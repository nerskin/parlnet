Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (09:31):  I continue from where I finished late last year on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. The marine bioregional zones targeted in this bill and the subsequent declaration of the marine pro­tected areas within them which will follow are provided for under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The declaration of marine bioregional plans is deemed by the act not to be a legislative instrument, and thus they are shielded from parliamentary scrutiny. This bill seeks to make the bioregional plans disallowable instruments. This bill seeks to remove that absolute power from the minister. It gives parliament the opportunity to have a say when occasions dictate it to be necessary. This bill provides for far greater parliamentary sovereignty and allows both houses the right to say whether any new marine park declaration should happen, on its individual merits. The current lack of review available to the final declaration of bioregional plans is a clear example of the vesting of power within narrow confines. It rests solely with the minister and therefore provides the opportunity for an abuse of power.


Parliamentary scrutiny is something that is sorely needed in this parliament after last year's gags on gags that we saw through the carbon tax debate and truncated debates generally. It was a year where legislation—like that which referred to the carbon tax and that which we are now seeing for the minerals resource rent tax—which people do not want and which the government do not have a mandate for was forced through parliament. Yet again it is the coalition who are trying to restore proper process and scrutiny to the parliament.


This bill is not about whether the govern­ment's declaration on marine protected areas goes ahead but whether parliament has the right to have its say and do the job we are elected to do, which is represent the millions of Australians who voted us here. It is a job which the coalition takes seriously. Unlike Labor, we will actually listen to the millions of Australians we represent. Overwhelm­ingly, support for parliamentary review of the marine bioregional planning process was evident in submissions to the Senate Environment and Communications Legisla­tion Committee inquiry. I would like to quote from the Abalone Industry Association of South Australia:


It is a real slap in the face to the good work done by our Government Fisheries Managers and Industry. We are very uncomfortable with the fact that the final decision of adopting the bioregional plans rests with the Minister for Environment only. We would prefer to have a far more rigorous and robust process through the parliament that doesn’t have the potential to be clouded by extreme green views.


The coalition is not an anti-marine-protected-areas party. We understand that we need them to protect and maintain biologically and culturally significant marine areas. The previous coalition government began the process of establishing marine protected areas around Australia's coastline. In 2006 the coalition announced the establishment of 11 marine protected areas along Australia's south-east coast. These 11 marine protected areas were created only after careful consideration and consultation with the recreational and commercial fishing sectors and other stakeholders.


Labor has continued the coalition's policy but it has failed to adopt a balanced approach to the marine protected areas. Labor has also failed to engage in appropriate consultation with the fishing industry and the wider community. The Labor government has continued to disregard and ignore the fishing industry, and its disastrous attempts to effectively engage with the fishing industry over marine parks have been embarrassing to say the least. Taking away further funding from the national peak body, Recfish, is proof that Labor would sooner tax and spend rather than govern in the interests of all Australians. All the fishermen in Queensland might like to bear that in mind when they go to the polls next month, on 24 March.


Many communities that rely on fishing are directly threatened by Labor's inability to consult on whether a region should be declared a marine protected area. Labor has failed to consult with both the commercial fishing industry and recreational fishers on major changes affecting them, a failure which threatens the jobs and livelihoods of many small businesses in coastal comm­unities. Doesn't this sound all too familiar—the Labor government yet again failing to consult stakeholders on the policies it is forcing on the Australian people? Just like the carbon tax, the mining tax and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which is in its second reincarnation, poor consultation is the hallmark of this government.


Why does the government not value the input of its key stakeholders? Having spent many hours on the road on the live cattle inquiry following the live cattle ban in June, I found many of those stakeholders wonder­ing why this government does not include them in the decision-making process affect­ing so many people's lives in Northern Australia. Why does it not discuss its proposed changes to this policy and legisla­tion with the people who will be directly affected—the fishermen, the recreational fishers and the commercial fishers of Australia? In these commercial and recrea­tional fishing sectors, those businesses and communities reliant on this whole-of-business approach to these regions up and down the coast of Australia have all raised serious and ongoing concerns about the consultation process implemented by Labor. Australians are raising their arms up, worried about the fact that they are not getting a say. Rather than seek genuine input on marine bioregional planning decisions, Labor has used the process for declaring marine protected areas to tell stakeholders what will happen. It has just used the process of declaring marine protected areas to tell them.


Unsurprisingly, recreational and commer­cial fishers, as well as the many related businesses and communities that rely on fishing, have raised substantial concerns about Labor's mishandling of marine protected areas. Appropriate and effective consultation is needed if marine protected areas are to balance environmental concerns with the need to promote jobs and to sustain communities that rely on commercial and recreational fishing. It is not a difficult task and it is not an unreasonable request: step outside of Canberra and talk with the recreational and commercial fishers and the myriad related businesses, small businesses and communities and ask them what they think. When they respond, however, you have to listen, something which this Gillard Labor government has failed to do time and time again. Labor does not listen. This is evidenced through its inability to listen to the Australian people on the carbon tax, to small miners on the mining tax and to Northern Australian cattle producers on the live cattle ban. Labor just does not understand the real world or the realities of running and maintaining a business.


The 2011-12 federal budget, delivered by the Labor-Greens alliance, resulted in no new initiatives for fisheries despite the industry being worth billions of dollars and providing a healthy and sustainable source of protein critical to meeting the future global food security challenges. This is yet another example of the Greens dictating policy to a desperate, ineffective Labor government looking to save itself. Labor does not even have enough courage to challenge the Greens and other radical environmental groups who want to lock up much of coastal Australia in marine parks. Many communities will face enormous economic and social losses unless there is proper and effective consultation on the potential marine protected areas. Only proper and effective consultation will ensure that the future of marine protected areas balances preservation of the environment with economic growth and strong coastal and, might I say, happy communities.


The coalition is committed to balance and fairness to marine conservation and this bill ensures that there will always be the scrutiny that Australians expect from proper and effective democracies. The work that Senator Boswell and Senator Colbeck are doing here in promoting this bill is testimony to their experience and the work they did in the previous Howard government to ensure that equity is maintained. The coalition supports proper community and industry consultation regarding any proposed marine protected areas. Imagine if the government had gone to the last election spruiking this consultation lock out. Imagine if the Bligh government in Queensland used locking up these areas as an election promise.


Labor has failed to tackle illegal foreign fishing in Australia's fishing zones, slashing funding for Southern Ocean patrols. Is it because it cannot carry out the patrols of the Southern Ocean to prevent fish poaching in Australian waters because all the maritime and aerial resources are being used to find boats penetrating our northern waters as a result of Labor's failed asylum seeker policy? Labor has also failed to meet its own time frames for declaring marine protected areas. Time frames have been altered due to Labor's inability to adequately consult within unrealistic schedules that were politically, rather than practically, motivated. Once again, the Green tail is wagging the Labor dog.


Labor has also failed to rule out large no-take zones within the marine protected areas currently being established across Australia. The fear of no-take zones has caused great uncertainty for businesses directly and indirectly reliant on access to fishing resources. As it did with the cattlemen of Northern Australia, this Labor government is undermining the essential ingredient in business security. Businesses must always have security. It is the very foundation in which they raise capital and it is the very foundation in which their banks expect them to be able to repay that capital which is borrowed. Labor has also caused great uncertainty amongst stakeholders who will be adversely impacted by potential loss of access to resources within declared marine parks. The bankers to fishing businesses, as I earlier referred to, would be reviewing this bill and would likely say, 'Hooray! Some checks and balances are to be parachuted into this ongoing debate.' Everybody in this business sector will look at this legislation and say, 'Will we have security in our business?'


The lock-up mentality of Labor and the Greens completely ignores the fact that Australia's recreational and commercial fishers are dedicated to sustainability. As a farmer myself, I say that you know that your future is predicated on your environmental sustainability. Locking up marine areas without proper consultation or scientific assessment and throwing away the keys is neither responsible nor practical. Labor's biggest contribution to fisheries so far has been to bungle the marine bioregional plans process, leaving fishing communities waiting months to see even one of the draft maps for the four marine reserve networks proposed. The parallels between this and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan process mean that the two are eerily similar. Labor fails yet again to properly consult and include the community in its plans for them. We need a full socioeconomic impact assessment that identifies the true loss of value to the community as a result of the loss of access to marine parks by the commercial and amateur fishers of Australia. Any assessment should be publicly released prior to the release of a declaration of any parks. Further, a compre­hensive fishing gear risk assessment should be conducted for each of the proposed marine parks before the parks are declared. This fishing gear risk assessment should not unfairly target selective fishing activities, such as trawling, from any new reserves, given that there are sustainable trawl fisheries operating successfully in marine parks in Australia.


Labor have failed to consult, have failed to include adequate community and industry concerns, have failed to consider commercial and recreational fishers and have failed again to uphold proper parliamentary scrutiny. Yet again Labor is opposing a bill that would deliver greater scrutiny to this parliament. The hypocrisy is rank. On the one hand you have the Prime Minister saying, 'Let's draw back the curtains and let the sun shine in; let our parliament be more open than it has ever been before,' and on the other hand you have Labor voting against letting the sun shine down on the parliament so that there is adequate scrutiny of marine park areas in Australia. So let the sun shine in; let the disinfectant be thorough. I ask that everybody get behind this bill and support it in the interests of all Australians.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (09:48):  It is with pleasure that I rise to support Senator Colbeck's bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. In following my colleague Senator Edwards, I note that, as with many areas of our coast, there stands to be partic­ular impact on our home state of South Australia, and more particularly the waters off it and therefore the livelihoods of the communities in our home state of South Australia.


The coalition, as others have outlined, has a proud history of protecting our marine environment—in particular the marine areas which so many of our communities rely upon for their livelihood. The coalition continues to support a balanced approach to biomarine conservation. It was the former Howard government, as others have noted, that established 11 marine protected areas in what is known as the south-east zone. But we consider that on that occasion not only adequate but very good and extensive consultation was undertaken with recreation­al and community groups, environmental groups and commercial fishing organisations and that we struck a balance between protecting marine biodiversity and minimis­ing the impact on fishers, local communities and local economies. That stands in stark contrast to the complete lack of balance and lack of transparency being demonstrated by the Gillard government in their flawed attempts to establish bioregional plans, or what can commonly be called marine parks.


This bill is not about stopping the declaration of bioregional plans or stopping the creation of marine parks, but it is about giving the two houses of this parliament the final say over the process. It still allows for the minister of the day—in this case a Labor government minister—to propose, area by area, marine park by marine park. It still allows that minister to seek the advice of his department and to consult with stakeholders impacted by establishing a marine park. But it also makes a declaration of a bioregional plan a disallowable instrument, which means that, bioregional plan by bioregional plan, it is open to this parliament to seek to disallow the proposed plan if members of this place consider, having heard from our local communities, that a particular declaration has knobs on it.


I travelled to Kangaroo Island in my home state last year and met with local fishermen and local government members, and they raised concerns about both federal and state plans for bioregions and the consultation—or rather, as they saw it, lack of it—that had been undertaken. They talked about a lack of scientific basis, particularly for decisions being made around areas to be declared under state arrangements. The creation of a marine park necessarily relies, or should rely, on a whole lot of evidence. In this parti­cular case, the local communities on Kanga­roo Island were questioning, and properly so, the scientific basis upon which certain declarations were proposed to be made. Their livelihoods are under threat, as are the livelihoods of many affected by the proposed bioregional plans across the country.


A lack of consultation about marine sanctuaries can cause a groundswell or a backlash against those seen to be proposing them. For example, there was a community meeting in my home state of South Australia last year, in Burnside in Adelaide, which attracted about 1,000 people to the local town hall to protest about what they saw as the lack of consultation and their lack of say about the development of marine sanctuaries in South Australia. The build-up of pressure leading up to and following that meeting was so great that, last November, the newly installed South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill, saw fit to announce a postpone­ment, an announcement for which I would not criticise him, of the release of draft plans, conceding that many groups felt they had not been consulted. So even a Labor Premier in my home state is able to recognise the lack of consultation on issues such as these—a lack that is addressed by this bill—and the way in which bioregional plans can strike at the heart of people's livelihoods. They need to be able to have their say about the impact these measures will have on them, and in many instances thus far they have not.


The first area to have a draft plan released was the south-west bioregion, extending from the eastern tip of Kangaroo Island in South Australia to Shark Bay on the Western Australian coast. That is 1.3 million square kilometres in total, and that sounds a lot, but the total area proposed to be put under the ambit of bioregional plans is, as Senator Colbeck has said, just over seven square kilometres—sorry, just over seven million square kilometres—of Commonwealth waters. I was about to say that is a truckload of water; I am glad I corrected my figures! That is a lot of water and we are talking about a lot of potential restrictions over that water for areas that are declared to be under a bioregional plan and a marine park. We are talking about areas that can have later designated within them areas of sanctuary zones, recreation-only zones or so-called special purpose zones. That means there can be areas that are closed to everything but a few activities. There can be areas where commercial and recreational fishing will be excluded and areas where particular types of equipment and fishing practices will be restricted. So this is a big deal and Labor is fluffing it—what a surprise!


A majority of the submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill raised concerns about the lack of consultation with the government's progression of its planned marine protected areas. For example, in his submission, made on behalf of the South Australian Marine Parks Management Alliance, Mr Gary Morgan stated:


It is a reflection of the level of concern among the industry that, in my 30+ years experience in both Government and fishing industry roles (including as Director of Fisheries in South Australia, 1997‐2000), I have never known an issue to create such anxiety and uncertainty in the industry and this is the only time I can ever remember that ALL sectors of the industry have come together to address what they see as a major threat to their livelihoods.


People in our communities say this is a big deal. Mr Morgan's submission also noted:


In SA, there has been a focus on ‘percentages’ of sanctuary areas, rather than such a orderly, science‐based approach, there has been no rigorous threat identification or assessment (particularly from fishing activities) and the process is clearly not science‐based


The Abalone Industry Association of South Australia said in its submission:


Our industry is very concerned about the political lobbying being undertaken by Green Groups at the moment blurring the line of using sanctuary zones (no take) as a fisheries management tool and using examples to support their cause from countries where there is no fisheries management.


We consider the abalone industry in South Australia to be a very well managed industry. It contributes over $300 million to our local economy and sustains more than 300 jobs in the local community. The issues at stake around bioregional plans are a big deal and they strike at the heart of the livelihood of the communities who rely on the subject waters for their commercial and recreational activities. Those communities deserve to be consulted. The Labor govern­ment has failed to do so adequately and so this bill, appropriately—and unfortunately—seeks to pull the Gillard Labor government up. It does not pull the government up short but simply pulls them up and requires their proposed bioregional plans to be subject to a mechanism that allows parliament to say, 'Not on this occasion; not in this area,' but also allows parliament to say, 'Having considered this particular proposal, we think it is the right thing to do.' I hope that this place sees fit to support Senator Colbeck's bill.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (09:59):  Happy new year to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and all of my fellow senators. I am very pleased to start the new parliamentary year by speaking about the importance of looking after our precious marine environ­ment. As a very proud Queenslander, I will focus on the amazing region in our north-east, the Coral Sea, which is currently awaiting protection. I will also talk about the great benefits that decent protection has brought to the Great Barrier Reef.


The Coral Sea is absolutely unique. It has 18 coral reef systems and a chain of undersea volcanoes which stretch 1,300 kilometres, with canyons of up to five kilometres deep. It is recognised as a global biodiversity hot spot. It has ocean giants such as sharks, tuna, marlin, swordfish and sailfish in massive abundance. It has 28 different species of dolphins and whales. It has six of the world's seven species of marine turtle. It has soft corals and large sea fans and spectacular sponge gardens. It is home to many species of coral, fish and invertebrates which are not found anywhere else on this planet. Clearly, it is a national heritage treasure. But it is not only that; it is also of significant historical importance to Australia. It was, of course, the scene of the 1942 Battle of the Coral Sea. I took the opportunity to mention this fact to President Obama on his visit, and he said that he would love to come and have a look at the Coral Sea. I certainly hope he does so. The 70th anniversary of the battle will be in May this year, and what an opportunity it will be to protect this underwater paradise. It is perfect timing.


The Coral Sea was declared a conserva­tion zone a few years ago when the govern­ment went through its marine bioregional planning processes, and the draft bioregional plan for the Coral Sea was released in November last year. The Greens welcomed the proposed ban on oil and gas mining and seabed trawling and gillnet fishing through­out the Coral Sea, but it is proposed to protect only half of the Coral Sea. This is a huge missed opportunity to create the world's largest marine national park. The proposed plan for a multi-use marine reserve simply does not go far enough and is piecemeal. Only two reefs of the specific 25 reefs in the Coral Sea will receive full protection, and that just does not seem enough to me. Instead of treating the region like a Swiss cheese and having different use zones, it would be much easier for the government to manage and monitor an entirely protected region. Nearly 70 per cent of Queenslanders support turning the entire area into a fully protected marine national park, so I hope that the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Populat­ion and Communities, Mr Burke, in his consultations, has a good ear to the ground and listens to the community. Public consult­ation is still open—it closes in two weeks, on Friday, 24 February—and I call upon anyone who in their spare time is listening or reading the Hansardand anyone who loves our oceans and this precious region to please make your voice heard. Write to federal environment minister Burke and ask him to act on this amazing opportunity to protect this vast pristine ocean area by making it the world's largest marine national park.


Making this area the world's largest marine national park is not just about protecting our environment; it is also critical for the long-term sustainability of our fisheries. There is no better example of the protection of our fisheries than the fantastic outcomes we have seen in the green zones in the Great Barrier Reef. Quite a bit of research has been done on the effectiveness of the green zones, and most recently some research by the US National Academy of Sciences in conjunction with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, AIMS, as well as James Cook University has found that the green zones—surprise, surprise!—really do work. According to this research:


… the network of marine reserves on the GBR has brought major, sustained ecological benefits, including enhanced populations of target fish, sharks, and even corals, the foundation of the coral reef ecosystem.


So this body of research has found that there have been rapid increases of fish inside the no-take reserves in both reef and non-reef habitats. This is very important for both our fishers and our tourism operators. The protected fish inside those no-take areas are bigger, so they will contribute many more larvae to the whole ecosystem. Therefore, the benefits of these no-take areas are expected to extend outside the no-take boundaries and to replenish the surrounding areas, which are open to fishing. It is a simple thing: protecting the fish breeding grounds gives you more and bigger fish. The green zones are also benefiting the overall health and resilience of the ecosystem. For example, the researchers found that there are less frequent outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on no-take reefs. Much to my horror, a recent briefing from AIMS says that crown-of-thorns starfish are still a massive issue in the GBR and that we are losing the battle. This is just one way that we can try to tackle that continuing problem. In short, we know that no-take areas can play a crucial role as recharge zones for sea-life popula­tions, thereby ensuring the long-term sustain­ability of our environment and recreational and commercial fishing as well as the local tourism industry.


I take issue with something that Senator Edwards raised on behalf of the opposition. He was waxing lyrical about the Liberals being on the side of the fishers. Frankly, I thought that was a bit rich. I moved a motion late last year calling for the suspension of dredging in Gladstone harbour and, in fact, up and down the reef, where we have seen massive impacts on local fish populations. We have seen fish with red spot disease, which has now spread to sharks and crabs. We are seeing absolute devastation in Gladstone harbour. It is so serious that the fishing industry was shut down for about three weeks last year. It has now been re-opened, but the local fishermen are still saying that they do not want to catch the fish there. The fish are still sick, and the bottom has dropped out of the local industry there. No-one will buy the fish because, of course, they are not prepared to sell diseased fish.


Where are the Nationals and the Liberals on this issue? I hear that Senator Boswell is agitating for better compensation for those local fishers, and that is fantastic. We certainly support that—we think it is ridicu­lous that one industry, the coal seam gas industry, has been allowed to dredge the harbour beyond recognition and the fisher­men have been left to suffer. We are all for proper compensation for the fishers, but that is not the whole story. Is Senator Boswell going to allow the dredging to continue? What about the next fishing community when five other ports are opened up for coal and coal seam gas export? I am afraid it is a bit rich for the Liberals and the Nats to claim that they are somehow the great champions of the fishing industry, when they have been prepared to abandon Gladstone harbour and do nothing to stop this massive dredging program for coal and coal seam gas export.


The Greens do not support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. We fully support marine protected areas. They are good for fishing, they are good for tourism, they are good for our economy and they are good for the future of our grandkids.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (10:07):  I think we need to be a little clearer on what the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011 is all about. It is not about opposing marine parks in any shape or form. It is about giving this parliament the right to oversight, to debate and to discuss where marine reserves are to happen, because, as Senator Waters has just pointed out, it is quite possible for interested groups or self-interested groups to skew the discussions and deliberations of the minister at any time during this debate. A pious motion from the Senate around dredging in Gladstone Harbour is not a useful thing. I was trying to think of how useless it was, but I cannot quite think of a polite comparison and so I shan't. It would not be useful in assisting either the environmental concerns in Gladstone Harbour or the fishing industry in Gladstone, which certainly have some serious problems. A motion from the Senate does nothing. It is the Queensland state government that needs to get its act together and do something there.


A minister for the environment who alone can make the decision about where marine parks go is not good for democracy or for Australia. We have already seen that there are conservation groups, fringe environ­mental groups—we could even include the fishing industry and other stakeholders—who, if they can get the ear of the minister or are in the right electorate at the right time, may skew the way the development of marine conservation proceeds in Australia. In fact, the Gillard and Rudd governments have in some ways simply continued the coalition's program, which was designed to protect and conserve our extraordinary marine resources in a balanced way. They have failed, of course, to continue the implementation correctly. Why should we be surprised by that? It happens in almost every area that the Rudd and Gillard governments touch. They have failed completely to continue appropriate consultation with the fishing industry or with the wider commu­nity. They have not adopted a balanced approach and they give preference to the views of NGOs and others at the expense of not just the fishing industry but also local tourism industries and other groups.


We can draw an adequate comparison between the fishing industry and fishermen and the agribusiness industry and farmers. These people are not there to destroy their livelihoods; they are great conservationists; they are great preservers; they want sustainable industries. They are not about destroying wherever they go. Consulting them and listening to the broad range of evidence that is available on marine regions are far more important than having the minister simply do what he likes when he likes. The idea of this bill we are putting forward today is not about destroying marine areas or destroying biodiversity; it is about having a sensible, balanced approach that reinstates parliamentary scrutiny to an area of just over seven million square kilometres of Commonwealth waters. What we seek to do here is to make the declaration of marine bioregional plans disallowable instruments, not a legislative instrument that is complete­ly shielded from parliamentary scrutiny with the stroke of a pen. The minister can have a massive impact on Australia's territorial waters and all the people who make a living from them or the resources in those areas. 


Senator Waters liked telling us how the fish improved in no-take areas. Yes, the coalition supports that idea. We completely support the idea that with a balanced approa­ch you will have no-take areas, you will have recreational areas and you will have areas for the fishing industry within marine parks. We have no problem whatsoever with this approach to balancing conservation with the marine industry, but we cannot achieve that if the only person making the decision is the minister and he or she is doing that without any oversight by this parliament. All we are seeking to do is to take the absolute power away from the minister to give parliament the opportunity to have a say about what should be included in a marine bioregional plan and what should not. It gives parliament far greater sovereignty and it gives both Houses the chance to have a say on the individual merits of each marine bioregional plan. There is no problem in my view with that being done and I have no idea why anyone would want to oppose that being done. In fact, I would have thought that it would be something that would be supported in this House particularly by the Greens and the Independents, because, given the record of this government on consultation, there is every reason to think that we will get ad hoc decisions designed to assist whatever group the government is trying to cosy up to at the time. The coalition has a very proud track record and a great commitment in the area of marine protected areas. It was the Howard government in 1998 that secured agreement with the state governments to commit to establishing a national representative system of marine protected areas. It was the Howard government that made a further, international commitment to establish such a representa­tive network by 2012 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002. And again, in 2005-06, it was the Howard govern­ment that initiated the investigation and subsequent implementation of the south-east marine reserve network, the fifth of the five bioregions that are likely to be covered by these marine bioregional plans. We are not anti marine parks, but we think there is a right way and a wrong way to go about developing such reserves—and we already have evidence of the wrong way being done now.


Every interest group and every stakehold­er have claimed that there has not been adequate consultation. There have not been appropriate levels of consultation with local communities or with affected commercial industries or with the marine recreation industries. Even environmental groups have said to our shadow minister and to others that they feel left out by the federal govern­ment when it comes to genuine consultation. And, if your livelihood depends on whether the fishing industry is going to be there in three years or five years, if whether the bank will lend you the money to buy a new boat is reliant on what the minister's whim of the day is, you are in a very difficult position. There has been incredible anxiety and uncertainty created in the fishing industry by this government's approach to developing marine bioregional plans.


Coastal communities are certainly aware that if they do not get a say in this, if there is not a way to ensure that their views can be aired and discussed and debated in this place, then on the basis of the track record of this government it will only be the fringe green groups that will actually get heard, not the people who use and manage and conserve our fisheries on a daily basis.


Industry is really nervous, and that is not just the commercial fishing industry, althou­gh I would point out that it is Australia's sixth-largest primary producer. Recreational fishing might be something that some of us do—very unsuccessfully in my case—just once or twice a year, but for thousands of Australians it is actually a job, and off those jobs hang many other jobs. There are resources that you need to get together a fishing boat, and many businesses are involved, not only with the boat itself but with the gear, the technology, the electronics that are used on the boat. Those are all industries that need a commercial fishing industry to survive. So we have to talk about not only the recreational fishing industry as a multibillion-dollar industry but also the very large commercial fishing sector that, as I said, is the sixth-largest primary producing sector in Australia.


Not only is it the lack of consultation that makes people nervous; not only is it the track record of this government that makes people in the industry nervous; but it is the fact that the government cannot even meet its own time frames for declaring marine parks that makes people nervous. So once again we have an implementation issue, which I suppose should not surprise us with this government, but it does nothing at all to assist businesses trying to function and to plan for the future in this area.


In the lead-up to the 2010 election, Labor promised to release draft maps for the south-western bioregion by mid-December. Then the minister said they would probably do them by late January or early February. We still have not seen those draft maps. It is no different to any other promise that Labor make during an election. It may not, in its consequences for the entire economy, be as serious as: 'We won't put a price on carbon. We won't introduce a carbon tax.' But for the people whose livelihoods depend on it, the fact that this government cannot meet its election promises in this area is just as bad, and the consequences are just as dire, as that broken carbon tax promise.


Labor also promised to release a displaced effort policy in the lead-up to releasing the first draft maps, but that did not arrive in the time frame promised either. So we have a group who are intimately involved with our fishing stocks and our marine parks who are saying, 'What is going on here?' And, if it is only the minister, through a legislative instrument, who can decide where a marine bioregional plan is established, these groups have no avenue for airing their concerns in a democratic way. They are forced to protest; probably some of them will be forced out of business. It is all very well for this govern­ment to say, 'We'll just sort out what we are doing when we get around to it.' But it has to keep in mind that a fishing boat, for example, is an investment that you would keep for 20 years or more. You are not going to go and buy one when this minister could decide, based on the whim of whichever stakeholder group the Labor government next wants to please, to undertake work that could simply ruin your industry. I know that the fringe environmental groups like to claim that our fisheries are in disarray, but that is completely wrong. They are among the best managed and healthiest in terms of stock numbers of any country in the world. You have to take into consideration that amongst them is the same group that wants the whole Coral Sea locked up. Those groups peddle mistruths and misinformation in the name of so-called conservation. But it is the practiti­oners, the people whose lives and livelihoods depend on healthy fish stocks and a healthy marine environment, who are the real custodians and the people who should be listened to by this government—not just the commercial fishermen but the tourism industry, the hospitality industry and the many other ancillary industries I mentioned that hang off commercial and recreational fishing.


There are a huge number of people who, at the stroke of the minister's pen, can lose their livelihoods and be disenfranchised. Why would there be any opposition to this parliament being the place where these matters are decided? Parliamentarians can air the views of the many stakeholder groups, and the claims of various groups can be properly assessed by parliamentary committ­ees. That would mean a sensible, balanced decision could be made based on what is best for the environment and what is best for industry, rather than the minister simply deciding what suits him best.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-02-09,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (10:24):  I rise to support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011 and to express some real concerns about the current system. How could you leave seven million square kilometres in the hands of one minister, whether that minister be a man or a woman?




Senator Farrell:
  He's a very good minister.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take that interjection. Let us look back at the decisions of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Perhaps we will go to the live-cattle-export issue. We saw the Four Corners story and we supported the abolition of Australian exports of live cattle to those abattoirs which were clearly doing the wrong thing. Then the minister put a total ban on the export of live cattle. What a financial mess this has been for the graziers in the Top End of our nation. This is a clear example of one minister with too much power doing something very wrong. Once the cattle got over 350 kilograms live weight, they were not suitable to send to Indonesia. So, as the delays went on, what could the people do with their cattle?


I live at Inverell, a lovely town in northern New South Wales, where we are fortunate to have an abattoir. Those Top End graziers were forced to send cattle from the top of Western Australia thousands of kilometres by road to Inverell. That is a classic example of a minister making a very bad decision. What Minister Ludwig should have done was to get a copy of that film, hop straight on a plane to Jakarta, meet with the Indonesian agriculture minister and say: 'Look at this. We have a problem. We do not accept animals being treated like this.' I agree with that proposal totally, as someone who has done my own butchering on the farm for many years. Whether it be beef cattle, sheep or pigs, I am no stranger to a butcher's knife. I would never, ever condone animals being treated like that.


To come back to our argument about ministerial power: it is seven million square kilometres. Like it or not, the Greens carry a lot of weight in this Gillard-led Labor government. We know we have to preserve our fish stocks. We know we cannot just go out and net the fish stocks. It is all about sustainability for the future. We know that in 1998 the Howard government led in the right direction on this very important issue, the conservation and retention of fish stocks in our marine areas. But there were consulta­tions. The government worked with the industries and the people, whether they were local fishermen who just wanted to go and wet a line on the weekend or professional fishermen. To leave this in the hands of a minister and take it away from the parlia­ment is wrong, by all democratic beliefs. How could you trust a minister? I could give you other examples. I have talked about the cattle industry and what a shambles it was.




Senator Farrell:
  He's a very trustworthy minister.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Trustworthy or not, the decision that Minister Ludwig made on the export of live cattle to Indonesia was a disgrace.




Senator McEwen:
  I think we're talking about bioregional plans.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I am giving an example of ministerial powers and how the Labor government made a terrible decision. It was a financial disaster for industries throughout Northern Australia. You want us to sit back and say: 'Leave it to the environ­ment minister. That minister will make the determination of where the marine parks are, what will happen, what will be closed down, who will be compensated.' We know about compensation. My colleague Senator Boyce mentioned professional fishermen investing in a boat. If they are shut out of the industry, who compensates them for the purchase of the boat? Will that happen, or will the minister say: 'No. Enough is enough; we're wiping it out'? 


Life is about fairness and, if the govern­ment take away your livelihood, they should compensate you. But in the current situation, when a minister takes away the livelihood of fishermen, are they compen­sated? These questions need to be answered. If it were left to the parliament to make this decision, these debates could be had and the questions could be put. Hopefully we would get some answers. But the current plan is totally unacceptable. Our bill is aimed at taking the power from the minister and giving it back to where it belongs, the parliament. I commend Senator Colbeck for his work on this issue and others who are passionate about this issue, such as my colleague Senator Boswell. Our bill repre­sents what Australian people would expect—that both houses of parliament make the decision on any new marine park declara­tions. That is the clear point here. The House of Representatives commences the legisla­tion process on most occasions but not always. When it comes to the Senate we have the opportunity to amend, to debate or even to vote down or reject legislation. 


I could talk about many ministerial decisions being made in this current govern­ment. It comes back to simply a lack of trust. That is the problem we have with this government, and the Australian people have the same problem. They do not trust the government. They do not trust the govern­ment on its commitment to introducing carbon taxes, on its commitment to keeping food, grocery prices, fuel prices and the cost of living low and on all the promises we got from the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, prior to the 2007 election; hence, Senator Colbeck's bill is a most important piece of legislation to return the power to the parliament and not leave it in the hands of just one minister. Why should we trust this government to get anything right? Just think back to Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. I mention live exports of cattle, home insulation or the Building the Education Revolution, the mounting national debt of the government, asylum seekers and our border protection, yet you expect us to trust an environment minister where the Greens would really use their power to influence that minister.


One of my pet hates is the locking up of land and simply leaving it. The National Parks Association have been pushing this year after year. We saw the shutting-up of the red gum forests down near Deniliquin in the middle of a state forest and in Victoria. It is amazing when you go down there, as I did some two years ago to look through that red gum forest where 900 hectares were burnt. That multiplied by 2½ is 2,400 acres. Red gum will not take fire at all. You see the Pilliga and the regeneration of ironbark and box trees and various other types of trees. What happened there was that that country was locked up. It comes back to management of the environment. That country used to be grazed to keep the fuel levels down. Now that it has been locked up, you cannot graze there.


The influence of the Greens is clear when it comes to the new Victorian state govern­ment, which will not allow grazing in the alpine regions to reduce the amount of fuel on the ground. I get back to the argument of ministerial decisions. Once you have more than five tonnes per hectare of fuel on the ground—grasses, twigs, six millimetres of dome or less, 30- or 40-kilometre wind, a 40-degree day—a fire is basically impossible to control. It comes back to environmental management. People just think of preserva­tion—lock it up and leave it—and then we destroy it through fire.


We get back to the argument here of ministerial decision. It was Minister Burke who overruled the decision of the Victorian government. I think that is wrong, because under the Constitution the management of land is clearly in the hands of the Crown or the states, but Minister Burke made that decision. He did not have a debate in this parliament. There was no decision about that at all. When fire destroys those areas again, hopefully we will not see the loss of life like we did in the Black Saturday bushfires a couple of years ago. It will happen again. Fires will occur again. We have had the wet seasons now and the grass is growing. We all know that it will dry out. It will get hot again, even though this summer has been so extremely cool. We have seen a minister's power to threaten the environment with Minister Burke in the alpine regions. They say you are not allowed to have hard-hooved animals in those areas. It is all right to have thousands of deer, thousands of brumbies, hundreds of thousands of wild goats and tens of thousands of wild pigs—they are all hard-hooved animals—but you cannot run cattle up there because they might eat the grass down; you have to just let it burn.


I make the point that this is a minister's decision and, to me, it is too powerful. There is too much responsibility in the hands of one person; likewise with the marine parks. Senator Colbeck's private member's bill should be supported because it gives the power back to the parliament, back to the elected people, to make a decision. The fear, of course, is the current make-up of the parliament in both houses of this country where you have the Independents and the Greens flexing their muscles—the tail wagging the dog of the Labor Party—whether it be on carbon taxes or other broken promises on deliveries that we are now seeing.


This is the worst time to have this power in the hands of one person. If you had a clear government, then you would not have to kowtow to minority groups who are pressur­ed by those out there who simply believe locking up everything is the way ahead. What are we going to do when we lock up all our marine parks? Are we just going to import our prawns from Thailand? We talk about food security for the future. We are the first to say there must be manage­ment and you cannot basically rape the oceans of fish and expect them to survive. That cannot happen.


In my lifetime I have seen reductions in fish in many areas. When I was a kid hanging a line over the jetty at Port Lincoln in about 1967 a huge amount of tommy rough would grab hold of your line. You probably would not see that today. For sure we have reduced fish numbers in areas around the world, but it is about balanced management. It is about the needs of mankind and looking after the environment and conserving the stocks we have. No doubt Senator Conroy would agree with me on this issue, as he does on most issues. 


I support this proposal by Senator Colbeck because it returns the power to the parlia­ment, to those who are elected to these places to represent the people in their electorates and not to give this enormous power to a minister who will probably get a backroom bribe from a minority group to do as they want or there will be trouble. We have already seen that with the carbon tax. We have seen Mr Windsor's demands in his agreement with Prime Minister Gillard. One of his demands was, 'You will form a multiparty climate change committee or else.' That was Mr Windsor's drive. He probably drove it more than the Greens. That is the problem we have. I urge support for Senator Colbeck's proposal.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-02-09,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:37):  I rise to speak in support of Senator Colbeck's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. The bill reinstates parliamentary scrutiny of just over seven million square kilometres of Common­wealth waters. The bill seeks to make bioregional plans a disallowable instrument. The waters adjacent to Victoria, my home state, are included in the south-east marine region, which extends from waters offshore of southern New South Wales to eastern South Australia. It also includes waters adjacent to Senator Colbeck's home state of Tasmania and Macquarie Island.


The coalition has a strong track record of supporting marine conservation. The coali­tion supports a balanced approach. Through­out the history of the development of marine protected areas the coalition has been at the forefront of developing workable plans at a local and national level. It was a coalition government in 1998 that secured agreement with the state governments to commit to establishing a national representa­tive system of marine protected areas. It was a coalition government that made a further international commitment to establish such a representa­tive network by 2012 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. And it was a coalition government that in 2005 and 2006 initiated the investigation and subsequ­ent implementation of the south-east marine reserves network, the fifth of the five bioreg­ions I mentioned in my introduct­ory remarks. 


I make these points to highlight that the coalition is far from being anti-marine park. We believe there is a right way and a wrong way to go about the development and maint­enance of such reserves. It is a balanced approach. We obviously need to consider industry. The south-east trawlers association, in my home state, has made numerous representations about the size of the marine park we have down in Victoria, which is the size of our entire state. Those in the industry in Victoria are the last people that want to see a reduction in fish stocks.


Similarly, a balanced approach needs to take into account recreational fishers—not only the impact of recreational fishing but our desire as a parliament and as leaders in our nation to promote healthy lifestyles and people getting out and about in the natural environment. A balanced approach also needs to take into consideration ecological systems and the environment itself, including fish stocks. Also, particularly from a regional perspective, we need to consider local economies, and a balanced approach to these sorts of discussions also needs to take into account the socioeconomic impacts on regional towns and communities.


I have seen the impact of overfishing through my travels in Canada in 2000. I spent a lot of time in Newfoundland, an area of Canada that is renowned for having destocked a complete species of fish. I saw the impact that has had on the local economy in terms of having to completely reconfigure how they live and work in that province and in that nation.


The coalition, and obviously the Nationals within the coalition, strongly support a balanced approach to marine parks and marine sustainability. The development of the south-east network reinforced to me that the successful implementation of a marine networks plan would not eventuate without genuine, detailed, open consultation with each and every stakeholder who felt they had a claim or a vested interest. That goes not only to the heart of the successful imple­mentation of these sorts of things but also to the notions of inclusion and involvement in the democratic processes of our nation.


The overwhelming measure of success for anything like this is that the consultation with stakeholders is actually enacted. There were 20 recommendations made on boundar­ies and zoning within the south-east network. The result is that, whilst the network is larger and more representative of the region than was the original proposal, it also has far less impact on the fishing industry. So it is really a win-win scenario for Victorians.


Unfortunately, current developments with regard to the remaining four marine biore­gional plans are not as positive. The core issue that other speakers have mentioned, and which I will go to in my comments, is that this bill goes to the fact that the minister has complete discretion and Labor ministers are not handling the great responsibilities before them in a manner that is giving stakeholders of any persuasion, at any end of the spectrum, confidence in the marine bioregional planning process or indeed any planning process currently before us.


The Rudd and Gillard Labor governments have not adopted a balanced approach to marine protected areas and they have not engaged in appropriate levels of consultation with local communities, with affected commercial industries or with marine recrea­tional interests. Environmental groups have said that they also have felt left out by the federal government when it comes to genuine consultation. This approach taken by Labor has created incredible anxiety and uncertainty in the fishing industry right around our nation. Coastal communities are wise to the fact that this Labor government's track record is that it will only hear from fringe green groups rather than the people who actually use, manage, live in and work in our fisheries on a daily basis. It is not just in this area, as I mentioned earlier. Just look at the track record of unilateral decisions by Labor ministers. My colleague Senator Williams spoke so knowingly about the decisions by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry around live cattle exports. The flip-flopping that went on there, with the TV program, the conversations with green groups, the conversations with other people and the ministerial decision-making process have led to a lot of uncertainty within that industry and within those communities. Similarly, there was the minister's approach to consultation on the Murray-Darling Basin, particularly in the first iteration. There is their ability to impact and their being beholden to, if you like, a certain end of the spectrum and how that is playing out in local communities in relation to uncertainty.


Again, on a particular issue concerning the granddaughter of a high country cattleman, there was a decision by Minister Burke to override the state government and ban grazing of cattle in the high country. Particularly when you look at the number of sambar deer and brumbies that are up there, and the number of cattle that are going in, it just does not make sense. So we are seeing ministers not making decisions on a scienti­fic basis or not taking all the information and all the impacts of their decisions into account. That is something that the coalition is concerned about, and I think it is something that all those who are interested in the good governance of our great nation need to be concerned about.


We now have to take the minister at face value when he says that he has all the information required, and there is no ability for the parliament to scrutinise the decision or for both ends of the spectrum to examine the minister's decisions and feed into that. I think it cuts both ways, and this is where I am really surprised at the Greens' perspective on this particular bill before us. What happens when we do not have a minister who is beholden to environmental interests, who is not captured by the Greens but rather by the other extreme? Surely we need a balanced approach, and that is what is this bill attempts to deliver: a mechanism to protect the environment from extremism.


The commercial fishing industry is Australia's sixth largest primary producer. In my home state about 721,000 Victorians enjoy recreational fishing. I am not one of them. I have never had much success with dropping in a line, despite living not far from beautiful Inverloch, but I know plenty of people who are mad keen fishermen. There are about 850 commercial fishery access licences in Victoria, and these operations land about $120 million worth of fresh seafood at Victorian ports each year. As Senator Williams said, we want to be able to manage these fisheries appropriately so that Australians can have access to high-quality food that is managed in a sustainable and appropriate way. Obviously this is what bioregional plans seek to do. What we do not want is unilateral decision making by ministers that are captured by those at either end of spectrums and philosophies.


When is the Gillard Labor government going to get it into its head that a nation that cannot feed itself is at the mercy of others whose interest in us may not be as benign as getting a good price for its exports and whose quality controls on their food production may be not be of a standard that Australians expect? I thank Senator Waters for the comments she made during her contribution about the Greens being very keen for and supportive of compensation measures for the industry regarding any adverse impacts—particularly as it is obviously a philosophy of the Greens to have some conversation about compensation measures for communities right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin for whom there will be a socioeconomic impact because of the 7,600 gigs they want to take out that system and the flow-on effects of that policy. I really look forward to sitting down with Senator Waters and discussing what sorts of compensation measures the Greens would be interested in supporting, given that the 7,600 gigs they want to take out of those commu­nities will absolutely devastate regional communities right throughout the basin and the economic basis on which they have been built. I will put a call in, I guess.


The coalition believes there is a need for conservation of our important marine biology, but future decisions on marine protected areas should consider peer-reviewed scientific evidence on threats to biodiversity before great swathes of ocean are locked up for all eternity. This bill is the opportunity for parliament to add a vital democratic check to the process, a process that has the potential to adversely affect the livelihood and future of millions of Austra­lians. So I support this bill. The declaration of bioregional plans in marine protected areas has significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences right through­out these communities that reside along our coast and indeed for our markets, our fishmongers and our small businesses in our capital cities and right throughout our nation. They should be given a chance to have their say in both houses of parliament on any decisions that will adversely affect them. It is therefore inappropriate for these declarations to be made without the opportunity for review. As a conservative, I abhor concen­trated power—hence, I am a senator—and I look forward to supporting this bill and I thank Senator Colbeck for bringing it before the Senate.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (10:51):  I am very pleased to rise and supp­ort my colleague Senator Colbeck and others who have spoken in relation to this matter, including Senator Boswell, in whom there is some considerable passion. Today I want to put on the record some of the background to the coalition's approach to this. I know that Senator Colbeck and others have already said it but I want to repeat that we support a balanced approach to marine conservation. It was our policy in the 2010 election, and we stand by that. But what is at the nub of this bill, which is being driven by Senator Colbeck, is the lack of consultation with those who have a legitimate interest in current marine parks or in the declaration of further marine parks. I am sure that many honourable members will remember the debacle of the mako shark issue, where fishers throughout the country rose up against a decision to ban the fishing of mako sharks. There was no consultation. At Torquay in the seat of Corangamite there were some 700 people at a public meeting complaining about mako shark fishing being banned. Of course, the local member was nowhere to be seen, but that is not unusual when it comes to the member for Coranga­mite; he would never dare to be seen when there are issues.


At the heart of this conservation debate is a lack of acknowledgement that the real conservationists in this country are the fishers, shooters and others. Anyone who knows anything about these areas and who speaks to and has grown up with the fishers and the shooters knows they are the true conservationists. These are the people whose sporting and recreational avenues are determined by the amount of fish and other species that are available to be taken. They actually own the conservation of this and have done for decades. Look at organisations such as Field and Game. Look at other fishing organisations. They are about conservation. For quite obvious reasons they want to preserve the species that they are shooting and hunting—if they are not there then their sport goes. They are the true conservationists in this country. They are never given appropriate credit for it, and they should be.


What these people want is consultation. The past process with marine parks has been completely bastardised by this lack of appropriate consultation. These people know when they enter these discussions that the decisions have virtually been made. They know that when they enter these discussions their voice will be heard but almost certainly will not be acted upon; and, on occasions, they cannot even get it heard. This bill is about enabling this parliament, when there has been that lack of consultation, to take on behalf of those people the right to make a decision about whether there has been appropriate consultation and whether, indeed, we should move to address it if there has not been.


I will very quickly read from the bills digest:


This Bill seeks to amend the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) to require that declarations of new Bioregional Plans1 and Commonwealth Reserves2 be disallowable by either chamber of Parliament.


…   …   …


Currently, Bioregional Plans are not legislative instruments and are not subject to parliamentary disallowance. The effect of this amendment would mean that they would continue not to be legislative instruments. However, they would be disallowable under Part 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 as modified by section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Common­wealth Reserves are legislative instruments which are not currently disallowable.


If these people—this nation's true conserva­tionists—are not being appropriately consulted then they should be. That is why I fully support Senator Colbeck's bill and fully support the comments made by others, including Senator Boswell.


The interesting part of this whole debate on marine parks is that we get the most extraordinary comments from some of those on the other side. Senator Marshall, who has been in his office listening, is down here immediately to make some comments. I think he knows what I am going to talk about. There are, of course, some on the other side who believe that we will have increased marine national parks through global warming. They might not be declared at this stage, but the member for Coranga­mite thinks that global warming will inundate massive areas of his home electorate. This is part of his defence of the carbon tax. It beggars belief that this man is actually allowed to be a federal member of parliament. On 17 August 2011—




Senator Marshall:
  Tell us about your candidate!




Senator RONALDSON:
  When the preselection is settled, I would be happy to talk to you about it. I am sure you and I will talk about it ad nauseam at airport lounges when we discuss what is likely to happen to the man whom you are so passionately defending—which I can never really understand, I have to say. Anyway. I am sure it is a faction based thing, because you have absolutely nothing in common. I have some regard for your intellect, for starters! That is the one clear difference between the two of you. But anyway. As I say, if you want to talk about preselection candidates, I am happy to engage in that later on.


Interestingly, Mr Cheeseman gave a speech on 9 September 2009 in relation to rising sea levels but posted on his website in March 2010 the speech that he was not allowed to give. Presumably he would requ­est that the rising sea be made a marine park. He posted this speech on his website. It was not the speech that he actually gave. It said:


The Great Ocean Road Mr Speaker, an icon of Australia and the engine room of our local tourism economy, will be largely destroyed.


It will be breached in place after place, if sea level rise is as expected.


Huge swathes of the Bellarine Peninsula will be inundated.


Current areas of the mainland will be cut off and become islands.


Queenscliffe will become an island.


The area from Barwon Heads to Breamlea will become an island.


What drives this man? This is all in defence of Labor's toxic carbon tax. I want to talk about that carbon tax and, indeed, rising sea levels and the requirement, presumably from the Labor Party's point of view, for more marine parks to take in this massive inunda­tion of what is currently land. I presume that will form part of the discussions in relation to the act at some stage further down the track. What was very interesting indeed was to look at the view of the people of Geelong in a recent survey of some 800 people. In that survey the people of Geelong made it quite clear that they do not and will not accept Labor's toxic carbon tax.


This was the outcome of their voting intention in relation to the carbon tax. I should throw this in because it is probably of some interest to honourable senators as well. The question was: is the federal government doing a good job? What do my colleagues think? Would 10, 15 or 20 per cent be the 'strongly agree' figure? No, it was not; 1.6 per cent of people in Geelong strongly agree that the Labor government is doing a good job. Neither agree nor disagree: 29.5 per cent; disagree: 29.9 per cent; strongly disagree: 25.1 per cent of people in the Geelong region. In relation to the carbon tax, the question was: do you support or reject the general concept of a carbon tax? Support: 22.9 per cent; reject: 53.5 per cent of the 800 people surveyed.




Senator Birmingham:
  They deserve a say.




Senator RONALDSON:
  They deserve a say, as Senator Birmingham said, as do those who will be potentially impacted upon by marine parks. That is why this parliament, as a result of this bill, must maintain the ability to represent their interests.


The local member for Corangamite thinks that we are going to be inundated. I notice that last year he commissioned a report into sea levels. Again, it was doom and gloom. It is almost approaching religious fervour, I have to say. I presume he is out there build­ing the boat as we speak to at least get some people from Corangamite onto the boat when it all floods. I have not yet seen the report. Maybe it has been released. If it has been, I apologise to the member for Corangamite. But apparently he commission­ed a report and gave some interim findings in September last year, but I do not think the report has been released. If it has been, again I will humbly apologise to the honourable member.


I have been talking at length about the matter before the chamber today and I will continue to do so. We have an incredibly proud history in relation to legislative protection of the environment in this country. In fact, in any reasonable assessment of who drove strong environmental protection measures in this country, it has indeed been the coalition parties. We are as committed to that today as we were when we first started this process, and we are committed to returning balance and fairness to marine conservation. Like anything else in this country, if you do not approach an issue such as this on the basis of balance and fairness, then there will never be appropriate outcomes. When these issues are hijacked by fringe groups, often associated with the Australian Greens or under the banner of the Australian Greens—but they are fringe groups nonetheless—and they take owner­ship of these issues, then we get the sorts of outcomes that I know others opposite sitting in the chamber today know are not appro­priate outcomes. There is the great state of Tasmania, where Senator Colbeck and Labor senators come from, and I hope that they are also committed to fairness and balance in relation to these debates. On that basis, they should be supporting this bill.


One of our greatest responsibilities in this country is to make sure that those who have a voice are able to have that voice heard. One of the great challenges in this country is to ensure that, in relation to this particular area, it is not the radical green fringe groups who drive the debate but the honest Australian men and women who are pursu­ing their recreational interests. They need to have the opportunity for some input into this decision-making process. They should not be confronted with a fait accompli when they go through the consultation process. That is their complaint: they arrive and the decision has already been made; their view on these matters is not wanted and most certainly not listened to. What causes me enormous concern about this is that at the moment we have a government that is completely paralysed. The only consultation that is taking place is consultation between the factions about who is going to lead the country. So we have people involved in marine parks out there looking for the opportunity to have some input and appro­priate consultation, but the only consultation this government is involved in at the moment is, indeed, who is going to lead the party.


We know that one of those opposite is actively involved in those discussions—a very significant player; a man of incredible power in this country. But I say to him and others opposite: let us stop worrying about who is going to be the Prime Minister and let us start worrying about the sorts of issues that have been raised by Senator Colbeck in relation to the lack of consultation. We see what has happened recently with the loss of manufacturing jobs. We see the risk to Alcoa workers in places like Geelong and we see two members down there refuse to do anything to support them because they know, and I know, and everyone in this chamber knows, that this toxic carbon tax is going to kill manufacturing jobs in places like Geelong. Where are the absentee members in defence of those workers? What the Alcoa workers want and what every other manu­facturing worker in this country wants is for Mr Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard to stop worrying about their own jobs and start worrying about the manufacturing jobs. That is what the Australian people want, that is what the Australian people demand and that is what the Australian people deserve. Do not worry about the Prime Minister's job; worry about the jobs of average working Australians, many of whom fish, many of whom shoot and many of whom want to have their voices heard in relation to these marine parks.


That is the great challenge for those opposite. Their great challenge is to stop talking about those things in which the Australian public has no interest, like the job of the Prime Minister, and start worrying about the jobs of these manufacturing workers. Start acknowledging once and for all that this toxic carbon tax is going to destroy this country. It is already under enormous pressure from the high dollar. There are a lot of external factors, which I acknowledge have an influence in this, but the one thing, the one pivotal government decision which can turn around perceptions in head offices around the world, including the Alcoa head office, is to drop this carbon tax. If the Labor Party and the Prime Minister sent out a clear message that this carbon tax is going to go because it will destroy jobs then we will start to see investment again. We will start to see the Alcoas of this world say there is some hope for manufacturing in this country. At the moment they are not, and the boardrooms around the world are looking at what we are doing and they are saying: 'Have they completely and utterly lost their minds? Are they stark raving mad to introduce a tax ahead of the rest of the world which will destroy Australian jobs?'


Make no mistake about it: there is one party, one coalition in this country that is concerned about the jobs of blue-collar workers, and that is the coalition. We will fight to defend their jobs. We will fight to defend their right to pursue their recreational pursuits without unnecessary interference from government. We will defend their rights to fish and shoot. We will defend their rights to have consultation on marine parks. We will stand up for them, which I can tell you is a far cry from what is happening with the Australian Labor Party, this Prime Minister and Mr Rudd at the present time.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (11:10):  I too rise to support Senator Colbeck's bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. In so doing, I ask myself why those opposite are so against this legislation. Why are they opposed to greater scrutiny of marine bioregional plans and the declaration of marine parks in Commonwealth waters?


Senator Colbeck's bill, which proposes an amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, will make bioregional plans disallowable instru­ments. The reason we are here debating this today is in direct response to what has been another bungle by the Australian Labor Party, this time in relation to the marine bioregional planning process to date.


Why should this surprise us? This government has had a litany of bungles. We have seen the pink batts—they cannot put fluffy stuff in people's roofs without people dying as a consequence. We have seen the bungling of the Julia Gillard memorial halls. Health has been one unmitigated disaster after another, which I have—




Senator Polley:
  A bit like when Tony Abbott was minister.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  No, that is not true, Senator Polley, and you know it. The research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that that is not the case. You know it, and every time that you raise that you are lying to this chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! You will withdraw that, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I will withdraw that. And every time—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fierravanti-Wells!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I withdraw my comment.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. I also ask you to direct your comments through the chair.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Every time those opposite raise that misrepresentation they know it is not true. I have repeatedly quoted chapter and verse in this chamber from the research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  You know it is not true, so do not keep repeating the same old drivel and babble, Senator Polley.


Now we shall return to the matter before us, which is the bungling of the marine bioregional planning process to date. Senator Colbeck's legislation introduces an amend­ment that is a simple step to allow scrutiny by both houses of parliament, and to allow the opportunity to disallow a bioregional plan that does not adopt a balanced approach to marine conservation. The effect of this amendment would be to protect stakeholders and communities against the potential for a minister to make a distorted decision. We have seen plenty of those in the history of the Rudd and Gillard governments, and this would be another opportunity where there would be no scrutiny.


We are talking about a very large area for these proposed marine bioregional plans; it is huge. It is more than seven million kilome­tres. Under the present arrangement the sole authority with the ability to sign off on these plans is the Minister for Sustaina­bility, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, so long as he remains the minister. Of course, the reason for this angst and what has been clearly obvious from the many submissions that have been provided to the Senate committee inquiry in relation to this is precisely this lack of transparency and the consequences of this.


Now that we have this Greens-Australian Labor Party alliance, it is very clear who is pulling the strings in this process. It is very clear from the tenor of the Senate report that it is really the Greens pulling the strings here, and it was very clear from the report that was tabled that this is really about the Greens agenda. But I will come to the Greens agenda in a moment. One has only to look at the marine and coastal areas part of their policy released at the last federal election to see just how antifishing their manifesto is—and, of course, 'manifesto' is the appropriate word to use in relation to Greens policies because, as we heard from Senator Sinodinos and as we may hear again at other times, the Greens are the closest thing that we have in Australia to the remnants of the Communist Party. One has only to look at what they say in their manifesto about their antifishing stance. Their primary concern is purely in relation to conservation and protection. It is not about balancing the interests of conservation and the interests of the users such as the fishers. It is only one-sided, and it is there. It is reduction in fishing. It is reduction in habitat damage from commercial and recreational fishing and other marine activities. That is what the focus of the Greens agenda is here, and that is why the coalition is seeking this amendment, because this is what this is all about. This is all about another give to the Greens and another payback for the Greens-Australian Labor Party alliance.


I look now to the practical effect of this. At the last federal election, one of the most lasting images for me was the number of bumper stickers, particularly in New South Wales, that said, 'I fish and I vote.' This was an issue that created angst up and down the coast in New South Wales—and I speak most particularly about New South Wales even though that angst was shared right around Australia. It was a huge issue last year. Let me just take two areas in particular. I will focus on two seats, Cowper and Paterson. The member for the federal seat of Cowper, Mr Hartsuyker, tabled a petition of 10,000 signatures on 23 May last year. This petition from concerned residents was about their real and heartfelt concerns over the government's plan to prevent commercial and recreational fishing in waters off the New South Wales North Coast. In tabling the petition, Mr Hartsuyker drew the attention of the other place to the devastating impact that a reduction in fishing will have on tourism and local economies. I would just like to refer to a couple of points that he made. One is that, if anyone had any doubts whatsoever about how important fishing is to the tourism industry, 55 per cent of the people who signed this petition were from outside his electorate. This was despite the fact that the petition was distributed only within the Cowper electorate. It goes to show just how important fishing is to the local tourism industry. Of course, the last election was against the background, particularly in New South Wales, of the damage that recreational and commercial fishers have already sustain­ed as a consequence of the New South Wales Labor deal with the Greens, which saw large areas of state marine parks made into no-go fishing zones. So naturally, again, the fishing industry—the recreational and commercial fishers—are justifiably concerned about the impact that this legislation will have on them.


I now move to another area, the federal seat of Paterson. Constituents in Mr Baldwin's electorate—he is the member for Paterson—have made contact with his office in relation to this. Senator Ronaldson was talking about meetings in Corangamite. The member for Paterson also had meetings with hundreds of angry fishermen, both commer­cial and recreational, regarding Labor's lack of consultation on the marine park process. Their concerns were very clear. For example, there were two meetings, at Forster and Shoal Bay, which were hosted by Mr Baldwin and Senator Colbeck, which more than 400 people attended, the majority of whom were furious over Labor's lack of con­sultation. So this is really about consultation.


I have also become aware that this matter will naturally result in financial and economic loss, and it will not be surprising if this whole process leads to some legal issues being raised regarding not only the lack of consultation but the effect on rights and the commercial consequences of this. It would not surprise me to see legal matters being raised and pursued against the Common­wealth to this effect.


Let us have a look at some of the issues that were raised in the submissions to the Senate committee inquiry. One was from the Australian Fishing Trade Association:


AFTA asks that you also consider the social impacts, the health and wellbeing benefits of recreational fishing and the financial ramifications to the many small businesses that depend on the investment provided to their businesses by recreational fishers. Many regional and coastal towns are dependent on recreational fishers for their financial existence.


This is clearly not a matter that the Australian Labor Party or their Greens alliance partners are concerned about.


There are two other interesting points I would like to highlight from that submission. One was about the science surrounding bioregional planning. The submission made it very clear:


To date no briefing regarding the science being used with Bio Regional Planning has been transparently tabled to stake holders. Thus no comment from stake holders has been achieved.


This vacuum of information has not been helpful in any understanding of current process, future process or past process.


What does that tell you? As usual, this is a government that, quite frankly, does not know what it is doing. That is not surprising: it does not really know what it is doing on a whole range of areas; why would it know what it is doing in relation to bioregional planning? The submission goes on to say:


No Socio economic information regarding communities that may be affected by the Bio Regional Planning process has been made available to Stake holders.


Surprise, surprise!


I go to another submission, by the Australia Marine Engine Council, which made some very interesting comments, most explicitly about the adverse financial implications of this legislation and its surrounding measures. As I said earlier, the total bioregional zones cover an area of seven million square kilometres. The total bioregional zones are equivalent to 92 per cent of Australia's landmass and the zones under current consideration are 70 per cent of the size of Australia. These implications were raised by the Australia Marine Engine Council:


Australia has the third largest fishing zone in the world covering an area of about 9 million klm2.


The commercial fishing industry is the nation's fifth largest primary industry with a value of $1.6 billion each year.


Australia's catches are relatively small by world standards


The total catch in Australian waters is only a small fraction of the catch taken in other fishing nations.


The key financial implications that this and other submissions have raised as needing to be considered are the costs to commercial and recreational fishing. Fishing is the only activity banned in all marine parks. I repeat: fishing is the only activity banned in all marine parks. As the Marine Engine Council points out in its submission, boating is not banned; tourism is not banned; diving is not banned; snorkelling is not banned; human entry is not banned; walking on coral is not banned; anchoring on coral is not banned; commercial shipping is not banned; oil tankers are not banned or restricted in all marine parks.


As the submission points out:


Marine Park Authorities frequently use the term “fully protected” but marine parks do not fully protect marine life.


This ban on fishing is the only protection which the council argues is being afforded to marine reserves. What are the hidden costs to Australians? The submission goes on to talk about some of these hidden costs to Australians. It states:


Bans on commercial fishing have a direct and measurable financial effect. Traditionally Commercial Fishers are compensated by a buyout of fishing licences and permits. Commercial fishermen then sell their boats and other assets or more commonly buy a licence in a different area, and so commercial fishing is frequently displaced rather than removed.


What, then, is the effect on the Australian consumer? The submission clearly points out:


Australian consumers however are not compensated and do not so readily 'move on'. Despite our huge coastline relative to our population, in 2007‐2008 Australia became a net importer of fisheries products, both in terms of volume and in terms of value. Australia is now a net importer of seafood. We import more than we export.


What does that mean in practical terms to our consumers? It means that we are buying imported fish, sometimes, as this submission says, of debatable quality, and it talks about some of those varieties. What does all this come down to? It not only comes down to this government being averse to proper scrutiny by this parliament but also means that we will not and cannot have a balanced approach to marine conservation.


The coalition has a very good record in this area. In his speech, Senator Colbeck outlined the very good history that coalition governments have had in this area. The coalition started the process of establishing comprehensive marine bioregional plans, which include determination of marine protected areas around Australia's coastline. As part of that process, we engaged, and rightly so, in extensive and cooperative consultation before marine protected areas were declared. This consultation ensured that an appropriate balance was struck between protecting our marine biodiversity and minimising the social and economic impact on fishers, businesses and coastal commu­nities, some of which I have raised in my speech today. Overall, it was a process that would achieve better outcomes for everyone. The final result would have been a greater protected area with less impact on industry. The history of the coalition government, including its record of consultation, is traversed also in the dissenting report of the coalition senators. In contrast, the Gillard government does not have a track record of effective consultation. For example, in my own shadow portfolio of mental health we have recently seen the government having to backflip in yet another area. They arbitrarily cut visits to psychologists for people with severe mental illness. There was no consult­ation whatsoever, and then the minister had to do a backflip. Minister Roxon did some­thing similar with the social workers and the occupational therapists—going in there with no consultation and making the arbitrary decision, saying 'if this is what the Greens want, we will do it' and forgetting the impact on patients. In this case the impact on the recreational and commercial fishers is forgotten; but the coalition is committed to returning balance and fairness to marine conservation. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:30):  I rise to support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011, which was introduced, Mr Deputy President, by our state colleague Senator the Hon. Richard Colbeck. I note that 75 percent of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team is in the chamber to support Senator Colbeck's very well thought out legislation. There is no doubt that Senator Colbeck, in his role as the shadow spokesman on fisheries, has taken a very consultative approach to his portfolio. This approach is being hailed by both the professional and the amateur fishing sectors. The fishing sector tells me that this approach is in stark contrast to that which the ALP-Green alliance government is trying to inflict upon the people of Australia with its so-called marine bioregional plans. Senator Colbeck seeks to consult rather than to dictate to the fishing sector. That comes through loud and clear to me when I have discussions with the fishing sector. They tell me that he listens rather than hectors. This is another lesson that the Australian Labor Party and their Greens partners in the alliance might learn from Senator Colbeck.


The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that any marine protected areas or biore­gional plans which have genuine and significant economic, environmental and social impacts be instruments reviewable by this parliament. Labor has deliberately sought to ensure that any decision they make is beyond the reach of the parliament. They want it to be the case that, simply by the signature of the minister, these so-called plans and protected areas come into force without their being subject to review by the parliament. What arrogance this is—what hubris! Why are they doing this? They are doing it because the plan and the protected areas are to be dictated to them by the Australian Greens. We all know that this is just another example of the green tail wagging the Labor dog. You can have these marine protected areas if you apply common sense. The coalition accepts and acknowled­ges that it makes sense. Indeed, in his second reading speech introducing the bill, Senator Colebeck set out in very great detail the coalition's proud history of marine protect­ion. The vital ingredient that stood out in Senator Colbeck's recounting of the coali­tion's history in this area, in contrast to the propositions of the ALP on marine protection, was balance. The coalition had balance, which Labor of its own accord—let alone with the influence that the Australian Greens have on everything this government seeks to do—is simply unable to achieve.


There is a marine park in the south-east area of Australia around Tasmania. I recall it well because I was the federal Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation at the time of its establishment, and I remember the consultations I had with Senator Colbeck and other members of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team as we developed that protected area. I was very pleased that at the end of the day we had the sign-off of the conservation movement, the recreational fishers and the professional fishers—we got the balance right. It took time and it took consultation; it also meant applying the science. I pay great tribute to TAFI, the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, which is so ably led by Professor Colin Buxton, for their wonderful work in getting the science in amongst the environmental mantra. When you get that balance right, you can in fact satisfy everybody. I recall some of the battles we had, which were necessary because other­wise the fishing industry and recreational fishing would have been hurt badly. Let us underestimate neither the importance of fishing, both professional and recreational, to the communities all around our coastlines nor indeed the importance of fishing as a social and recreational activity—the opportu­nities to bond with family and friends—to people who live in the cities and suburbs who are willing to travel great distances to enjoy the great Australian outdoors. It is a great Australian pastime, and it should not be hindered by artificial marine parks which serve no genuine environmental purpose and in fact cause great economic damage.


I still remember that certain people were suggesting that the zoned-off areas in the Tasmanian marine park be close to shore and that fishermen only be allowed to catch fish 200 kilometres, or whatever it was, offshore. The very sensible suggestion was made: why would you want the fishermen to have to burn fossil fuels to get 200 kilometres out; why do you not have the biomarine protected area at the 200-kilometre zone and allow the fishers to fish in the area that is closer to shore? It makes economic sense for exactly the same environmental outcome. They are the sorts of things we were able to achieve. Indeed, in one of the areas just off the east coast of Tasmania, there was to be a protected area in which recreational fishers had a longstanding tradition of conducting competitions. When I asked about the purpose of the marine protected area in this particular case, we were told it was for its benthic values. That was a term I learned at the time. I did not know what it meant, but it is the sea floor. I said, 'If we are concerned about the benthic values, the sea floor values, what is the matter with recreational fishing boats floating across the top trawling for fish if their hooks et cetera do not even touch the bottom of the sea floor?' We were able to make that compromise to allow recreational fishing to continue. 


It is that sort of balance and consultation that Senator Colbeck brings to this place with his bill. It is worth while doing and doing properly. But the problem is that if you give in to the Green mantra you do not want to consult. That is why the government does not want consultation and does not want parliamentary review, because the extreme nature of the way the Australian Greens are dictating policy to this Labor government would be exposed.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  We finally have a Greens senator expressing some interest in this bill by coming into the chamber, which I welcome. It is very interesting that wild sea fisheries have to be sustainable and, of course, in being sustainable there is a limit to the catch. So what does one do? It would make sense, would it not, to start engaging in fish farming? Fish farming is an activity that we do in Tasmania exceptionally well. It is world renowned, a growth industry, a value-add industry, a job-creating industry and an export-earning-dollars industry. It is great for our economy. Fish is an essential ingredient for a human balanced diet and the scientific evidence is there, that if you can eat more fish the healthier you will be. But there is pressure on wild sea fisheries; so, if the human race wants to eat more fish, we have to start farming them. 


But what do the Australian Greens do in my home state of Tasmania? They seek to oppose every new fish farm and the extension of every fish farm. This is the closed-for-business approach of the Australian Greens. Sure, on their salaries as senators or whatever else they might do, they might be able to afford a higher price for fish, but there are many people in the community that do want to consume fish. They know that there is a limit in the wild seas and that is why fish farming is so important—something we do so exception­ally well in Tasmania but something that the Australian Greens in Tasmania utterly oppose. The hapless government of Ms Giddings is paralysed to do anything about it and, as a result, the closed sign is up all over Tasmania, not only in the forestry area but also in the fisheries area and in the property development area. Those of us who live in Tasmania know the consequences of having a Greens-Labor alliance government stifling everything, and that has now been translated into Canberra as well, courtesy of the 2010 election and the dastardly deals that Ms Gillard did with the Australian Greens and some Independents. 


Part of that deal was to ensure the suprem­acy of parliament. It was to ensure openness, accountability and transparency. If the Greens believe in all those values they wrote into their agreement—as did the Independ­ents in the other place—with Ms Gillard, I simply ask: where is the openness? Where is the transparency? Where is the accountabili­ty in relation to marine parks? Why do you want to put it beyond the reach of this parliament to investigate and vote upon? 


If you are so confident that these marine parks are so good and wonderful, surely the logic and the scientific rigour of their assess­ments would convince every parliamentarian that they were a good thing—good for the community, good for the long-term wild sea fisheries et cetera. But, no, Labor and the Greens know that the task they have embarked upon is such that they do not want that sort of transparency or accountability, because they are scared of what it would reveal about their extreme agenda. Make no mistake: we are not just talking about lines on maps in relation to these marine parks; we are talking about the livelihoods of regional communities, we are talking about the livelihoods of small businesses and we are talking about the recreational activities of literally hundreds of thousands of Austra­lians all around the country. What we as a community can do and without doubt need to do is to live in harmony with nature, and we can do that. But one of the great problems that the Australian Greens have is they do not actually know where humankind fits in with nature. It is okay for seals to eat fish and for killer whales to eat seals, according to the Greens, but it seems that humankind is not allowed to catch fish for sustenance. That seems to be something that is very difficult for the Greens. They do not actually know where humankind fits into the scheme of things. That is their great dilemma. They nearly think that every human activity must of its nature be bad—and as a result they do not like fishing, they do not like forestry, they do not like plantations, and so the list goes on. In their comfort zones that is fine. But a lot of people actually do need the eco­nomic activity that is generated from fishing.


What we have shown is that we can have the economic activity combined with proper conservation for the maintenance of the species, and as a result we can enjoy the fruits of creation and enjoy that of which we are the stewards. We are not the preservers; we are the stewards. As we know, we cannot lock things up and expect them to be maintained exactly as they were at a given point in time, because things will change. In the forests there will be forest fires, or weeds or pigs or cats will get into them, so we need to manage them. It is the same with our seas, and if we manage them properly we can have them there for their rich biodiversity, and maintain it, and we can also have the richness that the seas provide to us in food, economic activity and recreational activity.


There is nothing wrong with that; these are all good, wholesome things. Indeed, fish are very good for you in our diet. We should be eating more of it—all the health special­ists tell us that. I thought the Greens were into alternative and preventative health, and can I say I am too. But one of the things you need for that is a bit of fish in your diet from time to time. Well, how do you do that if you want to close down the wild sea fisheries and you do not want to expand fish farms or to have fish farming? Where are we going to get our fish from? That is another one of the dilemmas the Greens have not answered.


I know there are some decent souls in this government but they are frustrated that they are locked into the alliance with the Austra­lian Greens. They should be taking stock of what this alliance means for them and their long-term supporters. The agenda of the Australian Greens, as reflected in the government's approach to this matter, is one that denies decent, hard workers from earn­ing a living and does not allow recreational activity, which is very important. That is why balance, the word I started off with, is so important. It is balance that Senator Colbeck is seeking to reintroduce into this debate with his well-thought-out bill, which is the result of the consultations he has undertaken. It is a bill based on common sense, not on the government Labor-Green alliance approach, which is built on hector­ing people and is the know-all, arrogant approach: 'We don't need the voice of the parliament and the input of the parliament in these matters. We will just make the decision and everybody else can go jump and live with the consequences of it.'


The bill that Senator Colbeck has worked on now for some time is an important bill that really does highlight and contrast the different approach that the coalition will take to government. That approach will be one of consulting and of getting the balance right, not of making policy at the behest of extreme environmental groups and at the behest of the Australian Greens. The sad thing is that I am sure the Labor voters and the coalition voters in this country are of a like mind on these issues. So we have to ask: how is it that, when 80 or 90 per cent of people are of a particular mind on an issue, the Greens seem to be able to dictate the policy? That is the matter of concern here, and that is something that we as the coalition are seeking to redress by this excellent bill.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (09:31):  I continue from where I finished late last year on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. The marine bioregional zones targeted in this bill and the subsequent declaration of the marine pro­tected areas within them which will follow are provided for under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The declaration of marine bioregional plans is deemed by the act not to be a legislative instrument, and thus they are shielded from parliamentary scrutiny. This bill seeks to make the bioregional plans disallowable instruments. This bill seeks to remove that absolute power from the minister. It gives parliament the opportunity to have a say when occasions dictate it to be necessary. This bill provides for far greater parliamentary sovereignty and allows both houses the right to say whether any new marine park declaration should happen, on its individual merits. The current lack of review available to the final declaration of bioregional plans is a clear example of the vesting of power within narrow confines. It rests solely with the minister and therefore provides the opportunity for an abuse of power.


Parliamentary scrutiny is something that is sorely needed in this parliament after last year's gags on gags that we saw through the carbon tax debate and truncated debates generally. It was a year where legislation—like that which referred to the carbon tax and that which we are now seeing for the minerals resource rent tax—which people do not want and which the government do not have a mandate for was forced through parliament. Yet again it is the coalition who are trying to restore proper process and scrutiny to the parliament.


This bill is not about whether the govern­ment's declaration on marine protected areas goes ahead but whether parliament has the right to have its say and do the job we are elected to do, which is represent the millions of Australians who voted us here. It is a job which the coalition takes seriously. Unlike Labor, we will actually listen to the millions of Australians we represent. Overwhelm­ingly, support for parliamentary review of the marine bioregional planning process was evident in submissions to the Senate Environment and Communications Legisla­tion Committee inquiry. I would like to quote from the Abalone Industry Association of South Australia:


It is a real slap in the face to the good work done by our Government Fisheries Managers and Industry. We are very uncomfortable with the fact that the final decision of adopting the bioregional plans rests with the Minister for Environment only. We would prefer to have a far more rigorous and robust process through the parliament that doesn’t have the potential to be clouded by extreme green views.


The coalition is not an anti-marine-protected-areas party. We understand that we need them to protect and maintain biologically and culturally significant marine areas. The previous coalition government began the process of establishing marine protected areas around Australia's coastline. In 2006 the coalition announced the establishment of 11 marine protected areas along Australia's south-east coast. These 11 marine protected areas were created only after careful consideration and consultation with the recreational and commercial fishing sectors and other stakeholders.


Labor has continued the coalition's policy but it has failed to adopt a balanced approach to the marine protected areas. Labor has also failed to engage in appropriate consultation with the fishing industry and the wider community. The Labor government has continued to disregard and ignore the fishing industry, and its disastrous attempts to effectively engage with the fishing industry over marine parks have been embarrassing to say the least. Taking away further funding from the national peak body, Recfish, is proof that Labor would sooner tax and spend rather than govern in the interests of all Australians. All the fishermen in Queensland might like to bear that in mind when they go to the polls next month, on 24 March.


Many communities that rely on fishing are directly threatened by Labor's inability to consult on whether a region should be declared a marine protected area. Labor has failed to consult with both the commercial fishing industry and recreational fishers on major changes affecting them, a failure which threatens the jobs and livelihoods of many small businesses in coastal comm­unities. Doesn't this sound all too familiar—the Labor government yet again failing to consult stakeholders on the policies it is forcing on the Australian people? Just like the carbon tax, the mining tax and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which is in its second reincarnation, poor consultation is the hallmark of this government.


Why does the government not value the input of its key stakeholders? Having spent many hours on the road on the live cattle inquiry following the live cattle ban in June, I found many of those stakeholders wonder­ing why this government does not include them in the decision-making process affect­ing so many people's lives in Northern Australia. Why does it not discuss its proposed changes to this policy and legisla­tion with the people who will be directly affected—the fishermen, the recreational fishers and the commercial fishers of Australia? In these commercial and recrea­tional fishing sectors, those businesses and communities reliant on this whole-of-business approach to these regions up and down the coast of Australia have all raised serious and ongoing concerns about the consultation process implemented by Labor. Australians are raising their arms up, worried about the fact that they are not getting a say. Rather than seek genuine input on marine bioregional planning decisions, Labor has used the process for declaring marine protected areas to tell stakeholders what will happen. It has just used the process of declaring marine protected areas to tell them.


Unsurprisingly, recreational and commer­cial fishers, as well as the many related businesses and communities that rely on fishing, have raised substantial concerns about Labor's mishandling of marine protected areas. Appropriate and effective consultation is needed if marine protected areas are to balance environmental concerns with the need to promote jobs and to sustain communities that rely on commercial and recreational fishing. It is not a difficult task and it is not an unreasonable request: step outside of Canberra and talk with the recreational and commercial fishers and the myriad related businesses, small businesses and communities and ask them what they think. When they respond, however, you have to listen, something which this Gillard Labor government has failed to do time and time again. Labor does not listen. This is evidenced through its inability to listen to the Australian people on the carbon tax, to small miners on the mining tax and to Northern Australian cattle producers on the live cattle ban. Labor just does not understand the real world or the realities of running and maintaining a business.


The 2011-12 federal budget, delivered by the Labor-Greens alliance, resulted in no new initiatives for fisheries despite the industry being worth billions of dollars and providing a healthy and sustainable source of protein critical to meeting the future global food security challenges. This is yet another example of the Greens dictating policy to a desperate, ineffective Labor government looking to save itself. Labor does not even have enough courage to challenge the Greens and other radical environmental groups who want to lock up much of coastal Australia in marine parks. Many communities will face enormous economic and social losses unless there is proper and effective consultation on the potential marine protected areas. Only proper and effective consultation will ensure that the future of marine protected areas balances preservation of the environment with economic growth and strong coastal and, might I say, happy communities.


The coalition is committed to balance and fairness to marine conservation and this bill ensures that there will always be the scrutiny that Australians expect from proper and effective democracies. The work that Senator Boswell and Senator Colbeck are doing here in promoting this bill is testimony to their experience and the work they did in the previous Howard government to ensure that equity is maintained. The coalition supports proper community and industry consultation regarding any proposed marine protected areas. Imagine if the government had gone to the last election spruiking this consultation lock out. Imagine if the Bligh government in Queensland used locking up these areas as an election promise.


Labor has failed to tackle illegal foreign fishing in Australia's fishing zones, slashing funding for Southern Ocean patrols. Is it because it cannot carry out the patrols of the Southern Ocean to prevent fish poaching in Australian waters because all the maritime and aerial resources are being used to find boats penetrating our northern waters as a result of Labor's failed asylum seeker policy? Labor has also failed to meet its own time frames for declaring marine protected areas. Time frames have been altered due to Labor's inability to adequately consult within unrealistic schedules that were politically, rather than practically, motivated. Once again, the Green tail is wagging the Labor dog.


Labor has also failed to rule out large no-take zones within the marine protected areas currently being established across Australia. The fear of no-take zones has caused great uncertainty for businesses directly and indirectly reliant on access to fishing resources. As it did with the cattlemen of Northern Australia, this Labor government is undermining the essential ingredient in business security. Businesses must always have security. It is the very foundation in which they raise capital and it is the very foundation in which their banks expect them to be able to repay that capital which is borrowed. Labor has also caused great uncertainty amongst stakeholders who will be adversely impacted by potential loss of access to resources within declared marine parks. The bankers to fishing businesses, as I earlier referred to, would be reviewing this bill and would likely say, 'Hooray! Some checks and balances are to be parachuted into this ongoing debate.' Everybody in this business sector will look at this legislation and say, 'Will we have security in our business?'


The lock-up mentality of Labor and the Greens completely ignores the fact that Australia's recreational and commercial fishers are dedicated to sustainability. As a farmer myself, I say that you know that your future is predicated on your environmental sustainability. Locking up marine areas without proper consultation or scientific assessment and throwing away the keys is neither responsible nor practical. Labor's biggest contribution to fisheries so far has been to bungle the marine bioregional plans process, leaving fishing communities waiting months to see even one of the draft maps for the four marine reserve networks proposed. The parallels between this and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan process mean that the two are eerily similar. Labor fails yet again to properly consult and include the community in its plans for them. We need a full socioeconomic impact assessment that identifies the true loss of value to the community as a result of the loss of access to marine parks by the commercial and amateur fishers of Australia. Any assessment should be publicly released prior to the release of a declaration of any parks. Further, a compre­hensive fishing gear risk assessment should be conducted for each of the proposed marine parks before the parks are declared. This fishing gear risk assessment should not unfairly target selective fishing activities, such as trawling, from any new reserves, given that there are sustainable trawl fisheries operating successfully in marine parks in Australia.


Labor have failed to consult, have failed to include adequate community and industry concerns, have failed to consider commercial and recreational fishers and have failed again to uphold proper parliamentary scrutiny. Yet again Labor is opposing a bill that would deliver greater scrutiny to this parliament. The hypocrisy is rank. On the one hand you have the Prime Minister saying, 'Let's draw back the curtains and let the sun shine in; let our parliament be more open than it has ever been before,' and on the other hand you have Labor voting against letting the sun shine down on the parliament so that there is adequate scrutiny of marine park areas in Australia. So let the sun shine in; let the disinfectant be thorough. I ask that everybody get behind this bill and support it in the interests of all Australians.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (09:48):  It is with pleasure that I rise to support Senator Colbeck's bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. In following my colleague Senator Edwards, I note that, as with many areas of our coast, there stands to be partic­ular impact on our home state of South Australia, and more particularly the waters off it and therefore the livelihoods of the communities in our home state of South Australia.


The coalition, as others have outlined, has a proud history of protecting our marine environment—in particular the marine areas which so many of our communities rely upon for their livelihood. The coalition continues to support a balanced approach to biomarine conservation. It was the former Howard government, as others have noted, that established 11 marine protected areas in what is known as the south-east zone. But we consider that on that occasion not only adequate but very good and extensive consultation was undertaken with recreation­al and community groups, environmental groups and commercial fishing organisations and that we struck a balance between protecting marine biodiversity and minimis­ing the impact on fishers, local communities and local economies. That stands in stark contrast to the complete lack of balance and lack of transparency being demonstrated by the Gillard government in their flawed attempts to establish bioregional plans, or what can commonly be called marine parks.


This bill is not about stopping the declaration of bioregional plans or stopping the creation of marine parks, but it is about giving the two houses of this parliament the final say over the process. It still allows for the minister of the day—in this case a Labor government minister—to propose, area by area, marine park by marine park. It still allows that minister to seek the advice of his department and to consult with stakeholders impacted by establishing a marine park. But it also makes a declaration of a bioregional plan a disallowable instrument, which means that, bioregional plan by bioregional plan, it is open to this parliament to seek to disallow the proposed plan if members of this place consider, having heard from our local communities, that a particular declaration has knobs on it.


I travelled to Kangaroo Island in my home state last year and met with local fishermen and local government members, and they raised concerns about both federal and state plans for bioregions and the consultation—or rather, as they saw it, lack of it—that had been undertaken. They talked about a lack of scientific basis, particularly for decisions being made around areas to be declared under state arrangements. The creation of a marine park necessarily relies, or should rely, on a whole lot of evidence. In this parti­cular case, the local communities on Kanga­roo Island were questioning, and properly so, the scientific basis upon which certain declarations were proposed to be made. Their livelihoods are under threat, as are the livelihoods of many affected by the proposed bioregional plans across the country.


A lack of consultation about marine sanctuaries can cause a groundswell or a backlash against those seen to be proposing them. For example, there was a community meeting in my home state of South Australia last year, in Burnside in Adelaide, which attracted about 1,000 people to the local town hall to protest about what they saw as the lack of consultation and their lack of say about the development of marine sanctuaries in South Australia. The build-up of pressure leading up to and following that meeting was so great that, last November, the newly installed South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill, saw fit to announce a postpone­ment, an announcement for which I would not criticise him, of the release of draft plans, conceding that many groups felt they had not been consulted. So even a Labor Premier in my home state is able to recognise the lack of consultation on issues such as these—a lack that is addressed by this bill—and the way in which bioregional plans can strike at the heart of people's livelihoods. They need to be able to have their say about the impact these measures will have on them, and in many instances thus far they have not.


The first area to have a draft plan released was the south-west bioregion, extending from the eastern tip of Kangaroo Island in South Australia to Shark Bay on the Western Australian coast. That is 1.3 million square kilometres in total, and that sounds a lot, but the total area proposed to be put under the ambit of bioregional plans is, as Senator Colbeck has said, just over seven square kilometres—sorry, just over seven million square kilometres—of Commonwealth waters. I was about to say that is a truckload of water; I am glad I corrected my figures! That is a lot of water and we are talking about a lot of potential restrictions over that water for areas that are declared to be under a bioregional plan and a marine park. We are talking about areas that can have later designated within them areas of sanctuary zones, recreation-only zones or so-called special purpose zones. That means there can be areas that are closed to everything but a few activities. There can be areas where commercial and recreational fishing will be excluded and areas where particular types of equipment and fishing practices will be restricted. So this is a big deal and Labor is fluffing it—what a surprise!


A majority of the submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill raised concerns about the lack of consultation with the government's progression of its planned marine protected areas. For example, in his submission, made on behalf of the South Australian Marine Parks Management Alliance, Mr Gary Morgan stated:


It is a reflection of the level of concern among the industry that, in my 30+ years experience in both Government and fishing industry roles (including as Director of Fisheries in South Australia, 1997‐2000), I have never known an issue to create such anxiety and uncertainty in the industry and this is the only time I can ever remember that ALL sectors of the industry have come together to address what they see as a major threat to their livelihoods.


People in our communities say this is a big deal. Mr Morgan's submission also noted:


In SA, there has been a focus on ‘percentages’ of sanctuary areas, rather than such a orderly, science‐based approach, there has been no rigorous threat identification or assessment (particularly from fishing activities) and the process is clearly not science‐based


The Abalone Industry Association of South Australia said in its submission:


Our industry is very concerned about the political lobbying being undertaken by Green Groups at the moment blurring the line of using sanctuary zones (no take) as a fisheries management tool and using examples to support their cause from countries where there is no fisheries management.


We consider the abalone industry in South Australia to be a very well managed industry. It contributes over $300 million to our local economy and sustains more than 300 jobs in the local community. The issues at stake around bioregional plans are a big deal and they strike at the heart of the livelihood of the communities who rely on the subject waters for their commercial and recreational activities. Those communities deserve to be consulted. The Labor govern­ment has failed to do so adequately and so this bill, appropriately—and unfortunately—seeks to pull the Gillard Labor government up. It does not pull the government up short but simply pulls them up and requires their proposed bioregional plans to be subject to a mechanism that allows parliament to say, 'Not on this occasion; not in this area,' but also allows parliament to say, 'Having considered this particular proposal, we think it is the right thing to do.' I hope that this place sees fit to support Senator Colbeck's bill.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (09:59):  Happy new year to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and all of my fellow senators. I am very pleased to start the new parliamentary year by speaking about the importance of looking after our precious marine environ­ment. As a very proud Queenslander, I will focus on the amazing region in our north-east, the Coral Sea, which is currently awaiting protection. I will also talk about the great benefits that decent protection has brought to the Great Barrier Reef.


The Coral Sea is absolutely unique. It has 18 coral reef systems and a chain of undersea volcanoes which stretch 1,300 kilometres, with canyons of up to five kilometres deep. It is recognised as a global biodiversity hot spot. It has ocean giants such as sharks, tuna, marlin, swordfish and sailfish in massive abundance. It has 28 different species of dolphins and whales. It has six of the world's seven species of marine turtle. It has soft corals and large sea fans and spectacular sponge gardens. It is home to many species of coral, fish and invertebrates which are not found anywhere else on this planet. Clearly, it is a national heritage treasure. But it is not only that; it is also of significant historical importance to Australia. It was, of course, the scene of the 1942 Battle of the Coral Sea. I took the opportunity to mention this fact to President Obama on his visit, and he said that he would love to come and have a look at the Coral Sea. I certainly hope he does so. The 70th anniversary of the battle will be in May this year, and what an opportunity it will be to protect this underwater paradise. It is perfect timing.


The Coral Sea was declared a conserva­tion zone a few years ago when the govern­ment went through its marine bioregional planning processes, and the draft bioregional plan for the Coral Sea was released in November last year. The Greens welcomed the proposed ban on oil and gas mining and seabed trawling and gillnet fishing through­out the Coral Sea, but it is proposed to protect only half of the Coral Sea. This is a huge missed opportunity to create the world's largest marine national park. The proposed plan for a multi-use marine reserve simply does not go far enough and is piecemeal. Only two reefs of the specific 25 reefs in the Coral Sea will receive full protection, and that just does not seem enough to me. Instead of treating the region like a Swiss cheese and having different use zones, it would be much easier for the government to manage and monitor an entirely protected region. Nearly 70 per cent of Queenslanders support turning the entire area into a fully protected marine national park, so I hope that the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Populat­ion and Communities, Mr Burke, in his consultations, has a good ear to the ground and listens to the community. Public consult­ation is still open—it closes in two weeks, on Friday, 24 February—and I call upon anyone who in their spare time is listening or reading the Hansardand anyone who loves our oceans and this precious region to please make your voice heard. Write to federal environment minister Burke and ask him to act on this amazing opportunity to protect this vast pristine ocean area by making it the world's largest marine national park.


Making this area the world's largest marine national park is not just about protecting our environment; it is also critical for the long-term sustainability of our fisheries. There is no better example of the protection of our fisheries than the fantastic outcomes we have seen in the green zones in the Great Barrier Reef. Quite a bit of research has been done on the effectiveness of the green zones, and most recently some research by the US National Academy of Sciences in conjunction with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, AIMS, as well as James Cook University has found that the green zones—surprise, surprise!—really do work. According to this research:


… the network of marine reserves on the GBR has brought major, sustained ecological benefits, including enhanced populations of target fish, sharks, and even corals, the foundation of the coral reef ecosystem.


So this body of research has found that there have been rapid increases of fish inside the no-take reserves in both reef and non-reef habitats. This is very important for both our fishers and our tourism operators. The protected fish inside those no-take areas are bigger, so they will contribute many more larvae to the whole ecosystem. Therefore, the benefits of these no-take areas are expected to extend outside the no-take boundaries and to replenish the surrounding areas, which are open to fishing. It is a simple thing: protecting the fish breeding grounds gives you more and bigger fish. The green zones are also benefiting the overall health and resilience of the ecosystem. For example, the researchers found that there are less frequent outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on no-take reefs. Much to my horror, a recent briefing from AIMS says that crown-of-thorns starfish are still a massive issue in the GBR and that we are losing the battle. This is just one way that we can try to tackle that continuing problem. In short, we know that no-take areas can play a crucial role as recharge zones for sea-life popula­tions, thereby ensuring the long-term sustain­ability of our environment and recreational and commercial fishing as well as the local tourism industry.


I take issue with something that Senator Edwards raised on behalf of the opposition. He was waxing lyrical about the Liberals being on the side of the fishers. Frankly, I thought that was a bit rich. I moved a motion late last year calling for the suspension of dredging in Gladstone harbour and, in fact, up and down the reef, where we have seen massive impacts on local fish populations. We have seen fish with red spot disease, which has now spread to sharks and crabs. We are seeing absolute devastation in Gladstone harbour. It is so serious that the fishing industry was shut down for about three weeks last year. It has now been re-opened, but the local fishermen are still saying that they do not want to catch the fish there. The fish are still sick, and the bottom has dropped out of the local industry there. No-one will buy the fish because, of course, they are not prepared to sell diseased fish.


Where are the Nationals and the Liberals on this issue? I hear that Senator Boswell is agitating for better compensation for those local fishers, and that is fantastic. We certainly support that—we think it is ridicu­lous that one industry, the coal seam gas industry, has been allowed to dredge the harbour beyond recognition and the fisher­men have been left to suffer. We are all for proper compensation for the fishers, but that is not the whole story. Is Senator Boswell going to allow the dredging to continue? What about the next fishing community when five other ports are opened up for coal and coal seam gas export? I am afraid it is a bit rich for the Liberals and the Nats to claim that they are somehow the great champions of the fishing industry, when they have been prepared to abandon Gladstone harbour and do nothing to stop this massive dredging program for coal and coal seam gas export.


The Greens do not support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. We fully support marine protected areas. They are good for fishing, they are good for tourism, they are good for our economy and they are good for the future of our grandkids.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (10:07):  I think we need to be a little clearer on what the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011 is all about. It is not about opposing marine parks in any shape or form. It is about giving this parliament the right to oversight, to debate and to discuss where marine reserves are to happen, because, as Senator Waters has just pointed out, it is quite possible for interested groups or self-interested groups to skew the discussions and deliberations of the minister at any time during this debate. A pious motion from the Senate around dredging in Gladstone Harbour is not a useful thing. I was trying to think of how useless it was, but I cannot quite think of a polite comparison and so I shan't. It would not be useful in assisting either the environmental concerns in Gladstone Harbour or the fishing industry in Gladstone, which certainly have some serious problems. A motion from the Senate does nothing. It is the Queensland state government that needs to get its act together and do something there.


A minister for the environment who alone can make the decision about where marine parks go is not good for democracy or for Australia. We have already seen that there are conservation groups, fringe environ­mental groups—we could even include the fishing industry and other stakeholders—who, if they can get the ear of the minister or are in the right electorate at the right time, may skew the way the development of marine conservation proceeds in Australia. In fact, the Gillard and Rudd governments have in some ways simply continued the coalition's program, which was designed to protect and conserve our extraordinary marine resources in a balanced way. They have failed, of course, to continue the implementation correctly. Why should we be surprised by that? It happens in almost every area that the Rudd and Gillard governments touch. They have failed completely to continue appropriate consultation with the fishing industry or with the wider commu­nity. They have not adopted a balanced approach and they give preference to the views of NGOs and others at the expense of not just the fishing industry but also local tourism industries and other groups.


We can draw an adequate comparison between the fishing industry and fishermen and the agribusiness industry and farmers. These people are not there to destroy their livelihoods; they are great conservationists; they are great preservers; they want sustainable industries. They are not about destroying wherever they go. Consulting them and listening to the broad range of evidence that is available on marine regions are far more important than having the minister simply do what he likes when he likes. The idea of this bill we are putting forward today is not about destroying marine areas or destroying biodiversity; it is about having a sensible, balanced approach that reinstates parliamentary scrutiny to an area of just over seven million square kilometres of Commonwealth waters. What we seek to do here is to make the declaration of marine bioregional plans disallowable instruments, not a legislative instrument that is complete­ly shielded from parliamentary scrutiny with the stroke of a pen. The minister can have a massive impact on Australia's territorial waters and all the people who make a living from them or the resources in those areas. 


Senator Waters liked telling us how the fish improved in no-take areas. Yes, the coalition supports that idea. We completely support the idea that with a balanced approa­ch you will have no-take areas, you will have recreational areas and you will have areas for the fishing industry within marine parks. We have no problem whatsoever with this approach to balancing conservation with the marine industry, but we cannot achieve that if the only person making the decision is the minister and he or she is doing that without any oversight by this parliament. All we are seeking to do is to take the absolute power away from the minister to give parliament the opportunity to have a say about what should be included in a marine bioregional plan and what should not. It gives parliament far greater sovereignty and it gives both Houses the chance to have a say on the individual merits of each marine bioregional plan. There is no problem in my view with that being done and I have no idea why anyone would want to oppose that being done. In fact, I would have thought that it would be something that would be supported in this House particularly by the Greens and the Independents, because, given the record of this government on consultation, there is every reason to think that we will get ad hoc decisions designed to assist whatever group the government is trying to cosy up to at the time. The coalition has a very proud track record and a great commitment in the area of marine protected areas. It was the Howard government in 1998 that secured agreement with the state governments to commit to establishing a national representative system of marine protected areas. It was the Howard government that made a further, international commitment to establish such a representa­tive network by 2012 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002. And again, in 2005-06, it was the Howard govern­ment that initiated the investigation and subsequent implementation of the south-east marine reserve network, the fifth of the five bioregions that are likely to be covered by these marine bioregional plans. We are not anti marine parks, but we think there is a right way and a wrong way to go about developing such reserves—and we already have evidence of the wrong way being done now.


Every interest group and every stakehold­er have claimed that there has not been adequate consultation. There have not been appropriate levels of consultation with local communities or with affected commercial industries or with the marine recreation industries. Even environmental groups have said to our shadow minister and to others that they feel left out by the federal govern­ment when it comes to genuine consultation. And, if your livelihood depends on whether the fishing industry is going to be there in three years or five years, if whether the bank will lend you the money to buy a new boat is reliant on what the minister's whim of the day is, you are in a very difficult position. There has been incredible anxiety and uncertainty created in the fishing industry by this government's approach to developing marine bioregional plans.


Coastal communities are certainly aware that if they do not get a say in this, if there is not a way to ensure that their views can be aired and discussed and debated in this place, then on the basis of the track record of this government it will only be the fringe green groups that will actually get heard, not the people who use and manage and conserve our fisheries on a daily basis.


Industry is really nervous, and that is not just the commercial fishing industry, althou­gh I would point out that it is Australia's sixth-largest primary producer. Recreational fishing might be something that some of us do—very unsuccessfully in my case—just once or twice a year, but for thousands of Australians it is actually a job, and off those jobs hang many other jobs. There are resources that you need to get together a fishing boat, and many businesses are involved, not only with the boat itself but with the gear, the technology, the electronics that are used on the boat. Those are all industries that need a commercial fishing industry to survive. So we have to talk about not only the recreational fishing industry as a multibillion-dollar industry but also the very large commercial fishing sector that, as I said, is the sixth-largest primary producing sector in Australia.


Not only is it the lack of consultation that makes people nervous; not only is it the track record of this government that makes people in the industry nervous; but it is the fact that the government cannot even meet its own time frames for declaring marine parks that makes people nervous. So once again we have an implementation issue, which I suppose should not surprise us with this government, but it does nothing at all to assist businesses trying to function and to plan for the future in this area.


In the lead-up to the 2010 election, Labor promised to release draft maps for the south-western bioregion by mid-December. Then the minister said they would probably do them by late January or early February. We still have not seen those draft maps. It is no different to any other promise that Labor make during an election. It may not, in its consequences for the entire economy, be as serious as: 'We won't put a price on carbon. We won't introduce a carbon tax.' But for the people whose livelihoods depend on it, the fact that this government cannot meet its election promises in this area is just as bad, and the consequences are just as dire, as that broken carbon tax promise.


Labor also promised to release a displaced effort policy in the lead-up to releasing the first draft maps, but that did not arrive in the time frame promised either. So we have a group who are intimately involved with our fishing stocks and our marine parks who are saying, 'What is going on here?' And, if it is only the minister, through a legislative instrument, who can decide where a marine bioregional plan is established, these groups have no avenue for airing their concerns in a democratic way. They are forced to protest; probably some of them will be forced out of business. It is all very well for this govern­ment to say, 'We'll just sort out what we are doing when we get around to it.' But it has to keep in mind that a fishing boat, for example, is an investment that you would keep for 20 years or more. You are not going to go and buy one when this minister could decide, based on the whim of whichever stakeholder group the Labor government next wants to please, to undertake work that could simply ruin your industry. I know that the fringe environmental groups like to claim that our fisheries are in disarray, but that is completely wrong. They are among the best managed and healthiest in terms of stock numbers of any country in the world. You have to take into consideration that amongst them is the same group that wants the whole Coral Sea locked up. Those groups peddle mistruths and misinformation in the name of so-called conservation. But it is the practiti­oners, the people whose lives and livelihoods depend on healthy fish stocks and a healthy marine environment, who are the real custodians and the people who should be listened to by this government—not just the commercial fishermen but the tourism industry, the hospitality industry and the many other ancillary industries I mentioned that hang off commercial and recreational fishing.


There are a huge number of people who, at the stroke of the minister's pen, can lose their livelihoods and be disenfranchised. Why would there be any opposition to this parliament being the place where these matters are decided? Parliamentarians can air the views of the many stakeholder groups, and the claims of various groups can be properly assessed by parliamentary committ­ees. That would mean a sensible, balanced decision could be made based on what is best for the environment and what is best for industry, rather than the minister simply deciding what suits him best.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (10:24):  I rise to support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011 and to express some real concerns about the current system. How could you leave seven million square kilometres in the hands of one minister, whether that minister be a man or a woman?




Senator Farrell:
  He's a very good minister.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take that interjection. Let us look back at the decisions of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Perhaps we will go to the live-cattle-export issue. We saw the Four Corners story and we supported the abolition of Australian exports of live cattle to those abattoirs which were clearly doing the wrong thing. Then the minister put a total ban on the export of live cattle. What a financial mess this has been for the graziers in the Top End of our nation. This is a clear example of one minister with too much power doing something very wrong. Once the cattle got over 350 kilograms live weight, they were not suitable to send to Indonesia. So, as the delays went on, what could the people do with their cattle?


I live at Inverell, a lovely town in northern New South Wales, where we are fortunate to have an abattoir. Those Top End graziers were forced to send cattle from the top of Western Australia thousands of kilometres by road to Inverell. That is a classic example of a minister making a very bad decision. What Minister Ludwig should have done was to get a copy of that film, hop straight on a plane to Jakarta, meet with the Indonesian agriculture minister and say: 'Look at this. We have a problem. We do not accept animals being treated like this.' I agree with that proposal totally, as someone who has done my own butchering on the farm for many years. Whether it be beef cattle, sheep or pigs, I am no stranger to a butcher's knife. I would never, ever condone animals being treated like that.


To come back to our argument about ministerial power: it is seven million square kilometres. Like it or not, the Greens carry a lot of weight in this Gillard-led Labor government. We know we have to preserve our fish stocks. We know we cannot just go out and net the fish stocks. It is all about sustainability for the future. We know that in 1998 the Howard government led in the right direction on this very important issue, the conservation and retention of fish stocks in our marine areas. But there were consulta­tions. The government worked with the industries and the people, whether they were local fishermen who just wanted to go and wet a line on the weekend or professional fishermen. To leave this in the hands of a minister and take it away from the parlia­ment is wrong, by all democratic beliefs. How could you trust a minister? I could give you other examples. I have talked about the cattle industry and what a shambles it was.




Senator Farrell:
  He's a very trustworthy minister.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Trustworthy or not, the decision that Minister Ludwig made on the export of live cattle to Indonesia was a disgrace.




Senator McEwen:
  I think we're talking about bioregional plans.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I am giving an example of ministerial powers and how the Labor government made a terrible decision. It was a financial disaster for industries throughout Northern Australia. You want us to sit back and say: 'Leave it to the environ­ment minister. That minister will make the determination of where the marine parks are, what will happen, what will be closed down, who will be compensated.' We know about compensation. My colleague Senator Boyce mentioned professional fishermen investing in a boat. If they are shut out of the industry, who compensates them for the purchase of the boat? Will that happen, or will the minister say: 'No. Enough is enough; we're wiping it out'? 


Life is about fairness and, if the govern­ment take away your livelihood, they should compensate you. But in the current situation, when a minister takes away the livelihood of fishermen, are they compen­sated? These questions need to be answered. If it were left to the parliament to make this decision, these debates could be had and the questions could be put. Hopefully we would get some answers. But the current plan is totally unacceptable. Our bill is aimed at taking the power from the minister and giving it back to where it belongs, the parliament. I commend Senator Colbeck for his work on this issue and others who are passionate about this issue, such as my colleague Senator Boswell. Our bill repre­sents what Australian people would expect—that both houses of parliament make the decision on any new marine park declara­tions. That is the clear point here. The House of Representatives commences the legisla­tion process on most occasions but not always. When it comes to the Senate we have the opportunity to amend, to debate or even to vote down or reject legislation. 


I could talk about many ministerial decisions being made in this current govern­ment. It comes back to simply a lack of trust. That is the problem we have with this government, and the Australian people have the same problem. They do not trust the government. They do not trust the govern­ment on its commitment to introducing carbon taxes, on its commitment to keeping food, grocery prices, fuel prices and the cost of living low and on all the promises we got from the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, prior to the 2007 election; hence, Senator Colbeck's bill is a most important piece of legislation to return the power to the parliament and not leave it in the hands of just one minister. Why should we trust this government to get anything right? Just think back to Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. I mention live exports of cattle, home insulation or the Building the Education Revolution, the mounting national debt of the government, asylum seekers and our border protection, yet you expect us to trust an environment minister where the Greens would really use their power to influence that minister.


One of my pet hates is the locking up of land and simply leaving it. The National Parks Association have been pushing this year after year. We saw the shutting-up of the red gum forests down near Deniliquin in the middle of a state forest and in Victoria. It is amazing when you go down there, as I did some two years ago to look through that red gum forest where 900 hectares were burnt. That multiplied by 2½ is 2,400 acres. Red gum will not take fire at all. You see the Pilliga and the regeneration of ironbark and box trees and various other types of trees. What happened there was that that country was locked up. It comes back to management of the environment. That country used to be grazed to keep the fuel levels down. Now that it has been locked up, you cannot graze there.


The influence of the Greens is clear when it comes to the new Victorian state govern­ment, which will not allow grazing in the alpine regions to reduce the amount of fuel on the ground. I get back to the argument of ministerial decisions. Once you have more than five tonnes per hectare of fuel on the ground—grasses, twigs, six millimetres of dome or less, 30- or 40-kilometre wind, a 40-degree day—a fire is basically impossible to control. It comes back to environmental management. People just think of preserva­tion—lock it up and leave it—and then we destroy it through fire.


We get back to the argument here of ministerial decision. It was Minister Burke who overruled the decision of the Victorian government. I think that is wrong, because under the Constitution the management of land is clearly in the hands of the Crown or the states, but Minister Burke made that decision. He did not have a debate in this parliament. There was no decision about that at all. When fire destroys those areas again, hopefully we will not see the loss of life like we did in the Black Saturday bushfires a couple of years ago. It will happen again. Fires will occur again. We have had the wet seasons now and the grass is growing. We all know that it will dry out. It will get hot again, even though this summer has been so extremely cool. We have seen a minister's power to threaten the environment with Minister Burke in the alpine regions. They say you are not allowed to have hard-hooved animals in those areas. It is all right to have thousands of deer, thousands of brumbies, hundreds of thousands of wild goats and tens of thousands of wild pigs—they are all hard-hooved animals—but you cannot run cattle up there because they might eat the grass down; you have to just let it burn.


I make the point that this is a minister's decision and, to me, it is too powerful. There is too much responsibility in the hands of one person; likewise with the marine parks. Senator Colbeck's private member's bill should be supported because it gives the power back to the parliament, back to the elected people, to make a decision. The fear, of course, is the current make-up of the parliament in both houses of this country where you have the Independents and the Greens flexing their muscles—the tail wagging the dog of the Labor Party—whether it be on carbon taxes or other broken promises on deliveries that we are now seeing.


This is the worst time to have this power in the hands of one person. If you had a clear government, then you would not have to kowtow to minority groups who are pressur­ed by those out there who simply believe locking up everything is the way ahead. What are we going to do when we lock up all our marine parks? Are we just going to import our prawns from Thailand? We talk about food security for the future. We are the first to say there must be manage­ment and you cannot basically rape the oceans of fish and expect them to survive. That cannot happen.


In my lifetime I have seen reductions in fish in many areas. When I was a kid hanging a line over the jetty at Port Lincoln in about 1967 a huge amount of tommy rough would grab hold of your line. You probably would not see that today. For sure we have reduced fish numbers in areas around the world, but it is about balanced management. It is about the needs of mankind and looking after the environment and conserving the stocks we have. No doubt Senator Conroy would agree with me on this issue, as he does on most issues. 


I support this proposal by Senator Colbeck because it returns the power to the parlia­ment, to those who are elected to these places to represent the people in their electorates and not to give this enormous power to a minister who will probably get a backroom bribe from a minority group to do as they want or there will be trouble. We have already seen that with the carbon tax. We have seen Mr Windsor's demands in his agreement with Prime Minister Gillard. One of his demands was, 'You will form a multiparty climate change committee or else.' That was Mr Windsor's drive. He probably drove it more than the Greens. That is the problem we have. I urge support for Senator Colbeck's proposal.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-02-09,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:37):  I rise to speak in support of Senator Colbeck's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. The bill reinstates parliamentary scrutiny of just over seven million square kilometres of Common­wealth waters. The bill seeks to make bioregional plans a disallowable instrument. The waters adjacent to Victoria, my home state, are included in the south-east marine region, which extends from waters offshore of southern New South Wales to eastern South Australia. It also includes waters adjacent to Senator Colbeck's home state of Tasmania and Macquarie Island.


The coalition has a strong track record of supporting marine conservation. The coali­tion supports a balanced approach. Through­out the history of the development of marine protected areas the coalition has been at the forefront of developing workable plans at a local and national level. It was a coalition government in 1998 that secured agreement with the state governments to commit to establishing a national representa­tive system of marine protected areas. It was a coalition government that made a further international commitment to establish such a representa­tive network by 2012 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. And it was a coalition government that in 2005 and 2006 initiated the investigation and subsequ­ent implementation of the south-east marine reserves network, the fifth of the five bioreg­ions I mentioned in my introduct­ory remarks. 


I make these points to highlight that the coalition is far from being anti-marine park. We believe there is a right way and a wrong way to go about the development and maint­enance of such reserves. It is a balanced approach. We obviously need to consider industry. The south-east trawlers association, in my home state, has made numerous representations about the size of the marine park we have down in Victoria, which is the size of our entire state. Those in the industry in Victoria are the last people that want to see a reduction in fish stocks.


Similarly, a balanced approach needs to take into account recreational fishers—not only the impact of recreational fishing but our desire as a parliament and as leaders in our nation to promote healthy lifestyles and people getting out and about in the natural environment. A balanced approach also needs to take into consideration ecological systems and the environment itself, including fish stocks. Also, particularly from a regional perspective, we need to consider local economies, and a balanced approach to these sorts of discussions also needs to take into account the socioeconomic impacts on regional towns and communities.


I have seen the impact of overfishing through my travels in Canada in 2000. I spent a lot of time in Newfoundland, an area of Canada that is renowned for having destocked a complete species of fish. I saw the impact that has had on the local economy in terms of having to completely reconfigure how they live and work in that province and in that nation.


The coalition, and obviously the Nationals within the coalition, strongly support a balanced approach to marine parks and marine sustainability. The development of the south-east network reinforced to me that the successful implementation of a marine networks plan would not eventuate without genuine, detailed, open consultation with each and every stakeholder who felt they had a claim or a vested interest. That goes not only to the heart of the successful imple­mentation of these sorts of things but also to the notions of inclusion and involvement in the democratic processes of our nation.


The overwhelming measure of success for anything like this is that the consultation with stakeholders is actually enacted. There were 20 recommendations made on boundar­ies and zoning within the south-east network. The result is that, whilst the network is larger and more representative of the region than was the original proposal, it also has far less impact on the fishing industry. So it is really a win-win scenario for Victorians.


Unfortunately, current developments with regard to the remaining four marine biore­gional plans are not as positive. The core issue that other speakers have mentioned, and which I will go to in my comments, is that this bill goes to the fact that the minister has complete discretion and Labor ministers are not handling the great responsibilities before them in a manner that is giving stakeholders of any persuasion, at any end of the spectrum, confidence in the marine bioregional planning process or indeed any planning process currently before us.


The Rudd and Gillard Labor governments have not adopted a balanced approach to marine protected areas and they have not engaged in appropriate levels of consultation with local communities, with affected commercial industries or with marine recrea­tional interests. Environmental groups have said that they also have felt left out by the federal government when it comes to genuine consultation. This approach taken by Labor has created incredible anxiety and uncertainty in the fishing industry right around our nation. Coastal communities are wise to the fact that this Labor government's track record is that it will only hear from fringe green groups rather than the people who actually use, manage, live in and work in our fisheries on a daily basis. It is not just in this area, as I mentioned earlier. Just look at the track record of unilateral decisions by Labor ministers. My colleague Senator Williams spoke so knowingly about the decisions by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry around live cattle exports. The flip-flopping that went on there, with the TV program, the conversations with green groups, the conversations with other people and the ministerial decision-making process have led to a lot of uncertainty within that industry and within those communities. Similarly, there was the minister's approach to consultation on the Murray-Darling Basin, particularly in the first iteration. There is their ability to impact and their being beholden to, if you like, a certain end of the spectrum and how that is playing out in local communities in relation to uncertainty.


Again, on a particular issue concerning the granddaughter of a high country cattleman, there was a decision by Minister Burke to override the state government and ban grazing of cattle in the high country. Particularly when you look at the number of sambar deer and brumbies that are up there, and the number of cattle that are going in, it just does not make sense. So we are seeing ministers not making decisions on a scienti­fic basis or not taking all the information and all the impacts of their decisions into account. That is something that the coalition is concerned about, and I think it is something that all those who are interested in the good governance of our great nation need to be concerned about.


We now have to take the minister at face value when he says that he has all the information required, and there is no ability for the parliament to scrutinise the decision or for both ends of the spectrum to examine the minister's decisions and feed into that. I think it cuts both ways, and this is where I am really surprised at the Greens' perspective on this particular bill before us. What happens when we do not have a minister who is beholden to environmental interests, who is not captured by the Greens but rather by the other extreme? Surely we need a balanced approach, and that is what is this bill attempts to deliver: a mechanism to protect the environment from extremism.


The commercial fishing industry is Australia's sixth largest primary producer. In my home state about 721,000 Victorians enjoy recreational fishing. I am not one of them. I have never had much success with dropping in a line, despite living not far from beautiful Inverloch, but I know plenty of people who are mad keen fishermen. There are about 850 commercial fishery access licences in Victoria, and these operations land about $120 million worth of fresh seafood at Victorian ports each year. As Senator Williams said, we want to be able to manage these fisheries appropriately so that Australians can have access to high-quality food that is managed in a sustainable and appropriate way. Obviously this is what bioregional plans seek to do. What we do not want is unilateral decision making by ministers that are captured by those at either end of spectrums and philosophies.


When is the Gillard Labor government going to get it into its head that a nation that cannot feed itself is at the mercy of others whose interest in us may not be as benign as getting a good price for its exports and whose quality controls on their food production may be not be of a standard that Australians expect? I thank Senator Waters for the comments she made during her contribution about the Greens being very keen for and supportive of compensation measures for the industry regarding any adverse impacts—particularly as it is obviously a philosophy of the Greens to have some conversation about compensation measures for communities right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin for whom there will be a socioeconomic impact because of the 7,600 gigs they want to take out that system and the flow-on effects of that policy. I really look forward to sitting down with Senator Waters and discussing what sorts of compensation measures the Greens would be interested in supporting, given that the 7,600 gigs they want to take out of those commu­nities will absolutely devastate regional communities right throughout the basin and the economic basis on which they have been built. I will put a call in, I guess.


The coalition believes there is a need for conservation of our important marine biology, but future decisions on marine protected areas should consider peer-reviewed scientific evidence on threats to biodiversity before great swathes of ocean are locked up for all eternity. This bill is the opportunity for parliament to add a vital democratic check to the process, a process that has the potential to adversely affect the livelihood and future of millions of Austra­lians. So I support this bill. The declaration of bioregional plans in marine protected areas has significant environmental and socioeconomic consequences right through­out these communities that reside along our coast and indeed for our markets, our fishmongers and our small businesses in our capital cities and right throughout our nation. They should be given a chance to have their say in both houses of parliament on any decisions that will adversely affect them. It is therefore inappropriate for these declarations to be made without the opportunity for review. As a conservative, I abhor concen­trated power—hence, I am a senator—and I look forward to supporting this bill and I thank Senator Colbeck for bringing it before the Senate.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (10:51):  I am very pleased to rise and supp­ort my colleague Senator Colbeck and others who have spoken in relation to this matter, including Senator Boswell, in whom there is some considerable passion. Today I want to put on the record some of the background to the coalition's approach to this. I know that Senator Colbeck and others have already said it but I want to repeat that we support a balanced approach to marine conservation. It was our policy in the 2010 election, and we stand by that. But what is at the nub of this bill, which is being driven by Senator Colbeck, is the lack of consultation with those who have a legitimate interest in current marine parks or in the declaration of further marine parks. I am sure that many honourable members will remember the debacle of the mako shark issue, where fishers throughout the country rose up against a decision to ban the fishing of mako sharks. There was no consultation. At Torquay in the seat of Corangamite there were some 700 people at a public meeting complaining about mako shark fishing being banned. Of course, the local member was nowhere to be seen, but that is not unusual when it comes to the member for Coranga­mite; he would never dare to be seen when there are issues.


At the heart of this conservation debate is a lack of acknowledgement that the real conservationists in this country are the fishers, shooters and others. Anyone who knows anything about these areas and who speaks to and has grown up with the fishers and the shooters knows they are the true conservationists. These are the people whose sporting and recreational avenues are determined by the amount of fish and other species that are available to be taken. They actually own the conservation of this and have done for decades. Look at organisations such as Field and Game. Look at other fishing organisations. They are about conservation. For quite obvious reasons they want to preserve the species that they are shooting and hunting—if they are not there then their sport goes. They are the true conservationists in this country. They are never given appropriate credit for it, and they should be.


What these people want is consultation. The past process with marine parks has been completely bastardised by this lack of appropriate consultation. These people know when they enter these discussions that the decisions have virtually been made. They know that when they enter these discussions their voice will be heard but almost certainly will not be acted upon; and, on occasions, they cannot even get it heard. This bill is about enabling this parliament, when there has been that lack of consultation, to take on behalf of those people the right to make a decision about whether there has been appropriate consultation and whether, indeed, we should move to address it if there has not been.


I will very quickly read from the bills digest:


This Bill seeks to amend the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) to require that declarations of new Bioregional Plans1 and Commonwealth Reserves2 be disallowable by either chamber of Parliament.


…   …   …


Currently, Bioregional Plans are not legislative instruments and are not subject to parliamentary disallowance. The effect of this amendment would mean that they would continue not to be legislative instruments. However, they would be disallowable under Part 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 as modified by section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Common­wealth Reserves are legislative instruments which are not currently disallowable.


If these people—this nation's true conserva­tionists—are not being appropriately consulted then they should be. That is why I fully support Senator Colbeck's bill and fully support the comments made by others, including Senator Boswell.


The interesting part of this whole debate on marine parks is that we get the most extraordinary comments from some of those on the other side. Senator Marshall, who has been in his office listening, is down here immediately to make some comments. I think he knows what I am going to talk about. There are, of course, some on the other side who believe that we will have increased marine national parks through global warming. They might not be declared at this stage, but the member for Coranga­mite thinks that global warming will inundate massive areas of his home electorate. This is part of his defence of the carbon tax. It beggars belief that this man is actually allowed to be a federal member of parliament. On 17 August 2011—




Senator Marshall:
  Tell us about your candidate!




Senator RONALDSON:
  When the preselection is settled, I would be happy to talk to you about it. I am sure you and I will talk about it ad nauseam at airport lounges when we discuss what is likely to happen to the man whom you are so passionately defending—which I can never really understand, I have to say. Anyway. I am sure it is a faction based thing, because you have absolutely nothing in common. I have some regard for your intellect, for starters! That is the one clear difference between the two of you. But anyway. As I say, if you want to talk about preselection candidates, I am happy to engage in that later on.


Interestingly, Mr Cheeseman gave a speech on 9 September 2009 in relation to rising sea levels but posted on his website in March 2010 the speech that he was not allowed to give. Presumably he would requ­est that the rising sea be made a marine park. He posted this speech on his website. It was not the speech that he actually gave. It said:


The Great Ocean Road Mr Speaker, an icon of Australia and the engine room of our local tourism economy, will be largely destroyed.


It will be breached in place after place, if sea level rise is as expected.


Huge swathes of the Bellarine Peninsula will be inundated.


Current areas of the mainland will be cut off and become islands.


Queenscliffe will become an island.


The area from Barwon Heads to Breamlea will become an island.


What drives this man? This is all in defence of Labor's toxic carbon tax. I want to talk about that carbon tax and, indeed, rising sea levels and the requirement, presumably from the Labor Party's point of view, for more marine parks to take in this massive inunda­tion of what is currently land. I presume that will form part of the discussions in relation to the act at some stage further down the track. What was very interesting indeed was to look at the view of the people of Geelong in a recent survey of some 800 people. In that survey the people of Geelong made it quite clear that they do not and will not accept Labor's toxic carbon tax.


This was the outcome of their voting intention in relation to the carbon tax. I should throw this in because it is probably of some interest to honourable senators as well. The question was: is the federal government doing a good job? What do my colleagues think? Would 10, 15 or 20 per cent be the 'strongly agree' figure? No, it was not; 1.6 per cent of people in Geelong strongly agree that the Labor government is doing a good job. Neither agree nor disagree: 29.5 per cent; disagree: 29.9 per cent; strongly disagree: 25.1 per cent of people in the Geelong region. In relation to the carbon tax, the question was: do you support or reject the general concept of a carbon tax? Support: 22.9 per cent; reject: 53.5 per cent of the 800 people surveyed.




Senator Birmingham:
  They deserve a say.




Senator RONALDSON:
  They deserve a say, as Senator Birmingham said, as do those who will be potentially impacted upon by marine parks. That is why this parliament, as a result of this bill, must maintain the ability to represent their interests.


The local member for Corangamite thinks that we are going to be inundated. I notice that last year he commissioned a report into sea levels. Again, it was doom and gloom. It is almost approaching religious fervour, I have to say. I presume he is out there build­ing the boat as we speak to at least get some people from Corangamite onto the boat when it all floods. I have not yet seen the report. Maybe it has been released. If it has been, I apologise to the member for Corangamite. But apparently he commission­ed a report and gave some interim findings in September last year, but I do not think the report has been released. If it has been, again I will humbly apologise to the honourable member.


I have been talking at length about the matter before the chamber today and I will continue to do so. We have an incredibly proud history in relation to legislative protection of the environment in this country. In fact, in any reasonable assessment of who drove strong environmental protection measures in this country, it has indeed been the coalition parties. We are as committed to that today as we were when we first started this process, and we are committed to returning balance and fairness to marine conservation. Like anything else in this country, if you do not approach an issue such as this on the basis of balance and fairness, then there will never be appropriate outcomes. When these issues are hijacked by fringe groups, often associated with the Australian Greens or under the banner of the Australian Greens—but they are fringe groups nonetheless—and they take owner­ship of these issues, then we get the sorts of outcomes that I know others opposite sitting in the chamber today know are not appro­priate outcomes. There is the great state of Tasmania, where Senator Colbeck and Labor senators come from, and I hope that they are also committed to fairness and balance in relation to these debates. On that basis, they should be supporting this bill.


One of our greatest responsibilities in this country is to make sure that those who have a voice are able to have that voice heard. One of the great challenges in this country is to ensure that, in relation to this particular area, it is not the radical green fringe groups who drive the debate but the honest Australian men and women who are pursu­ing their recreational interests. They need to have the opportunity for some input into this decision-making process. They should not be confronted with a fait accompli when they go through the consultation process. That is their complaint: they arrive and the decision has already been made; their view on these matters is not wanted and most certainly not listened to. What causes me enormous concern about this is that at the moment we have a government that is completely paralysed. The only consultation that is taking place is consultation between the factions about who is going to lead the country. So we have people involved in marine parks out there looking for the opportunity to have some input and appro­priate consultation, but the only consultation this government is involved in at the moment is, indeed, who is going to lead the party.


We know that one of those opposite is actively involved in those discussions—a very significant player; a man of incredible power in this country. But I say to him and others opposite: let us stop worrying about who is going to be the Prime Minister and let us start worrying about the sorts of issues that have been raised by Senator Colbeck in relation to the lack of consultation. We see what has happened recently with the loss of manufacturing jobs. We see the risk to Alcoa workers in places like Geelong and we see two members down there refuse to do anything to support them because they know, and I know, and everyone in this chamber knows, that this toxic carbon tax is going to kill manufacturing jobs in places like Geelong. Where are the absentee members in defence of those workers? What the Alcoa workers want and what every other manu­facturing worker in this country wants is for Mr Rudd and Prime Minister Gillard to stop worrying about their own jobs and start worrying about the manufacturing jobs. That is what the Australian people want, that is what the Australian people demand and that is what the Australian people deserve. Do not worry about the Prime Minister's job; worry about the jobs of average working Australians, many of whom fish, many of whom shoot and many of whom want to have their voices heard in relation to these marine parks.


That is the great challenge for those opposite. Their great challenge is to stop talking about those things in which the Australian public has no interest, like the job of the Prime Minister, and start worrying about the jobs of these manufacturing workers. Start acknowledging once and for all that this toxic carbon tax is going to destroy this country. It is already under enormous pressure from the high dollar. There are a lot of external factors, which I acknowledge have an influence in this, but the one thing, the one pivotal government decision which can turn around perceptions in head offices around the world, including the Alcoa head office, is to drop this carbon tax. If the Labor Party and the Prime Minister sent out a clear message that this carbon tax is going to go because it will destroy jobs then we will start to see investment again. We will start to see the Alcoas of this world say there is some hope for manufacturing in this country. At the moment they are not, and the boardrooms around the world are looking at what we are doing and they are saying: 'Have they completely and utterly lost their minds? Are they stark raving mad to introduce a tax ahead of the rest of the world which will destroy Australian jobs?'


Make no mistake about it: there is one party, one coalition in this country that is concerned about the jobs of blue-collar workers, and that is the coalition. We will fight to defend their jobs. We will fight to defend their right to pursue their recreational pursuits without unnecessary interference from government. We will defend their rights to fish and shoot. We will defend their rights to have consultation on marine parks. We will stand up for them, which I can tell you is a far cry from what is happening with the Australian Labor Party, this Prime Minister and Mr Rudd at the present time.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (11:10):  I too rise to support Senator Colbeck's bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011. In so doing, I ask myself why those opposite are so against this legislation. Why are they opposed to greater scrutiny of marine bioregional plans and the declaration of marine parks in Commonwealth waters?


Senator Colbeck's bill, which proposes an amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, will make bioregional plans disallowable instru­ments. The reason we are here debating this today is in direct response to what has been another bungle by the Australian Labor Party, this time in relation to the marine bioregional planning process to date.


Why should this surprise us? This government has had a litany of bungles. We have seen the pink batts—they cannot put fluffy stuff in people's roofs without people dying as a consequence. We have seen the bungling of the Julia Gillard memorial halls. Health has been one unmitigated disaster after another, which I have—




Senator Polley:
  A bit like when Tony Abbott was minister.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  No, that is not true, Senator Polley, and you know it. The research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that that is not the case. You know it, and every time that you raise that you are lying to this chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! You will withdraw that, Senator Fierravanti-Wells.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I will withdraw that. And every time—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fierravanti-Wells!




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  I withdraw my comment.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. I also ask you to direct your comments through the chair.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Every time those opposite raise that misrepresentation they know it is not true. I have repeatedly quoted chapter and verse in this chamber from the research from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  You know it is not true, so do not keep repeating the same old drivel and babble, Senator Polley.


Now we shall return to the matter before us, which is the bungling of the marine bioregional planning process to date. Senator Colbeck's legislation introduces an amend­ment that is a simple step to allow scrutiny by both houses of parliament, and to allow the opportunity to disallow a bioregional plan that does not adopt a balanced approach to marine conservation. The effect of this amendment would be to protect stakeholders and communities against the potential for a minister to make a distorted decision. We have seen plenty of those in the history of the Rudd and Gillard governments, and this would be another opportunity where there would be no scrutiny.


We are talking about a very large area for these proposed marine bioregional plans; it is huge. It is more than seven million kilome­tres. Under the present arrangement the sole authority with the ability to sign off on these plans is the Minister for Sustaina­bility, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, so long as he remains the minister. Of course, the reason for this angst and what has been clearly obvious from the many submissions that have been provided to the Senate committee inquiry in relation to this is precisely this lack of transparency and the consequences of this.


Now that we have this Greens-Australian Labor Party alliance, it is very clear who is pulling the strings in this process. It is very clear from the tenor of the Senate report that it is really the Greens pulling the strings here, and it was very clear from the report that was tabled that this is really about the Greens agenda. But I will come to the Greens agenda in a moment. One has only to look at the marine and coastal areas part of their policy released at the last federal election to see just how antifishing their manifesto is—and, of course, 'manifesto' is the appropriate word to use in relation to Greens policies because, as we heard from Senator Sinodinos and as we may hear again at other times, the Greens are the closest thing that we have in Australia to the remnants of the Communist Party. One has only to look at what they say in their manifesto about their antifishing stance. Their primary concern is purely in relation to conservation and protection. It is not about balancing the interests of conservation and the interests of the users such as the fishers. It is only one-sided, and it is there. It is reduction in fishing. It is reduction in habitat damage from commercial and recreational fishing and other marine activities. That is what the focus of the Greens agenda is here, and that is why the coalition is seeking this amendment, because this is what this is all about. This is all about another give to the Greens and another payback for the Greens-Australian Labor Party alliance.


I look now to the practical effect of this. At the last federal election, one of the most lasting images for me was the number of bumper stickers, particularly in New South Wales, that said, 'I fish and I vote.' This was an issue that created angst up and down the coast in New South Wales—and I speak most particularly about New South Wales even though that angst was shared right around Australia. It was a huge issue last year. Let me just take two areas in particular. I will focus on two seats, Cowper and Paterson. The member for the federal seat of Cowper, Mr Hartsuyker, tabled a petition of 10,000 signatures on 23 May last year. This petition from concerned residents was about their real and heartfelt concerns over the government's plan to prevent commercial and recreational fishing in waters off the New South Wales North Coast. In tabling the petition, Mr Hartsuyker drew the attention of the other place to the devastating impact that a reduction in fishing will have on tourism and local economies. I would just like to refer to a couple of points that he made. One is that, if anyone had any doubts whatsoever about how important fishing is to the tourism industry, 55 per cent of the people who signed this petition were from outside his electorate. This was despite the fact that the petition was distributed only within the Cowper electorate. It goes to show just how important fishing is to the local tourism industry. Of course, the last election was against the background, particularly in New South Wales, of the damage that recreational and commercial fishers have already sustain­ed as a consequence of the New South Wales Labor deal with the Greens, which saw large areas of state marine parks made into no-go fishing zones. So naturally, again, the fishing industry—the recreational and commercial fishers—are justifiably concerned about the impact that this legislation will have on them.


I now move to another area, the federal seat of Paterson. Constituents in Mr Baldwin's electorate—he is the member for Paterson—have made contact with his office in relation to this. Senator Ronaldson was talking about meetings in Corangamite. The member for Paterson also had meetings with hundreds of angry fishermen, both commer­cial and recreational, regarding Labor's lack of consultation on the marine park process. Their concerns were very clear. For example, there were two meetings, at Forster and Shoal Bay, which were hosted by Mr Baldwin and Senator Colbeck, which more than 400 people attended, the majority of whom were furious over Labor's lack of con­sultation. So this is really about consultation.


I have also become aware that this matter will naturally result in financial and economic loss, and it will not be surprising if this whole process leads to some legal issues being raised regarding not only the lack of consultation but the effect on rights and the commercial consequences of this. It would not surprise me to see legal matters being raised and pursued against the Common­wealth to this effect.


Let us have a look at some of the issues that were raised in the submissions to the Senate committee inquiry. One was from the Australian Fishing Trade Association:


AFTA asks that you also consider the social impacts, the health and wellbeing benefits of recreational fishing and the financial ramifications to the many small businesses that depend on the investment provided to their businesses by recreational fishers. Many regional and coastal towns are dependent on recreational fishers for their financial existence.


This is clearly not a matter that the Australian Labor Party or their Greens alliance partners are concerned about.


There are two other interesting points I would like to highlight from that submission. One was about the science surrounding bioregional planning. The submission made it very clear:


To date no briefing regarding the science being used with Bio Regional Planning has been transparently tabled to stake holders. Thus no comment from stake holders has been achieved.


This vacuum of information has not been helpful in any understanding of current process, future process or past process.


What does that tell you? As usual, this is a government that, quite frankly, does not know what it is doing. That is not surprising: it does not really know what it is doing on a whole range of areas; why would it know what it is doing in relation to bioregional planning? The submission goes on to say:


No Socio economic information regarding communities that may be affected by the Bio Regional Planning process has been made available to Stake holders.


Surprise, surprise!


I go to another submission, by the Australia Marine Engine Council, which made some very interesting comments, most explicitly about the adverse financial implications of this legislation and its surrounding measures. As I said earlier, the total bioregional zones cover an area of seven million square kilometres. The total bioregional zones are equivalent to 92 per cent of Australia's landmass and the zones under current consideration are 70 per cent of the size of Australia. These implications were raised by the Australia Marine Engine Council:


Australia has the third largest fishing zone in the world covering an area of about 9 million klm2.


The commercial fishing industry is the nation's fifth largest primary industry with a value of $1.6 billion each year.


Australia's catches are relatively small by world standards


The total catch in Australian waters is only a small fraction of the catch taken in other fishing nations.


The key financial implications that this and other submissions have raised as needing to be considered are the costs to commercial and recreational fishing. Fishing is the only activity banned in all marine parks. I repeat: fishing is the only activity banned in all marine parks. As the Marine Engine Council points out in its submission, boating is not banned; tourism is not banned; diving is not banned; snorkelling is not banned; human entry is not banned; walking on coral is not banned; anchoring on coral is not banned; commercial shipping is not banned; oil tankers are not banned or restricted in all marine parks.


As the submission points out:


Marine Park Authorities frequently use the term “fully protected” but marine parks do not fully protect marine life.


This ban on fishing is the only protection which the council argues is being afforded to marine reserves. What are the hidden costs to Australians? The submission goes on to talk about some of these hidden costs to Australians. It states:


Bans on commercial fishing have a direct and measurable financial effect. Traditionally Commercial Fishers are compensated by a buyout of fishing licences and permits. Commercial fishermen then sell their boats and other assets or more commonly buy a licence in a different area, and so commercial fishing is frequently displaced rather than removed.


What, then, is the effect on the Australian consumer? The submission clearly points out:


Australian consumers however are not compensated and do not so readily 'move on'. Despite our huge coastline relative to our population, in 2007‐2008 Australia became a net importer of fisheries products, both in terms of volume and in terms of value. Australia is now a net importer of seafood. We import more than we export.


What does that mean in practical terms to our consumers? It means that we are buying imported fish, sometimes, as this submission says, of debatable quality, and it talks about some of those varieties. What does all this come down to? It not only comes down to this government being averse to proper scrutiny by this parliament but also means that we will not and cannot have a balanced approach to marine conservation.


The coalition has a very good record in this area. In his speech, Senator Colbeck outlined the very good history that coalition governments have had in this area. The coalition started the process of establishing comprehensive marine bioregional plans, which include determination of marine protected areas around Australia's coastline. As part of that process, we engaged, and rightly so, in extensive and cooperative consultation before marine protected areas were declared. This consultation ensured that an appropriate balance was struck between protecting our marine biodiversity and minimising the social and economic impact on fishers, businesses and coastal commu­nities, some of which I have raised in my speech today. Overall, it was a process that would achieve better outcomes for everyone. The final result would have been a greater protected area with less impact on industry. The history of the coalition government, including its record of consultation, is traversed also in the dissenting report of the coalition senators. In contrast, the Gillard government does not have a track record of effective consultation. For example, in my own shadow portfolio of mental health we have recently seen the government having to backflip in yet another area. They arbitrarily cut visits to psychologists for people with severe mental illness. There was no consult­ation whatsoever, and then the minister had to do a backflip. Minister Roxon did some­thing similar with the social workers and the occupational therapists—going in there with no consultation and making the arbitrary decision, saying 'if this is what the Greens want, we will do it' and forgetting the impact on patients. In this case the impact on the recreational and commercial fishers is forgotten; but the coalition is committed to returning balance and fairness to marine conservation. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (11:30):  I rise to support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Bioregional Plans) Bill 2011, which was introduced, Mr Deputy President, by our state colleague Senator the Hon. Richard Colbeck. I note that 75 percent of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team is in the chamber to support Senator Colbeck's very well thought out legislation. There is no doubt that Senator Colbeck, in his role as the shadow spokesman on fisheries, has taken a very consultative approach to his portfolio. This approach is being hailed by both the professional and the amateur fishing sectors. The fishing sector tells me that this approach is in stark contrast to that which the ALP-Green alliance government is trying to inflict upon the people of Australia with its so-called marine bioregional plans. Senator Colbeck seeks to consult rather than to dictate to the fishing sector. That comes through loud and clear to me when I have discussions with the fishing sector. They tell me that he listens rather than hectors. This is another lesson that the Australian Labor Party and their Greens partners in the alliance might learn from Senator Colbeck.


The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that any marine protected areas or biore­gional plans which have genuine and significant economic, environmental and social impacts be instruments reviewable by this parliament. Labor has deliberately sought to ensure that any decision they make is beyond the reach of the parliament. They want it to be the case that, simply by the signature of the minister, these so-called plans and protected areas come into force without their being subject to review by the parliament. What arrogance this is—what hubris! Why are they doing this? They are doing it because the plan and the protected areas are to be dictated to them by the Australian Greens. We all know that this is just another example of the green tail wagging the Labor dog. You can have these marine protected areas if you apply common sense. The coalition accepts and acknowled­ges that it makes sense. Indeed, in his second reading speech introducing the bill, Senator Colebeck set out in very great detail the coalition's proud history of marine protect­ion. The vital ingredient that stood out in Senator Colbeck's recounting of the coali­tion's history in this area, in contrast to the propositions of the ALP on marine protection, was balance. The coalition had balance, which Labor of its own accord—let alone with the influence that the Australian Greens have on everything this government seeks to do—is simply unable to achieve.


There is a marine park in the south-east area of Australia around Tasmania. I recall it well because I was the federal Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation at the time of its establishment, and I remember the consultations I had with Senator Colbeck and other members of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team as we developed that protected area. I was very pleased that at the end of the day we had the sign-off of the conservation movement, the recreational fishers and the professional fishers—we got the balance right. It took time and it took consultation; it also meant applying the science. I pay great tribute to TAFI, the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, which is so ably led by Professor Colin Buxton, for their wonderful work in getting the science in amongst the environmental mantra. When you get that balance right, you can in fact satisfy everybody. I recall some of the battles we had, which were necessary because other­wise the fishing industry and recreational fishing would have been hurt badly. Let us underestimate neither the importance of fishing, both professional and recreational, to the communities all around our coastlines nor indeed the importance of fishing as a social and recreational activity—the opportu­nities to bond with family and friends—to people who live in the cities and suburbs who are willing to travel great distances to enjoy the great Australian outdoors. It is a great Australian pastime, and it should not be hindered by artificial marine parks which serve no genuine environmental purpose and in fact cause great economic damage.


I still remember that certain people were suggesting that the zoned-off areas in the Tasmanian marine park be close to shore and that fishermen only be allowed to catch fish 200 kilometres, or whatever it was, offshore. The very sensible suggestion was made: why would you want the fishermen to have to burn fossil fuels to get 200 kilometres out; why do you not have the biomarine protected area at the 200-kilometre zone and allow the fishers to fish in the area that is closer to shore? It makes economic sense for exactly the same environmental outcome. They are the sorts of things we were able to achieve. Indeed, in one of the areas just off the east coast of Tasmania, there was to be a protected area in which recreational fishers had a longstanding tradition of conducting competitions. When I asked about the purpose of the marine protected area in this particular case, we were told it was for its benthic values. That was a term I learned at the time. I did not know what it meant, but it is the sea floor. I said, 'If we are concerned about the benthic values, the sea floor values, what is the matter with recreational fishing boats floating across the top trawling for fish if their hooks et cetera do not even touch the bottom of the sea floor?' We were able to make that compromise to allow recreational fishing to continue. 


It is that sort of balance and consultation that Senator Colbeck brings to this place with his bill. It is worth while doing and doing properly. But the problem is that if you give in to the Green mantra you do not want to consult. That is why the government does not want consultation and does not want parliamentary review, because the extreme nature of the way the Australian Greens are dictating policy to this Labor government would be exposed.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  We finally have a Greens senator expressing some interest in this bill by coming into the chamber, which I welcome. It is very interesting that wild sea fisheries have to be sustainable and, of course, in being sustainable there is a limit to the catch. So what does one do? It would make sense, would it not, to start engaging in fish farming? Fish farming is an activity that we do in Tasmania exceptionally well. It is world renowned, a growth industry, a value-add industry, a job-creating industry and an export-earning-dollars industry. It is great for our economy. Fish is an essential ingredient for a human balanced diet and the scientific evidence is there, that if you can eat more fish the healthier you will be. But there is pressure on wild sea fisheries; so, if the human race wants to eat more fish, we have to start farming them. 


But what do the Australian Greens do in my home state of Tasmania? They seek to oppose every new fish farm and the extension of every fish farm. This is the closed-for-business approach of the Australian Greens. Sure, on their salaries as senators or whatever else they might do, they might be able to afford a higher price for fish, but there are many people in the community that do want to consume fish. They know that there is a limit in the wild seas and that is why fish farming is so important—something we do so exception­ally well in Tasmania but something that the Australian Greens in Tasmania utterly oppose. The hapless government of Ms Giddings is paralysed to do anything about it and, as a result, the closed sign is up all over Tasmania, not only in the forestry area but also in the fisheries area and in the property development area. Those of us who live in Tasmania know the consequences of having a Greens-Labor alliance government stifling everything, and that has now been translated into Canberra as well, courtesy of the 2010 election and the dastardly deals that Ms Gillard did with the Australian Greens and some Independents. 


Part of that deal was to ensure the suprem­acy of parliament. It was to ensure openness, accountability and transparency. If the Greens believe in all those values they wrote into their agreement—as did the Independ­ents in the other place—with Ms Gillard, I simply ask: where is the openness? Where is the transparency? Where is the accountabili­ty in relation to marine parks? Why do you want to put it beyond the reach of this parliament to investigate and vote upon? 


If you are so confident that these marine parks are so good and wonderful, surely the logic and the scientific rigour of their assess­ments would convince every parliamentarian that they were a good thing—good for the community, good for the long-term wild sea fisheries et cetera. But, no, Labor and the Greens know that the task they have embarked upon is such that they do not want that sort of transparency or accountability, because they are scared of what it would reveal about their extreme agenda. Make no mistake: we are not just talking about lines on maps in relation to these marine parks; we are talking about the livelihoods of regional communities, we are talking about the livelihoods of small businesses and we are talking about the recreational activities of literally hundreds of thousands of Austra­lians all around the country. What we as a community can do and without doubt need to do is to live in harmony with nature, and we can do that. But one of the great problems that the Australian Greens have is they do not actually know where humankind fits in with nature. It is okay for seals to eat fish and for killer whales to eat seals, according to the Greens, but it seems that humankind is not allowed to catch fish for sustenance. That seems to be something that is very difficult for the Greens. They do not actually know where humankind fits into the scheme of things. That is their great dilemma. They nearly think that every human activity must of its nature be bad—and as a result they do not like fishing, they do not like forestry, they do not like plantations, and so the list goes on. In their comfort zones that is fine. But a lot of people actually do need the eco­nomic activity that is generated from fishing.


What we have shown is that we can have the economic activity combined with proper conservation for the maintenance of the species, and as a result we can enjoy the fruits of creation and enjoy that of which we are the stewards. We are not the preservers; we are the stewards. As we know, we cannot lock things up and expect them to be maintained exactly as they were at a given point in time, because things will change. In the forests there will be forest fires, or weeds or pigs or cats will get into them, so we need to manage them. It is the same with our seas, and if we manage them properly we can have them there for their rich biodiversity, and maintain it, and we can also have the richness that the seas provide to us in food, economic activity and recreational activity.


There is nothing wrong with that; these are all good, wholesome things. Indeed, fish are very good for you in our diet. We should be eating more of it—all the health special­ists tell us that. I thought the Greens were into alternative and preventative health, and can I say I am too. But one of the things you need for that is a bit of fish in your diet from time to time. Well, how do you do that if you want to close down the wild sea fisheries and you do not want to expand fish farms or to have fish farming? Where are we going to get our fish from? That is another one of the dilemmas the Greens have not answered.


I know there are some decent souls in this government but they are frustrated that they are locked into the alliance with the Austra­lian Greens. They should be taking stock of what this alliance means for them and their long-term supporters. The agenda of the Australian Greens, as reflected in the government's approach to this matter, is one that denies decent, hard workers from earn­ing a living and does not allow recreational activity, which is very important. That is why balance, the word I started off with, is so important. It is balance that Senator Colbeck is seeking to reintroduce into this debate with his well-thought-out bill, which is the result of the consultations he has undertaken. It is a bill based on common sense, not on the government Labor-Green alliance approach, which is built on hector­ing people and is the know-all, arrogant approach: 'We don't need the voice of the parliament and the input of the parliament in these matters. We will just make the decision and everybody else can go jump and live with the consequences of it.'


The bill that Senator Colbeck has worked on now for some time is an important bill that really does highlight and contrast the different approach that the coalition will take to government. That approach will be one of consulting and of getting the balance right, not of making policy at the behest of extreme environmental groups and at the behest of the Australian Greens. The sad thing is that I am sure the Labor voters and the coalition voters in this country are of a like mind on these issues. So we have to ask: how is it that, when 80 or 90 per cent of people are of a particular mind on an issue, the Greens seem to be able to dictate the policy? That is the matter of concern here, and that is something that we as the coalition are seeking to redress by this excellent bill.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (11:57):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum and have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.


The speech read as follows—


Once again this summer, the Japanese Government sent a whaling fleet to the Southern Ocean to hunt minke and fin whales for meat in an apparent breach of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.


While the Australian Government has a case pending in the International Court of Justice to examine Japan’s alleged breach of the convention, Japan continues to pursue its so-called “scientific whaling” hunt. 


But this year, the whalers went further than they had in past summers, entering Australia’s Whale Sanctuary, its territorial waters and World Heritage Area off Macquarie Island.


The whale sanctuary was created under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and prohibits all whaling activities in the waters up to 200 miles off the shore of Australia and its external territories.


The Australian Government was left sitting on its hands while the Japanese whaling vessels were in our waters, especially as it refused to despatch the Ocean Protector customs vessel which is tasked with the monitoring of illegal fishing in the Southern Ocean.


The presence of any whaling vessel in our whale sanctuary should be protested strongly and actively monitored to ensure the vessel does not attempt to illegally take whales and to emphasise Australia’s strong opposition to the practice.


To this end, I am introducing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Monitoring of Whaling) Bill 2012 (the Bill) to create an obligation on the Australian Government to monitor foreign whaling vessels that enter our whale sanctuary.


The Bill inserts the new section 236A“Monitoring foreign whaling vessels” into the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.


It requires the government to send a Commonwealth vessel to monitor any foreign whaling vessel that enters or nears the whale sanctuary.


The Environment Minister must then publicly release the observations of this vessel within 30 days of that monitoring beginning and within 30 days after its completion. 


A foreign vessel is already defined in the Act and for the purposes of this Bill a Commonwealth vessel includes any vessel that is owned, possessed or controlled by the Commonwealth or one of its agencies, excluding those used by the defence forces.


Australians expect their government to act strongly in response to illegal whaling. This Bill will ensure that other countries are left with no illusions about our commitment to ending commercial whaling across the globe.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

That there be laid on the table by 27 February 2012 by the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Senator Evans) any advice or documentation received by the Government regarding the cost of implementing $1 bet limits on poker machines, particularly in relation to the $1.5 billion figure referred to by the Minister in public comments.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (12:49):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator ARBIB:
  The government is, of course, happy to release departmental advice on the costs of the $1 maximum bets on poker machines when the appropriate review and consultations have been undertaken. Senator Xenophon has also written to the minister and submitted a freedom of information request to the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for the same material. These requests are being processed, and the department's independent FOI process has begun. As the advice includes materials from third parties, with possible commercial-in-confidence implications, they will also need to be consulted. It is right and proper that this consultation is conducted.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:50):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I note the minister's comments. I did put in a freedom of information request to the minister for details of what documents there are and on what basis the government says it will cost $1.5 billion to have machines made $1-bet-capable. I find it extraordinary that the minister says, 'Well, you're going through the FOI process; we don't need to do this.' I think this is a better process. The parliament and the Senate ought to order the production of documents. The coalition know my views, and we have yet to hear from them what they say about this particular motion. I understand they are opposing it at this stage, and I hope they can reconsider. I have consistently supported the opposition when they have sought production of documents on the minerals resource rent tax, for instance. I think it is the right thing to do in the order of transparency.


I think Senator Di Natale will make reference to the fact that in Victoria there has already been a change of machines from $10 to $5 per bet, and that was done with a minimum of fuss and a minimum of cost. So this order for the production of documents, I believe, has some urgency to it. It is important that we find out, in terms of the upcoming debate on poker machines, what the actual costs will be. I suspect the figure has been plucked out of thin air—or hot air—and I do not see what the problem is in providing these documents as a matter of urgency.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (12:51):  I also seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Given what we have just heard from the senator, I am not surprised that the government is reluctant to release details of the costings, particularly if those costings were made on the basis of third parties such as the poker machine industry. We know that $1 bet limits are the simplest, cheapest and most effective way of achieving poker machine reform. We also know that in Victoria, where a bet limit was introduced reducing the limit from $10 to $5, it was done with a minimum of fuss and with no outcry from the industry and no complaints—it was done very, very quietly. We also know that the proposal to reduce poker machine bet limits to $1 was costed independently by groups such as the Australia Institute and a number of academics at in the order of $200 million. That is wildly different to the government's costing of $1.5 billion.


This is important because the government has indicated that, when it comes to $1 bet limits, the only barrier to their implementa­tion was cost—not support in the parliament; cost. Given that cost is a major barrier, according to the government, to implement the most effective, simplest and, in our view, cheapest way to achieve reform in this area—reform that is supported by over 60 per cent of the Australian community—why shouldn't the Australian people get to see the basis on which that $1.5 billion figure was made? Why shouldn't this parliament get the opportunity to see on what basis those costings were made? If the senator is correct and those costings were made on the basis of third-party advice—that is, advice from the poker machine industry—I can understand why they would like to keep those costings under wraps.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  The question is that notice of motion No. 636, standing in the names of Senators Di Natale and Xenophon, be agreed to.

The speeches read as follows—



TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNIVERSAL SERVICE MANAGEMENT AGENCY BILL 2011


The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 is the cornerstone of a package that I am introducing today to achieve continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network. The other bills in the package are the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy Bill) 2011.


The regulatory arrangements for the universal service obligation (commonly known as the USO) were designed for a market where there was a vertically integrated operator of a national telecommunications network. Implementation of the Government's National Broadband Network policy will result in a fundamental change to the structure of the Australian telecommunications market as Telstra's near ubiquitous national copper fixed line network is progressively decommissioned as NBN Co rolls out its next generation fibre network.


We are moving to an environment where all retail service providers will be able to offer high quality voice and high-speed broadband services nationally using the National Broadband Network. It is appropriate that as we move to this new environment the model for delivering univer­sal service and other public policy telecommu­nications outcomes be reformed to facilitate the competitive supply of universal service and other public policy telecommu­nications outcomes. A regime that enables competitive supply arrange­ments will be of benefit to consumers and industry as it promotes more innovative, effective and efficient service delivery arrangements.


On 23 June 2011, the Government announced that it had entered into an agreement with Telstra to deliver universal service and other public interest services. As part of the reforms embodied in that agreement, the Government will establish a new agency, the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency to be known as TUSMA, which will manage the Telstra agreement and other contracts and grants (including the two existing contracts for the provision of the National Relay Service). TUSMA's remit is to ensure that all Australians continue to have reasonable access to universal service and other public interest telecommu­nications services.


The establishment of a statutory agency dedicated to the implementation and effective administration of telecommunications service agreements will promote high quality and efficient contract and grant management to maximise the benefit for consumers and manage risks appropriately, within a transparent and accountable legislative framework.


The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill establishes TUSMA and sets out the governance structure of the agency, including its functions and powers in contracting for public policy outcomes. It creates a rigorous transparency and accountability frame­work for TUSMA's activities, and also establishes arrangements for the collection of levies from the industry. 


The Bill provides that TUSMA will be established as a statutory agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, and its CEO and staff will be employed under the Public Service Act 1999. The day to day administration of TUSMA will be the responsibility of the CEO, but decisions that affect industry and consumers will be made by a Chair and other appointed members who together will have the right mix of skills and experience to fulfil TUSMA's statutory objectives.


TUSMA will, on behalf of the Common­wealth, be able to enter into and manage contracts or make and manage grants for financial assistance. These contracts and grants must address clear policy objectives based on the current legislated objectives for the standard telephone service and payphone components of the USO, the National Relay Service and the emergency call service, and also cover the provision of programs to support the continuity of supply of carriage services during the transition to the NBN. TUSMA will be required in performing its functions and exercising its powers to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the policy objectives are achieved.


The Bill provides for the Minister, by legislative instrument, to make standards, rules or benchmarks for the universal service components of the agreement with Telstra, and for future contracts and grants. Service providers with whom TUSMA has a contract will be required to comply with standards, rules or benchmarks.


The Bill includes transitional provisions to ensure that TUSMA is responsible and accounta­ble for managing the Telstra agreement and the existing National Relay Service agreements.


TUSMA's reporting obligations will be extensive – not only will TUSMA be subject to existing reporting requirements under the FMA Act, but it will have additional obligations including maintaining public registers of grants and contracts and obligations to report annually to the Government and the Parliament on the performance of contracts and grants. The transparency and accountability provisions are important protections that will enable scrutiny and evaluation of TUSMA's performance.


The Government will commit base funding to TUSMA of $50 million over the two financial years 2012-13 and 2013-14, and $100 million per annum after that. 


TUSMA's residual funding requirements will be met through a consolidated industry levy scheme which, from 1 July 2012, will replace the current USO and National Relay Service levies and also cover future funding for TUSMA's other responsibilities.


The accompanying Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 imposes an obligation on industry carriers to pay the levy. The Telecom­munications Universal Service Manage­ment Agency Bill covers arrangements for collecting the levy and determining liability.


The amount each telecommunications carrier has to pay towards the levy will be based, as is currently the case for the USO and NRS levies, on its eligible revenue as assessed by the Austra­lian Communications and Media Authority. The Australian Communications and Media Authority will remain responsible for collecting the levy and determining who must pay.


Transitional mechanisms are set out in the accompanying USO Reform Bill. The Government also made a commitment, when it announced the TUSMA arrangements in June this year, to review the levy arrangements and the need for any additional Budget funding, over and above the Government's committed base funding, during the course of the first two financial years of TUSMA's operation.


The Bill also provides for a review before 1 January 2018 of the Act, any legislative instruments made under the Act, and associated provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1997.


This is an important package of legislation. Together, the three Bills will provide certainty for all Australians that telecommunications consumer safeguards will continue to be delivered in the transition to the National Broadband Network, under transparent and accountable arrangements. The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 contains the key measures in these reforms, by establishing an independent body that will transition the industry from regulated obligations to a more flexible service provider model that will promote greater efficiency, transparency and competition in public policy delivery.


 


TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (UNIVERSAL SERVICE REFORM) BILL 2011


The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011 forms part of a package of legislation that I am introducing today to achieve continuity of key telecommunications safeguards in the transition to the National Broadband Network (NBN). The other bills in the package are the Telecommu­nications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011.


This Bill plays an important supporting role to the overall reforms for the delivery of telecommunications safeguards, which are largely set out in the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011. TUSMA will focus on managing the delivery of key telecommunications services under contracts or grants that the community expects will continue to be delivered effectively and efficiently. TUSMA will be accountable to the industry and to Government through extensive reporting arrangements. The residual costs of TUSMA that are not met from Budget funding will be met through a new Industry Levy Scheme based on current USO levy arrangements. The new levy will be imposed by the Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill.




TUSMA is expected to be operational by 1 July 2012 so it can take over responsibility for the Commonwealth
'
s agreement with Telstra to deliver universal service outcomes and other public interest services. The Government intends that there be an approximately two year period for concurrent operation of contract and regulatory requirements before phasing out USO regulation. Over time, the current regulated obligations to provide voice services and payphones will transition to a model that is similar to the current arrangements for the provision of the National Relay Service, in that the Commonwealth 
(through TUSMA) will contract with service providers for the supply of these important services, without imposing specific regulatory obligations.



This Bill amends the universal service regime in the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 so that within two years of commencement of TUSMA operations, the Minister must consider whether it is appropriate to remove the current regulated USO on Telstra to make the standard telephone service and payphones reasonably accessible, and shift to a fully contractual model for provision of universal service outcomes. 


The Government recognises the importance placed by many in the community on having access to basic voice services and payphones. Therefore the Bill provides that between 18 months and two years after the establishment of TUSMA, the Minister will be required to consider if Telstra:


has met relevant contractual and regulated obligations during the initial transitional period, and 


will be likely to substantially comply with its ongoing contractual requirements for provision of standard telephone services and payphones. 


The Minister will be required to separately consider the removal of the standard telephone service and payphone elements of current USO regulation. Each of these decisions will be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. In considering whether to lift USO regulation, the Minister will be required to obtain advice from both the TUSMA and from the communications regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, as to Telstra's record of compliance with its contractual and regulatory obligations for the standard telephone service and for payphones. The Minister will also be able to consider any other relevant matters.


If the Minister considers that there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place in relation to payphones, Telstra's regulated obliga­tions for payphones can then be removed across Australia. If the Minister considers that there are satisfactory contractual arrangements in place for the standard telephone service, Telstra's regulated USO obligations to supply the standard telephone service will be progressively removed in fibre areas as Telstra migrates customers from the Telstra copper network to the NBN fibre network in accordance with a final Migration Plan that has been approved by the ACCC. In areas where fibre is not being rolled out, and Telstra is not required to structurally separate, Telstra's regulated obligations to supply the standard telephone service will be removed. Linking the removal of USO regulation for the standard telephone service to the progressive NBN roll out in fibre areas and the migration of customers from Telstra's copper network to the NBN fibre network is consistent with the requirement that the package of Bills not commence operation unless Telstra is legally committed to implement structural separation.


If the conditions for regulatory removal are not met initially, the Bill provides the Minister with the power to defer consideration of whether regulation should be removed for an additional period of 18 months, with up to two such deferral declarations able to be made.


Removal of USO regulation in relation to the standard telephone service will not change the important safeguards (such as the Customer Service Guarantee) that apply to Telstra and all other providers of a standard telephone service.


The Bill makes a range of other transitional and consequential amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997 and the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The Bill also makes transitional amendments to provide for the phasing out of the USO and NRS Levies (respectively) after 30 June 2012 given the transition to a new Telecommunications Industry Levy Scheme. This Bill also includes conse­quential amendments to ensure that the ACMA, as the communications regulator, has the ability to effectively enforce the new levy arrangements. The details for the assessment and collection of the new Industry Levy are included in the Telecommunications Universal Service Manage­ment Agency Bill 2011.


This is an important package of legislation. Together, the three Bills will provide certainty for all Australians that telecommunications consumer safeguards will continue to be delivered in the transition to the National Broadband Network, under transparent and accountable arrangements. The Telecommunications Legislation Amend­ment (Universal Service Reform) Bill makes necessary transitional changes to support the establishment of an independent body that will take the industry away from regulated obligations to a more flexible service provider model that will promote greater efficiency, transparency and competition in public policy delivery.


 


TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INDUSTRY LEVY) BILL 2011


The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 is one of three bills that together will reform the delivery of universal service and other public interest services. The other bills in the package are the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Universal Service Reform) Bill 2011.


The Telecommunications (Industry Levy) Bill 2011 works with the provisions in the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, which set out a scheme for determining who must pay the levy, and for administering and enforcing that scheme. Under the Industry Levy Bill, if a person has a levy amount for an eligible levy period because of section 99 of the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill, then levy is imposed on that amount and a person is liable to pay the levy.


The persons who will have a levy amount are defined in the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill, and are telecommunications carriers or, if the Minister has made a legislative instrument to that effect, carriage service providers. Under the Telecom­munications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011, there is also provision for the Minister to exempt particular persons from being considered liable to pay levy. 


The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy recently established a $25 million eligible revenue threshold for levy contributions, and it is the Government's policy that this important red tape reform will continue under the new legislative arrangements.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:00):   My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the evaluation by the firm Hall and Partners Open Mind, relied upon in the ANAO audit of the multimillion-dollar carbon tax advertising campaign, which found that the effectiveness of the campaign was 'disappointing' and that: 'There was limited acceptance of key messages related to carbon pricing and household assistance.' Does the minister accept the findings of the independent evaluation upon which the ANAO report relied, that the $31½ million campaign is a disappointing failure?

Given that the minister has been prepared to inform the Senate of some of the conclusions of the ANAO report, can I ask the minister to direct her mind to that conclusion of the ANAO report—this is the ANAO report itself, not the consultant—which finds that the campaign:



… did not demonstrate consistent adherence to internal guidance, the FMA Act and FMA Regulations.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:01):  I am asked about the Audit Office report into the Clean Energy Future campa­ign. I am very pleased to respond on that report because that was a report that was invited by the Leader of the Opposition, who claimed the advertising was misleading, and the ANAO has confirmed a range of facts to which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, pointed when he was asserting the campaign was misleading. The Audit Office has confirmed that it is a fact that around 500 companies will be covered by the carbon price—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. The minister is required to be directly relevant to the question. The question was about a consultant's report upon which the ANAO report relied and specific findings by the consultant—not about the findings of the ANAO itself on other matters.




Senator Arbib:
  Mr President, on the point of order, Senator Wong is being directly relevant to the question. Senator Brandis might not like the answer, but she is being directly relevant.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The minister has one minute 22 remaining. I believe the minister is addressing the question. I am listening to the minister's answer closely, and the minister needs to come to the matter. 




Senator WONG:
  I can also confirm that the ANAO confirmed that a number of other statements that the opposition were complai­ning of were correct, including that the gove­rnment will use more than half the carbon price revenue to assist households and that nine out of 10 households will receive assist­ance through tax cuts, increased family bene­fits or higher pensions or other payments.


In relation to the effectiveness or other­wise of the campaign, I do not have any briefing on the specific quote in a consult­ant's report to the ANAO to which Senator Brandis is referring, but I would say this: the opposition made a range of claims that were inaccurate, asserting that the facts in the campaign were false, and Mr Abbott's allegations have been found to be untrue, have been found to not be correct.




Senator Conroy:
  In other words: liar, liar, pants on fire!




Senator WONG:
  I could take Senator Conroy's interjection, which is probably somewhat more pithy.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:04):  First, it is the case that the report identifies some concerns with processes adopted by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. This should not be confused with a conclusion that the campaign contained statements that were inaccurate. In fact, the report explicitly states:



While issues were identified with the sources cited by DCCEE for campaign statements, this did not mean that the statements themselves were wrong or could not be supported by other sources of information.



Isn't it interesting—the selective quoting of the opposition! I would remind those opposite: if you really care about transpar­ency and you really care about making sure campaigns are accurate, one would not have ever got that impression from the way Senator Abetz and Howard government ministers used to run government advertising when they were in government.

The PRESIDENT:  Order! There is no point of order, but comments should be directed to me in the chair.




Senator WONG:
  Mr President, what precious petals they are today! They do not like to be reminded of the hundreds of millions of dollars they spent telling Australians that reducing workers' wages and conditions was great for them. They do not like to be reminded of spending taxpayers' money to tell parents that it was great for them to have to go into work without notice, that it was great for them to have their wages and conditions reduced. The reality is—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, no part of this answer is directly relevant to anything other than the Howard government's Work Choices advertising campaign. There are only six seconds to go. You ought to conclude that the minister has defied your ruling.



The PRESIDENT:  The minister has six seconds remaining in which to address the question. Minister, I draw your attention to the question.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (14:10):  I thank Senator Bishop for the question. The Treasurer today in the House outlined the crisis in Europe and talked about the increas­ing financial market volatility, which is undermining global confidence and weaken­ing global growth prospects, with Europe now expected to fall into recession this year. This has obviously been reflected in the IMF's downgrades to global growth, which echoed our own midyear update last November. The fact is that no country is immune from the fallout from the troubles in Europe. 


Australians have every reason to be confident in our strong fundamentals, which make us better placed than most advanced economies to deal with global instability. We have an economy that is growing. There is solid growth, with the economy expected to grow at trend this year, over three per cent. We have low unemployment— almost half the rate seen in Europe—at 5.2 per cent. In the United States, it is 8.3 per cent. We have contained inflation. The cash rate is at 4.25 per cent, well below the rate left by John Howard and the coalition. We have an unprecedented investment pipeline, with $455 billion in resources alone. We have very low debt, peaking at 8.9 per cent compared to 92.9 per cent for advanced economies. Also, we have a AAA credit rating from all three rating agencies for the first time in our country's history. 


Because of this great strength, we are determined to ensure the budget gets back into surplus. We are working hard at it. We are holding real growth in spending to two per cent a year until the budget returns to surplus. At the same time, we are keeping taxation as a share of GDP below the level for 2007-08, when it was 23.5 per cent. We have provided savings to the budget over four years of $100 billion.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (14:13):  This is a Labor government that has put jobs at the forefront of its economic policy. When the global recession hit it was Labor who stood by workers to stimulate the economy. Infrastructure—that is what this government invested in. We have a record road budget. We have doubled the road budget. We are putting money into rail. It is something like 10 times the amount it was when we came into office. That is increasing the productive capacity of this country, keeping the construction sector going, keeping people employed, keeping apprentices employed. At the same time, we are working towards going back into the black next year, with a surplus. 


Compare this to the coalition. I have to say, Peter Costello must be shaking his head after yesterday, with the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, walking away from a budget surplus.

Mr Abbott has now made known his point which we already knew because Andrew Robb, the shadow finance minister, has also made that claim. At the same time, the coalition has walked away from tax cuts. There will be no tax cuts under the coalition in its first term.


This is a coalition that has given up on good economic management. As I said, Peter Costello and John Howard would be ashamed. This is a Liberal Party that is no longer committed to keeping the economy in the black. This is the modern Liberal Party. They will walk into this chamber and they will vote against small business tax cuts when the MRRT bills come through. That is the Liberal Party. (Time expired)

Yesterday was another very important day in the rollout of the National Broadband Network and, more importantly, for those Australians who will rely on the satellites to provide a level of service and a price that is affordable. Whilst the National Party has rolled over to the Liberal Party in supporting a project that Senators Joyce and Nash once claimed as their own, I am happy to report that none other than the National Farmers Federation have recognised what this announcement means for regional and remote communities. Mr Jock Laurie, the NFF president, responded to our announcements by not only welcoming it but coming out and saying that it was very positive. He said:


We welcome the commitment from the Government, and their acknowledgement that those who live in rural, regional and remote areas should not be disadvantaged when it comes to telecommunications.


The NFF believe that one of the keys to their success has been their commitment to presenting innovative and forward-looking solutions, and the Gillard government strongly believe that the NBN is indeed an innovative and forward-looking solution for the nation. I said it yesterday and I will say it again today: there is only one party that is committed to delivering and guaranteeing the same price for the same service regardless of whether you live in the city or the bush.

The coalition has now abandoned regional Australia. In responding to yesterday's announcement, Mr Turnbull suggested he would consider selling the satellites. Mr Turnbull also misled the Australian public by asserting that there was sufficient satellite capacity that we could either lease or upgrade. But NBN Co. is already using existing satellite capacity to provide an interim satellite service, an investment of $300 million through to 2015. This is only the first step, which is providing half the service speeds on the way to the reliable 12-meg down and one-meg up that everyone else in Australia will enjoy on the NBN. (Time expired)

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Brandis and Birmingham today relating to the carbon tax.


Surprise, surprise, shock horror! In trying to sell their great, big, new carbon tax to an unsuspecting and unwilling public, the government has failed to comply with its own financial management regulations. Do you believe that, Mr Deputy President? Well, they have. I understand that in one particular case tenders were open for 1½ hours. It does not sound to me like the Prime Minister's much lauded, 'Let the sun shine in,' and, 'Accountability is the foremost goal of this government,' assurances have been met. Not a very good start, I would say.


The Auditor-General also found that the campaign has not been very effective. There would not be anyone in our nation who is surprised to hear that. It is like trying to sell a dog's breakfast, yet it is a dog's breakfast that the Prime Minister said would never be served up to the Australian public, and it has not been successful.


Apparently, as the newspapers tell us, the campaign thus far has cost about $20 million and there is about another $10 million to spend. As you know, Mr Deputy President, I like to be helpful. I suspect it might assist the government not to spend the final $10 million and instead to put it into trying to pay off the budget deficit. That is what I would be doing with the extra $10 million. Of course, none of this money—the $20 million or the $10 million following—comes any­where near the cost to this country of the most expensive carbon tax in the world. The government's carbon tax will raise $7.7 billion in the first year, and that is at $23 per tonne of carbon. But, by 2014-15, it will cost $9.2 billion a year.


What do Labor love? Labour love three things: they love taxing, they love debt and they love the churn. You have heard me on debt before, Mr Deputy President. There has not been one federal Labor government since 1901 that has left government with more money in the kitty than there was when they came in. Since 1901, they have always put Australia further into debt. So Labor love taxing, they love debt and they love the churn. These are the three steps to social democracy. But social democracy has failed in western Europe, and it will fail in Australia.


Many mischievous arguments have been put in favour of the carbon tax. Perhaps the most mischievous—and the most pathetic—argument, which has been put by too many people in the Labor Party, including the minister and the Prime Minister, is this: irre­spective of whether other countries introduce a price on carbon, it is in Australia's interest to have one. I say that again—this lot says that, irrespective of whether any other count­ry on earth has a carbon tax, it is in our interest to have one. Who in this country except this lot believes that absolute rubbish? They believe that, even if no other country on earth prices carbon, it is in our interest to pay more money for energy and for our cost of living to go up. If it were such a sterling idea, don't you think that some other nation would have come up with this brilliant brainwave? They would all be running to do it before us. The United States, Canada, Brazil, Russia, India and China would all be running to do it before us; yet not one of them has done so. That is because they know that moving first in the world on carbon is a mistake. It is a mistake because it is against their national interest, just as it is against our national interest.


The greatest disgrace of this government is this: they want to be heroes overseas—to look good at the UN and elsewhere—and they are quite prepared to sell out Australia's national interest to do so. That makes me sick.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-02-09,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  Now that Senator Mason has taken his seat and stopped shouting through this chamber, as he has for the last five minutes, we can perhaps put some sense back into the debate and respond to some of the misleading statements he has just made, which are right in line with and follow on from the thinking of his leader, Mr Abbott, who has also been found to have misled the Australian people.


The ANAO report which has now been released has stated clearly that the govern­ment's advertisements were not misleading at all. Yet Mr Abbott has made a range of claims that they were inaccurate, and his allegations have now been found to be untrue. No wonder Senator Mason has to shout his way for five minutes through another diatribe of misleading information in this chamber—he is following his leader. Senator Mason loves misleading and lying to the Australian people on climate change, because we know that he does not believe in climate change. Senator Mason and his leader, Tony Abbott, are in denial of the fact that we need to act on climate change, which is exactly what the advertisements were all about.


Even though the ANAO report has identified that there were some concerns with the processes, we should not confuse this identification with a finding that the ads were inaccurate; as I said, the ANAO report found no such thing. The ads were not misleading, and I am startled by the hypocrisy of the opposition's talk about misleading people through government advertisements. We know full well that when they were in government the ads they aired to the Australian people were misleading—in fact, they were a complete hoax. They told Australian working people that having their wages and conditions reduced by Work Choices was going to make them better off. That is what you call misleading, not the government's ads, which have now been cleared and found certainly not to be misleading or inaccurate by the ANAO report. Yet Tony Abbott has continually claimed that they were. The Work Choices ads of the former Howard government were misleading to working Australian families. They suggested that the wages and condi­tions of working Australian families were under threat and proposed Work Choices as a solution. How dare the opposition come into this place and say that our ads were misleading when they clearly were not. They are the misleading opposition, and their leader, Mr Abbott, should apologise to the public servants involved for saying that the government's ads were inaccurate when they were not.


Clearly the opposition have lost the plot and completely given up, as Mr Mason showed us during his five minutes of shouting and screaming. They are the ones who are misleading the Australian people. They have lost the plot and given up. They have given up and we have only to look at the economic management side of their responsibilities to see exactly how they have given up. When it comes to economic management they have no real policies; no real costings—and now they have walked away from the surplus that they once said they would try to deliver; no real savings; no real bottom budget line—in fact they have a budget black hole of $70 billion; and no real leadership. What we have seen from Senator Mason in his response today to taking note of answers is another example of how he is continuing Mr Abbott's misleading claims which have now been proven to be unfounded by the ANAO report, which found that the factual statements in the government's clean energy future advertising campaign of last year were supported by evidence that shows the opposition have been dishonest and discredits Abbott's scare campaign on carbon pricing.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-02-09,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (15:23):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong to questions asked by Senators Brandis and Birmingham. The clean energy future package is a grubby and expensive exercise of Labor spin. It is the carbon tax that is going to make things worse for Australian workers, but the government is so bound by its agreement with the Greens and Independents to retain power that it had to pull off the carbon tax at any cost. The shouting that Senator Singh referred to as coming from Senator Mason could be more accurately described as outrage on behalf of the Australian people, Australian workers and taxpayers as a result of this government's economic management. 


Workers will pay with their jobs, especially workers in the regional areas. To add insult to injury, those same workers have paid through their taxes the $20 million it has taken to fund the advertising campaign mentioned in the report we have been speaking about. It is a double whack, from the front and the back. They were dudded by a government that cannot use the resources of the media to get its message out. Its good news on carbon tax ended up being no news for the Australian media. A case of no news is good news, maybe. So aware of its own incompetence of getting the good news out, it designed a $12 million advertising cam­paign, which was increased by another $8 million. That is $20 million. Senator Cash mentioned a lot of projects and programs that that $20 million could have been better spent on. Is it a reflection on the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Combet, that he is unable to sell the government's message, which he could not get across to the media at no cost to the Australian taxpayer apart from his time, to tell us the benefits of the carbon tax? Minister Combet issued numerous media releases in July extolling the details of the price on carbon, but that obviously was not considered enough. In fact, ministers were out and about all around the countryside spruiking. Any media conference that Minister Combet calls is usually very well attended, so it is not as if he was talking to walls. Why did the media not cotton onto the great news of the carbon tax and sell it to the Australian people?


The Gillard government, which normally prides itself on its ability to spin a good story, used the excuse it had limited time to convince the Australian people of the benefits of the carbon tax—limited time on a policy initiative that was in committee for months to decide on. It ran a tender process for a $2.7 million contract for 36 hours and then wanted quotes updated in just 90 minutes. We wonder whether Minister Combet consulted with the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, on the tender process. Glossy brochures and ads do not make good policy and there was a fraction too much fiction for the Auditor-General, Ian McPhee, who raised concerns in his report about key claims of the campaign that he was not able to find. I quote:


... a clear line of sight between 52 statements presented as fact in the campaign and the sources cited in the matrix to support those statements.


One instance may be considered careless, two reckless, but 52 indicates an endemic level of incompetence that washes through everything this government touches. Senator Wong decided to bring WorkChoices into her answer, but there are so many instances of where this toxic tax will cause distress to Australian workers, including regional workers. In fact, it will be the regions that are affected the most.


Today in my home state of Victoria there are reports that Alcoa is to review the future of its Port Henry aluminium smelter at Geelong. The Prime Minister may think it is disgusting for Mr Abbott to scaremonger about jobs, but it was the Managing Director of Alcoa, Alan Cransberg, who confirmed that the carbon tax would increase pressure on his company. He is quoted on page 1 of the Australian as saying:


Post July 1 we have obviously got another challenge to overcome and we're very keen on doing that.


The government may say the high dollar and low metal prices are affecting the company's decision processes, but as Victoria's largest consumer of electricity the Alcoa smelter is obviously going to be under increasing pressure come 1 July and is going to be looking at 600 jobs—that is, 600 regional Australians who will be affected by this government. 


The first point of a good financial manager is that you have to comply with financial regulations and the ANAO report found seven breaches of the government's own Financial Management Act. The second point is that you ensure you get bang for your buck. Being strategic and prudent about the spend, using accurate data, is something this government needs to start doing. (Time expired)

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:28):  When Labor came to office in 2007 we promised the Australian people that we would restore confidence to government advertising in this country. We pledged that government campaigns would be properly and independently reviewed, properly targeted, nonpolitical with the intention of informing the community about government policies and programs. We have delivered on that commitment. The proof is in the administration of government adverti­sing arrangements audit process. It proves that we have delivered on this commitment. But the question must be asked: why did Labor have to pledge this to the Australian people in the lead-up to the 2007 election? Why was this reform of government advertising and oversight required here in Australia? The answer is quite simple: because the Australian public had lost confidence in government advertising during the years of the Howard government. For proof of that we need look no further than the government advertising associated with the goods and services tax campaign and, particularly, the Howard government's shonky advertising associated with Work Choices, a $55 million waste of taxpayers' money. It was blatantly party political advertising used to soften up the public regarding the harshest elements of the total realisation of Work Choices.


Not only was this advertising associated with Work Choices blatantly party political; it was also wrong. Some of the information contained in those ads was completely wrong. There is no greater example of that than the fact that the ads associated with Australian workplace agreements claimed that workers could move onto Australian workplace agreements where they received 'fair' compensation from their employer. Having dealt with a number of Australian workplace agreements I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that the compensation was not fair at all. In fact, in many respects there was no compensation for forcing young workers in particular onto agreements that stripped away weekend penalty rates, shift allowances and other important leave entitlements. But those ads also claimed that if people had questions about moving onto Australian workplace agreements they could seek advice from an organisation called the 'workplace authority'. Everyone scratched their head and thought: what on earth is the workplace authority? Then it was discovered that there was no workplace authority at all and that the closest thing may have been the Office of the Employment Advocate.


But the greatest example of the Howard government's failure with respect to the Work Choices advertising campaign came in early August 2007, when the Howard government was actually forced to withdraw their own government advertising. Why? Because an actor who was playing a 'concerned father', concerned in this ad about the fact that his two sons might be forced onto Australian workplace agreements that cut conditions, had been accused by two young workers who had worked for him in his painting business of ripping them off. Life writ large in a Howard government ad! It said everything about Work Choices. Is there any wonder why that particular ad was withdrawn?


The government welcomes the ANAO report on its Clean Energy Future package. The report was tabled in parliament and it suggests that the government's transparency and accountability framework for campaign advertising is operating well. Again, we made the promise and we have delivered on that promise. The report finds:


Additional Treasury evidence supported the statement that more than 9 in 10 households (92 per cent) were estimated to receive some combination of assistance, lending support to the statement in the household mail-out.


That is, lending support to the statement that this household mail-out was true. The report also says:


The campaign did not contain any overt promotion of party political interests, party slogans or bias …


It is an independent report verifying that the government system of advertising is working. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:33):  Senator Singh's contribution to this debate was typical of the deceitful and dishonest approach by the Australian Labor Party to most things these days. Senator Singh claimed that this report of the ANAO criticised Mr Abbott. I challenge her, by way of interjection, to identify for me in the ANAO report where that had occurred. She could not do it because it did not happen, and it is typical of the deceit and dishonesty of the ALP to continue to verbal the Auditor-General on that particular aspect. Indeed, the Auditor-General's report clearly shows that the Labor Party has been caught at it again.


I will give some advice to the Labor Party. You can spend as much money as you like—it will never be your own, of course; it will be the taxpayers' money, because one thing the Labor Party is good at is spending someone else's money. But let me give you this advice: it does not matter how much money you throw at spin and deceit, it does not work on the Australian people. The Australian people are not mugs, in spite of what the Labor Party think of them. They know that this carbon tax is an absolute crock. Most Australians know, without a very expensive advertising campaign, that the climate of the world is changing and most of them understand that it has been changing for eons—for millions and millions of years. As I have always said, of course the climate is changing, and all Australians know that it has. But is it the fault of humans that this is happening? That, to me, is a question on which leading scientists every­where have different views.


On that point I just might mention that Mr Bill Kininmonth, who was a director of climate change in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and is a very distinguished Australian and a very distinguished person in the meteorological and climate area, is a recent signatory along with a dozen other very senior scientists in challenging the view on the human impact on climate change. I will ask Senator Wong at estimates which of those scientists she considers are the flat-earthers, as she so rudely and inaccurately called them at an estimates committee hearing a few years ago. I would like her to repeat to Mr Kininmonth and to some of his colleagues from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology her claim that he is a flat-earther. Mr Kininmonth is a far better scientist than Senator Wong will ever be a politician or a minister.


The Australian public know that this is a crock. They know that you cannot fix the troubles of the world by dealing with Australia's less than 1.4 per cent of emissions when nobody else in the world is doing anything serious about it. We have seen in the last couple of days reports in the papers that Chinese and American airlines are saying to the Europeans: 'We're not paying your carbon tax, because it is all rubbish.' But the Australian airlines have to pay it. How can they remain competitive? You have to look no further than to the aluminium industry difficulties that are happening now. How can Australian manufacturing compete with Chinese, American or, indeed, Euro­pean manufacturing when Australian manu­facturing is taxed enormously whereas these countries have no, in the case of the United States and China, or very low, in the case of Europe, carbon taxes.


That is why the Auditor-General was correct when he said that, whatever was spent, this advertising was completely ineffective. You cannot sell to the Australian people, people who are cleverer than the ALP gives them credit for, a proposition that they know is inherently wrong. There is nothing that the majority of Australians will accept out of the Labor Party's use of their money to try and brainwash them into a huge tax that is so typical of Labor. I commend the ANAO report and urge the government to do something about it. (Time expired)

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the Defence Security Authority vetting report.


This is a very, very important report. It is a report by the Inspector-General of Intelli­gence and Security commissioned by the Prime Minister. In March 2010, whistleblow­ers wrote to three government ministers through their local Labor member, the former member for Forde in Queensland. They set out a pattern of conduct in the granting and administration of security vetting that involved a number of things, including bullying and harassment. They also raised the issue of corrupted vetting practices.


Defence's response and the response of the members of parliament was to simply ignore them. But worse still the Defence report went on to treat them as if they were cranks in a most arrogant and offhand way. It was not until the Lateline program in May 2011 raised these issues that the whistleblowers were taken seriously and the Defence administrators and, indeed, those people higher up the chain were brought to any form of account to set out what had been going on. We now know that more than 20,000 security vettings have been compromised—that is, people who work in the Prime Minister's office, people who work with the Minister for Defence, people who guard bases. And let us not forget what happened with respect to the terrorism plot over Holsworthy. These compromised vettings include people who guard embassies, embassies that can be troubled in terms of their current and previous political histories. Defence Minister Smith says that he only heard about this in May 2011. I want him to clearly state that he did not have on his desk in any other shape or form any knowledge of this matter until that time. If he did, he is complicit in what is a shocking scandal of maladministration in a very important area that the public needs to have some confidence in as it goes to the government's credibility.


The Secretary of Defence, when this was raised with him in estimates, slapped it down, flicked it away and said that he was totally oblivious to the significance of the issue. He said on the record that a flaw in the data input did not necessarily lead to a flaw in the security clearance. We now know that the flaws in the clearances from Defence went all the way into the ASIO system. This department's maladministration not only corrupted its own processes but also, through the electronic transfer, corrupted the ASIO understanding and capacity to review who is who out there doing sensitive and important security based jobs. There are 5,000 top-secret security clearances that have been compromised. The simple question that we all must ask is: who is accountable? Who is responsible? There is nobody that this government has pointed to as being respon­sible. It is always a review, adverse findings and 'we'll fix it now'. Nobody is accountable. This is an absolute disgrace.


These whistleblowers were treated with contempt. They have now received the Inspector-General's report. The first line of that report is that there should be an ackno­wledgement that what the whistleblowers said from day one was true and correct. We owe them a debt of gratitude. The parliament owes these three brave people a great debt of gratitude for coming forward in the circum­stances. They were derided and treated as cranks. Indeed, when I first raised this issue in estimates I was told in no uncertain terms there were no workarounds; there were no compromised security vets. We now know that what I was told in estimates was completely and utterly wrong. If ever you want to see the smoking gun of a group of officials with no idea what had been going on, have a look at the questions and answers on this matter in the Senate estimates of last May. The evidence has been overwhelming that there has been endemic, entrenched maladministration.


But the point that I want to finish on is the inspector-general's report. It is damning, it is a scandal, it is a disgrace—but nobody is accountable. Not only have these three good citizens been treated appallingly but also nobody has been brought to account. This is the way this government bumbles and fumb­les and incompetently manages very import­ant and sensitive security matters in this country. It is an absolute art form in incom­petence. Of course, the minister says, 'Oh no, I know I did not know anything about it,' yet three of his colleagues were told 12 months before. I was told at Senate estimates, 'Oh no, Senator, you've got that wrong.'


The Prime Minister was asked to commission this report because these three might have been in breach of the law disclos­ing what they disclosed. The inspector-general has the power of a royal commis­sioner. The Prime Minister had to convene this review and, as I say, it is damning. The Black report that we have had in Defence recently says there is a crisis in accounta­bility in the Department of Defence. I must say I think it is going to improve with the new secretary and the CDF. But somebody, surely, must be accountable for this. This has cost a lot of money. People have been ignored in circumstances where alarm bells seriously should have gone off. This report makes fascinating reading as to a level of incompetence that is Olympic gold medal class. 


I seriously cannot believe that this is not front-page news on most newspapers. There are 5,000 top secret security vets that have been compromised. Several thousand of them have been worked through, but we are two or three or four years away from resolving what has gone on here. It beggars belief, and the minister was on television last night saying, 'Look, people have made mist­akes and we all bat on.' It is just appalling and it fits wholly and solely into the track record and the performance standards of this government. It is just a disgrace.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:48):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the ministerial statement on live animal exports.


I remember 8 June quite vividly. It was one of those moments that had a significant effect not only on the Territory but also on the cattle industry and on regional and rural Australia. We will always remember where we were when we heard the message from the Prime Minister that the live cattle trade to Indonesia was being ceased. The only person I saw nodding their head in support was the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Henderson, as he stood next to the Prime Minister.


We have moved on since then and we should have learnt a lot from that since it was not only the cessation of the trade but also the cessation of business in Indonesia. I was in Indonesia a very short time later. It was very distressing to walk around the markets and speak to the people who did business with Australia. They were very charitable and kind to me personally, but they were really quite miffed and they were looking for some explanation about what they had done to so offend us. They thought that perhaps there was something they did not understand about our culture that made us respond in this way and, out of the blue, put our foot on the throat of a vital supply of food to the people of Indonesia.


It has impacted on not only the relationships we have with business and with the people of Indonesia but also, most importantly, the relationship we have with the government of Indonesia. The govern­ment of Indonesia have responded in a number of ways, and I think they have responded quite correctly, as would any nation that suddenly had their food security threatened. It does not matter what you think about live cattle or what you think about animal welfare. The simple issue, from the perspective of the Indonesian government, is that they had so many people relying on a source of protein that had for many years been a constant supply. The trade had built up over time and Indonesia and Indonesians relied on it seasonally for protein. They also relied on it for jobs and for part of their economy, but it was absolutely essential and they could rely on it. The relationship with Indonesia now is such that they can no longer rely on it and they have responded. They have said, 'We now need to be independent.' You cannot blame them. They have to feed their people. They need to be completely independent of others, particu­larly the unreliable source that Australia sadly has become. We have gone from being a completely reliable country to a sovereign risk as far as Indonesia is concerned.


You wonder whether we have really learnt anything from that. The government has been through a bit of a hard trot. Every now and again you do get a bit of a slapping in this game and you get it completely and utterly wrong. We have already discussed in this place just how badly the government got it wrong and the impacts on animal production in Australia and the impacts on our relationship with Indonesia. 


The government then moved with all its wisdom to ensure that some of the animal welfare concerns extended to the Middle East. Of course, they are the sorts of things we should be doing. I accept the argument that this is not only about protecting animals but about protecting our industry, but you would have thought the government would have understood and learnt something from that. So, when we announced the supply chain assurance processes to go to the Middle East, one would have thought you would have ensured you did the only thing we did not do the first time around with the cattle debacle. The worst thing in Indonesia was that they were the last people to know. Nobody picked the phone up and rang Indonesia. So, in Minister Ludwig's office or in the Prime Minister's office, perhaps this is time for a 'note to self' on the fridge: 'Next time you are going to do something ugly with someone's trade, you should probably give them a ring.' It is pretty ABC stuff. But, sadly, that does not seem to have been the case.


When we were introducing the new supply chain assurance scheme, they did not really talk to people in the Middle East about it. So they now have to suddenly do a bit of an emergency trade mission over there to ensure that people have some understanding. The DAFF Middle East importers document actually says that there is no requirement for governments to undertake any action to implement the new arrangement. I mean, talk about offensive! It is a complete fallacy that, in the absence of government-to-government communications, you can implement a comprehensive and complex supply chain assurance scheme. It is difficult enough dealing with it in our own country, let alone over in the Middle East. It is simply lunacy to imagine that a supply chain assurance scheme can be effectively rolled out without the assistance of government. This level of misunderstanding almost beggars belief.


I know that the Greens are very keen, as I am, on ensuring that we successfully roll out mechanisms to ensure that people can eat Australian animal protein in a manner that is consistent with Australian standards and the way we wish those animals to be treated. But we are never going to get there unless we have a decent relationship with the countries we trade with. What we generally call 'the Middle East' is dozens of countries with vastly different cultures and vastly different circumstances in terms of infrastructure. This infrastructure is, most of the time, essential to the principles of animal handling. We need animal yards, but some people do not even have them. There are very different circumstances.


But, in the rolling out of this, there has been an assumption that you can put one rigid system into place, almost overnight, and somehow it is going to be implemented by a whole range of different countries. What this sounds like to me is that we are setting industry up to fail. With all our knowledge of the appalling stuff up we made of the live cattle trade and the absolutely appalling impact it had on the men and women whose lives and futures depend on the live cattle trade in Indonesia, even after that outrageous mistake this government made, how can they possibly stand in front of the Australian people and say that they are in any sense competent when, immediately after that, when they have to do the same thing again, the first thing they do is say: 'We don't really need to talk to the government we trade with; we're just going to make this a dictate and off we go.'


We know that the implementation of a through-chain supply assurance system is a very complex and difficult thing to do. But what this government has done is decide that there will be an arbitrary date at the end of the system. And the system does not end because it is finished; it does not end because the infrastructure is there; it does not end because we have completed the supply chain assurance. It ends simply because this government has been stupid enough to put an arbitrary date on it. They say, 'Here is the arbitrary date and, if you don't meet that date, it's all over.' I am not necessarily saying it should be endless. But given the complex­ity of the systems and the complexity of the cultures, given the disrespect from this government about their approach to the implementation of a series of standards from Australia into another country, given the lessons that should have been learnt through the appalling mistakes of the destruction of the live cattle trade from Northern Australia into Indonesia, one would have thought it would now be a case of 'forewarned is forearmed'.


But it is not so. Again, not only have we damaged our relationship with the government of Indonesia and the business people of Indonesia—that is the legacy—but we have moved to ensuring that the smarts of Senator Ludwig's department will be to say: 'We've done it to that country. We haven't even fixed it yet. We're going to move on and destroy trade in another country by setting arbitrary limits.' They do not recognise the differences in culture and they do not engage with the other government about ensuring it understands and assists with the implementation of what is probably one of the most complex assurance systems you can design. This is setting the industry up for complete failure. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,"<title>Live Animal Exports, Defence Security Authority Vetting</title>",MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,24,1,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-02-09,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (15:58):  I rise to speak to the ministerial statement on the live export trade. It is a brief statement and lacks the detail that I think the issue warrants, but it certainly has some informative issues that compound the concerns that so many Australians have with regard to how Australia is managing this issue. The delegation that the minister accompanied to the Middle East was actually made up of Australian industry representa­tives and exporters to these markets. When you consider that, in the second paragraph of the statement, the minister talks about the issue of international standards to ensure animals are being treated in line with animal welfare requirements, it is of concern that he took no people from the animal rights sector to the Middle East but just went with industry representatives. That speaks volumes, I think, about the mismanagement this government brings to this issue. I also note that they did not take any union representatives. The Australian Meat Indust­ry Employees Union have done a great deal of work in this, and I raise that because in the first paragraph of the minister's statement he talked about jobs, hardworking families and the importance of rural and regional communities. But, again, what we are seeing here is a failure to look at the benefits that can come from having more processing of the meat in Australia.


What is also worth looking at is what this delegation actually did on their visit. I understand they visited feedlots and abattoirs, but it does not say that the delega­tion actually saw the animals being slaught­ered. So you have to ask the question: if this is about lifting the standards of how animal welfare issues are managed in Australia's export trade, how do you make a judgment on the level of cruelty if you do not see how the animals are slaughtered? So again we see a major flaw in the minister's statement, as well as in how the delegation's visit was conducted.


Overall, what this ministerial statement does is once again underline that the government has missed the opportunity to end the live export trade. This is how we could have dealt, in a responsible way, with the issue of the cruelty these animals suffer and also with boosting jobs, particularly in regional areas. We know that so many animals die when they are exported. They undergo extreme suffering, both in the transport to these countries and in the actual process of slaughter.


I think all members in this place, while we may have our disagreements, are aware of the huge public distress when the ABC screened the Four Corners program about the overseas live export trade. I continue to get hundreds of emails about this issue, and interestingly just after midnight on New Year's Day I got a number of emails saying, 'Please in 2012 make banning live exports a key issue for the parliament where you work.'


The Greens' response to this ministerial statement is that, in terms of the response from the government, in essence, all we got was the Export Supply Chain Assurance System. This is no way to implement safeguards that can guarantee the humane transport and slaughter of animals in overseas markets. However, as the ESCA is the best that we have got, the Greens will certainly track the system very closely and we will be working to ensure that the meagre set of regulations that the government is putting in place are absolutely thoroughly followed.


I would like to move on to the other issue that I raised, the economics of the live export trade. This is where there has been a great deal of misinformation, and once again we see that the government has not been facing up to how this issue plays out, particularly for regional communities. At the end of the day, in so many communities, particularly in Northern Australia, they have seen their abattoirs shut and hundreds of jobs have been lost in so many local centres.


For a government that makes out that it is a government of jobs, that it is a party about jobs for ordinary people, this is where they have failed enormously. Much of the politics around the live export industry relies on arguments that come from reports that are very loaded and, I would argue, quite misleading. In 2006, Hassall & Associates released The live export industry: value, outlook and contribution to the economy. This was commissioned by the meat and livestock association and LiveCorp and was released in July 2006. When you look at the modelling that the Hassall report has relied on, it is questionable as to where they have extrapolated their figures from.


The modelling in the Hassall report has an average salary of more than $76,000 per employee for people in this industry, whereas the ABS national input-output table for 2006-07 has $60,000 per full-time equivalent employee overall, and consider­ably less for the agricultural sector. Those figures are significant because when they are extrapolated we end up with a very inflated economic benefit from this industry that really does now need to be questioned. Again, I urge members to look at some of the work that the AMIEU has undertaken.



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator RHIANNON:
  I note that interjection at that point. It is a union that is working hard for its members and for region­al Australia to create more jobs in an area where the government is failing enormously.


Studies conducted on behalf of the live export industry have as their foundation of premise that the live export trade operates in a different market or a different segment of the market to the meat processing industry. This whole narrative has been developed around the industry as a way to try and separate out this whole problem that regional Australia is faced with—that they have been losing out as the export industry has grown over the past decade. That whole premise is what we want to challenge.


Many of the predictions on stock price implications lack transparency and have questionable assumptions that are used to justify them. I believe that they have been created because those in the live export trade, who are obviously promoting this industry, would know that if the comparison were made with processing meat in this country then the so-called economic benefits of the live export trade would not stack up. So we have many fallacies here. Again I acknowledge that on this delegation it probably was not the key priority of the minister and he has presented it very much in terms of the animal welfare concerns. How­ever, on that issue would I argue he failed because nobody from the animal welfare sector accompanied him on that delegation, and when it comes to the issue of jobs the fudge that has become part of how the Labor government handles this continues.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:07):  All in Australia want to ensure that in our live cattle export industry we put the wellbeing of animals to the forefront. We also want to make sure that Australia continues to provide employment in those areas in Australia that rely on the live cattle export. This attitude of the industry and, I think, all Australians is well exemplified in the passage quoted in the minister's ministerial statement from Mr Andrew Ogilvie, the President of the Cattle Council of Australia, when he said:


The CCA stands committed to working with Government and industry in assuring the welfare of Australian livestock, while maintaining a sustainable live export industry.


He said the export supply chain assurance system would assist in that.


It is an essential industry. It is very important to Northern Australia and to North Queensland, which I represent in this parlia­ment and look after on behalf of the federal opposition. It is perhaps the biggest non-mining industry in the north, and that is why the north was so devastated by the stupidity of Senator Ludwig in succumbing to an issue brought by a very vocal minority group. I do not attribute any mischief to them; they believe what they say, and I accept that. I do not think they follow the whole issue. Unfortunately, a government that relies on a hotchpotch of Independents to keep it in power reacts badly to these day-long crises. Senator Ludwig was completely incapable of dealing with the matter. He made the right decision, I might say, after seeing the Four Corners report: he put a temporary ban on. He was then pressured by the left of his party, the Greens and the animal welfare people, to make it a permanent ban and, in doing so, destroyed the livelihoods of many Australians, particularly those in Northern Australia.


There is not a lot of time, and I want to share the balance of the available time with my colleague from Western Australia Senator Eggleston, who also represents many of those working families in the Kimberley and the north of Western Australia who were devastated by the actions of the Gillard government. But I want to point out a couple of other issues in the limited time available to me. This statement is interesting. If you have a look at it, you see it is a statement by the 'Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery, Senator the Hon. Joe Ludwig', and nothing else. Perhaps I am the first one to break that Senator Ludwig has lost his portfolio of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. One would have thought that, if he were still that minister—and who knows what happens in the Gillard govern­ment, where ministers and leaders change by the hour—a statement on live cattle export would be issued by the minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry. I wonder what the Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery has to do with the live cattle export from, effectively, Northern Australia. That in itself is interesting.


I appreciate that the Queensland Premier, in the throes of an election campaign, always thinks she gets value from being involved in natural calamities like floods and cyclones. I notice our Queensland Premier is out doing what she did a year ago: fronting the TVs and sort of acting as an emergency services director, seeking to again this year, as she did last year, attract votes because she is an on-the-spot Premier. I might say to Premier Bligh: I think that, if Queenslanders admired you last year, they have woken up to how a lot of your actions are more directed to vote winning and getting in the way of the emergency services personnel, who really have better things to do than look after the Queensland Premier involving herself in what are really professional emergency services matters.


I am pleased to see that at least the Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery has issued a media release on this, but I do question his competence in dealing with anything related to the live cattle export when we compare it with the fiasco that resulted from his last involvement in this area.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (16:12):  Like Senator Macdonald, I am somewhat intrigued by the title that Senator Ludwig now has as the Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery. I must say: if he is no longer the minister for agriculture, few tears will be shed in the Kimberley and Pilbara areas of Western Australia, where the consequences of the abrupt termination of the live cattle export trade to Indonesia had catastrophic economic effects and caused enormous hardship. It was not only in the Kimberley and Pilbara; it also did a lot of damage to our relationship with Indonesia because of the lack of consultation.


I gather Senator Ludwig has been on a trip, this time to the Middle East, to discuss live cattle exports there. The trade to the Middle East is worth $200 million per annum. There has been a deadline set for export accreditation by 29 February. If this is not met, the trade will grind to a halt. Surely, I ask the Senate, we could not be facing a repetition of the Indonesia fiasco when the trade was abruptly terminated. But there are four problems that I see in Senator Ludwig's supply chain assurance statement.


Firstly there is the absence of government-to-government discussions, which was a key failure in the government's dealings with Indonesia. Secondly, there is a very short time frame before this agreement is supposed to be in place. It is supposed to be in place by 29 February. It is very difficult to see that, given the complexities of dealing with people in the Middle East, that time frame will be met, so this live cattle export trade to the Middle East must also be in some jeopardy. Thirdly, the market systems are unregulated in the Middle East and the operators there are unlikely, I think, to agree to some of the Australian regulator's dema­nds, such as the tabling of contract details and so on. They are more likely to just pull out of the trade and that will mean a loss of our market share.


As I said, the minister has set an arbitrary implementation date of 29 February—a bit imperious when dealing with people in the Middle East. Arabs, like the Indonesians, like to take time in making their business decisions. So we are left in a situation where we must wait and see what happens. I hope that we are not going to see a repetition of the disastrous consequences which followed the decision to cease the live cattle trade to Indonesia—consequences which in the Pilbara and the Kimberley in particular were very severe indeed. As I said earlier, the minister's decision, without consultation with the Indonesian government, did immense damage to our relationship with Indonesia, and that will take a very long time to repair.

SENATE FOREIGN AFFAIRS, DEFENCE AND TRADE REFERENCES COMMITTEE





INQUIRY INTO DEFENCE'S REQUEST FOR TENDER FOR AVIATION CONTRACTS





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE





November 2011





RESPONSES TO RECOMMENDATIONS





Recommendation
 1
  paragraph 9.28



The committee recommends that Defence:


requires the documentation of a dedicated probity plan for all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO;




Response - Agreed.



A probity plan specific to future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO has been developed and is attached. A specific instruction will be issued to mandate the development of a probity plan based on this template for all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO. The template probity plan can also be tailored for other procurements undertaken by HQJOC, as required.


More generally, the necessary Defence procurement policy and operational guidance framework for the creation of a probity plan already exists (see Defence Procurement Policy Manual, 1 July 2011 edition (DPPM) at Chapter 5.4 Request Documentation, paragraphs 62, 63 and 65).


ensures probity plans for all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO identify expressly and address the risks associated with:


(i)   proponent grievances and


(ii)   the small and highly competitive nature of the commercial air charter market;




Response – Agreed



The attached probity plan specifically addresses the two risks listed above.


implements its proposed policy of appointing probity advisors to all complex and strategic procurements and monitors closely the implementation progress and impact of this policy – in particular, ensures that a probity advisor is appointed to all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO; and




Response – Agreed in principle



Probity advisers will be appointed where it is consistent with the existing Defence procurement policy and operational guidance. The DPPM, Chapter 3.13, paragraphs 14 to 29, provide for the appointment of probity advisers based upon the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) policy that 'the decision on whether to engage an external probity specialist should weigh the benefits of receiving advice independent of the process against the additional cost involved and include consideration of whether or not skills exist within the agency to fulfil the role'.


Based on past experience it is reasonable to assume that the future procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO would meet the Finance policy requiring the appointment of a probity adviser, and the template Probity Plan referred to above is drafted on this basis.


 amends chapter 3.2 of the Defence Procurement Policy Manual on risk management in procurement to include references to probity risks. In particular, Defence should consider cross-referencing chapter 3.13 on ethics and probity in procurement.




Response - Agreed.



In the planned 1 December 2011 update of the DPPM, Defence will update Chapter 3.2 to expand the references to probity risk, and cross reference this chapter with Chapter 3.13 on ethics and probity in procurement. In addition, Defence will also release an updated chapter 3.13 as part of the planned 1 December 2011 update.




Recommendation 2


paragraph 10.9



The committee recommends that Defence reviews all Defence Instructions and related documents in respect of Reservists, full or part time, to ensure that real and potential conflicts of interest that might arise as a result of past, current or post separation employment are identified, reported and managed appropriately. In particular:


(a)   Defence considers whether Defence Instructions DI(G) PERS 25-2 (Employment and voluntary activities of ADF members in off-duty hours) and DI(G) PERS 25-3 (Disclosure of interests of members of the ADF) should be extended to Reservists who are not engaged in continuous full-time service; or


(b)   if there is no intention to extend the application of DI(G) PERS 25-2 and DI(G) PERS 25-3 to Reservists who are not engaged in continuous full-time service, Defence develops specific policies covering the civilian employment of, and the disclosure of conflicts of interests by, those personnel.




Response – Agreed.



Defence has incorporated DI(G) PER 25-3 into a revised version of DI(G) PERS 25-6 (Conflict of Interest and Declaration of Interest) which came into effect on 29 March 2011. The revised DI(G) PERS 25-6 applies to a “Defence Member” as defined in section 3 of the Defence Act. This definition of “Defence Member” includes Permanent members of the Navy, Army and Air Force, and members of the Reserves who (a) are rendering continuous full-time service or (b) are on duty in uniform.


DI(G) PERS 25-2 is currently under review and will be revised to include the definition of 'Defence Member' to align with the definition in DI(G) PERS 25-6.


As Defence has agreed to Recommendation 2(a) there is no requirement to develop the specific policies requested in Recommendation 2(b).




Recommendation 3 
paragraph 10.21



The committee recommends that, prior to the re-tendering of any future contracts for the provision of air sustainment services to the MEAO, Defence ensures that:


(a)   all Reserve personnel involved in the procurement complete a conflict of interest declaration; and




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with usual Defence procurement practice as set out in the DPPM, Chapter 3.13. In addition, the attached Probity Plan contains a specific requirement in this regard.


(b)   commanding officers or supervisors in 1 JMOVGP:


(i)   make a risk-based assessment as to which other Reserve personnel must complete a conflict of interest declaration and which personnel do not;


(ii)   in making a risk-based assessment, give consideration to identifying and obtaining conflict of interest declarations from Reservists who have associations with the commercial air charter industry. Such associations may include:


present or previous civilian employment with air transport providers;


financial interests in these companies or related companies; or


professional or social relationships with members or employees of these companies; and


(iii)   document their decisions whether or not to require these Reservists


to complete a conflict of interest declaration.




Response – Agreed in principle.



Standard Defence probity arrangements provide that only those personnel who have a genuine 'need to know' have access to confidential tender information (eg. draft requirements, tenders, and evaluation material). This ensures that personnel who are not involved in the procurement do not access confidential information relating to the process or have an ability to influence the conduct of the process.


Further, if someone in the project team is approached by someone outside the project, an obligation to report such contact has been included in the attached Probity Plan.


Accordingly, it will be the responsibility of the project manager for a future procurement of air sustainment services to ensure that all relevant personnel complete conflict of interest declarations.




Recommendation 4 
paragraph 10.22



The committee recommends Defence ensures that, in all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO:


All members of tender evaluation boards and working groups, and all persons involved in the development of requests, sign conflict of interest declarations. Such declarations:


(a)   should be signed prior to the commencement of the tender evaluation process or the development of the request (as applicable); and


(b)   include declarations about possible conflicts of interest arising from their employment, prior employment, financial interests in potential suppliers or relationships with persons who have interests in potential suppliers.




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with Defence procurement policy and operational guidance which provides for the identification and management of conflicts of interest (see DPPM, Chapter 3.13). The probity plan templates available from the Commercial Policy and Practice Branch (CPP Branch), DMO Commercial Group, intranet site already contain a conflict of interest declaration proforma.


The timing for the completion of the conflict of interest declarations in certain circumstances is covered by the DPPM, Chapter 5.4 Request Documentation, paragraph 63, which states that 'If a probity plan is required, it should be developed and approved before commencement of the tender evaluation' at which point the conflict of interest requirements in the plan would apply (including any requirements regarding the timing for personnel to provide declarations).


In order to address the specific concerns of the Senate committee, a supplementary direction will be issued within 1 JMOVGP that all future MEAO air sustainment procurement activities must have a probity plan approved at the beginning of the procurement process (i.e. not just before the commencement of the tender evaluation).


1 JMOVGP will also direct that conflict declarations are to be obtained at the beginning of the procurement process. This requirement will also apply to all persons involved in the development of request documentation.


All members of tender evaluation boards and working groups receive specific briefings on conflicts of interest and other probity matters, prior to the commencement of tender evaluations.




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with existing Defence procurement policy and practice (see DPPM, Chapter 3.13). The attached probity plan also expressly includes this requirement.




Recommendation 5 
paragraph 11.20



The committee recommends that Defence:


In line with the findings of the AFCD Review, considers strategies for the improved documentation of the business case for any future decisions to re-test the market for the provision of air sustainment services to the MEAO.


Response – Agreed.


The DMO Commercial Group or the Defence Support Group, Non-Equipment Procurement Centre of Excellence (NEP COE) will assist 1 JMOVGP with the


drafting of any future business case for future decisions to market test the provision of air sustainment services to the MEAO, including ensuring the business case is in accordance with existing policy.


Reviews its procurement plan for the current MEAO contract, to ensure that sufficient lead time is provided for the making of any future decisions to re-test the market, and the planning and execution of a procurement process.




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with usual Defence procurement practice. For example, DPPM, Chapter 5.0, provides guidance on the development of procurement plans. The DMO Commercial Group or the NEP COE will assist 1JMOVGP, where required.


In all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO:


(a)   continues to include in procurement strategies a requirement that members of the Air Transport Standing Offer Panel are given advance notice of any decisions to re-tender the contract, prior to the release of the RFT; and


(b)   ensures that such requirements are implemented.




Response –Agreed in principle.



Defence will ensure that notice is provided to all potential suppliers in accordance with Commonwealth procurement policy as set out in the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines (CPGs). For instance, paragraph 5.2 of the CPGs requires that “All potential suppliers should have the same opportunities to compete for government business and must, subject to these CPGs, be treated equitably based on their legal, commercial, technical, and financial abilities.”


Advance notice of a future procurement of air sustainment services would be provided through Defence's Annual Procurement Plan (APP) (where the procurement is conducted as an open approach to the market).


1 JMOVGP will ensure that, in any future re-tendering, the tender release and closing dates for the request for tender meet or exceed the minimum time limits set out in the CPGs (see paragraphs 8.56 - 8.62; see also DPPM, Chapter 5.5 Tender Advertising, Submission and Receipt, paragraphs 6 – 11).


The CPGs relevantly provide:


'8.57   Agencies need to provide sufficient time for potential suppliers to


prepare and lodge a submission in response to an approach to the market. Time Limits discussed in this section represent minimum periods and should not be


treated as default time limits for potential suppliers to lodge submissions.”


'8.61   Where an agency intends to specify conditions for participation that


require potential suppliers to undertake a separate registration or pre-qualification procedure, the agency must state the time limit for responding to


the registration or pre-qualification in the approach to the market. Any such conditions for participation must be published in sufficient time to enable all potential suppliers to complete the registration and qualification procedures within the time limit for the procurement.'


Any future procurement process for MEAO air sustainment services will comply with the CPGs, including ensuring that there is sufficient time to enable tenderers to get aircraft onto the AO certificate.


• Implements strategies to ensure that potential tenderers have a clear and accurate understanding of how Australian industry participation is taken into account in the evaluation of tender responses, as part of the overall value for money assessment.




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with existing Defence procurement policy. Defence implements the requirements of the Australian Industry Participation (AIP) National Framework via its Australian Industry Capability (AIC) program. Defence procurement guidance on the AIC program is set out in DPPM, Chapter 3.12. Defence plans to update Chapter 3.12 in its 1 December update of the DPPM.


All relevant ASDEFCON templates include clauses that explain how AIC is taken into account in the evaluation of tender responses as part of the overall value for money assessment.


On the release of future requests for air sustainment services to the MEAO, implements the following actions to minimise the risk for potential proponent grievances:


(a)   provides potential tenderers with an explanation of the reasons for re-tendering the contract and any changes to tender requirements from the previous request;




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with existing Defence procurement policy and practice. For instance, the covering letter that forms the first part of the relevant ASDEFCON tendering and contracting template prompts the user to provide tenderers with appropriate background information about the procurement. This could include the reasons for re-tendering the contract and any key changes to tender requirements from the previous request.


(b)   provides potential tenderers with an explanation of how the evaluation criteria in the request documentation will be assessed; and




Response – Agreed in part.



Standard Defence procurement practice is to advise tenderers about the evaluation criteria and the basic rules governing tendering evaluation. In strategic and more complex procurements, the relevant ASDEFCON templates provide greater levels of specificity about how evaluation criteria are assessed, (eg by advising tenderers about what information will be used to assess which criterion). Also, if evaluation criteria are specifically ranked in terms of their relative importance or otherwise weighted, Defence procurement practice would require this order of ranking/weighting to be provided to all tenderers.


However, the detailed evaluation methodology which is used by tender evaluation teams to evaluate tenders is set out in the tender evaluation plan (TEP). In accordance with standard Commonwealth practice, the TEP is an internal document and is not normally provided to tenderers.


(c)   includes in the request documentation, where applicable, an express statement of Defence's:


(i)   preferred solution for meeting tender requirements, including


technical specifications; and




Response –Agreed in part.



Defence procurements do not tend to mandate a preferred solution as this can be seen by potential tenderers as favouring a specific tenderer and may stifle innovation and


otherwise limit the field of potential tenderers. Instead, and consistent with paragraphs 8.46 to 8.51 of the CPGs, the Defence approach is to analyse its requirements, undertake market research, and use this information to develop requirements/specifications which focus on the expected outcome from the procurement rather than specifying a particular way of meeting the requirement.


If Defence has specific requirements or technical specifications that must be met by tenderers, then Defence policy requires that these requirements and specifications be advised to tenderers. These would normally be included in the draft Statement of Work that is included as part of the request for tender.


(ii)   intention to consider alternative solutions.




Response – Agreed.



This recommendation accords with existing Defence procurement practice and is reflected in standard Defence Conditions of Tender (for example, see ASDEFCON Complex Materiel Vol. 2, conditions of tender, clause 4.10).


As a matter of priority in future tender processes for the provision of air sustainment services to the MEAO, takes action on the tender evaluation issues identified by the Deloitte, AGS and AFCD Reviews, as documented at paragraph 11.15 of this report.




Response – Agreed.



The issues identified at paragraph 11.15 of the Senate inquiry report are either generally consistent with existing Defence procurement policy and practice, or are being addressed for inclusion within that framework. For example, DPPM, Chapter 5.4 Request Documentation, and our ASDEFCON tendering and contracting templates, provide the guidance and framework respectively for drafting request documentation. The guidance and templates cover all CPGs requirements, including minimum content and format requirements, conditions for participation, essential requirements, evaluation criteria and technical specifications.


Another example is the current work within Defence to develop Tender Evaluation Better Practice Guides for the assistance of personnel undertaking procurements. Defence recently released the Better Practice Guide: Tender Evaluation in Simple Procurement, and a better practice guide for tender evaluation in more complex procurements is currently under development.




Recommendation 6 
paragraph 12.10



The committee recommends that in all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO, Defence develops and implements tender evaluation processes for assessing respondents' fitness and propriety to contract with the Commonwealth. Such evaluation processes should:


(a)   identify criteria setting out requirements or indicators for being 'fit and proper' to contract with the Commonwealth;


(b)   specify searches that may be conducted on tender respondents, their key personnel, proposed subcontractors and any associated companies (for example, parent or subsidiary companies)—including guidance on the scope of the searches;


(c)   identify the possible implications of the findings of each of the specified searches; and


(d)   enable the identification and assessment of potential risks arising from issues identified in these searches including:


(i)   reputational damage to the Common­wealth, should it proceed to


contract with the relevant tenderer; and


(ii)   proponent grievances about the relevant tenderer's fitness and


propriety to contract with the Commonwealth.




Response to (a) – (d) above – Agreed.



In the conditions of tender for all future MEAO air sustainment services procurements (and as reflected in the attached Probity Plan), Defence will reserve the right to undertake probity searches of tenderers and key personnel in order to assess the issues set out in the above recommendations.


This will require the tenderer, its proposed subcontractors, and their respective key personnel, to sign relevant consent forms – allowing the Commonwealth to seek such information.


The relevant clause for inclusion in the conditions of tender is as follows:


""The Commonwealth reserves the right to perform such security, probity or financial checks and procedures as it may consider necessary in relation to the tenderer and its subcontractors, their officers, employees, partners, associates or


related entities (including consortium members and shareholders and their officers or employees if applicable). These checks may include (without limitation):


-security and probity checks including criminal history checks; -corporate history checks;


-media checks;


-litigation searches (past, present or pending);


-reference checks; and


-any other checks which the Commonwealth considers relevant.


Each Tenderer agrees to provide, at its cost, all reasonable assistance to the Commonwealth to facilitate these checks being carried out (including executing all necessary consent forms).""


It should also be noted that all the current ASDEFCON templates already contain clauses that seek a significant amount of information of this kind, including :


the tenderer's proposed key personnel. The tenderers' responses to these questions should provide the necessary information to determine if one of a tenderer's proposed key personnel fails to meet the requirements of DI(G) PERS 25-6 (Conflict of Interest and Declaration of Interest);


the tenderer's financial position; and


a declaration from the tenderer that the information they have provided is accurate and not misleading.


Defence is currently developing a Tender Evaluation Better Practice Guide for complex procurements. This document will include detailed guidance on searches that may be conducted on tender respondents, their key personnel, proposed subcontractors and any associated companies, and implications of the findings.




Recommendation 7


paragraph 12.16



The committee recommends that Defence includes in all future tender evaluation documentation for the procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO:


specific provisions on conducting financial risk assessments of tender responses involving charter broker arrangements; and


essential requirement that proposals involving any form of broker-based solution – including sub-contracting arrangements – must include the complete financial statements of the proposed air charter operator and any other proposed sub-contractors.




Response – Agreed.



The necessary Defence procurement policy and operational guidance framework already exists to implement these recommendations (see DPPM, Chapter 3.3 Financial Policy and Advice in the Procurement Process). Defence's existing probity and tender evaluation plan templates, and the ASDEFCON conditions of tender, permit financial statements to be obtained from tenderers and financial risk assessments to be undertaken. The Financial Investigation Service (FIS), DMO Commercial Group, is able to undertake financial assessments for procurement related matters.


The attached Probity Plan also requires suggested financial risk assessment to be undertaken as part of a future procurement process for air sustainment services to the MEAO, and requires the probity adviser to ensure these matters are considered as part of the tender evaluation.




Request to Auditor-General


paragraph 12.22



The committee requests that the Auditor-General:


Conduct a performance audit of the tender process in respect of RFT AO/014/09, with a focus on probity risk management. In particular, the audit should evaluate the following matters, with a view to identifying any further areas for future improvement:


(a)   Defence's governance arrangements for the identification and management of significant probity risks to the procurement process, including conflicts of interest, confidentiality and proponent grievances;


(b)   Defence's program of procurement governance and process reforms, including those outlined in its evidence to the committee; and


(c)   Any other matters considered relevant to probity risk management, or related governance matters, in respect of the procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO.


After sufficient time has elapsed, conduct a second review to examine Defence's implementation of its program of procurement governance and process reforms. In particular the review should:


(a)   evaluate the implementation progress and impact of the reforms outlined in Defence's evidence to the committee; and


(b)   recommend, as necessary, any further reforms to probity risk management and other governance arrangements in respect of the procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO.




Response – Not applicable.



This recommendation relates to the Auditor-General. Defence will provide all necessary support to the Auditor-General, as required.




Recommendation 8 
paragraph 12.23



The committee recommends that Defence report back to the committee by 1 May 2012 on progress being made to implement the reforms it has announced including:


the ongoing performance of the 2010 contract, including the cost per mission, the realisation of projected savings, the continuing need for the increased cargo volumetric requirements and the contractor's compliance with the tender requirements;


progress on the establishment of the Centre of Excellence that is intended 'to support a more robust and consistent commercial approach to non-equipment procurement';


the work of the newly created Non-Equipment Chief Procurement Officer; and


the strategies for the recruitment and retention of suitably skilled procurement professionals.




Response – Agreed



Defence will report back to the committee as requested.




Recommendat
ion 9 
paragraph 12.25



Although the majority of recommendations apply to the procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO, the committee recommends that Defence consider incorporating the principles and practices underpinning them as part of Defence wide non-equipment procurement policy.




Response – Agreed.



The majority of the principles and practices discussed in the recommendations are either consistent with existing Defence procurement policy, practice or templates (such as the DPPM or the ASDEFCON templates) or will soon be incorporated as a result of the DPPM 1 December 2011 update and the Tender Evaluation Better Practice Guides. These principles and practices apply to all Defence procurement as described in the DPPM.


In relation to training staff in the practical application of these principles and practices, for a number of years DMO, on behalf of Defence, has been working to improve the content of Defence procurement training courses. In June 2011, CPP Branch, DMO Commercial Group, finalised the design and content of the Simple Procurement Refresher course in consultation with representatives from Defence Education and Training Development (DETD). Delivery of this training course is expected to commence in October 2011. CPP Branch and DETD are also finalising the design of the Complex Procurement Refresher course. Improving Defence procurement training courses will lead to more highly skilled procurement professionals.




Corrections to Senate Report



1.   Paragraph 3.7 of the Senate inquiry report states:


'Preparation for re-tender


3.7   Defence commenced preparation for the re-tendering process in late 2009.


Two key stages—which are discussed below—were the establishment of the Air Transport Standing Offer Panel in November 2009, and the preparation and approval of the procurement strategy. Headquarters, 1st Joint Movement Group


(HQ 1JMOVGP), within the Joint Operations Command, was the area within Defence responsible for conducting the procurement. The Commanding Officer of 1 JMOVGP was Group Captain Robert Barnes. His superior officer was the Deputy Chief of the Joint Operations Command, Rear Admiral Ray Griggs.'


This is not factually correct. The command relationship is between CO 1 HQJMOVGP (ie Group Captain Barnes) and CJOPS. In practical terms, DCJOPS deals with day to day issues. While DCJOPS is a superior officer from a rank perspective, this is not in a direct line accountability sense. In addition, the paragraph implies that then RADM Griggs was GPCPT Barnes' superior officer throughout the whole process. This is not the case as then RADM Griggs did not arrive in headquarters until May 2010. RADM Griggs did not take over as DCJOPS until July2010 having spent the first 5 weeks as acting CJOPS. DCJOPS during November 2009 was AVM Greg Evans (although between November 2009 and July 2010 there were several DCJOPS primarily due to a run of ill health).


2.   The Senate inquiry report refers in a number of places to 'Dr Raymond Bromwich'. Mr Bromwich does not hold a doctorate, and accordingly the report should be corrected so that he is referred to as 'Mr Raymond Bromwich'. The relevant references are as follows:

PART II – INCIDENTS ONBOARD HMAS SUCCESS BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY 2009 AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE





December 2011





RESPONSES TO RECOMMENDATIONS





Recommendation 1 paragraph 7.85



The Committee recommends that:


IGADF examine the inquiry processes from the initiation of the E&D health check through to the legal advice (and its consequences) provided by Colonel Griffin and Defence Legal in order to identify real or potential systemic failures in the inquiry processes and consider the practical measures needed to minimise the risk of future mistakes;


concurrently, the Fairness and Resolution Branch examine independently the


same processes in order to identify real or potential systemic failures in the inquiry processes and consider the practical measures needed that would minimise the risk of future mistakes;


at the same time, Defence Legal examine the legal advice, in respect of HMAS


Success, provided by legal officers to the senior Navy officers at that time, especially on initiating inquiries and procedural fairness, with a view to identifying any weaknesses, inconsistencies or errors in, and the overall quality of, this advice;


having carried out their respective examinations, the IGADF, the Fairness and


Resolution Branch and Defence Legal jointly consider their findings and together identify what needs to be done to rectify problems; and


by 1 December 2011, provide the committee with a report on their findings, the lessons to be learnt and their joint recommendations.


The Committee requests that the IGADF, the Fairness and Resolution Branch and Defence Legal keep a written record of the notes taken during their separate examinations and also a record of the discussions held between them when producing their joint findings. The purpose in having these notes retained, is to ensure that they would be available to the Committee should it resolve to consider matters further.


The Committee notes that for a number of years it has expressed concerns about the standard of investigations undertaken by the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS). The most recent revelation about significant deficiencies in this investigative service is most disturbing. The Committee suggests to ADFIS that the shortcomings identified in the investigations that took place relating to incidents onboard HMAS Success in 2009 should not be treated as an 'aberration'. In the Committee's view, they should be considered in light of the committee's 2005 findings and ADFIS' continuing attempts to improve its investigations. It should be noted that the committee found in 2005 that the ADF had 'proven itself manifestly incapable of adequately performing its investigatory function'.


The Provost Marshal, through the Minister for Defence, has been providing the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee with periodic updates on the progress of reforms to the investigative service.




Response - Agreed In Part



The Government agrees with the intent of Recommendation 1, but there are practical considerations that apply to its implementation.


With specific reference to the sub-recommendation regarding IGADF, Mr Gyles is scheduled to deliver Part 3 of the HMAS Success Commission of Inquiry in the near future.


Part 3 is focused on examining Defence inquiry processes and the relationship of inquiries with administrative or disciplinary procedures.


As well, a number of broader cultural reviews are taking place in Defence, many of which may have implications for inquiry arrangements, complaint handling mechanisms and the roles that legal officers play in those processes. These reviews include the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force's review into the management of incidents and complaints within Defence, again expected to be released in the near future.


As these reviews are Defence wide, they will clearly examine issues beyond HMAS Success. Consequently, the Government considers that any further specific HMAS Success focused review conducted in isolation from these broader efforts will be a duplication of those other reviews, be unlikely to significantly advance matters, and may complicate the current reviews underway. This broader focus (beyond HMAS Success) of the reviews should incorporate those matters at the heart of HMAS Success as well as other Defence related procedural strengths and weaknesses.


With specific reference to the sub-recommendation that Fairness and Resolution Branch (FRB) review the Equity and Diversity (E&D) Health Check and subsequent processes, the Government considers that the FRB is not an appropriate or competent authority to examine ADF inquiry processes and related legal advice: no valid construct (FRB or otherwise) exists in Defence for the HMAS Success related E&D health check. It was a Navy creation at the time.


As the subsequent inquiry processes that resulted from the 'health check' were under the Defence Inquiry Regulations, being an integral part of the Military Justice system, these do not fall within FRB expertise. FRB had no role to play in the technical detail of the Administrative Inquiries processes for the ADF or in their application as they applied to HMAS Success or more broadly.


With specific reference to Defence Legal and in particular the sub-recommendation that Defence Legal examine the legal advice, in respect of HMAS Success, provided by legal officers to the senior Navy officers at that time, especially on initiating inquiries and procedural fairness, with a view to identifying any weaknesses, inconsistencies or errors in, and the overall quality of this advice, Mr Gyles has already identified the weaknesses and deficiencies in the legal advice provided at Fleet Headquarters in relation to HMAS Success. Remedial actions are being considered as an element of those legal related recommendations of Parts 1 and 2 of the Commission of Inquiry Report. The Government considers that further examination of this legal advice is unlikely to realise any additional benefit.


Further, the Government asks the Committee to note that in implementing the Gyles recommendations, which included the comment that Navy Legal lacked candour in the manner in which it provided legal advice in the HMAS Success matter, and that Navy Legal needs a jolt, the CDF has already ordered a review of the command and control arrangements for all ADF legal officers. This will examine their structural and organisational independence from command, particularly in the context of being free from perceptions of inappropriate command influence. This broader review will look at the potential systemic issues that led to the failings in the Fleet Legal legal advice and what, if any, structural and organisational changes may be needed to ensure, as far as possible, the independence of legal officers from command across the ADF.


With specific reference to the sub-recommendation that having carried out their respective examinations, the IGADF, the Fairness and Resolution Branch and Defence Legal jointly consider their findings and together identify what needs to be done to rectify problems; and by 1 December 2011, provide the committee with a report on their finding, the lessons to be learnt and their joint recommendations, as detailed above, the FRB does not have a role in the Administrative Inquiry process. Noting this, the forthcoming Part 3 COI report and broader cultural reviews being undertaken, the Government cannot commit to provide the Committee with a report by 1 December 2011.


Notwithstanding the comments made, the Government has indicated it agrees with the intent of Recommendation 1 and proposes to consider it following the receipt of Part 3 of Mr Gyles' report and in the context of the results arising from the various cultural reviews that are currently underway.




Recommendation 2


Paragraph 9.10



The Committee recommends that the Provost Marshal in his next update to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on progress in reforming ADFIS include the lessons learnt from the investigations into matters relating to HMAS Success. The Committee is not interested in individual performances but the systemic shortcomings that allowed the mistakes to occur and importantly to go undetected for some time.




Response - Agreed



The Government agrees with Recommendation 2 and the Provost Marshal Australian Defence Force will provide a formal response as an integral part of his Annual Report to CDF and subsequently will report to the Chair of the Senate Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade.


 




Government Response





Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity





Final Report





Inquiry into the Operation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006



The Government welcomes the Committee's Final Report, and recognises the Committee's contribution to the further development of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and the Commonwealth public sector integrity system generally.


The Government's approach to preventing corruption is based on the premise that no single body should be responsible.  Instead, a strong constitutional foundation (the separation of powers and the rule of law) is enhanced by a range of bodies and government initiatives that promote accountability and transparency.  The Commonwealth bodies involved in preventing corruption include:


Australian Consumer and Competition Commissioner


Australian Crime Commission


Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity


Australian Federal Police


Attorney-General's Department


Australian National Audit Office


Australian Public Service Commission


Australian Securities and Investments Commission


Australian Taxation Office


Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre


Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions


Commonwealth Ombudsman, and


Office of the Australian Information Commissioner


This distribution of responsibility is a great strength in Australia's approach to corruption because it creates a strong system of checks and balances.


The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity's (ACLEI's) primary role is to investigate law enforcement-related corruption issues, giving priority to systemic and serious corruption.  ACLEI also collects intelligence about corruption in support of the Integrity Commissioner's functions.


The Integrity Commissioner must consider the nature and scope of corruption revealed by investigations, and report annually on any patterns and trends concerning corruption in law enforcement agencies.


In its report the Committee has made a number of recommendations concerning the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and the Commonwealth public sector integrity system generally.


In this context, the Government is pleased to respond to the Committee's recommendations.




Recommendation 1:



The committee recommends that the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 be amended so as to establish a 'second tier' to the Act.  Agencies with a law enforcement function included in this second tier would be subject to limited ACLEI oversight, under which the head of an agency, or the minister responsible for the agency, may refer a corruption issue, on a voluntary basis, for consideration by the Integrity Commissioner. The Integrity Commissioner should also have the power to commence an investigation or inquiry into a corruption issue in a second tier agency on his or her own initiative.




Noted 



The Government will consider whether it is appropriate to expand ACLEI's jurisdiction to include additional agencies that perform law enforcement functions.  


The establishment of the Integrity Commissioner to investigate corruption in Commonwealth law enforcement agencies is still relatively recent.  ACLEI's jurisdiction was extended beyond the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to include the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) on 1 January 2011.  Before considering the inclusion of new agencies within ACLEI's jurisdiction, the Government considers that it is appropriate to allow 12 to18 months for ACLEI to consolidate its existing jurisdiction following the inclusion of ACBPS.  That experience can then be used to properly inform any further expansion of ACLEI's functions.


All of the agencies nominated by the Committee for inclusion as tier two agencies are subject to the Public Service Act 1999 and as such are bound by the APS Values and Code of Conduct. These agencies also have existing internal and external corruption prevention and investigation measures.  




Recommendation 2:



The committee recommends that ACLEI's second tier jurisdiction should initially comprise the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, CrimTrac, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.




Noted 



See the response to Recommendation 1. 




Recommendation 3:



The committee recommends that the operation of a second tier in the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and the list of agencies prescribed in that tier be reviewed two years after initial establishment. This review should include consideration of whether any tier two agencies may more appropriately be subject to tier one prescription. Similar reviews should subsequently be conducted at two year intervals.




Noted 



See the response to Recommendation 1. 




Recommendation 4:



The committee recommends that the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 be amended so as to ensure that secrecy and confidentiality provisions pertaining to law enforcement agencies within ACLEI's jurisdiction do not prevent the Integrity Commissioner from receiving information necessary to the investigation of a corruption issue.




Agreed 



The Government agrees that secrecy and confidentiality provisions that apply to agencies within ACLEI's jurisdiction should not prevent ACLEI receiving necessary information.  Secrecy provisions in the AFP and ACC legislation contain explicit exceptions to ensure relevant information can be made available to ACLEI.


The Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No 2) 2011 authorises the disclosure of protected information under the Customs Administration Act 1985 for the purposes of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.




Recommendation 5:



The committee recommends that the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 be amended so that the period of appointment of the Integrity Commissioner may be extended once, beyond the five year period of appointment, for a period of up to two years by the Governor-General on recommendation of the Minister, with the approval of the committee. Any such extension to the period of appointment should apply only to a serving Integrity Commissioner and should be approved no less than three months before the expiry of the current period of appointment.




Agreed in part



The Government will introduce amendments to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 to enable the initial sum period of appointment of the Integrity Commissioner to be extended beyond five years, for a further period of up to two years.  


As the position of Integrity Commissioner is a statutory appointment made by the Governor-General, it is a matter for the executive Government and it is not appropriate for it to be subject to approval by the Committee.  




Recommendation 6:



The committee recommends that the Integrity Commissioner, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Public Service Commissioner, the Auditor-General and the Attorney-General's Department develop a more detailed and comprehensive definition of corruption for the purposes of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. A proposed definition should be circulated for public consultation, including this committee, no later than November 2011.




Agreed in principle



The Government agrees that the definition of corruption must be clear and appropriate, noting that the definition has relevance beyond the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.  The Government accordingly agrees that the Attorney-General's Department will work with relevant agencies to clarify the definition of corruption for the purposes of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and undertake public consultation on this issue.


The outcome of this work could be either guidance concerning the definition or an amendment to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 to clarify the definition itself.


The development of an effective draft definition of corruption will require research and careful discussion of the issues that is likely to take several months.




Recommendation 7:



The committee recommends that ACLEI and the Australian Public Service Commission continue to collaborate in the development of ethics training provided to public servants to include corruption prevention using ACLEI's specialised experience and knowledge.




Agreed



The Government agrees that ACLEI and the Australian Public Service Commission collaborate as appropriate in the development of ethics training provided to public servants to promote the importance of appropriate behaviour, including avoidance of corrupt activity.  




Recommendation 8:



The committee recommends that the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 be amended so as to provide a mechanism by which the Public Service Commissioner, with the consent of the Integrity Commissioner, could request assistance, including on behalf of any head of a Commonwealth agency, in investigating a serious corruption issue. Such a request would be made after consideration of whether ACLEI's unique experience and powers meant that ACLEI could provide greater investigatory value than the Australian Federal Police. Furthermore, to avoid overburdening ACLEI to the detriment of its primary law enforcement focus, such an arrangement should be funded by the requesting agency.




Noted



The Government encourages agencies to share expertise and resources in appropriate circumstances.  It is important to ensure that the core work of ACLEI in investigating corruption issues within law enforcement agencies is not adversely affected.


This recommendation has the potential to constitute an open-ended second tier of agencies that could be subject to ACLEI oversight.  The Government considers that any extended role for ACLEI in assisting Commonwealth agencies more broadly might be most appropriately more in the nature of an advisory role, rather than an investigative role.  The investigative role is appropriately discharged by the AFP.


Conferring a referral role on the Public Service Commissioner would add a layer of procedural complexity in most cases.  The exception would be in those matters where the Public Service Commissioner was personally investigating the suspected misconduct of an agency head under section 41(1)(f) of the Public Service Act; in those instances the Public Service Commissioner would consult the AFP about the carriage of matters that raised potential issues of serious corruption. 




Recommendation 9:



The committee recommends that the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 be amended so as to include a 'more conveniently dealt with' clause that would enable the Integrity Commissioner to refer to the Commonwealth Ombudsman issues that are not, or through the course of investigation, it is discovered are not, corruption issues but which do relate to misconduct.




Noted



The Government notes that the Integrity Commissioner currently may provide information to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, where this is appropriate.  The Attorney-General's Department will continue to liaise with the Integrity Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman to ensure that these existing arrangements remain suited to their purpose.


In general, the Ombudsman has no jurisdiction in relation to misconduct in APS agencies. Allegations of suspected misconduct by an APS employee should always be passed to the relevant agency head. If the allegation concerns misconduct by an agency head, including failure to deal properly with misconduct by his/her employee(s), that is a matter that can only be inquired into by the Public Service Commissioner.




Recommendation 10:



The committee recommends that the Australian Government conduct a review of the Commonwealth integrity system with particular examination of the merits of establishing a Commonwealth integrity commission with anticorruption oversight of all Commonwealth public sector agencies, taking into account the need to retain the expertise of ACLEI in the area of law enforcement.




Noted



The Government's approach to preventing corruption is based on the premise that no single body should be responsible.  Instead, a strong constitutional foundation (the separation of powers and the rule of law) is enhanced by a range of bodies and government initiatives that promote accountability and transparency.  This distribution of responsibility creates a strong system of checks and balances.  


The Government has undertaken and continues to undertake significant work to improve the Commonwealth integrity system.  This work includes:


Developing Australia's first National Anti-Corruption Plan, an initiative announced by then Minister for Justice the Hon Brendan O'Connor MP in September 2011. In developing the Plan, the Government will examine evolving corruption threats to Australia's national interests and ways to reduce corruption risks. The Plan will also clarify the roles and responsibilities of the range of bodies that promote accountability and transparency, including the overall lead responsibility for Commonwealth anti-corruption policy development and agency coordination.  


The implementation of revised Common­wealth Fraud Control Guidelines, issued by the Minister for Home Affairs and Justice on 24 March 2011, that place a greater emphasis on fraud prevention and instilling a culture of fraud awareness in Government agencies.


Working towards the establishment of a Parliamentary Integrity Commissioner (PIC), to undertake a range of functions including providing advice to parliamentarians on ethical issues, and upholding a Parliamentary Code of Conduct.  The Government has referred the matter of a Parliamentary Code of Conduct, including the role of the PIC, to the House of Representatives Privileges and Members' Interests Committee and the Senators' Interests Committee.  The House Committee released a discussion paper at the end of the 2011 Spring sittings.  The Senate Committee is expected to report back in the 2012 Winter sittings.  


Significant reforms to managing federal judicial complaints, which were announced by the Attorney-General in March 2011, to introduce greater transparency and accounta­bility in judicial complaints handling.  The reforms include developing a framework to assist Chief Justices of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Chief Federal Magistrate to manage complaints about judicial officers that are referred to them and the re-introduction of the Parliamentary (Judicial Misbehaviour or Incapacity) Commission Bill into Parliament.


The current review of Australia's implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).  UNCAC is a binding global instrument on anti-corruption that establishes detailed mechanisms for the prevention and criminalisation of corruption, as well as international cooperation, asset recovery and information exchange. 


Recent changes to the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997 to enhance the role of Audit Committees.  In particular, Chief Executives will be encouraged, wherever practically possible, to appoint at least one independent member.  The changes also broaden the functions that an audit committee may also undertake, such as reviewing the effectiveness of an agency's governance arrangements and reviewing the adequacy of an agency's risk management framework, internal control environment and legislative compliance.


Development of a Public Interest Disclosure Bill to establish further whistleblower protections in the Commonwealth public sector.  The Bill would give effect to the Government response of 17 March 2010 to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs titled Whistleblower Protection: A Comprehensive Scheme for the Commonwealth Public Sector.


The Government considers it appropriate to implement these measures before considering whether any further review should be conducted, and notes that on the available evidence there is no convincing case for the establishment of a single overarching integrity commission.








Government Response to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's Human Rights Sub-Committee Report:





Human rights in the Asia-Pacific: Challenges and opportunities





Recommendation 1





The Committee recommends that


The Australian delegations to its bilateral human rights dialogues with China and Vietnam include parliamentary representation from the Human Rights Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade; and that


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provide the Human Rights Sub-Committee with an annual briefing on the outcomes of these dialogues, and on any other bilateral human rights dialogues that may later be established with countries in the Asia-Pacific.


The Government supports this recommend­ation and acknowledges the value of parliament­ary representatives participating in bilateral human rights dialogues.  It has been the practice of successive governments to invite representa­tives of the Australian Parliament (including members of the Human Rights Sub-Committee of the JSCFADT) to participate in delegations.  


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would be pleased to provide briefings to the Human Rights Sub-Committee on the outcomes of bilateral dialogues.  




Recommendation 2 



The Committee recommends that AusAID adopt a human rights-based approach to guide the planning and implementation of development aid projects.


The Australian Government promotes and protects human rights through its aid program, including in the areas of gender, disability, good governance, health, education, and law and justice. While the Government does not label it a 'rights-based approach', human rights principles are integrated into the planning and implement­ation of development aid projects.


The Independent Review of Aid Effectiveness, commissioned by the Australian Government in November 2010, released their report in April 2011. The report noted that Australia's aid program is 'rich in activities that advance Australia's commitment to human rights'. The Panel also saw an opportunity to improve clarity and communication about the links between the aid program and human rights. 


The Government's response 'An Effective Aid Program for Australia' (July 2011) meets this challenge by incorporating human rights into one of its key development objectives: 


Improving governance in developing countries to deliver services, improve security, and enhance justice and human rights for poor people; and to improve overall effectiveness in aid delivery in partnerships between host governments and aid agencies. 


Many aspects of AusAID's current policies and activities are working to advance human rights within the Asia-Pacific region. For example:


The Human Rights Fund, established in 1996, is an important mechanism for supporting human rights activities in the Asia-Pacific region through the aid program. It supports the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions; and the Government's Human Rights Grants Scheme (HRGS).


The HRGS provides grant funding to non-government organisations and human rights institutions based or operating in developing countries. The HRGS is an important component of AusAID's overall approach to human rights and aims to build human rights capacity in areas of need across the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. 


The Government's 'Development for All' strategy aims to ensure that persons with disabilities are included in, and benefit equally from, development assistance and is an important part of the aid program's broader human rights agenda. The strategy contributes to meeting our obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) by addressing the barriers experienced by persons with disabilities to social and economic opportunities throughout the Asia-Pacific.  


The promotion of gender equity and the empowerment of women in partner countries is an overarching objective of Australia's aid program.  AusAID is committed to ensuring the needs, priorities and interests of women are considered in all development activities and at every stage of the development process.




Recommendation 3



The Committee recommends that in responding to the need to make progress in the region on embracing and implementing the universal human rights principles contained in the core human rights treaties, the Australian Government should review its current strategies, consult closely with key regional stakeholders, and consider work already being undertaken on this issue. This should include consideration of:


human rights education to enhance understand­ing in the region of the content, benefits and practical local application of these treaties; and


ongoing support for countries to meet reporting and other participation obligations in the United Nations human rights system.


The Government supports, and will continue to implement, this recommendation.  


The Government has various strategies for promoting increased ratification of, and adherence to, core human rights treaties: bilaterally (through representations, dialogues and the aid program), regionally (through support for regional organisations that promote human rights) and multilaterally (through the United Nations). These strategies are kept under review.


The Government acknowledges the import­ance of consultation and engagement with key stakeholders and continues to look for ways to seek stakeholder views effectively. In promoting human rights in the region, the Government works closely with non-government organisations (NGOs), National Human Rights Institutions, and relevant authorities. The Government also recognises the importance of ongoing human rights education in the Asia-Pacific region, which it pursues through programs such as the Australia Awards initiative (for further information please see response to recommendation 4). 


Through its aid program, the Government currently provides targeted funding and technical support to a number of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to assist them to meet their international human rights treaty obligations. For example: 


Australia's bilateral Human Rights Technical Cooperation (HRTC) programs with China and Vietnam have assisted the Vietnamese and Chinese Governments to meet their treaty reporting obligations and to incorporate aspects of these treaties into their domestic legal frameworks. This support has, in part, assisted China to draft national legislation on domestic violence.  Vietnamese Government institutions have linked this assistance to major policy and legislative reform such as the enacted Law on Legal Education and Dissemination, the Gender Equality Law, the Law on Domestic Violence and the draft Law on Disability.


In East Timor, the aid program has supported the development of a new national disability policy and strategy on disability. In Cambodia, Australia supported the development of disability rights legislation. A new program of support will enable the Royal Government of Cambodia to ratify, and then implement, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).


Australia provides funding to the Regional Rights Resource Team of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC/RRRT), which offers professional and technical support to build human rights capacity within Pacific Island governments and civil society organisations, including advice concerning obligations relating to international human rights treaties. SPC/ RRRT assists individual Pacific Island countries to develop appropriate legislation for the protection and promotion of civil society organisations and supports civil society in advocating for the establishment of human rights machinery in specific countries. 




 Recommendation 4 



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a scholarship fund to enable individuals from non-government organisations and civil society groups in Asia and the Pacific, who work in human rights or relevant fields, to attend approved human rights courses in Australia.


The Government supports this recommend­ation and is pleased to report to the Committee that it is already being implemented through programs such as the Australia Awards initiative and the Australian Leadership Awards Fellow­ships.  


The Australia Awards initiative, funded from the aid program, provides scholarships (up to 3700 in 2014) for study in Australia largely at the postgraduate level, and professional development opportunities in developing countries and in Australia.  


The Australia Awards provide opportunities to address needs across governments, the private sector, NGOs and civil society.  Individuals from non-government organisations and civil society groups in Asia and the Pacific are eligible for the Awards and can undertake approved human rights courses and other human rights training in Australia.  AusAID works closely with whole-of-government and development partners to encourage applications that focus on priority issues, including human rights. In 2009 and 2010, students from Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam were enrolled in human rights courses at Australian universities through AusAID-funded scholarships.


Since 2007, AusAID has funded five human rights-related programs through the Australian Leadership Awards (ALA) Fellowships.  The Fellowships are designed to provide short-term opportunities for study, research and professional attachment programs in Australia delivered by Australian organisations.  For example, Justice Equality Rights Access International Ltd (JERA International) received an award in 2010 to host 12 Fellows from the All China Women's Federation and Research Centre for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law and the Peking University Law School for Human Rights.


Training is also provided to NGOs and civil society groups in developing countries under the Human Rights Grants Scheme. In 2009-10, seven grants were provided to train representatives from NGOs on human rights issues.




Recommendation 5 



The Committee recommends that the Australian Government appoint a special envoy for Asia-Pacific regional cooperation on human rights, to undertake consultations with countries in Asia and the Pacific, and report to the Government within 12 months. The special envoy should engage in discussion in the region on how Australia can best support regional approaches to the protection and promotion of human rights, and the redress for human rights violations in the Asia-Pacific. The special envoy's responsibilities should be determined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but could include:


undertaking high-level political consultations about the establishment of a Pacific subregional human rights mechanism and a wider Asia-Pacific regional mechanism; and


consulting with government officials and key regional non-government stakeholders.


The Government does not support this recommendation. 


While recognising the desirability of greater regional cooperation on human rights, the Government notes that evidence presented to the Committee strongly cautioned against Australia being seen to be the driving force behind the establishment of a regional human rights mechanism. The Government considers that supporting practical, grassroots activities and initiatives is a more effective way to promote human rights in the Asia-Pacific.  This is considered more likely to achieve broad support from countries in the region for human rights objectives.


The Government also notes that its network of Posts throughout the Asia-Pacific often perform a similar function to the one proposed for a Special Envoy on Human Rights, including providing advice on how Australia can support regional human rights initiatives. For example, the Australian embassies in Jakarta and Singapore provided extensive information and advice to Canberra over a number of months on the negotiations surrounding the formation of the ASEAN Inter-Governmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). 


This advice informed Prime Minister Gillard's announcement in October 2010 at the ASEAN-Australia Summit in Hanoi that Australia would provide funding to support engagement between the Australian Human Rights Commission and AICHR so that the two Commissions could build strong linkages. In addition, Australian Heads of Mission regularly make representations on human rights concerns to foreign governments in the region and Posts routinely report to Canberra on human rights issues.


The Australian Government is pleased with the recent appointment of a Human Rights Adviser by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.  The Government encourages and supports the human rights activities being undertaken by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Regional Rights Resource Team (SPC/RRRT) of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, including their work to explore a regional, demand-driven human rights mechanism. 


The Australian Government also supports the Pacific Islands Law Officers' Network (PILON) in complementing the Pacific Islands Forum's efforts to improve the protection and promotion of human rights in the region.  PILON's initiatives and activities in this respect are coordinated through the PILON Secretariat.  For example, PILON members were encouraged at the 2009 meeting to consider their own legislative frame­works for compliance with international human rights instruments.  In 2010, the PILON Secretar­iat, temporarily based in the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department, coordinated and distributed to members a discussion paper on the implications of a regional human rights charter for the Pacific. The Australian Government will continue to participate in PILON human rights activities and initiatives, coordinated through the PILON Secretariat.








JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES





REPORT 110:  TREATIES TABLED ON 18, 25 (2) AND 26 NOVEMBER 2009 AND 2 (2) FEBRUARY 2010





GOVERNMENT RESPONSE




Recommendation 3:  Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Australia to amend the Agreement concerning Space Vehicle Tracking and Communication Facilities of 29 May 1980, as amended



Recommendation 3:  The Committee recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs write to all other ministers to remind them that, when they are planning to enter into a treaty, they must factor in the agreed 15 to 20 sitting day timeframe for the Committee to conduct its inquiry.


The Government agrees with the Committee that requests for the expeditious consideration of a treaty should be reserved for exceptional circumstances.  The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Dr Craig Emerson MP, wrote to Ministers on 16 September 2011 to remind them of the need to factor in the 15 to 20 sitting day timeframe when tabling treaty actions.


Treaty tabling timeframes are also highlighted in the 2011 edition of Signed, Sealed and Delivered - Treaties and Treaty Making: Officials' Handbook.  This handbook contains the domestic and international legal framework supporting treaties and sets out the steps involved in treaty making, including critical timelines and individ­ual departments' and agencies' responsibilities.  It is widely distributed and readily available to assist officials from all Commonwealth agencies.  When dealing with line agencies about tabling treaties, Treaties Secretariat staff regularly reinforce the information regarding the import­ance of maintaining the timelines set out in Signed, Sealed and Delivered.  The need to factor in the agreed timeframe for Committee inquiries and deliberations in respect of treaty actions is also emphasised in the annual Treaty Seminar conducted by the Treaties Secretariat of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  



Recommendations 4-7:  Extradition Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India and the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters


The Government thanks the Committee for its consideration of the Extradition Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India and the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.  The Government provides the following responses to the Committee's recommendations.



Recommendation 4:  The Committee recommends that new and revised extradition agreements should explicitly provide a requirement that the requesting country provide annual information concerning the trial status and health of extradited persons and the conditions of the detention facilities in which they are held.


The Government does not accept this recommendation.  


The Committee suggests that implementing this recommendation would mitigate perceived risks resulting from the introduction of the 'no evidence' standard in Australian extradition practice in 1986.  The Government does not consider that the removal of the prima facie case requirement is directly relevant to the question of human rights protections available to a person following his or her surrender to another country.  An assessment of whether or not an application for extradition has met the prima facie standard of evidence is separate from consideration of post-extradition issues such as the person's trial status, health and conditions of detention.


Further, and more importantly, the Govern­ment considers that the most appropriate time at which to examine any potential human rights concerns is before extradition occurs.  The extensive review process during extradition proceedings provides ample opportunity for any such concerns to be raised and investigated.  


This approach is consistent with Australia's obligations under international human rights law and mirrors Australia's approach to considering the risk of human rights abuses before an individual is removed from Australia under the Migration Act 1958.  It is also consistent with international extradition practice.  It is likely that current and potential extradition partners would not be prepared to accept the inclusion of explicit monitoring obligations in extradition arrange­ments with Australia.


The extradition process in Australia includes extensive procedural safeguards.  These safeguards are included in the Extradition Act 1988, as well as in bilateral treaties.  For example, Article 4(3)(d) of the Extradition Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India provides for the refusal of an extradition request where the Requested State believes that the surrender is likely to have exceptionally serious consequences for the person whose extradition is sought, including because of the person's age or state of health.  This is in addition to other internationally accepted grounds of refusal, such as where the death penalty may be imposed or where the Requested State has substantial grounds to believe that the request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race, sex, religion, nationality or political opinion.


Further, as noted in the Government Response to Report 91 of the Committee, Australia has established monitoring mechanisms in relation to Australian nationals who have been extradited overseas.  This monitoring is able to be conducted because of the consular rights provided for under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the resources provided to support Australia's consular network.  The consular role reflects the Australian Government's particular responsibility for assisting its nationals while overseas.


Also consistent with the Government Response to Report 91, the Government has agreed to include additional information on persons extradited from Australia in the Annual Reports of the Attorney-General's Department, including information on:


extradition requests granted by Australia and the categories of the relevant offences by reference to the countries which made the request the number of Australian permanent residents extradited, and any breaches of substantive obligations under bilateral extradition agreements noted by Australian authorities.



Recommendation 5:  The Committee recommends that all Australians who are subject to extradition should receive a face to face meeting with an Australian consular official, except where the person has made explicit their objection to consular assistance to the satisfaction of consular officers.


The Government accepts this recommendation.  Current Australian Government procedures ensure that, wherever practically and legally possible, consular officials visit Australians who are imprisoned overseas at least annually, and normally more frequently than this.  In some limited circumstances, face to face meetings may not be practicable or necessary.  For example, in a large country such as the United States where there are significant numbers of Australians imprisoned, they are widely dispersed and consular staff are familiar with the standard of prison conditions, consular assistance can be provided satisfactorily via regular telephone calls to the prisoner. 



Recommendation 6:  The Committee recommends that, when a foreign national is extradited from Australia to a third country, the Australian Government formally advise the government of that person's country of citizenship that one of its nationals has been extradited from Australia to a third country.


The Government accepts this recommendation in principle.  When foreign nationals are detained in Australia for the purposes of extradition, law enforcement officers will generally inform them that they are entitled to request that their consular authorities be informed of their detention, and consular authorities are entitled to visit and communicate with the person.  In accordance with the constraints of disclosure of personal information under the Privacy Act 1988, the Government will only notify the extraditee's country of citizenship of their detention and extradition if the individual consents to the disclosure of personal information.



Recommendation 7:  The Committee supports the Extradition Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India and the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of India on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.


The Government accepts this recommendation.  Regulations have been made under the Extradition Act 1988 and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987.  The treaties entered into force on 20 January 2011.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:26):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Clearly, the government has something to hide when it comes to its dodgy mining tax. Over the last 18 months the government has been ducking and weaving and running for cover and being absolutely desperate to avoid having to table the information about its mining tax revenue assumptions. Clearly, its mining tax revenue estimates must be dodgy. Clearly the mining tax revenue estimates must not stand up to scrutiny. Why else is this government is so desperate to keep them secret from the scrutiny of this parliament?


The mining tax revenue estimates have been bouncing around ever since the Prime Minister and the Treasurer negotiated, exclusively and in secret, this mining tax deal behind closed doors, excluding all of the competitors of those three big mining companies from the process. What the government now tells us is that the mining tax revenue assumptions, commodity price assumptions and production volume assumptions are somehow a national secret. The government tells us that information is based on commercial-in-confidence data provided by the three big mining companies that were involved in the negotiations.


The logical conclusion of that argument is that not only were those three big mining companies given preferential access to the design of a massive new tax--which already gives those three companies a competitive advantage compared with everyone else who was excluded from the process—but also we are now told by this government that those three big mining companies are the only ones allowed to know what the government's mining tax revenue assumptions are. That is so outrageously inappropriate and improper that I cannot believe the Senate could possibly stand for that sort of contemptuous attitude from the executive government towards this chamber.


The mining tax deal negotiated by the government gave those three big companies a massive upfront tax deduction because it introduced the concept of a market value based upfront deduction. If you look at the revenue estimates, which are completely dodgy, and at the costs of all the related promises, which clearly exceed even the revenue that the government expects to collect, you can see that this mining tax package is yet another Labor Party fiscal train wreck in the making. It will put our budget at serious risk not only over the forward estimates but over the medium to long term, and it is quite unbelievable that the Greens, who were quite tough in their rhetoric over the past 12 months, have caved in and joined the Labor Party in this mining tax cover-up.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (16:30):  I move:


That the Senate notes the reflections of the Leader of the Australian Greens (Senator Bob Brown) on the President of the Senate, the Prime Minister (Ms Gillard), the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Ludwig), Senator Boswell, the Leader of The Nationals in the Senate (Senator Joyce) and Senator Cash.


I rise to contribute to the debate on this motion. It is a very serious motion, and at the outset I wish to point out that I will not be canvassing the material from Senator Kroger, which the Senate has referred to its Privileges Committee, in relation to Senator Bob Brown. Suffice it to say that Senator Kroger has argued:


… it is necessary for the Senate to be protected from the corrupting influence of a senator negotiating a $1.6 million corporate donation for their party, which has led to questions being asked, points of order taken, and votes being cast in the interests of the donor.


What concerns me today—hence the motion that we are now debating—is Senator Brown's behaviour since this reference and, in particular, his indiscriminate attacks on the President of the Senate, the Prime Minister, Senator Ludwig, Senator Boswell, Senator Joyce and me.


Senator Brown's reaction to the passage of Senator Kroger's motion referring him to the Privileges Committee was to give notice of a motion censoring the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, over the Tasmanian Forests Intergovernmental Agreement. Senator Ludwig was, of course, at that time the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I believe that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, probably talked Senator Brown out of this attack on the Greens' alliance partner, as Senator Brown withdrew his notice of motion. However, Senator Brown, whilst obviously admonished, was undeterred. Two days later he gave notice of a similar motion calling on Senator Ludwig to report on the failure of the Prime Minister to uphold the Tasmanian Forests IGA. He then gave notice of another highly disrespectful—indeed, one might say pitiful—motion suggesting that the President had allowed the Privileges Committee to be politicised by giving precedence to a SLAPP-writ-style reference from Senator Kroger. SLAPP stands for 'strategic lawsuit against public participa­tion'. However, consistently with so much of what Senator Brown does, I have no idea what relevance this could possibly have to a Privileges Committee reference.


But it did not end there. Senator Brown's deliberate and completely unfounded assault on the integrity of other members of the Senate continued. On the last day of the Senate sittings we learned that, in a tit-for-tat exercise, Senator Brown had concocted a charge against the father of the Senate, Senator Boswell, and had written to the President of the Senate asking that he give precedence to a motion to refer his allegations—which are no more than deliberate slurs against Senator Boswell—to the Privileges Committee. Anyone in this place who has served with Senator Boswell would agree that he, above all of us here, is a man of principle and integrity and does not have a corrupt bone in his body. Being a man of principle, despite being deliberately and unfairly targeted by the Australian Greens, he will not be silenced or deterred in his fight against the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign being spearheaded by Senator Rhiannon.


The President quite rightly rejected Senator Brown's request. Senator Brown, of course, refused to accept the ruling of the President, moved a motion of dissent and then turned his attack on the President of the Senate. A considered person would have taken the time over the parliamentary recess to consider their ill-informed behaviour. Senator Brown did not do this. What we have witnessed this week, the first sitting week of 2012, was a continued and sustained attack on the President of the Senate, with Senator Brown accusing Senator Hogg of bias, of a remarkable error of judgment, of a failure of presidential prudence, of a double standard, of facilitating an ambush on Senator Milne and him, and of a disgraceful detriment to the Senate's tradition of fairness. This was not only unwarranted but an unprecedented attack on the President of the Senate which could not pass unanswered.


Sadly, Senator Brown's childish behaviour does not end there. Over the parliamentary recess, Senator Brown continued his petulant attack and turned on the Prime Minister over the Tasmanian IGA by unilaterally breaking off his weekly meetings with her—weekly meetings which, I note, are a condition of the Labor-Greens agreement. Then, as senators resumed this year, we discovered that Senator Brown had also written to the President in relation to Senator Joyce and me with more trumped-up charges that he wanted brought before the Privileges Committee. Unsurprisingly, the President determined that they should not be given precedence. The fact that these are trumped-up charges was admitted by Senator Brown yesterday in a statement to the Senate, when he said in relation to the President's ruling:


I think your decision to effectively reject my application in the matters regarding Senator Boswell, Senator Cash and Senator Joyce was correct.


Yet, despite this admission in the Senate yesterday, Senator Brown continues to waste the time of the Senate and continues to treat the Australian people with contempt. He has now put on the Notice Paper notices of motion in relation to these matters, matters that Senator Brown himself has admitted that the President was right to dismiss.


Senator Brown's statement and his ensuing actions confirm that Senator Brown sees himself as the leader of an elitist party with no regard for the practices or procedures of the Senate or, indeed, the parliament and, ultimately, has contempt for the Australian people. However, whilst it may well be disappointing to so many of us that a political party leader would use the Senate in this childish manner, it is hardly surprising. I am, however, like so many others, amazed that the other Greens' senators put up with such erratic behaviour from their leader. Clearly, Senator Brown's actions in lashing out at everyone in a scattergun approach is an attempt to distract attention from his own predicament. We know that some members of the Greens are onto this and believe that Senator Brown is out of control. To quote from the Monthly's feature on the rift in the Greens:


Members of the old guard have been heard referring to Brown as a 'megalomaniac'.


Senator Brown's behaviour, as I have outlined, is surely an example of this personality trait. We see motions and privileges references from someone with no real insight into why people believe that he behaved corruptly and who is lashing out at anyone and everyone in an attempt to justify himself and his own diminishing relevance.


We all know why Senator Brown's relevance and his grip on the Australian Greens is diminishing: because Senator Rhiannon is consciously and deliberately undermining Senator Brown's leadership. While Kevin Rudd has been white-anting Ms Gillard, Senator Rhiannon has been red-anting Senator Brown on this very issue. This started last year, when Senator Rhiannon's Democracy4$ale website featured criticisms of the Graeme Wood donation and reported allegations of Senator Brown's conflict of interest in relation to the Triabunna mill sale.


Since November, after Senator Brown was referred to the Privileges Committee for investigation over this matter, Senator Rhiannon's harping about the evils of corporate donations, particularly from property developers, has reached fever pitch. To quote a report from the Australian:


Angry Greens believe Senator Rhiannon set out to embarrass her leader over the privileges reference with a string of media releases and press conferences over donations and a notice of motion on lobbyists as the Senate vote loomed and in its aftermath … 'It's too much of a coincidence,' one Greens insider insisted.


I'll say it is! Now Senator Rhiannon's criticism has become explicit. In the current issue of the Monthly, featuring the rift in the Greens, Senator Rhiannon is quoted as saying this about the almost $1.7 million donation to the Greens negotiated by Senator Brown with Wotif founder, Graeme Wood:


We—


the New South Wales Greens—


would have considered that a large donation from one person—considering we have worked very hard and in some ways we have led the campaign around political donations—may not have been wise for us.


It is no wonder that Greens insiders believe Senator Rhiannon is deliberately undermin­ing Senator Brown's leadership. What she is saying to Senator Brown, to her colleagues and to the Greens membership, is that Senator Brown was unwise to take the donation from Mr Wood and that, had Senator Rhiannon been in the same position, she would not have.


As each day goes past, the Australian people are recognising that the Australian Greens are a party of contradictions. On the one hand they garner votes by pretending to be a cuddly party of tree huggers who are holier than thou in their approach to their finances and policies, whilst on the other hand they harvest massive political donations which they attempt to hide from the public. The Greens holier-than-thou claim that they cannot be bought is put to rest when you look at some of the political donations that they themselves have received. Corporate donations are horrendous. They are bad and they corrupt the democratic process—unless, of course, the Australian Greens are the beneficiaries of that donation. Absolute hypocrisy. The Australian people are waking up to the way that the Australian Greens operate and their gross hypocrisy. Led by Senator Bob Brown, their actions show them to be deceptive, dishonest and duplicitous. The Greens' hypocrisy is rank.




Senator Bob Brown:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order—two matters that might help guide the senator. One is that a matter has been put to the Privileges Committee and she should not trespass on that. The other is that there are standing orders about reflecting on honour­able members in this place. Senator Cash is new here, but she might read that standing order.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator Brown, I accept that those points should be considered; I have the standing orders in front of me. This debate will ride very close to the standing orders all the way through by nature of the content. There is a matter before the Privileges Committee, and I know all senators are aware of that. I will continue to listen very closely, Senator Brown. I am aware of the sensitivities, but my ruling is that it has not gone too far beyond normal debate at this point. I draw senators' attention to the issue of the Privileges Committee.




Senator CASH:
  The hypocrisy of the Greens is rank and transparent, and the Australian people are finally waking up to how the Greens do their politics in Australia—it is deceptive, it is dishonest and it is duplicitous.




Senator Bob Brown:
 Madam Acting Deputy President, on the matter of calumny: it is not allowed in this place to use epithets such as 'dishonest' against honourable members by using a class or generic term such as 'the Greens'. I ask you to look at that matter, Madam Acting Deputy President, and, if you do not care to judge it now, to ask the President to rule on it.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
):  Senator Brown, I will do that. My understanding, though, is that such terms have been regularly used in this place and that therefore there is considerable precedent. Direct imputation cannot be used; however, at this stage it is general. I will seek a ruling—I think that is appropriate—and I ask Senator Cash to be aware of that as she continues her contribution.




Senator CASH:
  This is exactly what the Australian Greens represent in this place: one standard for everybody else and a completely different standard—or is it rather absolutely no standards?—for the Australian Greens.


I say to Senator Bob Brown: withdraw your criticisms of the President of the Senate; apologise to him and apologise to Senator Ludwig; stop scapegoating the Prime Minister of Australia for your own predica­ment; and then remove your trumped up notices of motion against Senator Boswell, Senator Joyce and me from the Notice Paper. I do not expect an apology from Senator Brown, but I do think that Senator Bob Brown should think very carefully about apologising to both Senator Joyce and Senator Boswell.


I finish with a question to Senator Bob Brown. Last week it was revealed that Mr Wood's almost $1.7 million donation to the Australian Greens, which we know funded the Australian Greens' advertising campaign, was in kind; I ask Senator Brown whether or not Mr Wood received any benefit for that donation?




Senator Bob Brown:
  Madam Acting Deputy Speaker, that is clearly trespassing on a matter which the honourable senator's party put before the Privileges Committee via the President. Senator Cash does not know or understand the rules, even with Senator Abetz sitting behind her—though he is unable to advise her—but she should be asked to desist from breaching standing orders.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brown, you make a valid point, and I draw Senator Cash's attention to it. The Senate has referred the issue to the Privileges Committee, and the issue is before it.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,"<title>Brown, Senator Bob</title>",MOTIONS,29,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2012-02-09,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:47): How ignominious it is that Senator Cash ended by breaching the rules which she came in here to say should be upheld and that she did so in such a way that Senator Abetz has now fled the chamber. It is quite extraordinary.


Senator Cash's motion was debated at great length in the chamber just the day before yesterday, and Senator Cash took no role in it—she had no contribution to make. But today, no doubt aided and abetted by people who have more influence on the opposition then she does, she has brought forward this motion and made quite a hash of trying to substantiate any point in it. It is, of course, a motion to discuss personalities and politics rather than anything germane to or with any impact on the electorate. Therefore, to raise the level of debate from where Senator Cash began it, I intend to move that her motion be amended so that the following words are inserted after 'Senator Cash':


but considers the call from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Abbott) to debate Australia's economy, and his proposals which would lead to a $70 billion deficit and extensive job losses, as a more appropriate matter for debate in the Opposition's private senators' time.


The honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, began the week saying 'bring it on'—he wanted to discuss the economy. However, I understand from news reports that he has not been able to do that in the House. Here we have a sterling opportunity to have a debate about the economy, and Senator Cash crashes right across it with this very petty and pretty poor motion, thereby using up the opposition's own private senators' time. Any reader of the Hansard is going to wonder what on earth has happened to this opposition. Senator Cash has only two colleagues in here out of the whole lot of them—there is nobody in here to listen to the debate. According to the opposition, the time allotted to debate this notice of motion is an opportunity to waste time. But as far as the Greens are concerned it is an important opportunity to talk about issues which the electorate is interested in reflecting upon. My proposed amendment to the motion is currently being circulated amongst members so that they can see the merit in it and, hopefully, vote for it so that at the end of the day a substantial motion, rather than the frivolous one Senator Cash brought before the chamber, is passed.


When, as we moved halfway through this period of government, Mr Robb, the honour­able shadow finance minister, revealed that there was a $70 billion deficit in the opposition's policies, there was a fair amount of shock. I was among those who were shocked; I had had the excellent economist in my own Greens policy unit look at the opposition's policies, and the report had come back to me saying that, in the assess­ment of the economist, there was a $70 billion deficit in what the opposition was putting forward. I am loath to admit this, because I know how vulnerable one is to any admission in parliament, but I said to my policy unit: 'Look, that's incredible; the public won't believe that. Can you come back with a more modest deficit in the opposition policy?' They were working on that at the time Mr Robb came out and confirmed that the economists were correct. This opposition says, 'Put us into office and we'll give you a $70 billion deficit.' Mr Hockey said that the coalition faced the task of finding $50 billion, $60 billion or $70 billion and Mr Robb again confirmed that $70 billion was 'the order of magnitude' as recently as November. What an extraordi­nary failure this is of a conservative opposi­tion which is dedicated to returning a surplus in the interests of the Australian people.


What is the penalty clause for that $70 billion that Senator Cash and her colleagues would run Australia into deficit with if we put it into more human terms? I can tell you that this would facilitate their friends at the big end of town at the expense of average Australians and their hospitals, their schools, their security, their roads, their public trans­port, Indigenous welfare, the environment, rural extension services. Senator Cash and her colleagues would rip that apart with massive spending in the interests of their particular section of the community, but to the detriment of everybody else.


We know that the first point of attack of the opposition, were they to get into government under their honourable leader Mr Abbott, will be the Public Service. We have heard from the opposition themselves—Senator Cash has not said this, but her more senior colleagues have—that some tens of thousands of Public Service jobs will go immediately. This country's voters need to know that and to understand that there will be a lot of breadwinners who are going to find themselves at home without a job if Senator Cash and her colleagues make it into government. I am not making this up; this is their own assessment of their own policies.


Senator Cash does not want to talk about that. She wants to be petty and to recycle debates from earlier in the week—during which she failed to make any contribution whatsoever—to fill up time on a Thursday afternoon, when you would think the opposition, if it did want a debate on the economy, would be in full flight. The only flight it is making is out of this chamber. All but three of them are missing right now. You have to wonder if this is an opposition the public expects in any way. It is totally bereft.


The government says it wants to end up in the black. The coalition wants a one per cent surplus rather than the 0.1 or 0.2 per cent that the government intends. That would mean finding more than an additional $10 billion. Take that out of health and education and transport and housing and so on. If it is to start funding the dental health and disability insurance aspirations to which Mr Abbott referred at the Press Club, it will need even more tax increases or spending cuts.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, you would know that at the moment the Green's spokesperson on health, Senator Richard Di Natale, who is from Victoria, is negotiating with the Minister for Health on the health insurance legislation, which is before us at the moment. The Greens have a long-held policy based on community feedback that would produce a much better dental health scheme for this country. We have led that debate here. I have been pursuing that, even through the long drought of the Howard years, which represents the philosophy of Senator Cash. Not only did we not see an improvement in dental health care services, but we also saw a perfectly good scheme that helped pensioners and others get ripped out while the coal industry and others were being given hundreds of millions of dollars under the rule of Senator Cash and her colleagues. She was not here when pensioners were having their dental health scheme abolished, but she was part of the apparatus.


That is only a shade of what is to come if Senator Cash and her colleagues have their way. All her senior colleagues are missing from the chamber in this important debate. If the Abbot-led coalition, which I see is on the slide in the polls, were to come to govern­ment—I note in passing that Senator Cash's criticism about the appearance of the Greens in public comes with an increase in the Greens' position in the poll this week from 11 to 13 per cent. Senator Cash finds that amusing and so that is something we can celebrate together.


Senator Cash has an obsession with my good colleague from New South Wales, Senator Lee Rhiannon. Senator Cash is there with the poor old Murdoch media trying to create division and isolation. Is it me who is isolated, or is it Senator Rhiannon? I don't know. Use your time on that, Senator Cash, as you will, but the public see it as a missed opportunity and an abrogation of your duty if you do not come forward with policies other than the $70 billion black hole. They see it generally as a failure to get on with the job of putting forward a program that the voters of Australia might find exciting. I think it is far too much for me to suggest that there be a vision as well as a program brought forward. The amendment that I am proposing, which I hope the Senate will take up, leads me back to the issue of the Hon. Mr Robb, the shadow finance minister, suggesting that commodity prices could come off more than the govern­ment is forecasting in the coming years and there would consequently be a deficit of $50 billion. He did that in an interview on Lateline on 29 November last year. Given the rhetoric of the coalition about avoiding deficits, you are left with the conclusion that this would require them to find that addition­al $50 billion in savings. What we get to here is a completely hollow concoction from the opposition if they are going to respond with more than criticism of this minority Gillard government and where it is going.


We have an opposition that has no substance. It is very good at personal abuse. It does not like putting on the boxing gloves if it cannot fight below the belt—and Senator Cash has just demonstrated that again here today. What a sad lot of opposition members we have in this chamber. You would have thought that, if this situation in the country is as difficult as they say it is, the opposition would have a very substantial motion before the Senate in private members' time on Thursday afternoon with some constructive alternative to put to the people of Australia. Instead of that, as their shadow finance minister, the Hon. Mr Robb, has pointed out, their current policy platform would lead us into a $70 billion black hole.


What Senator Cash has done in bringing forward this motion is just attack personalities and events. She failed under the Senate program to make any contribution whatever, and left this till Thursday after­noon. If she had wanted to make a real construction for the Senate in this important private members' time of the week, there would have been a motion presenting legisla­tion, presenting an innovation, testing out the Senate to take a lead in public discourse. Instead of that, it has all been scuttlebutt and petty personality disputation coming from Senator Cash. What a lost opportunity.


Mr Acting Deputy President, for 13 years there was effectively no private members' time for discussion of bills during the Howard years. And you will remember that they took over the Senate and used it as a rubber stamp; they dishonoured its long tradition of being a watchdog for the people. But, having got the opportunity after the vote of the people of Australia in 2010, the Greens established, amongst other things, private members' time dedicated to legislat­ion in both houses of parliament. When I asked my office to look at this just this week, it found that my team—every one of whom works hard and is an innovative thinker and is constructive in this place—has produced no fewer than 45 pieces of legislation to benefit the people of Australia. The coali­tion, with three times as many members on the opposition benches in the Senate, has produced the princely sum of five. There you get it: a ratio where the Greens output in constructive legislation per person is 20 times-plus that of Senator Cash and her colleagues. And if Senator Cash has got a piece of legislation on the slate I do not know where it is.


It is very easy to come in here and waste time. It is much more difficult to come in with constructive ideas. Senator Cash menti­oned the intergovernmental agreement on forests in Tasmania. It was a Labor govern­ment which made the monumental break­through, in the wake of great public protests in Western Australia, on the back of moves by the Liberals at the time to protect at least a substantial component of the great forests of Western Australia, though there is more work to be done there. But Senator Milne and I and, indeed, the whole team of Greens are very proud to be working towards the protection of the world renowned forests of Tasmania. The National Geographic, for example, has been in Tasmania and is well aware that the tallest flowering forests on the face of the planet are a perfect complement to the giant redwood forests of California, which are of enormous interest right around the planet.


But Senator Cash and her colleagues—not least, of course, Senator Abetz—are chain­saw driven. They want to put the bulldozers into these World Heritage-value forests. They are flying in the face of 80 per cent of public opinion around the country that says 'protect them'. Again, she raised the issue. I would say to Senator Cash: go out and talk to the people of Australia, not least in your own state, and see what they think about protect­ing wildlife habitat, about preventing the extraordinary rate of extinct­ion of species in this country. Go beyond the carping and petty politics that so often is exhibited at this time on Thursday afternoon and, instead, think about what it is that makes a community happy.


I have adverted to the failure of the opposition to come up with an economic policy—except one which will leave a $70 billion black hole and see the wholesale sacking of public servants and the defunding of hospitals, schools, housing and public transport. But there are other values in life as well. This is an opposition which is riddled with climate change sceptics and opposed to action to prevent the pollution of our atmosphere, which is an enormous threat to lifestyle and happiness as well as to the future economy. Wouldn't this have been a great opportunity for Senator Cash to have outlined the opposition's environment poli­cies? Certainly if she had done that her 17-minute speech might have been more like 17 seconds—but there must be something there. There must be some recognition of the environment somewhere in the opposition that they could latch onto and bring forward here. How different it is to the days of the Hon. Malcolm Fraser, who not only protect­ed Fraser Island but stopped whaling in this country and had a regard for the environment which was nowhere to be seen in opposition ranks in 2011.


My amendment is to change this pretty poor-quality motion to one that has substan­ce. I recommend it to the Senate. I hope that the Senate will see fit to alter the words in the way that I have proposed when the vote comes up.

Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (17:07):  I have to say this is a disappointing end to the sitting week. I am not surprised, given that sniping from opposition senators has typified the sitting period. Opposition senators apparently think it is more useful to use the chamber to snipe at other senators than to use their time to develop and detail alternative policies for the nation. As ever, there are no plans, no policies, no alternat­ives that the opposition Liberal and National parties are prepared to discuss. Really they should be in here outlining their ideas for managing the Australian economy, making the country more productive and helping Australian workers, families, pensioners, farmers and small businesses. But alas, that is too much to hope for.


The government has been consistently clear on this issue: the Senate should not become a Star Chamber. The government has been consistent in its view that it will not use Senate motions to condemn individuals, the public, members of the House or other senators. The use of motions as tactics to personally attack or name senators is completely inappropriate. There are proper procedures to deal with any matters which may arise regarding the behaviour of sena­tors. If we are to be respected as a chamber, we must respect the processes of the chamber. There are processes in place that should be used, and the Senate should always provide procedural fairness.


The Senate is not and should not be the place to examine a senator's individual behaviour as has happened in motions such as those we have seen in the last two days for general business debate. There should be no room for undermining the processes of the Senate or indulging in personal attacks. It reflects poorly on the opposition and, more importantly, it reflects poorly on the chamber and all senators. The government will not be addressing the substance of the issue raised in Senator Cash's motion today, nor will we partake in such ad hoc debate in the future. I am disappointed that during this week estab­lished processes have been tested. In my opinion and in the opinion of the government the Senate has wasted its time on personal attacks. This should not be a place of duel­ling motions attacking individual senators. This is a chamber for considered review of legislation.


I know I am quite new to the position of Manager of Government Business, but I had expected that the element of cooperation for reaching the best outcomes for the Australian community would be more typical of Senate debate. 




Senator Brandis:
  If you mean what you say, will you chastise Senator Conroy?




Senator ARBIB:
  Let me be clear: the government believes there are established and well-tested methods for dealing with the conduct of senators, and Senator Brandis knows them quite well. It is our intention to support these processes and we will support the rulings of the President in relation to matters of determining precedence on any privilege motions. The position of President will continue to be respected by the govern­ment. The position of President is an inher­ently difficult one—we all know that—and we will continue to support the duties he exercises with proper process and fairness. I remind the chamber that, as the President said yesterday, a determination of whether a matter requires precedence is in no way a reflection on, or a preliminary assessment of, the facts. It is for the Senate as a whole, not the President, to determine whether matters should be referred to the Privileges Committee.


As I have already said, general business should be about discussing matters of substance. This chamber should have a high standard of debate on issues and challenges facing this country. Debating quotes out of context, and senators spending time settling scores and pursuing minor personal argu­ments, should not become the standard of debate in this place. The government has a significant agenda of reform. During a period when the world faces ongoing insecurity about economic stability, the government is determined to keep our economy strong, create new jobs, invest in our country and make our economy more productive. The opposition unfortunately rejected most of those policies last year and we have seen that typified in the debates this week.


We have all heard their noes, but what are the opposition's answers? What plans do coalition senators have for this country? We await their policies. I am sure that senators opposite do have views and do have ideas. Why do they not use the opportunities in this place to argue for their alternative vision? Even I am not so jaded that I assume oppo­sition senators have no ideas and just want to indulge in petty squabbles. Now is the time to outline for the country your policies to make this a better place and to improve the quality of life of our people. Use the time; end the squabbles. These are the critical issues challenging the country. These are the critical issues that should be debated in this chamber. The government will not support the motion and will not support any motions like these in the future.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:14):  What we have just witnessed again from Senator Bob Brown is yet another example of what I could only kindly call a clumsy deflection. He has attempted to direct the focus away from himself and from his colleagues because they do not like scrutiny and they do not like being accountable for their actions. I have listened to Senator Arbib preaching to us about what he considers to be good behaviour and all I can ask him is: what would the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd say in response to your comments about good behaviour? Your actions speak far louder than words and you have an incredibly high-handed approach to others that you do not practise yourself. Be very careful of what you preach to others if you are not prepared to practise it.


I have sat in this chamber with a heavy heart all this week. I agree with the concerns that Senator Arbib raised because Senator Brown continued to impugn the integrity of the presiding officer of this place, directing an unprecedented attack against the President, casting aspersions on his judg­ment, accusing him of prejudice and bias and, even more concerning, challenging the integrity in his presiding over the procedures and conduct in this chamber. There probably is not one senator that has not disagreed with a ruling that has been made at some time and I disagreed with one against myself only yesterday. It is the nature of this place. It is the nature of politics. We are elected to serve and to represent our constituents and, in so doing, the issues and debate in this place can become understandably heated, if not combative. It is the very nature of politics as we scrutinise and assess legislation and issues on the basis of what we believe is in the best interests of the nation.


Tragically, we have witnessed Senator Brown taking this prosecution to a new level. As for many footballers in the heat of a grand final or tennis players sweating over a tie-break to win game, set and match, the umpire is the ultimate arbiter. While we individually may not like his decision, it is essential for the integrity of any particular institution that the umpire's decision is final and, most importantly, respected. Regretta­bly, we have heard ad nauseam this week the protestations from Senator Brown that the umpire of this place—the presiding officer, the President of the Senate—should not have the final word. The events that have unfolded this week have reflected poorly on the judgment of Senator Brown rather than that of the President.


As the matters I referred to the Privileges Committee are currently under consideration, I do not wish to touch on those matters either, notwithstanding the fact that Senators Brown and Milne sought to do so earlier on in the week. I respect due Senate process and I believe it should be allowed to follow its due course. I note that Senator Brown has left the chamber. One wonders whether he has left the building, but he has most certainly left the chamber. The man who has created this issue has left the chamber.


What we have witnessed this week is a broadening of the vitriolic spray that the Greens leader directs at anyone who chooses to disagree with him. We all witnessed that with his dissent motion on the ruling of the President and his continued criticism of the President. As Senator Cash just mentioned, the first target of Senator Brown's wrath was Senator Ludwig following the Senate passing a motion of reference to the Privileges Committee as he gave notice of a motion to censor Senator Ludwig over the Tasmanian forests intergovernmental agreement. Senator Brown, for reasons which have already been speculated on, then withdrew this, only to give notice of a second motion calling on Senator Ludwig to report on the Prime Minister's failure to uphold the Tasmanian forests intergovernmental agreement.


On the last day of the Senate last year, Senator Brown engaged in a further tit-for-tat exercise with a letter to the President seeking precedence over allegations in relation to Senator Boswell—matters that had been clarified some 12 months earlier. Yet again, over the recess he wrote to the President in relation to Senators Joyce and Cash on matters that had already been declared in the senators' interest register. Unfortunately, what this has demonstrated is the obsessive behaviour of a leader who continues to shy away from personal public scrutiny and who is brutal in his language and demeanour when he seeks to deflect the focus. What we witnessed in this chamber this week was sadly nothing but bullyboy antics. I would suggest it was intimidatory behaviour, which only serves to diminish the standing of this place in the community. It most certainly diminishes the credibility of the individual. The significance of this behaviour cannot be underestimated as the attacks on many in this chamber, not least of all the President, have taken place while the cameras are rolling and Hansard records every word.


It begs the question: do these same histrionics happen behind closed doors or is it something else? When the cameras are turned off, what happens behind the scenes? This is a particular concern when Senator Brown is dubbed the Deputy Prime Minister and is privy to weekly private meetings with the Prime Minister. If his behaviour is erratic when the cameras are rolling, what is it like when the cameras are turned off?


When Senator Brown announced early in January that his weekly meetings with the Prime Minister were off until she honoured her commitment to Tasmania's native forests, I have to confess that I did wonder whether the Prime Minister considered it her lucky day and the best Christmas present she had received, even if it was a belated one.


An insight into the wobbly relationships among the Greens is starting to emerge. You know there are problems afoot when members inside the Greens party start briefing out on each other—and we saw evidence of that in the recent publication of the Monthly. Senator Brown has been making a great show of unity with Senator Rhiannon of late but, unfortunately for them, the facts do not support this. According to the Monthly:


While both Brown and Rhiannon insist they work well together—and others attest to this—there is little love lost between them. ""I know Bob doesn't like Lee and I know Lee doesn't like Bob,"" says one insider. In 2009, Brown opposed Rhiannon's nomination for the Senate, instead backing Kate Faehrmann, the then 39-year-old executive director of the New South Wales Nature Conservation Council, who went on to win election to the New South Wales upper house. ""We need to be bringing new blood into the Greens. Those of us who came out of the 1980s have contributed a lot, but our job is becoming one of elder statespeople,"" Brown said in a pointed reference to Senator Rhiannon.


Without going to the substance of the allegations against Senator Brown, Senator Rhiannon and her 'eastern bloc comrades' have been excoriating about the Wood donation. On 10 January 2011, New South Wales Greens MP John Kaye issued a statement, which is on the Democracy for Sale website, disassociating the New South Wales Greens from this donation. He said:


Almost none of Mr Wood's $1.6 million was spent in New South Wales. … The Greens New South Wales election campaign did not have any involvement in accepting this money or determining how it would be spent.


On 12 January, Democracy for Sale featured an editorial from the Australian headed '$1.6 million donation sits strangely with Greens rhetoric'. On 17 June, Democracy for Sale featured another piece from the so-called hate media, an article entitled 'Brown faces conflict call over logging query'. And there is yet more. Since November last year, Senator Rhiannon's calls for donations reform have gone into overdrive. Senator Rhiannon has now gone on record in the Monthly to say this about the Wood donation:


We, the New South Wales Greens, would have considered that a large donation from one person, considering we have worked very hard and in some ways we have led the campaign around political donations, may not have been wise for us.


If this is not putting the skids under Senator Brown then I do not know what it is. We know about the friction between the Australian Greens and the New South Wales Greens. As recorded by the Monthly, the New South Wales group, who habitually refer to the Australian Greens as though they were another party, has staunchly resisted Brown's attempts to strengthen the Greens' national organisation. Members of the old guard have been heard referring to Brown as a megalomaniac. Another insider says: 


They have poisoned Bob's image in New South Wales. They have made him out to be a centrist and trying to bully them and control everyone and take away the power of states' rights.


Senator Brown is still not in the chamber, but I am sure he can get this on Hansard. I might send him an email just to make sure he sees it. Senator Brown, we can see right through your facade. We can see that your wild and random attacks on senators are driven not just by the predicament you find yourself in right now but by the internal politics and dissension within your own party. I support Senator Cash's call. I think you should apolo­gise to the President, to Senator Ludwig, to Senator Boswell, to Senator Cash and to Senator Joyce. I think you should come clean on this whole thing. It was disclosed only last week that Mr Graeme Wood's $1.6 million donation to the Australian Greens was an in-kind donation. Senator Brown, how does one give an in-kind donation of advertising to the Australian Greens?


I understand that Senator Brown has been dragooning all his young Greens senators to support him in the chamber here this evening. I find that a tad strange when he himself is not sitting here in the chamber. But I would like to note that Senator Rhiannon is sitting up in the back. Senator Rhiannon, where do you stand on this? I look forward to hearing from you in this chamber now to defend your leader, Senator Brown.




Senator Milne:
  Mr Acting Deputy Presi­dent, the standing orders provide for matters to be raised through the chair, not through a direct call across the chamber. I ask Senator Kroger to respect the standing orders.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  All senators should abide by the standing orders at all times.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,"<title>Brown, Senator Bob</title>",MOTIONS,29,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2012-02-09,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:29):  I rise today to comment on a matter that Senator Cash has raised, and I share the concern of my leader, Senator Bob Brown, that this private members' time is being taken up by a matter allowing the coalition to continue a personal attack instead of dealing with matters of public importance. I mentioned this yesterday when Senator Sinodinos took the opportunity, in an incredible fall from grace, to spend his first matter of public importance for the year engaged in a personal attack on another senator rather than outlining a coalition policy or strategy.


The normal procedure for matters of public importance is to talk about matters that are important to the future of the nation, and I move:


That Senator Cash's motion be amended to insert the following words after 'Senator Cash':


but considers the call from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Abbott) to debate Australia's economy, and his proposals which would lead to a $70 billion deficit and extensive job losses, as a more appropriate matter for debate in the Opposition's private senators' time.


I have a signed copy of the amendment and ask that it be delivered to the chair.


As to the matter of the coalition's black hole, it is quite extraordinary that the coalition would prefer to use private members' time to, in Senator Kroger's own words, 'be clumsily deflective and to refuse to have scrutiny and accountability for their actions'. That is precisely what the coalition is doing in relation to economic policy. What we have already is confirmation by Mr Robb, the shadow finance minister, of a $70 billion black hole, and Mr Hockey, of course, confirmed that, saying that the coalition faced the task of finding $50, $60 or $70 billion worth of savings. Mr Robb again confirmed in November last year that $70 billion was the order of magnitude of the coalition's black hole.


People listening to this debate must be asking themselves, 'How are the coalition going to deliver the surplus they say that they are going to deliver, when there is a $70 billion black hole already in their promises?' The coalition have said they want surpluses of one per cent of GDP rather than the 0.01 to 0.02 per cent that the government intends. That would mean finding more than an additional $10 billion a year. We heard from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, at the Press Club, his aspirations on dental health and disability insurance—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 90(3):


An amendment must be relevant to the question to which it is proposed to be made.


I am aware, of course, that when it comes to debate on the MPI a great deal of latitude is given to recharacterise the question before the chair by way of amendment. However, I submit to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that an amendment in the form which this has proposed goes a very long way beyond the latitude that is customarily given. The proposition it advances is that the Senate form the opinion—the amendment has just been handed to me—that a particular subject matter would have been a more appropriate matter for debate in opposition senators' private time. I do not recall ever having seen an amendment of this character. It is not an amendment which addresses the substantive issue which it seeks to raise—that is, the economy and criticism of the opposition's alternative policy proposals—but rather something entirely different. It is as it were by way of commentary upon the appropriate­ness of Senator Cash moving the motion she has moved. 


Mr Acting Deputy President, I invite you to rule that this amendment falls beyond the terms of standing order 90(3) because it is utterly irrelevant to Senator Cash's motion. The expression of an opinion that Senator Cash would have been better off moving a different motion is utterly irrelevant to the issue which Senator Cash has placed before the Senate. Indeed, in substance—to take the point further—it is not really an amendment to the motion at all. It is grammatically in the form of an amendment, but in substance it is not even an amendment. It is a comment on whether or not Senator Cash should have moved the motion. In that sense as well it is beyond standing order 90.




Senator Chris Evans:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, I think Senator Brandis hit the nail on the head when he indicated that a great deal of licence had been allowed in these debates. I think that is right and, while I do not feel strongly on the issue, it seems to me, given the nature of the debate, it is probably not unreasonable to rule that the amendment is in order. But I have to say that senators ought to think about how they are treating the Senate and their own behaviour. This motion is a disgrace. The attempt to use general business and the time of the Senate in this way is a disgrace. It brings no credit on anyone; it brings no credit on the Senate, and this tit-for-tat, childless behaviour that is going on in the Senate is an embarrassment to us all. Mr Acting Deputy President, however you rule, I encourage all senators to have a good think about it.




Senator Kroger:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order, the amendment has not been distributed throughout the chamber. As opposition whip, I do not have a copy of it, and I understand the normal courtesy of the senator moving an amendment is to provide one so that we have an opportunity to look at it. We do not have copies throughout the chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  It is not a point of order that a proposed amendment has not been circulated.




Senator Kroger:
  Can we ask the attendants to circulate it?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, we will ask the attendants to circulate the amendment, but I am aware that Senator Brandis has received a copy of the amendment. Senator Brandis, on the point of order, the motion that is before the chair is extraordinarily wide. Its opening words refer to the reflections of a range of members of this place and another place, and in no way is that limited by the remaining content of the motion. The amendment that has been mov­ed by Senator Milne certainly to a limited extent comes within the known deliberations of a range of the persons referred to in the motion. By 'known deliberations' I mean comments that I have heard reported in the press or comments I have heard persons make in either chamber. Accordingly, whilst the amendment is very wide and at a distance from the motion, I do rule that it is in order. However, I have not had sufficient time to give more than cursory consideration to the points you raised, and the point you raised does have, in my mind, some substance and certainly some consequence. Accordingly, I will seek that the issue you have raised, whilst I rule against it now, be referred to the President for more considered deliberation and report back to the Senate, if he thinks appropriate, at a future time.




Senator MILNE:
  As I was indicating, what we have at the moment is rhetoric from the coalition about avoiding deficits that would require them to find an additional $50 billion a year in savings. In the Press Club speech the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said that by the end of a coalition government's term tax cuts 'will be in prospect'. What does that mean? Will be in prospect? Taken at face value, that suggests that there will be no tax cuts for at least four or five years. This policy seems to have lasted less than a day, because media reports then had spokespeople for the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, saying there will be tax cuts within the first term.


I also go to the issue of the clean energy package which passed through the Senate last year and in which there is considerable benefit to Australians, with a $10 billion investment in clean energy—a huge investment in energy efficiency—announced today. I urge people in the community to be aware that there is over $200 million that the community can now apply for for energy efficiency grants that have been announced today as part of that package. The coalition would abolish all of those and yet it is out there telling the community that it supports renewable energy whilst at exactly the same time saying it will not support the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.


Interestingly, in that context in Tasmania you have the opposition—the Liberal Party in Tasmania—saying that the government should try to leverage off the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for Tasmania to have a whole strategy in renewable energy. It is quite clear that Mr Groom, the spokesperson, and Mr Hodgman, the Leader of the Oppo­sition in Tasmania, have not spoken to their federal colleague Senator Abetz, because Senator Abetz would be able to tell them that they ought not talk about leveraging off the Clean Energy Finance Corporation when he intends to make sure it does not happen and that Tasmania gets no benefit from it in that circumstance.


Equally, we have Mr Groom and Mr Hodgman out there saying they want a second Basslink. They want to get that out of the Connecting Renewables Initiative, which the federal government has on the go. They are saying, 'We want some of that money for Tasmania.' Meanwhile we have the coalition saying that it has a $70 billion black hole. It is going to sack public servants and somehow it is going to add tax cuts. It is going to get all the benefits, supposedly, of compensation and so on. This is a complete mess from the coalition in terms of an economic policy. No wonder Senator Cash does not want to talk about the coalition's policy; she does not want to have any scrutiny or any accountability for her actions in relation to the economy. 


Let me move onto the issue of the mining boom. The Greens supported the resources super profits tax that was broadly in line with the Henry proposals. And we regret the fact that the government backed off the super profits tax, because it would have been appropriate to take excessive profits in the midst of a minerals boom and put them in a sovereign wealth fund in order to help Australia invest in public health and public education—particularly in light of the fact that under the Howard years there was such underfunding of education.


We hollowed out the manufacturing sector. We failed, under the Howard govern­ment, to invest in education and training. We turned this economy into a far less sophisticated economy. We turned it into a quarry economy, and that is why the coalition are now struggling with their economics. They have a situation where they cannot indicate how they intend to make up the $70 billion black hole in their strategy.


I want to go onto the super profits tax and the mining issues because Senator Cash is one of those who thundered against the proposal that the standard petroleum excise would apply to condensate from the North West Shelf. She was one who wanted to make sure that they did not pay an appropriate return—that they did not pay the taxpayers for the resources they were taking, that are owned by the community. There is an appropriate return to be had by the community from the resources of this country, and in the view of the Greens that should be spent on building the new economy—on building diversification and sophistication in the economy, investing in new manufacturing sectors and, in particular, investing heavily in education, training and pure research as well as applied research, because Australia happens to be very good at innovation. Australia happens to be very good at coming up with solutions to problems in particular technological areas. That is why we have such a fantastic global reputation when it comes to the solar industry in particular and the renewable industry. I am very pleased to say that it is because of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the clean energy package that we now see people wanting to come home from overseas, back to Australia, to get behind the transition to the low-carbon economy and create the manufacturing industries of the future.


We are at a stage in Australia and in the world, in fact, where the race is on to make the breakthroughs that are necessary in the technologies, whether that is solar, wind or batteries for electric cars. We are looking at a global race to be first in getting the breakthroughs that will rapidly accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. That is what the Greens have been working on with the government to try to achieve through the clean energy package. We have seen the coalition oppose it, oppose it, oppose it. They do not want to see a transition to a low-carbon economy; they want to lock in coalmining—a massive expansion of coalmining in Queensland. In fact, they are massive coalmines that will lead to an increase in global greenhouse gas emissions. They talk up cheap energy at the expense of the environment and an acceleration of climate change and global warming. They deny global warming exists for the most part. They want to see an expansion of fossil fuel industries at the end of the fossil fuel age, when our whole competitive advantage in the future depends on us leaving those fossil fuels behind and making the massive transition. It is a fundamental difference of approach. That is where these debates ought to go.


As I was indicating a moment ago, in terms of fairness and income equality, we had here this morning a motion that I brought forward to address the duopoly of Coles and Woolworths, which is absolutely undermining the farm-gate price return for rural communities across Australia. The coalition, the National Party and the Liberal Party, voted it down with the government.




Senator Ryan:
  Since when have you cared about farmers? What are dairy farmers going to do with a carbon tax?




Senator MILNE:
  You voted it down and, tragically, there are farmers across the country who are going to the wall. We had the Queensland dairy farmers showing exactly what the milk price war has done to them, including the losses at the farm gate over time—the downward spiral that is going on. Exactly the same will now occur with Coles's discounting of fruit and vegetables—a 50 per cent reduction in the price of some lines of fruit and vegetables. Where will that leave the growers? How long is that discount in place?



Senator Brandis interjecting—



Senator Ryan interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  The word 'hypocritical' has been used in here. Let me say, in relation to the Liberal Party and National Party's position when it comes to farmers and farm-gate prices, whenever Coles and Woolworths are mentioned they get up on their soapbox in communities around Australia saying they are doing everything they can to address the duopoly. Then, when you bring things in here which will actually start to address that, they vote against it because, when push comes to shove, they are not prepared to stand up for a decent farm-gate price.


This goes to the bigger picture issue of food security and food sovereignty in Australia. I would love to have a private member's debate in here at length on the issue of how you keep farmers on the land in Australia when they are under assault from coal seam gas, which the coalition totally support. Every last one of them is out there supporting the gas companies against the farmers. We are seeing the water resources of Australia compromised by coal seam gas miners and, behind them, the coalition totally support them and then get up and say they support farmers. Well, they are not support­ing farmers in the Year of the Farmer. They are not supporting lifting productivity on farms. How is it lifting productivity when you drive a farmer off the land with coal seam gas expansion? How is that lifting productivity? How is polluting and compro­mising the Great Artesian Basin lifting agricultural productivity? It is not.


We have got a situation here where, if you are serious about keeping farmers on the land and protecting and sustaining the land for food and agricultural production, you would be looking at issues like, first of all, the planning laws that allow so much agricult­ural land to go under urban expansion around the country, you would be looking at issues like forcing the supply chain, and you would be looking at issues like the margin of each stage of the supply chain, so that we could find out with Coles—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, don't you love it when people stand up and make a big issue of respecting the procedures of the chamber and then they just cannot help themselves but interject at length. I am on my feet now speaking. They will have their turn in a moment.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Opposition speakers in this debate were listened to in absolute silence. The same courtesy should be extended to Senator Milne. Senator Milne, you were correct to raise that with me.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was just discussing the Coles and Woolworths duopoly and what is going on with Coles at the moment. What we should be debating in here this afternoon is how we can get an answer out of Coles. They are saying on the one hand that they are going to reduce the price of certain lines of fruit and vegetables by 50 per cent and they are saying that that will not have a long-term impact on farmers. In fact, they are saying that they are doing a great thing by the farmers by taking their surplus product. However, what is going on is that they have clearly negotiated a lower price with the farmers without guaranteeing a volume in return that they will take or a period of time over which they will take any particular volume. What is to say that farmers have not signed onto a low price in a time of glut, if you like, around the country and then will be forced to take lower prices into the long term?


Furthermore, while Coles will deny it, it is very clear that Coles will not be suffering a margin drop in its profits. It will spread the loss across the supermarket to make sure that it is not out of pocket, but the farmers will be pushed to a lower level of return at the farm gate. At some point farmers have to decide whether it is worth continuing in the business of farming, and that is why we are suffering in Australia at the moment. With the average age of farmers increasing, younger people are deciding that they are not going to go on the land because they have watched their families struggle all these years for less and less of a return. That is the kind of debate we should be having in here this afternoon, and we should be taking on this duopoly. We should be looking at it.


On Australia Day I was sickened to see big Australian flags over the tops of canned products in supermarkets. The assumption of the consumer is that if you buy this product then you are supporting something Australian, but we do not know that. The labelling laws in this country would allow the supermarkets to import vegetables from overseas by the container load, put them in those cans, stick an Australian flag on the front of the can and then lead consumers to believe that they are somehow supporting Australian farmers. That goes to the heart of the issue of trade, which is another issue we should be debating in here. We do not have fair trade under the current arrangements that have been entered into.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator MILNE:
  The coalition members are interjecting but they are the ones who oversaw the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. The former Minister for Trade Mark Vaile ran around the country telling people in rural Australia that there would be hundreds of thousands of jobs created in Australia because of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It was a sell-out, and the Productivity Commission has now pointed out that the claims were wildly exaggerated and that the benefits have not ensued as a result of that agreement.


Now the US is coming back with the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement, which is being negotiated as I speak. The whole Australian community has no clue what the Americans will ask for under this Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement because the US is insisting that the negotiating documents are kept secret for four years after it is negotiated. That is not on. I understand from leaks that have been made in other countries that are in these negotiations that the US is coming back with big pharmaceuticals to try to extend the patent period so that the generic medicines cannot be made sooner. The result will be more expensive medicines for people in Australia and in developing countries. Equally, Monsanto is coming into that agreement wanting to overturn any restrict­ions on GMOs. We have a moratorium in Tasmania and we do not allow it there, but Monsanto will be coming back to try to overturn that. We also have proposed changes to copyright. They are trying to get rid of Australian content in the Australian media and communication rules. We have an issue here that warrants a debate.


We have been asking the government to come clean and tell the Australian people what they are negotiating in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. What are they going to sell and give up? What are they about to trade away under an agreement where there is no indication at all that this is anything more than a big geopolitical move to suit the United States, rather than offering any benefit to this country? That is what we should be debating. We should be looking at the broader issues; and, frankly, the Abbott opposition is not up to it.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,"<title>Brown, Senator Bob</title>",MOTIONS,29,1,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2012-02-09,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (17:56):  Before I address the substantive motion of Senator Cash I cannot let some of the allegations of Senator Arbib and Senator Milne go past. Being lectured to by Senator Arbib about good behaviour in politics is like being lectured to about the respect for law by Chopper Read. New South Wales is a killing field of disgrace and Labor leaders due to his influence and that of people like him. Under his guidance the New South Wales ALP became as much a racket as it was a political party. And who were the caporegimes of that mob? They were the New South Wales state secretaries—the heads of the New South Wales right.


He asks for ideas, as Senator Milne has. We have been pushing these ideas for several years now. They are simple: stop the new taxes, cut red tape, cut spending, balance the budget and pay back debt. It is actually pretty simple, but it is so hard for Labor to do because they have never ever managed it. If you do not get the basics right, all the grand schemes, all the best endeavours and all the highest aspirations are nothing short of meaningless.


Senator Milne has talked about the use of time in this chamber, which just proves that the Greens have no sense of irony. Day after day we sit in this place amid meaningless divisions that serve no purpose other than to print new bumper stickers for bikes in Fitzroy, where the Greens can run around and claim to be morally superior, pitching themselves to the morally superior class who do not bear the cost of the policies they seek to implement. For Senator Milne to come in here and talk about the impact on farmers when the carbon tax is going to force up the costs of Australian dairy farmers, who make the milk that Senator Milne is talking about and who are going to see cost increases of 10 to 20 per cent in only a handful of years, is nothing short of complete hypocrisy. I have little doubt that Senator Milne would have opposed the repeal of the Corn Laws, because cheap food is apparently a bad thing.


What we saw yesterday in the comments by Senator Bob Brown with respect to the ruling of the President represented a new low. All the President did was not grant precedence to a motion moved by Senator Brown; nothing more and nothing less. This is entrusted to the responsibility of the President's judgment, granted by the Senate by virtue of his election to the office. Senator Brown illustrated his complaint by outlining that the ruling of the President in such matters is often adopted by the chamber, quoting a report from several decades ago. This does not strengthen his argument; it merely reinforces that his grievance was with the decision itself rather than with a substant­ive issue. It is not formally determinative and it merely illustrates that the judgment of the President, which was exercised in this place, is important.


Senator Brown confused the issue here. The fact that allegations are made does not necessarily warrant any particular outcome. That is a matter for consideration at another time. As Senator Brown did not get his way in his motion of dissent, he used extraordin­ary language. The key tactic of the militant left was again illustrated when they failed to get their desired outcome: sledge and impugn the decision, judgment, person and indeed the motives of those with whom you disagree. To Senator Bob Brown and the Greens civil disagreement is not possible. Senator Brown also filed notices of motion, which he then admitted should not have been granted precedence. That represents an abuse of the procedures in this place. It does him, the Greens in particular and this parliament no favours.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This document is the Tourism Australia Report for 2010-11. Tourism in Australia at present is suffering from a number of factors, one of which is clearly the high Australian dollar. The tourism industry in North Austra­lia and the north of the state that I represent in this chamber is experiencing particularly difficult times. There are iconic tourism destinations like the Whitsundays, a fabulous area. For those who might be listening, the Whitsundays are better than the Greek Islands for a sailing experience and for the resorts around there. They are slightly off the beaten track but there are good air services into the Hamilton Island airport. But that community is struggling from, as I say, the high Australian dollar. The additional costs of getting to places like that that will be caused by the carbon tax when it is introduced will place yet another burden on a struggling industry.


The Australian government should be doing everything in its power to support places like the Whitsundays, Port Douglas and Cairns, all of which are struggling for the same reasons. Because of the high cost of travel associated by general cost-of-living increases—which have been a hallmark of the current government—the cost of getting to these places in Australia is far higher than it is for getting to places like Bali, Thailand or Vietnam. This is a real problem, and it is exacerbated by the fact that, under the Gillard government, not only have passport costs gone up for international visitors but things like the carbon tax will put an extra burden on tourism industries which desperately need assistance.


We talk in this chamber quite often, and I notice Senator Carr is a great advocate, a great champion of this—in his own mind at least—of the manufacturing industry. He throws figures like billions of dollars to the manufacturing industry and to the car industry—and that is in part something that over the years has been supported by our side of politics. But very little, if anything, goes to support one of the most significant industries in Australia—the tourism industry. The current federal government, and indeed the current Queensland government, seem incapable of devising any sort of program or assistance that would help those industries that are really doing it tough at the present time. The Queensland government is quite incapable of any financial assistance to the tourism industry. The Queensland govern­ment, as anyone who lives in my state of Queensland knows, is absolutely broke. The debt of the Queensland government is reaching the debt levels of the old Labor governments of Hawke and Keating—$96 billion. I think the last time I saw it, the debt incurred by the Queensland government was up around $90 billion. The Queensland government has sold everything it could get its hands on but is still what one might call broke. So we cannot expect any help from that direction. 


Some of the money that the Gillard government has spent on climate change and on bureaucrats and advertising would have been far better used had it been diverted to assisting the tourism industry in North Queensland and Northern Australia, which is doing it so tough at the moment. I make a plea to the Gillard government, before it is too late, to have another look at the carbon tax. Realise what sort of damage you are doing to Australian industries like aluminium and tourism and have a rethink. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (18:15):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I welcome this report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the funding of political parties in election campaigns and I welcome the recommend­ations of the committee, which proposes a better, more transparent and more account­able system for the funding of political parties and election campaigns. I think it is important to remind the Senate that the first term of reference for this inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which was agreed to by both the Senate and House of Representatives last May, was:


… options to improve the system for the funding of political parties and election campaigns, with particular reference to:


(a) issues raised in the Government’s Electoral Reform Green Paper - Donations, Funding and Expenditure, released in December 2008;


I think that that green paper, now more than three years old, stands the test of time. As Special Minister of State at that time, responsible for the production of the green paper, I remain very committed to addressing the challenges facing our electoral system that I identified then: the costs of election­eering leading to what I described as a 'campaigning arms race'; the adequacy of our electoral laws to deal with new media and new technologies; the rise of third-party participants in our electoral process and how their electoral activity should be regulated; and the complexity that we face with overlapping and confusing electoral systems for three tiers of government. In my introduction to the green paper I said:


In Australia, as in other democracies around the world, the potential for large and undisclosed sums of money in election and campaign financing has become more and more a matter of concern to the public. Perceptions of the potentially distorting nature of large donations—either cash or other resources—to political parties will degrade the public’s trust in the integrity of the political process. These perceptions of possible influence need not be only concerns about potential undue influence in the narrow sense of how government decisions are made, but in a broader sense: concerns that parties and politicians dependent on large donors will be if not compliant, then at least receptive, or that large donors may get access that others do not.


I went on:


The perception of undue influence can be as damaging to democracy as undue influence itself. It undermines confidence in our processes of government, making it difficult to untangle the motivation behind policy decisions. Electors are left wondering if decisions have been made on their merits.


In speeches I make to this chamber I rarely quote my own words and even more rarely do I quote my own words at such length, but I have done so on this occasion because I stand strongly by those words. I wanted to take this opportunity this evening to state clearly that, since I wrote those words, my commitment to reforming and improving our campaign and disclosure laws in Australia has not waned. Reform is desperately needed.


I want to see political parties and candidates subject to the toughest and most rigorous disclosure and accountability provi­sions possible in our electoral system. If that offends any vested interests on any side of politics, so be it. Frankly, I could not care less, because ensuring we have an electoral system of integrity in this country is paramount.


I also welcome the committee's clear support for the provisions of the Common­wealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill, which I originally introduced as Special Minister of State in 2008. That bill contained new disclosure and accountability proposals for which, despite my best efforts, I was unable to attain majority support in this chamber. Some of the measures contained in that bill—now, I am pleased to say, endorsed by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—include reducing the current donation disclosure threshold from the current indexed $11,900 to a set, non-indexed figure of $1,000; eliminating of the donations-splitting loophole whereby donors can give multiple donations of just less than the donation disclosure threshold to all the different branches or divisions of a political party without having to disclose anything at all; banning of overseas donations, which are wholly acceptable in the Australian system but which most countries in the world outlaw; and reducing the reporting periods for participants in the electoral system. These are all important steps in the right direction. If enacted, they will make our electoral funding and disclosure system more transparent and more accountable.


I must say, in concluding my remarks, that it is very disappointing, although not surprising, that the opposition has stated its trenchant opposition to these important reforms in its dissenting report. That is very disappointing. Australian politics deserves better.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (18:24):  Senator Faulkner's comments are very welcome but, quite frankly, unless the union movement and third parties are involved and covered by the framework of any legislation then it does not actually make a difference. I do not think the Australian Labor Party and their acolytes have had the political courage to take the hard decisions on this. It is all very well, Senator Faulkner, to make these comments but, I have to ask myself: had organisations like the HSU and other unions been covered would perhaps a lot of the highways and byways that we have traversed in relation to Mr Craig Thomson, and his time before he became a member, have been a lot easier—particularly in the dealings with Coastal Voice, many of which I have traversed in this chamber as well?

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:25):  It is an honour for me to follow Senator John Faulkner in this debate. I recognise that he has made a huge contribution, and I was very pleased when he came into the chamber to contribute a response to this report. When the green paper that he made reference to came out, it gave people who are following this issue closely and are campaigning for electoral funding reform great hope. Many of us actually felt great sadness when he was no longer the minister and we felt the chances of achieving reform had hit a roadblock and possibly gone backwards. Many people have said to me, and it is certainly my own feeling, that many of the recommendations in the report that we are considering now would have been fundamentally different if Senator Faulkner had still been the minister.


I was very pleased to hear Senator Faulkner's comments and I fully agree with him that the recommendations in the green paper stand the test of time. When he was Special Minister of State that document became a very regularly used reference for people who are deeply committed to the need for change here. I also agree with Senator Faulkner about how disappointing it is where the coalition stands. Senator Fierravanti-Wells has again unfortunately come into this debate with a lack of understanding, because her colleagues actually voted against some of the proposals that she said would have allowed reform to go ahead. I am referring to the comments that she made about union donations and third party donations. The Greens put forward recommendations on this issue. They appear in our dissenting report. If you look in the minutes, you will see that the coalition voted against them.


While the recommendations from this inquiry are limited, it certainly was a signifi­cant inquiry and the body of evidence that is now in this report is very useful. Electoral funding reform should remain a top priority for all political parties. Indeed, it is critical to the very strength of our democratic process. I can share with senators in this chamber that many people in our community are deeply troubled by the political donations that pour into this political system. What I see is that it is breeding a cynicism about the political process, where people believe, 'What is the point of engaging with politicians when they will clearly pick up the phone for those who donate large amounts of money?' This is something that we need to deal with in a much more detailed way than with the recommendations before us.


Having said that, there are some signifi­cant achievements in these recommendations and I would like to mention a couple of them. One is that Labor have honoured the promise they made that they would lower the donation disclosure threshold to $1,000. This is very important in terms of the public having a greater understanding of where the money comes from that is funding political parties and many candidates. 


It is worth remembering the history of why this reform is needed. One of the very unsavoury aspects of electoral changes that were made in the Howard years, and would have gone through this chamber, was when the disclosure threshold was lifted to $10,000, to increase with the CPI. So now it is around $11,500, and that is the level below which donations in the federal sphere do not have to be disclosed.


Another important recommendation that has come forward in this report is that any donation over $100,000 must be disclosed within 14 days. I was pleased that this was one of the recommendations that we put forward which was picked up. The Greens have advocated for this for quite a while. However, although it was picked up and supported—and you will see it in the report—there is a loophole here, and that is that the donations will not be judged on a cumulative basis. Therefore, you could have a donor who gives many small donations and if you added them up they could be above $100,000. But because they are not added up, that information would not be required to be disclosed within 14 days. I do think that that is unfortunate. Again, that sort of trickery—and I do have to call it that because that is how many people view it—is what makes people very cynical. It appears that you are gaining a reform but the system has these loopholes that really hide important information from the public.


The major failure with these recommenda­tions is that we do not have the substantial electoral funding reforms that are urgently needed and which are being achieved in the states. We now have a state of affairs where the federal electoral funding laws are becoming increasingly out of step with what is happening in state jurisdictions. I am particularly referring here to New South Wales and to Queensland, but there is certainly talk that their reforms could occur in other states. In New South Wales the reforms have actually been quite far reaching. It is now illegal for developers and donors associated with the tobacco industry, the alcohol industry and the gambling industry to donate to political parties. There are also very tight caps on donations. The amounts that can be given by any organisation, corporation or individual to a political party cannot be over $5,000 and cannot be over $2,000 to a candidate. That has been a significant achievement.


Another area which is another example of a missed opportunity with this inquiry is that the important bill that Senator Bob Brown gave notice of in this chamber—that is, the Electoral Amendment (Tobacco Industry Donations) Bill 2011—was not given support by this inquiry. It was a very simple piece of legislation—a very obvious piece of legislation—saying that we should stop anybody, any corporation or any part of the tobacco industry donating to the political process, and that was not agreed to.


In making these comments I have to say that my thoughts do go back to some of the hearings of this inquiry. A House of Representatives member, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop, was on this inquiry. Her behaviour on this inquiry made our work very difficult. It was quite appalling at times. She impu­gned the reputation of witnesses and she would grandstand with extreme statements. I came to realise that her tactics, from what I could see, were to be disruptive to the process of hearing important evidence and to throw witnesses off their evidence. That was certainly challenging, but I do congratulate the chair of this committee, Mr Daryl Melham, for being extremely fair in how he conducted the inquiry in the face of great difficulties from some members.


Because the inquiry recommendations were inadequate, I did set out a series of recommendations, in keeping with Austral­ian Greens policy, in a dissenting report. These go through a whole number of key aspects that are already part of legislation such as that in Canada and being advanced in other Western democracies. Aspects of them are coming through in Queensland and New South Wales legislation. Again, I want to emphasise that important point—how out of step the federal laws are.


In summary, the Greens recommendations included a ban on all donations from all entities other than individuals. And just to emphasise for coalition members—again, going from the comments that Senator Fierravanti-Wells made—surely they could have been able to support our recommenda­tion to ban donations from corporations, unions and other organisations and to deal with third parties. To go back to the recommendations in our dissenting report, we also called for a cap on the amount of money that can be donated in a year from a single individual, and caps on expenditure by political parties, candidates and third parties. I find that one is particularly popular with the public, because they realise that it would limit all those coloured glossies that get pushed into their letterboxes, and they have doubts about how useful they really are.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (19:12):  I rise this evening to share with the Senate the story of this year's Tasmanian of the Year and to highlight the benefits of ecotourism, one of Tasmania's most important and succe­ssful industries. In the days after Christmas last year, I had the chance to join Rob Pennicott on a trip with his ecotourism busi­ness based at Bruny Island. Rob's business has grown from a small start-up base on the Tasman Peninsula to being a flagship for Tasmanian ecotourism and the state's beautiful wilderness. Pennicott Wilderness Journeys now operates around Tasman and Bruny Islands, taking tourists to the cusp of the Southern Ocean and around the rugged cliffs of the coastline of Tasmania.


Along the way, Rob's company has employed local workers, told the stories of the birds, seals and other wildlife that call the state's coast their home, and promoted to the world some of the most remarkable land­scapes in one of the most remarkable places in the world—Tasmania


I had the privilege of joining Rob Pennicott on his Bruny Island cruise down to the tip of Bruny Island in the Southern Ocean, seeing for myself the incredible array of seals and birdlife along the way and how they inhabit our beautiful island. On that trip I saw caves and other parts of Bruny Island that I had never seen before. I have frequent­ed Bruny Island on many occasions, but Rob's tour was a unique way for me to experience the rugged coast of Bruny Island and Tasmania. It was an incredible experi­ence. All those on board, despite the unpredictable weather on the day, had an incredible time. For me, the feeling I had there of being very much alive will stay with me forever.


Rob's commitment to Tasmania and to protecting the unique natural environment that it houses has been a driving force behind a business that takes its impact on the enviro­nment as seriously as it does its striking marketing strategy. Impressively, Pennicott Wilderness Journeys offset all their carbon emissions through Greening Australia and with a particular focus on local planting projects. They measure their energy, waste and water usage using the EC3 system and achieve above best practice for all their scores.


Rob established the Pennicott Foundation with his wife, Michaye Boulter, in order to actively support the conservation and rehabilitation of the natural environment. In 2007 they founded the Tasmanian Coast Conservation Fund in partnership with Wildcare. Since that time, their landmark coastal conservation effort has been to rid Tasman Island of the feral cats there, intro­duced in years past by lighthouse keepers unconcerned by or ignorant of the island's incredible seabird ecosystem. Since that time, Rob has made a personal contribution of $100,000 toward the TCCF—a figure that would be impressive enough were it not dwarfed by the amount Rob raised with his Follow the Yellow Boat Road initiative.


The Yellow Boat about which I speak is no more than a simple, outboard driven, inflatable dinghy skippered by Rob and his colleague and friend Mick Souter. Along with cameraman Zorro Gamarnik, they followed the 'road' around Australia, attempt­ing to circumnavigate the country over the course of months. Why? More than just for Rob's passion for adventure and the water, the Yellow Boat was raising money for the global effort to eradicate the scourge of polio. By October 2011, five months after the trip began, they had raised $280,000. Recent reports out of India suggest that polio has all but disappeared there.


With a sustained effort from organisations like Rotary International and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as by our own federal government, it might quickly be brought to the edge of defeat in countries such as Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rob's story is one that connects the local communities of Tasmania—the landscapes, the families, the heritage and the country—with the hundreds of thousands who will be benefit from the eradication of the deadly and debilitating polio. The efforts of this marine enthusiast cum entrepreneur and fisherman cum philanthropist make him wholly deserving of his title of 2012 Tasmanian of the Year.


I would also like to talk tonight about the NBN Co Discovery Truck. In January I was able to host a group of residents from the Glenorchy municipality on a tour of the Discovery Truck, which has been touring Tasmania since November last year and doing a fantastic job educating people on what the NBN will mean to them. I wanted to ensure the older members of our commu­nity understood how the NBN could impact their lives in a positive way, and what better way to do this than through the interactive tour offered by members of the NBN Co Discovery Truck.


I was joined by staff, residents and board members from the Lady Clark Centre in Claremont and by a number of members of the Glenorchy Bowls Club. We arrived at the truck and were greeted by the enthusiastic NBN Co demonstration team—Amy, Tom and Graeme—who will travel across Austra­lia over the coming 11 months, educating Australians about the NBN.


After boarding the 23-tonne truck, we were seated and the presentation began. The team explained that 93 per cent of Australian homes would have fibre-optic cables connecting them to the NBN. The remaining seven per cent will have access to either satellite or fixed wireless internet service. Whichever the option, Australia's new broadband network is going to be seriously fast. For example, people will be able to download an entire movie in just under two minutes—something that can presently take up to two days, and that is if that connection does not time out. The speed of our internet that will result from the NBN is difficult to fathom. You may be interested to know that Australia is currently rated as 42nd on the list of network speeds in the developed world. Simply put, the Gillard Labor govern­ment do not think this is good enough, which is why we are taking action in this area.


We also learnt that over the course of the NBN rollout it will employ more than 15,000 people over 10 years. This is a fairly big milestone. Over recent years, data download­ed on the internet has increased by some 19,000 per cent. If this trend continues, the NBN is the only answer to ensuring we have the infrastructure in place to handle such downloads. We must have an extensive, reliable network that will enable us to interact on a global scale. We cannot continue as No. 42 on the list of network speeds in the developed world. 


The group I hosted on the tour were particularly interested in how the NBN will benefit their health, how it will enable them to have, for example, a medical consultation from the comfort of their own home via videoconference. We were also able to expl­ore the ways they will be able to undertake rehabilitation and exercise progra­ms in their own homes. Members of the group were able to trial a fall prevention proram developed by Neuroscience Research Australia. This is a technology that, thanks to the NBN, will be able to detect and respond to human move­ment. Sessions will be recorded and progress charts will be downloadable for health professionals, who can then monitor their patient's progress. This technology will benefit those recovering from a stroke, spinal cord injuries and Parkinson's disease and potentially benefit those with dementia or brain damage. This will dramatically impro­ve the quality of life for so many in our community. There are so many benefits, and we touched on but a few during our tour. Education, health care, business, entertai­nment—all will be improved, thanks to the NBN.


I found that hosting a tour of the NBN Co Discovery Truck was a great experience for all those who came along. I would encourage all parliamentarians to do likewise when the team on the truck visits their electorates over the course of this year.
