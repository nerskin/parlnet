"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:31):  This bill is certainly one that relates to a topic very much discussed around the Australian community. I refer senators to the speech of Senator Birmingham back in November 2012 which confirmed very serious concerns about the health impacts of the noise coming from wind farms. I understand that since November last year we have proposed some amendments to the bill, effectively calling upon the National Health and Medical Research Council to develop appropriate guidelines for an independent study of the impacts of wind farms and the noise of wind farms on people living in the vicinity.


Mr Deputy President, as you know, I come from the north of Queensland. There are some wind farms up around Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tableland—indeed, they were some of the first wind farms to be established in Australia. There has been concern from residents in that area about health impacts on them from those wind farms. I have to say that, while I am one who believes in renewable power, I have often wondered about the visual pollution that wind farms cause. I remember in the very early days of the Greens political party, they were very vocal about the visual pollution of wind farms. You only have to go out to Lake George near Canberra to see what used to be a wonderful country vista with magnificent rolling hills—





Senator Boswell:
  I just can't understand the Greens on this.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You're right, Senator Boswell. I cannot understand the Greens on this either. Mind you, I cannot understand the Greens on anything. I do understand this and this alone: that they are a very left-wing socialist party and some of their members like Senator Rhiannon make no bones about that. They are quite open about the fact that they were once members of the communist party and believe in that socialist, left-wing dogma. That much I do understand about the Greens—anything else I do not really.


There is the issue of visual pollution. There is a place for wind farms at times, but one has to wonder why the community has not been outraged just at the visual pollution. Senator Madigan's bill refers more to the genuine concerns that many people have about the impact that wind farms are having on their communities, on their lifestyles and on their health. Neither the parliament nor the government should easily dismiss these concerns. You will be aware, Mr Deputy President, that this bill was referred to the Senate's Community Affairs References Committee, which presented a report on the social and economic impact of rural wind farms in June 2011—almost two years ago. The committee recommended that:


… the Commonwealth Government initiate as a matter of priority thorough, adequately resourced epidemiological and laboratory studies of the possible effects of wind farms on human health. This research must engage across industry and community, and include an advisory process representing the range of interests and concerns.


That recommendation was a unanimous one, and I emphasise the words 'as a matter of priority' to do this research. It is typical of the Gillard Labor government that they understand 'a matter of priority' as almost two years later and have ignored issues which really do concern Australians and which many people would say do have an impact on the health of Australians.


Is our Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, looking at these things as a matter of priority or is she campaigning in Australia's longest ever election campaign in Western Sydney? Mr Acting Deputy President, I will bet you that, as she campaigns in Western Sydney, Ms Gillard is not focused on the health concerns many Australians have about wind farms. I suspect that people in Western Sydney would not have to put up with the impact of wind farms, as I suspect there are not too many around that area—



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And you are right, Senator Boswell, I suspect there are not too many at Rooty Hill, but then I am not sure that Ms Gillard is going to Rooty Hill now. One of Ms Gillard’s ministers actually said that it would be high farce to book in at the Rooty Hill RSL. What a joke of a government. It would be funny if it were not serious, because problems that need the attention of the Prime Minister, problems that are addressed in this bill, are being ignored while the Prime Minister embarks upon Australia’s longest ever election campaign.


On 13 September 2012, a year and a half after the committee's recommendations were made, the government responded by saying that they accepted the recommendations in principle. Again, this shows how focused Ms Gillard is on the real health concerns of Australians! Apparently the government then provided an NHMRC literature review. They said, 'Here are a lot of readings on the subject; that is our response.' But that is not the sort of Australian based research, with thorough epidemiological and laboratory studies, that we think is necessary to provide the robust scientific evidence needed to manage this very concerning issue.


Senator Madigan and most of us on this side of the chamber believe that, where it is important, where it is relevant, we should make our decisions based on science. The government have continually ignored science. You only have to look at the bioregional marine plans to see that the government’s decision in that important area for Australians was based on the lobbying of a foreign environment group which has little concern about the Australians who would be impacted, and there was practically no reference to the science on the subject. One aim of the marine bioregional plan was to save fish stocks in the Coral Sea, near where I come from. The take of fish from the Coral Sea over many, many years has been infinitesimal. Even a year 1 science student would have been able to tell the Gillard government that. But they do not make decisions on the basis of science, as they should; they make them on the basis of political necessity, on the importance of getting Greens preferences at the next election and on the fact that the Greens are supported by some very wealthy people, including the Pew Environment Group. That group commenced some years ago in the United States on the back of very big donations from oil companies in the United States that felt they needed to absolve their consciences by doing something 'positive' for the environment.


We believe that these December isions and what Senator Madigan is calling for in his bill have to be based on science. That is why we have proposed an amendment to this bill which seeks a scientific approach. Senator Madigan will no doubt speak for himself later, but I understand there is some support for the idea that we should insist upon proper and adequate scientific research.


I mentioned my interest in wind farms. There are some in North Queensland. I have always been appalled by their visual pollution, particularly around Canberra, and in the north. There was the CopperString proposal up in North Queensland—




Senator Boswell:
  The Bob Katter proposal?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am not even sure who you are talking about.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Macdonald, you will ignore the interjections.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I think Senator Boswell mentioned a politician up that way. I am not sure if he is a politician—you never see him in parliament. You never see him voting on important issues. I never take much notice of what the current member for Kennedy says. I do recall, Senator Boswell, that for years he has been talking about development of the north and some water storage facilities on the Flinders and other rivers up that way. When a leaked draft coalition discussion paper on these things hit the newsstands—I do emphasise it is not coalition policy at this stage—all Mr Katter could do was oppose the proposals that I thought he had been calling upon and supporting for a long period of time. But it is always difficult to understand what Mr Katter's view is on anything.


There was a proposal for a power grid in the north. I do not want to go into that; it has fallen on tough times. But part of that proposal was for a wind farm in the plains to the west of Townsville, around Hughenden.


One would think that, if there are to be wind farms, somewhere like that might be a good place—assuming the wind patterns are appropriate there. It is, to a degree, away from population bases, so the sorts of health difficulties which Senator Madigan referred to in his bill would be obviated.


We believe there should be research which, as I said, includes full monitoring and full laboratory and epidemiological studies. It should be research which ensures that the views of industry and community are heard so that areas of concern can be studied and addressed. It should look at audible noise, low-frequency noise—infrasound—electromagnetic radiation and vibration arising from or associated with wind farms, including wind turbines. It should look at transmission lines, substations, telecommunications towers and other structures associated with industrial wind electricity generation. That is why we are moving this motion.


Wind farms and wind power generation are important in achieving the 20 per cent renewable energy target set by the Commonwealth—by the Howard government. As time has moved on, however, more and more questions have been raised about whether that 20 per cent renewable energy target is appropriate for Australia at the present time. I assume Senator Boswell will speak a lot more about that in his contribution to the debate on this bill. Suffice it for me to say that I do think there is a change in community perception and I think that is something the current government and any future government might have to look at very carefully.


In the limited time left to me I will just raise a couple of things. I am a great believer in hydro power. Very often you will hear people from Tasmania—and the Greens political party, for some reason, seem to have a greater following in that state than anywhere else—




Senator Siewert:
  They are sensible in Tasmania.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is a state which lives on hydro power and yet, when you talk about hydro power in any other state, suddenly it is bad, it is wrong and you cannot have it. You can have it in Tasmania but not anywhere else. Perhaps one of the Greens senators might tell me why it is good in Tasmania but not good in Queensland.


Fortunately, a new government in Queensland is seriously looking at hydro power. The Burdekin Dam has been up for some time—an initiative of the Fraser Liberal government—and now there is considerable money being spent on putting a small hydro-electricity power plant on it. There are opportunities to raise the dam wall and to increase the power supply from doing so. There was also a community meeting, just a couple of weeks ago up in Ravenshoe, at which the Tully-Millstream Koombooloomba Dam extension was discussed at length. Quite a bit of work has been done on that.




Senator McLucas:
  Not Tully-Millstream again!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I see Senator McLucas mumbling to herself. You would think that, as a senator sometimes based in Cairns, she would be aware of community interest in a baseload power station for Cairns—a power station which relies not on fossil fuels but on water power. Rather than mumbling about it, I would have thought that Senator McLucas, who will no doubt take part in this debate later, would have had some interest in it.


I also mention the idea of using the enormous amounts of water which come out of the mountain ranges of Papua New Guinea to supply power—and perhaps even water in times of drought—to Queensland and Australia. The Queensland government some time ago put in place a memorandum of understanding with the PNG government on that proposal. It is something which shows that there alternatives to fossil fuels, that you can use renewable energy and that you can perhaps do so cost-effectively.


I know Senator Boswell and many other people have been concerned at the cost to Australia of the renewable energy program. I lament always that Ms Gillard broke her promise not to introduce a carbon tax. The carbon tax of course does not reduce carbon emissions. Even on the government's own figures, carbon emissions increase under the carbon tax. Australia is responsible for less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. One therefore wonders why Australia is burdened with the world's largest carbon tax—$23 a tonne. The Europeans are paying either $5 or $10, depending on which day of the week it is. The New Zealanders are paying $1. I think some Chinese provinces are doing it at 20c. Australia is paying $23, going up to $29, going up to $39, going up to $300 a tonne—and the Labor Party wonders why the jobs of Australian workers are going offshore. Time does not allow me to pursue that further except to lament that our Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, as the Labor leader, would promise not to introduce a carbon tax and then make it the first thing she did. I see that she and her ministers continue to say what a great thing the carbon tax is. If that is true, why did she promise not to introduce it? Did she not understand, back before the last election, that it would be as good as she now claims it to be? It just shows what an absolute farce the current government of Australia is.


Needless to say, this is an important bill. I congratulate Senator Madigan for raising it. I will be supporting the coalition's amendments and I hope that means we will actually get somewhere on this very important issue. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (09:51):  I must admit to some disappointment that we are today debating a bill about wind farm noise. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Windfarms) Bill has its origins in concerns about the supposed health effects of living next to wind farms. As Senator Milne noted in her contribution to the debate, an enormous variety of symptoms have been attributed to wind turbines. The list starts with headaches, nausea, loss of sleep and fatigue, and goes as far as things like terminal cancer. Indeed, allegations have been made that animals keel over dead as a result of wind turbines. As a doctor, many of these symptoms are familiar to me, and they do have much in common with many other conditions that are associated with modern life. I do not doubt for a moment that these symptoms are real, but the cause is much more complicated than the substance of this bill implies.


What we are debating today are matters of scientific fact—are wind farms noisy, how much acoustic energy do they introduce into the environment, does that energy have a direct impact on the human body that can lead to health problems. These are not political questions; they are questions of empirical fact. I will come back to the facts of the health impacts of wind farms in a moment, but I do need to emphasise the importance of science in this debate. Science is the pursuit of truth; the pursuit of knowledge. As a scientist by training I have always respected, indeed have been in awe of, the scientific method and what it has achieved for the human race. The results are all around us. In a few generations, in the blink of history's eye, we have seen air travel, electric power and instantaneous global communication all move from the miraculous to the routine.


My medical training instilled a deep respect for the scientific method as a way of sifting truth from falsehood. Nowhere are the benefits more plain than in medicine. There is a deep respect for this method amongst medical practitioners and researchers. After all, it is not that long ago that medicine concerned itself with balancing the humours and bloodletting. Nowadays a fairly routine trip to the hospital might involve a trip, for example, to a PET scanner. For a PET scan, unstable atomic nuclei are introduced into the body so we can build up a three-dimensional image based on the gamma rays that are emitted. It is just incredible. Few of us would probably stop to consider the centuries of painstaking work that made this possible, but it is reflected in the longer, healthier lives that we lead here today. Many or even most of us would not be alive were it not for the scientific advances of previous decades and centuries.


In other words, science works. Its fruits are on display and cannot be denied. Indeed, we take them for granted. We cannot come up with cogent explanations for the workings of the mobile phone. I use an aeroplane frequently, and I will fly home tomorrow. I trust the phone and the aeroplane, and many other things, because they are built on sound and well tested scientific principles. Science deals with facts in a way that is fundamentally different from politics. Science is not about going into bat for a particular position, about finding some evidence to tailor some predetermined desired outcome. Science is a process; it takes into account the biases inherent in human nature and systematically eliminates them from the final result. Science is not a journey to some predetermined outcome but a commitment to follow the evidence wherever it leads. That is quite foreign to the way public policy is generally made in this place.


It is paradoxical that our lives have become more dependent on science and technology while, at the same time, the status of science in the public debate is eroding. This is a fairly recent phenomenon. It was not that long ago that the polio vaccine, penicillin and even the atom bomb were branded as new reminders of how science is changing everyday lives and the future of our world. As constant scientific and technological innovation has become a part of background life, the significance of science has faded. As a result, scientists now occupy just another voice in the public debate. On a good day they are given equal billing with another lobby group or vested interest, and this is a dangerous thing when we are debating a matter of scientific fact such as whether wind farms are harmful to human health.


Scientists are not always the best people to participate in policy debates—they are often inexperienced and not skilled in the media, and they can be drowned out or outfoxed by those who are much better equipped for these tasks. Cashed-up lobby groups have the skills and resources to distort debates, and it can be difficult for scientific experts to overcome this. We have seen before the dangers inherent in this way of doing things. The tobacco lobby were extraordinarily successful in muddying the waters around science. They did not need to prove that tobacco was safe, that there was no link between smoking and lung cancer—all they had to do was instil in the public mind the idea that the question was not yet settled and then let inertia and commercial interests do the rest. The same thing is happening with climate change—think tanks, pet academics, fake grassroots groups; they have long been sowing doubt about the seemingly undeniable reality of climate change. They are not struggling for cash or access to the megaphone. Powerful and wealthy industries have a commercial imperative to delay action on climate change, and it is frightening to see how successful they have been.


This bill, which I contend is largely the product of such mischief by vested interests, is one small example of the phenomenon that is now playing out all over the world—and critically here in Australia.




Senator Edwards:
  What vested interests?




Senator DI NATALE:
  The irony is that these lobby groups are compelled to cloak their campaigns in the language of science.




Senator Boswell:
  Just like you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! I remind the chamber that Senator Di Natale has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Because of their extraordinary success, science and the sciences do command public respect. We still see scientists as disinterested experts we can trust. Politicians and lobby groups do their best to cash in on that. Science suffers from some of its worst abuses when it is misused and twisted to give a veneer of scientific respectability to a specific policy or ideology. This is pseudoscience, and it is rife in the public debate.


Sorting real science from pseudoscience can be difficult for the public at large, and it is a challenge that the media are often not up to. It takes a lot of time and hard-won expertise to do that. After all, an anecdote is very, very powerful. We all know about the power of the personal story. Personal stories are really of little worth when it comes to settling scientific questions, but they do have the power to sway a debate. They make for a juicy and readable story or a compelling TV moment, and the quest for balanced reporting makes it all too easy to give equal time to both sides of the debate. Especially in scientific matters where it may not be apparent where the consensus lies, it is easier to throw in quotes from competing experts. But, in reality, there are not two sides to every story—at least not two equal sides. In a debate like climate change, giving the impression that there are two sides accomplishes precisely what the vested interests want. The science is undermined because it looks like the question is open and the debate is still a live one.


As policymakers, we have to consider a variety of factors. Science is just one of them. Public values, priorities for scarce resources, and even election commitments all need to be taken into account, but we should be honest about it. Hand-picked evidence, friendly experts and data taken out of context are not science. That is just keeping up appearances. The role of science in policymaking is to find out what works. When used honestly, it is not just another tool that one can use to buttress a predetermined ideological position.


Scientists look for evidence that disproves their theories. They know that, if they do not, others will do it for them, and they will look foolish and lazy. No slogan, no matter how well received by a focus group, will help a scientist if her peers have failed to replicate experimental data. An inconsistency in theory cannot be dismissed based on good polling. In other words, integrity is critical in science. When used properly, science brings integrity back into public policy.


On the substance of this bill: what does the science tell us about wind farms? Wind farms are a mature technology. There are over 200,000 of them operating in the world today. That is enough for us to have some confidence in the effects they have on health. According to the NHMRC's public statement on wind farms and health, there is no scientific evidence that indicates that wind turbines have a negative effect on human health. The level of noise caused by a wind turbine at 350 metres, well short of the typical distance of houses from any turbine, is barely discernible from the ordinary background noise in a quiet bedroom. Measurements of the infrasound—that is, sound of a frequency too low to be detectable by human ears—show that levels near wind farms are lower than a typical urban environment. Of course, wind turbines are not completely silent. Experiencing the peace and quiet of the Australian countryside is one of my chief pleasures in life. Everyone should be entitled to a quiet environment and a good night's sleep. However, noise issues are already regulated, and wind farms are not exempt from these laws.


So, on the one hand, we have good evidence that wind farms produce noise at low levels, often undetectable to the human ear, and we have a situation where science can suggest no mechanism whereby such noises could impact the human body. On the other hand, we have a considerable body of stories from people who are suffering severe health impacts from their proximity to wind turbines. What is going on here?


The special interests that are hell-bent on disrupting the scientific debate in our papers and on TV are also having an effect on people's health. When outfits like the Waubra Foundation spread fear, uncertainty and doubt about the safety of wind turbines, this scares people. It is a terrible thing to have to worry about your health and that of your family. I shudder to think of how anxious I would be if I thought a facility was being built next to my family's farm that would pollute the environment and make us ill.


The symptoms attributed to the so-called wind turbine syndrome, including headaches, nausea, tinnitus and loss of sleep, appear to be the invention of a single person. Those symptoms are not unknown. There are many historical examples of illnesses such as these associated with the rise of modern technology. In the 19th century, the symptoms we are discussing here today were given the label 'neurasthenia'. In 1880, George Beard attributed the causes of neurasthenia to a collection of things, including wireless telegraphy, science itself, steam power, newspapers and the education of women.


However, these symptoms did not disappear as we got used to the innovations that caused that anxiety back then. More modern examples include high-voltage powerlines, wireless phone towers, fluoridated water and, indeed, vaccination. All of these have been associated with the symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, headache and so forth. In every case, the best science has failed to find a causative link between these issues and adverse effects on human health. Indeed, with things like wireless internet or powerlines, it is often possible to prove that the symptoms continue as long as the sufferer believes that they are being exposed to the source, even when the source no longer exists. In medical science this is known as the nocebo effect: the belief that something causes you real harm.


These problems, known as psychogenic illnesses, are well documented in the scientific literature. Psychogenic conditions may be on the rise. A growing distrust in science is manifesting itself in a suspicion of conventional medicine and technology. The advent of the internet—which is, incidentally, another one of science's great achievements—has widened access to information and misinformation. Anyone concerned about health impacts can find no shortage of information to fan the flames of their fears. Wind turbines would appear to be but the latest example of this phenomenon.


Simon Chapman, who has made some valuable contributions to this debate and has investigated the situation, has found that only a small minority of wind farms have attracted health complaints.


In evidence he gave to the inquiry into this bill he found that, while nobody in Western Australia has ever made such a complaint, it is where anti-wind-farm activism is present that complaints occur. Complaints about health tend to follow publicity about health effects. In short, there is no substantial evidence that wind farms impact on human health. But the literature on psychogenic illness is very compelling in this case.


Further evidence that has been tendered to the inquiry into this bill points out that people who have financial interests in a wind farm near their properties exhibit none of these symptoms. They are also rare in non-English speaking populations, such as in Denmark, where they have many more wind turbines but less access to the English literature on the supposed ailments associated with wind power.


I want to be clear about this: I do not doubt the testimony of those who are experiencing these symptoms. I believe that those symptoms are genuine and do lead to suffering. When somebody says they are experiencing pain or are in discomfort, we should not deny them that experience. Those symptoms are real. What I do contest is the source of these symptoms. The evidence is very clear that the acoustics of the turbines do not have a measurable impact on human health but, of course, the anxiety created by wind farm opponents does. Stress and worry have enormous consequences for health and wellbeing. Once the seeds of fear have been sown, it is very difficult to undo the health consequences. I therefore heartily condemn those who continue to spread this misinformation. It is the spread of misinformation that harms, not the wind turbines themselves. A bill such as this only exacerbates that fear and aids those who want to hinder the development of wind power for other commercial reasons.


This bill focuses on the supposed negative health effects of wind farms which, as I have pointed out, have no scientific basis whatsoever. Yet it completely ignores the health benefits, which are well documented in the scientific literature. Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, including coal, for power generation. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal. As such, it seems absurd that we are spending time debating whether the noise from distant wind turbines can injure people and not debating the terrible and well-documented effects that coal has on human health.


At every stage of the process, from the mining of coal to the combustion of coal and the transport of coal, there are measurable impacts on our health. Coal fired power in Australia burdens the community with a human health cost—including from lung and heart conditions—of over $2 billion annually. Reducing the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transport can reduce the incidence of these conditions of heart and lung diseases, including lung cancer. In Australia, air pollution is estimated to kill more people every year than the road toll. That does not even take into account the health impacts of climate change; extreme weather; heat waves; flooding; the spread of vector borne diseases like dengue fever and Ross River fever, and the increase in incidences of diseases like gastroenteritis, all of which the World Health Organisation have stated will increase as a result of runaway climate change. The effects of climate change have already been responsible for the deaths of many Australians.


This bill is a case study in the need for evidence based policy. Those who suffer from 'wind turbine syndrome' are not suffering because turbines are dangerous. They are suffering because they have been poorly served by those who claim to be acting in the public interest but are really acting for vested interests. Scaremongering about the health effects of wind power is irresponsible. It causes enormous anxiety for some people and it threatens to derail a promising and necessary industry for this country. For those reasons, I cannot support the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:11):  I rise today to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012. It would come as no surprise to Senator Madigan that I have strong views on this bill and it would also be no surprise to him that I am taking an active interest. I cannot proceed with my presentation to my Senate colleagues without addressing a number of issues which came up with Senator Di Natale's presentation over the last 20 minutes, given that the first 10 minutes of his presentation was a rambling discourse on the effects of science on everything that matters in life. That is very important, but I fail to see how trying to draw the link between the evolution of science and the way in which it is presented is helping his cause here, because that is the very issue this bill is looking to address.


I say from the onset that the proposed coalition amendment throws the onus back onto that issue of science. Basically it would rely on a report to be commissioned by the National Health and Medical Research Council onto the science of effects of this proliferation of wind farms. I hear all the emotive issues like Meniere's disease and tinnitus. I am not going to speak too much about that, but will address how the case was put to me very simply by a prominent sound engineer who has done work on these wind farms and also for most of the government agencies around the country over the years on issues of sound and its effects on the community. I think we have to be very careful to keep this argument simple because it does get clouded with complexity.


This man said to me, 'Senator Edwards, this issue of infrasound is something which does not affect everybody. Let me put it to you this way: if you and I put to sea on a moderate day and you get seasick and I don't, why is that?' I pondered the question. He said, 'That is the same as infrasound.' The cynical people who do not experience the effects of infrasound sit in judgement of those who do experience it. Let us be very careful when we are talking about the science, because science is something that you can hide behind. This is something that does not affect everybody.


With our amendment—it is a credible amendment; it is not something that should be baulked at by anybody here in this chamber—and a competent agency, and none are more competent than the National Health and Medical Research Council, to undertake with strict terms of reference an inquiry into this issue we will hopefully address the facts, rather than involve ourselves in this political discourse which pits science agencies against each other, depending on who is paying. It is the old story: you can get a very, very credible independent expert's report as long as you are paying.


Let me move on. On this area of renewable energy, everybody who has been listening to my comments and contribution knows that my issue has not been on wind farms and has not been around the issue of health—although I believe it is something that should be addressed and will be addressed, if our amendment is adopted. My issue is that the complexity of the argument of wind farms has 99 per cent of the Australian public completely disengaged. They are completely disengaged because they switch off. It is because of the issue at the very heart of wind farms, which is the 20 per cent renewable energy target.


We are committed to renewable energy at the coalition, but it has to be equitable, it has to be spread around this country and there has to be a network in which we can fully take up the benefits of renewable energy. Last year, I sat in on the Select Committee on Electricity Prices' inquiry. I can assure you, it is a very complex area across this country and one which the average Australian cannot get their head around. I will tell you why: to compare the cost of electricity generation—if you can compare it technology to technology—they use a mechanism called the levelised cost. I warn anybody who is listening that they will have to pay attention here, because the basis of renewable energies and the premise of how it is structured is based on this. I will get into acronyms a bit later too. The levelised cost of energy—the LCOE—is the most transparent metric used to measure electric power-generating costs and is widely used as a tool to compare the generation costs from differing sources. The levelised cost of energy, the LCOE, is a measure of marginal costs—that is, the cost of producing one extra unit—of electricity over an extended period. It is sometimes referred to as long-run marginal costs or LRMC.


The LCOE is representative of the electricity price that would equalise cash flows—that is, the inflows and outflows—over the economic life of the energy-generating asset. It is the average electricity price needed for a net present value, or an NPV, of zero when performing a discounted cash flow, a DCF, analysis. With the average electricity price equal to the LCOE, an investor would break even and so receive a return equal to the discount rate on the investment. The LCOE is determined by the point where the present value of the sum discounted revenues is equivalent to the discounted value of the sum of costs. The analysis of the levelised cost of electricity uses a set of core economic parameters and assumptions to enable a relatively consistent comparison of electricity generation technologies.


These assumptions have had a significant impact on the LCOE calculation—with assumptions about interest rates and policies such as carbon taxes et cetera, which all remain important in any calculation that is based on the economic life of the asset. Who could not be absolutely compelled by that argument? You wonder why people just pay their electricity prices and do not get involved in this discussion about renewable energy! The people that do get involved in this discussion are the people that are affected. That is the people who are affected both visually and regarding their health, which you cannot ignore. Senator Di Natale quite rightly said that those people should be heard—excuse the pun—because any pain should be addressed. As I said earlier, the pain is not experienced by everybody but cannot be ignored by anybody.


The people of Australia are unwittingly paying both high social and economic costs to produce wind energy. This bill is important for ensuring a sustainable balance can be struck between those interests of both local communities and wind farm developments, while still meeting Australia's 2020 commitment to renewable energy targets.


In in my home state of South Australia, we have had significant firsthand experience with wind farms. At Waterloo near my hometown of Clare, in the state's mid-north, TRUenergy announced plans only six months ago to add six new wind turbines to its existing Waterloo wind farm. It is a project worth about $40 million. So it is an issue for me and it is very close to home. It is also an important fact—and if anybody has followed my comments on this they would know—that South Australia accommodates nearly half of the wind power that has been installed to date across the country. Not insignificantly or surprisingly, this has resulted in significant increases in electricity prices throughout the state in recent years. South Australia has the highest rate of electricity in this country. It nearly parallels those with the world's highest power costs.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  I will take interjections at any time from the Greens, if there is some credible thing that they would like to say about this. But the economics of it is that, with the rising cost of living, Australians are struggling to pay their power bills. You can ignore it as much as like and you can surround it with as much science as you would like to produce—



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Edwards, resume your seat. I remind senators on the right that all senators have the right to be heard in silence.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will continue. Renewable energy certificates have enabled developers of wind farms to maximise their returns. Because of the commitment to the 20 per cent target, we have seen, as I said, this proliferation of wind farms in South Australia and this has seen our state pass the 2020 target in the year 2012. So we are eight years ahead of everybody else.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  I am not sure. There are a lot of reasons that we can attribute that to. So concerned was the South Australian community that my state Liberal colleague David Ridgway MLC, who was the shadow minister for urban development at the time, commissioned an inquiry into the activities of and the lax planning laws for wind farms in that state. Last year, the South Australian state planning minister brought in an interim change to the planning rules governing wind farms, which basically meant that it was a free-for-all for wind farm developers. The change allowed turbines to be built just one kilometre from people's homes and stopped people from being able to use existing laws to stop developments close to their home. The minister took away appeal rights. The minister has made an interim regulation in response to court action taken by a landowner against a wind farm proposal in the state's south-east. The court found in favour of the landowner and the development was dropped. We have a Labor minister in South Australia who is so keen to support the federal Labor Party in the proliferation of wind farms that he is prepared to give up his constituency in an effort to be the golden-haired boy amongst his federal parliamentary colleagues.


Wind farm developers have concentrated on South Australia because of the lax planning regulations and the absolutely unfettered ability to get approvals in that state, and this has been a fault of the Rann-Weatherill Labor government. The guidelines have left South Australia out on its own—out there as an absolute beacon of light for those who want to proliferate the development of wind farms in this country. In relation to that heavy hand of government coming down on people in the south-east of South Australia, the Law Society, when providing evidence to the committee of inquiry into these regulations, shared their deep concern about the power that the planning minister had used in setting up interim regulations. Disturbingly, they provided the minister with unrestrained powers to override the community when approving wind farm developments. No wonder there is deep suspicion and deep division within all communities—particularly in South Australia because we have had much of this development.


Politics is not above people, and if people are continually rallying, as they did in Middleton some two Sundays ago, and are wanting to be heard and are failing to be heard by governments then that is a hallmark of a government out of touch. Why can't and why wouldn't the government support the coalition's amendment to have a proper review of this science? I urge governments of all persuasions to have a look at the economics of it to just see if there is potential market failure. We see a procession of superannuation funds—basically those superannuation funds which are controlled by boards of management or have on them directors with trade union backgrounds—that are all flocking to government sponsored policy which protects investment. We have all found in the past that anything a government gives it can take away. So with the subsidies that exist for renewable energies we have to be very careful that we do not get a distortion of one energy type which can then be taken away by another government. What would happen to the economics of wind farms and wind farm developments if they did not receive a rebate for the purchase of renewable energy certificates? They would collapse. This is the problem with creating a business based on subsidies from governments.


The renewable energy target and the subsidies that go with it are relatively well protected because, generally, it is accepted by all in this parliament that we have to have a target for it. But what happens when governments of the ilk that we have in this country run out of money because of rising debt and mismanagement of the budget? Actually, where is Treasurer Swan at the moment? We have not seen him around for weeks now. He is probably lost out in the western suburbs of Sydney, I suspect, trying to find his fearless leader.


We have a reckless government with a cavalier attitude to their budget. On Christmas Eve, they said: 'That surplus we promised? It's not going to be there. Happy Christmas!' What happens to government policies where they subsidise things—and that it is the case with renewable energy—is that they tend to review them when they run out of money: 'How can we pull back? How can we restrain spending?' That is the risk for the Australian people with anything that is government sponsored welfare, if you like—if it receives a subsidy, a payment. Anything that happens with a change of government policy will see those wind farms stand silent—which is what they have to do, if I may digress, when it is a little bit too hot or, ironically, when the wind is blowing too hard. They have to be switched off.


There are many, many aspects to this whole wind farm debate. I am passionate about it. I know people whose health is affected. There are real people whose lives are affected through the regulation and the lack of compassion or understanding. This bulldozer style is typical of socialistic governments, where they just mandate laws without any consultation. I think they commonly call it 'announce and defend'.


A lot of people, including senators opposite, say that wind is wonderful and it does not increase the cost of living. They say that the carbon tax is a magic pudding for all of us and that, while we export jobs, we will all get healthier. Senator Di Natale attributed the deaths of many people to climate change. I guess that Dorothea Mackellar was a visionary. She must have been a visionary because she spoke all that time ago of the effects on this land of 'droughts and flooding rains'—long before the coal fired power stations that you talk of as the evil of this country came into effect. I urge you to support the coalition's proposed amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-02-28,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:32):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


This Bill seeks to amend the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act to give powers to the Clean Energy Regulator that ensure accredited wind farms do not create excessive noise.


Under the Bill, the definition of excessive noise would be background noise plus 10 dBA.


Should a wind farm be found to be contravening the excessive noise provisions of this Bill, it would be prevented from creating and on-selling large-scale generation certificates.


The importance of having a nationally applicable definition of excessive noise has been explained by Dr Bob Thorne, a well-regarded independent acoustician. Dr Thorne said:




""
The thing that none of us has is a consistency across all states. That leads to my mind to the most important function of this bill: it gives a consistent approach to excessive noise throughout all of Australia... This is where I would see the benefit of this particular bill in that it provides a certainty of approach to all states, it provides a certainty of approach to the industry 
and it gives a clear definition to all the different states
'
 legislation.
""



The benefits of a definition of excessive noise that applies to all states and territories will provide clarity and consistency of application throughout Australia.


Those who live close to wind farms can therefore be assured the wind farms are required to operate in accordance with established noise guidelines so that any disturbance caused by wind farm noise is minimised.


Ultimately, this is about empowering individuals and communities who have felt disempowered as a result of these large industrial structures and the excessive noise they create.


The suggested limit of background plus 10 dBA is in fact generous compared with current Australian noise guidelines.


The South Australian Environmental Protection Authority's noise guidelines impose a limit of background plus 5 dBA in cases not involving wind farms.


So we must consider is that, in some areas, noise from wind farms is limited at 40dBA, or background plus 5 dBA, whichever is greater. This figure completely fails to take into account the fact that background noise — the sounds we hear all the time — is going to be far lower in rural and regional areas than in metropolitan areas, and instead allows the highest possible level of noise to occur.


The comparative 'noise nuisance' of 40dBA will naturally be much higher in the areas where wind farms are built.


During the Environment and Communications committee inquiry into this bill, leading acoustician Dr Stephen Cooper gave the following evidence:




""
The standards say that if a noise is above the background it is likely to be annoying and that exceedances of up to five are of marginal significance. So the concept has been that for general noise you can have noise that is audible but once you get to about five, above the background, it starts to present problems to the community or those people being affected by the noise. So if the background is higher in a city environment, then you can have a higher noise 
level. If you are near a large industrial estate or near a freeway that generates noise, then you are in a noisier environment and you can have a higher level of noise emission from the industrial sources.





This graph clearly shows that, as you move to quieter environments, then the criteria that apply should also drop down.
""



Excessive noise in general has been shown to cause sleep disturbance and disruption, as discussed in the World Health Organisation's 'Guidelines for Community Noise'.


There is so much information flying around in this debate that it important that independent research into the potential health effects of excessive noise from wind farms is undertaken.



I note that the Coalition has circulated amendments which, if enacted, would require the NHMRC to cause research to be conducted into the possible effects of noise from wind farms on human health.


I thank the Coalition members who have spent a significant amount of time working with Senator Madigan and me to construct some workable amendments. While I do have some concerns about their other amendments, I strongly support the need for more research.


Unfortunately the wind farm debate has been tarnished to some extent by certain individuals who choose to attack those who complain that their health has been adversely affected.


Allowing for independent research is something we should all support, no matter which side of the debate you are coming from.


A unanimous report from the Community Affairs References Committee in 2011 into the social and economic impact of wind farms in regional areas recommended that independent research be undertaken into the reported health effects.


And at this stage it's appropriate to pay tribute to the late Judith Adams and her tireless work in this area.


The committee also recommended that further consideration be given to the separation distance between wind farms and residences, and that further research be done on the noise effects of wind farms, including infrasound.


I want to take this opportunity to discuss some of the arguments that have been raised against this bill.


Some, including Senator Milne, have claimed this bill is 'anti-wind farm' and part of a campaign against renewable energy.


With respect, this bill is not anti anything except excessive noise.


We already have laws in place to control noise levels around airports, major roads, and other significant infrastructure.


How is this any different?


Yes, there are state and territory laws in place that put noise limits on wind farms. But these vary from region to region, and can't be enforced anyway because there is no real-time noise data available.


Senator Milne also spoke at length against the reported health effects of wind farms. She went so far as to claim that 'where people have a financial interest in the wind farm... these people do not get sick'.


Firstly, I'd like to mention the case of David and Alida Mortimer in the South East of South Australia. They are turbine hosts — they get a financial benefit from having a turbine on their property — but they have been very vocal about the negative impact this has had on their lives.


This bill is not about the purported health effects of wind farms. This bill is about excessive noise — something that is widely acknowledged can have an impact on sleep and quality of life.


But where is the harm in commissioning research into possible health effects? If there is no link, then what is there to fear?


Senator Milne also said she believed Senator Madigan and I were 'part of a campaign against wind energy and renewables in Australia'.


I repudiate that in the strongest terms.


Professor Simon Chapman, whose work on the plain packaging legislation and tobacco advertising I greatly admire, also accused me of being an ""anti-wind farm zealot"", adding that my interest in this cause brought about a ""sad decline of a once admirable independent.""


At least he thought I was admirable once.


Professor Chapman is of course welcome to express his opinion, and I am pleased to be able to express mine.


I am not anti-wind farm.


In fact, I am pro-renewable energy. It is on the public record that I believe it is important that we have a mandated renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020.


I also believe that we have a very long way to go to achieve that.


My issue is not with that target but with the way the target is achieved through an over-reliance on one specific form of technology — wind turbines.


Wind farms do not provide a reliable baseload power, which means dirty coal-fired power stations need to be kept on standby.


We need to be investing in baseload reliable renewables, and I worry that our reliance on wind energy is in fact stifling investment in other areas, such as geothermal, solar thermal and tidal power.


So I am not anti-wind power.


But I do believe that wind power is only one part of the solution, and we shouldn't focus on it to the exclusion of everything else.


In September last year, The Australian's environment editor Graham Lloyd wrote about a two year analysis of Victorian wind farms, undertaken by mechanical engineer Hamish Cumming.


Lloyd wrote:




""
[Cumming
'
s] analysis shows that despite receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from green energy schemes driven by the renewable energy target, Victoria
'
s wind farm developments have saved virtually zero carbon dioxide emissions in the state.
""



He goes on to describe how, despite the feed of wind-generated power into the grid, fossil fuel generators do not reduce their rate of coal consumption.


In South Australia, Cumming estimated that the cost of greenhouse gas abatement was at $1484 a tonne.


I believe climate change is real and must be addressed urgently. We must do everything we can to mitigate the damage it has and will cause to our environment and our economy.


Part of that challenge is reshaping our economy to move towards less carbon-intensive ways of operating across all sectors. It is a fine balance between using a carrot and a stick.


We are not striking that balance.


For example, the structure of the current carbon tax could act as a positive disincentive to investment in other forms of renewable energy.


So, while I of course commend this Bill, I believe we also need to look at our over-reliance on wind energy and the repercussions for investments in other innovative forms of renewable energy.


I note that the Government does have upcoming legislation to extend a tax rebate to geothermal exploration activities.


This is certainly a step in the right direction.


But geothermal projects still struggle to get access to funding, even when specific amounts have been set aside.


For example, in a response to an estimates question I placed on notice last year, the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism stated that the Government had committed a total of $899 million to renewable energy projects.


Of this, only $302 million was for solar projects and $205 million was for geothermal.


And, even worse, only $104 million had actually been received by grant recipients.


This shows a serious neglect in funding alternative forms of energy.


We put all our eggs in one basket with coal-fired power, and we're now paying the price. Let's learn from that and not make the same mistake again.


I understand there is a lot of controversy about wind farms, and that these arguments make some people uncomfortable.


But ultimately, this is a question about excessive noise. It is fair and reasonable that there be a national standard for noise, and that wind farms publish live information to show their compliance with this standard.


In the end, communities must be empowered. They must have access to real-time information on the noise generated from these turbines, because right now they are fighting legal battles with one hand tied behind their back.


In the same way that aircraft noise near airports is publicly available, the same approach should be taken to wind farms.


Surely in the interests of transparency, the industry should not object to this information being made available to local communities.


As I said before, this is no different from noise restrictions in place elsewhere.


I indicate my support for this bill, and I hope this is only the beginning of the debate on these issues.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:32):  I am pleased to speak today on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012. The bill seeks to establish a definition of excessive noise for wind farms and the impact of noise on sleep and health. My colleague Senator Di Natale has canvassed with great sensitivity and coherence the way that you assess how people are experiencing health impacts. He did it far more coherently than I could. It is a shame that Senator Edwards is leaving the chamber, because I did want to pick up on one of the issues that he mentioned.




Senator Edwards:
  I'm still here!




Senator LUDLAM:
  He is still here, which is excellent. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill concluded that the bill is effectively discriminatory against one kind of power generator, that the bill will not prevent wind farms from operating but could in fact have an impact on electricity prices and that the bill involves the Commonwealth taking over planning and regulatory responsibilities that, in my view, properly lie with the states.


But the committee also concluded—and perhaps that is something that we can all agree on, although the Greens will not be voting for this bill—that every resident, whether in a city environment or in a rural area, should be protected from unreasonable environmental impacts by the operation of planning laws and guidelines. Obviously that applies to a much larger degree of industrial phenomena than simply wind farms. It is an important principle, though, and I would like to acknowledge Senators Madigan and Xenophon for bringing that forward, apart from the rather peculiar way in which wind farms have been singled out in this bill.


When the committee held the hearing into the bill, in November last year, there were strong feelings from people who felt that they had been negatively affected by wind farms. I draw senators' attention to the comments made by Senator and Dr Di Natale that those people should not be dismissed out of hand, because these symptoms are clearly real. People are not making these things up. But how we attribute the cause is extremely important.


Every large-scale industrial technology can be done badly. It can be done with poor consultation and it can have negative impacts on people. It is the case that wind farms have an impact. They are not invisible. They are large structures in the landscape. So there is a visual impact and there is a noise impact and there do need to be clear regulations in place about how to manage those. Ironically enough, I have never heard anybody in the wind industry, which I have good contacts with, disputing any of these things. We should study the impacts and we should learn the lessons. We need to acknowledge what exists in the medical literature and what does not exist. Most importantly, from the perspective of the Greens, we need to learn how to improve consultation processes with affected communities, whether it is for a wind farm installation or anything else.


The other thing from our perspective is to do with the placement of wind installations. If you put them across bird or bat fly ways, you can have impacts on wildlife. The industry has already learnt a great deal in the decades that it has been operating about how to place these installations well. It is crucial to learn the lessons and improve the processes about this technology, because this industry has such a large and important part to play in the future of electricity generation here in Australia and around the world.


We need to acknowledge another important report into wind farms, which was tabled in June 2011, from a Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry chaired by my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert. That offered another careful consideration of these issues. I am canvassing this history in order to underline the point that we must not dismiss these issues out of hand. I do not think wind farm developers should get a free run and be able to circumvent proper community consultation and proper planning procedures just because they are part of an industry I support. I think they should be held to the same standards of community engagement, public health and safety, and planning guidelines as other things—as we are so dramatically failing to uphold in the instance of the coal seam gas industry, the coal industry and the uranium industry, to name three examples that are close to my heart, where we see communities being assaulted, effectively, by invasive industrial processes that have very real and present health threats to those communities.


So the report that Senator Siewert undertook also adopted quite a sensitive approach to people who had come forward expressing health concerns and undertook very rigorous analysis, in particular, of the concerns around infrasound because those issues, in my view, had not been canvassed particularly well in Australia before that inquiry was undertaken.


So the Greens do take these issues seriously, but we also take the fortunes and the future of the wind energy industry very seriously because it is such an important part of our future. It has to be part of our future to mitigate the worst impacts of dangerous climate change. We already live in the age of climate change, and it is actually completely immaterial whether people like Mr Abbott and Senator Joyce believe it exists or not; it is occurring around them regardless. They can choose to adopt a policy blindfold and stumble around in the dark—I would prefer that they did not because of the harm that it threatens to the rest of us—but it is happening whether they believe it to be so or not.


Wind energy, as the most mature, large-scale renewable energy technology where economies of scale have long been an important part of the reason why it is being built, does have a very important part to play in the energy mix here in Australia. We need a zero emissions energy sector, and wind is clearly going to be a large part of that. In all of the studies that investigate how to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy networks, including the one that Senators Milne and Bob Brown and the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, were able to incorporate in the negotiations for the Clean Energy Act being undertaken right now into what a 100 per cent renewable energy sector for the national electricity market would look like, wind is going to take up a large fraction of the heavy lifting because it is cheap, it can be installed rapidly and the technology is mature. I would like to see a greater degree of local content of manufacturing and fabrication here in Australia.


Part of that is around the economics. Last week, my colleague Robin Chapple and I launched Energy 2029, which is a more fine-grained study than has yet occurred in Western Australia for how you would get to 100 per cent renewable energy on the South West Interconnected System—the SWIS—in WA. In both of the scenarios that we had commissioned, wind did a very large part of the heavy lifting for the reasons I have expressed.


As of February this year, wind is now cheaper than fossil fuels in producing electricity in Australia—




Senator Boswell:
  Absolute rubbish!




Senator LUDLAM:
  and the LC—




Senator Boswell:
  Absolute rubbish!




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Boswell, just listen quietly and you may learn something.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Senator Boswell, please cease interjecting.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You'll have a chance to speak.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. You will have a chance to speak, Senator Boswell, and I am so looking forward to hearing your contribution.


Now the LCOE calculations that appear to have completely baffled Senator Boswell's colleague Senator Edwards are just a standard way of assessing one energy technology against another. If you are going to compare the lifetime capital and operating costs of an energy technology in a way that is fair—you can compare a nuclear power station, coal, gas and various forms of renewable energy technologies, new and mature—then you need a metric like the levelised cost of electricity, otherwise you are not operating on a level playing field.


It is a shame that Senator Edwards came in here expressing his bafflement at how these calculations are made, because they are entirely standard in the energy industry. What they tell us is that a new wind farm can supply electricity at a cost of $80 per megawatt hour, compared with $143 or $116 from a new coal or gas fired power station. Senator Boswell, 80 is lower, is less, than 143—



Senator Boswell interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Boswell, please.




Senator LUDLAM:
  so wind electricity is therefore cheaper—cheaper is the word that I will use—than coal or gas. And both coal and gas technologies have important negative health consequences for the people living near them. Most of the focus has been on coal dust and the impacts of the coal industry, but I would also invite senators to contemplate the plume of toxic organic chemicals that come from, for example, Woodside's gas plant on the Burrup Peninsula that then shrouds the populations of Karratha, Dampier and Roebourne. The gas industry has its health impacts as well, and they need to be called to account.


Senator Edwards—I found this enormously amusing—blamed wind energy for increases in electricity costs in his home state of South Australia. I am from WA, where, because of blocking actions by the Barnett government, we have not seen as great a deployment of wind energy as we have in South Australia. They are starting to get the picture, so we are seeing some installations, but SA, nonetheless, are still further ahead than we are. When you are calculating in a deregulated market like SA the merit order effect of who shall we bring on because there is a supply gap, which generators can supply energy at the least cost, wind energy generators are generating electricity at night for an effective marginal cost of zero, of nothing because, once you have put the capital in, the energy of the wind is delivered for free. And so the Essential Service Commission of South Australia—the ECOSA—which regulates retail electricity prices in South Australia, has recently released a draft price determination that proposes an 8.1 per cent reduction. Senator Boswell, that means the price is going down by 8.1 per cent in the electricity standing offer because you have such a high degree of wind installation generating electricity effectively at the cost of nothing at all. And that, ECOSA proposes, is likely to translate to a reduction of $27 per megawatt hour. What that means in South Australia is a fall in electricity bills by an average of $160 per household. Senator Boswell, that is prices going down, which is different to prices going up.



Senator Boswell interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ludlam, I would ask you to talk through the chair, not directly to Senator Boswell, and that may discourage him from interjecting.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I might need your assistance, Acting Deputy President, in spelling out to Senator Boswell the difference between prices going down and prices going up. We can dwell here further if you think that it would be useful to do so.


Renewable energy is capital intensive, and the costs are all up-front, but your fuel costs are zero, and that goes for solar energy as well, which is why it is so exciting to see in Spain, the United States and other markets around the world the development of very large-scale, effectively better than baseload, solar power stations.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Boswell, they had a housing bubble because of rampant speculation in the housing market, and thank goodness they have got out in front and developed a robust renewable energy technology sector. We will shortly be importing componentry from them because they got out in front. It is not too late for Australia to take a lead in this industry and in this sector, but attacking the wind industry in particular and singling them out, I would respectfully suggest to our coalition colleagues and to Senator Madigan, is a rather poor way of doing that.


Wind power has actually grown faster than the booming solar industry but of course it had something of a head start. In 2008, installed wind power capacity rose by 30 per cent and it is the fastest growing type of new electricity generation. That is why the contributions that you will hear from all Greens who will speak in this debate will say that it is very important to get the planning processes right, to make sure that communities do not feel they are being cut out of the consultation processes if these things are going in their communities or close to their communities.


Currently Australia has 59 separate wind farms, which consist of 1,345 individual turbines with 2,480 megawatts of capacity. Generally you would not get them all generating at the same time but if all of those wind farms were operating at maximum output, they would produce almost 2½ gigawatts of electricity—that is, the output of two large nuclear installations. This technology is mature and it does have a very big place in the Australian energy market. I should acknowledge that there are currently over 14 gigawatts of large-scale wind farm energy projects around the country. One of the reasons the industry is finally stepping up here is that we have some of the policy settings right. We have a renewable energy target that was, I acknowledge, introduced by the Howard government.




Senator Boswell:
  Two per cent.




Senator LUDLAM:
  It was two per cent originally, Senator Boswell. I was around then. We thought at the time that that renewable energy target was interesting and, of course, partly because of rapid advances in the wind industry, that target was met years before schedule. It was ramped up to 10, it was ramped up to 20 and now we are seeing, not because this technology is flaky and not because this technology is expensive but because it is so successful, coordinated attacks by fossil incumbents on the wind energy sector. I do not believe for a moment that the individuals presenting with health concerns at these public meetings or the people who fronted Senate inquiries are part of some grand anti-wind conspiracy, but let us not deny that renewable energy technology, capital intensive but having zero fuel costs, is a very effective competitor to fossil fuels. It has the incumbents extremely worried and they are doing everything they can to shut out these competitors.


From a purely commercial point of view you might say that it is their right, as energy incumbents, to protect their investment. The Greens believe there is a public health and an urgent social, economic and environmental imperative to ramp up the output of renewable energy generators across the board. This does not mean cutting regulatory corners, it does not mean putting communities at risk, but the urgency cannot be understated for ramping up this technology. Whether they be mature technologies like wind or encouraging the next generation like concentrated solar thermal plants, the need is absolutely urgent.


To give a sense of the importance of the wind industry, in my home state of Western Australia, the South West Interconnected System, the SWIS, which effectively stretches from Geraldton through to Kalgoorlie and Albany, takes in the big generators in Collie in Kwinana—SWIS is about 50 per cent in the electricity consumed in WA. Of the small fraction of renewable energy on that grid, 75 per cent of the renewable energy is generated by wind farms. Three of the largest ones, Collgar at Merredin, Walk Away at Geraldton and Emu Downs at Badgingarra, are very large-scale utility plants making a large contribution. It is not going to be enough and we believe that the wind energy industry has a big future in WA, as it does elsewhere. We want to see the same results as those we have seen in South Australia where the large-scale deployment of this technology is seeing wholesale electricity prices falling.


The coalition are entitled to their own opinions and that is good. That is why we assemble in this parliament—to have a clash of opinions. But can you at least not invent your own facts and make things up, which Senator Edwards was doing before, insisting that wind energy has pushed prices up when the South Australian electricity regulator is telling us it is pushing prices down. We know to a decimal place how far wind energy is pushing prices down. I want to underline the idea that we start now in a serious way to roll out the next generation of renewable energy infrastructure, which, once it is built, requires maintenance but no fuel. That is what will ultimately push electricity prices down. When we become efficient about how we use electricity and stop wasting so much of it and when we finally have a large amount of infrastructure in the ground which effectively has zero fuel costs, we will start to see electricity prices coming down.


We do not believe that this bill provides the best way forward, although I think all of us who have contributed have acknowledged the motives of Senator Madigan in bringing it forward as being to give some voice to people who have expressed genuine health concerns. All I can really do by way of comfort to Senator Madigan is to call his attention to the way Senator Di Natale, or the other the Australian Greens, spelt out that these people do need to be given a voice, to have their legitimate concerns aired. But let us have a look at the cause and effect relationship, at exactly what is giving rise to these concerns in the first place. We should look in a fairly clear-headed way at Denmark—world leaders in wind energy technology. They have huge onshore and offshore installations and buffer zones; they do not have people living right underneath the turbines for perfectly good reasons. They have zero of the health effects that some claim are causing the impacts which are being reported to Senate inquiries and through various other processes.


The Greens will stand with the wind energy industry. It has a huge part to play in energy policy here in Australia. We will not be giving them free rides. We will not be enabling cutting of corners, regulatory or consultative, but let us at least try to work from an acknowledged body of facts in this debate—to do any less than that really is to let down the constituents who have spoken to Senator Siewert and Senator Madigan expressing these health concerns—so that collectively we can take the urgent actions that are required of this present generation to rapidly expand the installation and deployment of renewable energy in this country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2013-02-28,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:51):  I have listened to Senator Ludlam carefully, and what he is saying as I understand it is that, if you subsidise something so much, it becomes cheaper and therefore it will give out a cheaper product in the end. If I could put it this way, if the government completely built every house, paid for it and put it on the rental market then of course your rent would be less than for someone that had to build a house and get a return on his investment. That is what Senator Ludlam is saying in a nutshell: the government pays for it—well, the government does not pay for it; the cost gets passed on—the product becomes cheaper and therefore eventually you will not have to pay for it or it will cost less. That works if there is a subsidy on it. If Senator Ludlam can tell me that renewable energy does not need a subsidy, he has got the strongest convert he will ever get. But unfortunately renewable energy does need to be heavily subsidised, and that subsidy is being paid for by industry in Australia.


That is not the subject of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012. The subject of this bill that is presented by Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon is to consider the health issues and the effects on the communities and lifestyles that people are forced into as they live in the vicinity of these particular wind farms and solar energy farms. It is not something I have followed closely, but I have heard and listened to people that say they have definitely been affected, and I think this bill deserves support. I hope the coalition will support it.


But I think there is a bigger effect than that. That is a huge effect, but the effect this is having on prices, the cost of industry, the cost of business and the cost of jobs has to be taken very seriously into consideration. I have here a list of industries that are paying a renewable energy tax and a carbon tax, and I have a list of these people that were paying these taxes in July. I will not mention their names, except for the people that have said that I can. There is a car hire business. You would not think a hire car business would pay much renewable tax or carbon tax. In July they paid $440 of carbon tax and a renewable energy tax of $291. Multiply that out. This is for a very small car hire business. The combined carbon tax and renewable energy tax comes to $8,772 a year. That is a domestic industry. It is a small industry. It probably has an office and not much else. So those self-employed people that drive those cars have to front up for a tax bill of $8,772 every year.


I have another one here called Urangan Fisheries. Urangan Fisheries is owned by a friend of mine called Nicky Schulz. He started off fishing when he was a kid. In fact, he went out fishing in a sailing boat and then developed a fishing business and then, from that, developed an export industry. It employs 60 or 70 people. I asked him to do his carbon tax sums. He said he would in July. In July his carbon tax was $1,967.75 and his renewable energy tax was $1,294.87. So multiply that by 12 and he is up for $39,151.44 in carbon and renewable energy tax. Nick Schulz is a fisherman who worked his way up to be a fish processor, and his product goes on the export market. Because of the high dollar he is having tremendous trouble meeting the market—getting his product away. He has three or four boats of his own, and a number of other fishermen come in and use his facilities to process their fish. He has to meet a high dollar and then pay $39,000 for the privilege of having a carbon tax and a renewable energy tax. How do people compete? How can he compete? How can he sustain his business, which is basically export, when these taxes are inflicted on him? He is having a great deal of difficulty doing it.


There is another one, a Queensland ice distributor. I knew these people. Ithaca Ice Works, as it is known, is run by the Mee family—Jimmy Mee. There have been three Jimmy Mees: I have known his grandfather and his father, who is about my age, and now the son runs Ithaca Ice Works. It is a family business, probably employing 20 or 30 people. They are forced into paying a carbon tax of $4,676.72 for July and a renewable energy tax of $3,093, which comes to $93,236. That is renewable energy and a carbon tax. To say, as Senator Ludlam did, that a carbon tax and renewable energy are not costing anything is just absolutely wrong. They are costing industry a fortune.


I have another one here: a small poultry farm paying $8,446 in combined renewable energy and carbon tax. I can go on and on and on. There is a fairly significant hotel on the Gold Coast paying $13,057 a month in carbon tax and renewable energy tax of $9,209 a month—a total of $267,192. These people are struggling. The tourist industry is struggling because of the high dollar. They are fighting to stay in the game, and then a renewable energy cost and a carbon tax are inflicted on them, and then they have to compete against much cheaper nations for the tourist dollar. It is just hurting them. It is a killing field out there. Twenty-seven thousand jobs have been lost in the manufacturing industry. I am not suggesting it is all because of the carbon tax and the renewable energy tax, but they have taken a toll.


If we want to have a manufacturing sector in Australia, we have to take all this into consideration. It is not only the wind farms; it is the same with other technologies like solar—especially rooftop—which continues to enjoy generous subsidies via the Renewable Energy Target scheme. Australians are paying for energy sources that achieve nothing environmentally and only work to drive power prices higher every year. RET is costing Australia $5 billion a year, not far behind the $9 billion carbon tax. The RET in its current form is unacceptable, and one reason for that is that it was originally a fixed target, but now with 20 per cent by 2020 we are paving the way for around 20 to 28 per cent of power to be sourced from renewables by 2020. We put a target figure of 20 per cent, but, because of the dwindling demand for energy across Australia, AEMO's annual energy and maximum demand forecast in 2012 was significantly lower than the 2011 estimate. Matt Zema said:


We have not seen electricity use drop this much since the National Electricity Market (NEM) commenced.


Energy use in the large industrial sector was expected to decline three per cent between 2011-12 and 2012-13. That is expected to fall even more over the next five years.


You would think with a rising population and a demand for more jobs that our energy use would be going up. Instead, jobs are being cut, factories are shutting down and electricity consumption is falling—all thanks to the sky-rocketing prices that have resulted from the carbon tax and RET. Reducing the LRET to 28,000 gigawatt hours would make it a true 20 per cent target rather than the 41,000 gigawatt hours target that represents around 26 or 28 per cent of the forecast future demand. Power companies, businesses and industry have all flagged a significant cost saving that could be made by doing this. It is chilling to think what the Australian situation could be in 2020, with 26 to 28 per cent of power coming from renewables. Right now around 10 per cent of electricity generated in Australia comes from renewable sources. Of that, seven per cent is from hydro while three per cent is from wind and solar. The Productivity Commission estimated that the abatement of one carbon tonne cost $60 for wind sources and between $473 and $1,043 for solar sources. Hydro is reliable and relatively cheap, but wind and solar are costing us too much and we do not gain anything environmentally.


Just last week the Queensland Competition Authority announced the biggest hike in household electricity prices in years. The typical customer's annual bill went up by $253. Solar rooftop subsidies and the carbon tax were named as the big culprits. Make no mistake—wind and other renewables are just as bad. The cost of RET now stands at 60 to 70 per cent of the cost of the carbon tax. This will only go up as the annual renewable target goes up. The QCA's findings were not isolated. IPART has already reported the average cost of RET compliance for a typical electricity customer will be $102 per household, which is a nearly five per cent increase on the previous year. It is not only householders who are suffering under the wind and solar power induced RET burden; energy retailers have been forced to pass on the cost of overpriced renewable generated electricity to their customers or to shoulder them themselves. Origin Energy will cut 350 jobs by the end of this year, mostly in Queensland and Victoria, on top of the 500 jobs it has already cut this financial year. There were the 500 or so jobs cut last year by Ergon Energy, which has long pinpointed RET and the government's carbon related policies for pushing up prices. If the power companies are struggling with the cost of renewables, it is their business customers who are really bearing the brunt of this destructive policy. I have brought into this chamber several examples of the hundreds of thousands of dollars RET along with the carbon tax is costing Australian business. As long as 2020 renewable target stays in place, these huge Greens influenced imposts will not go away. One large industrial user in Queensland predicted a $5.78 million electricity bill this year—$1 million tied to the carbon tax and $495,000 tied to RET. Over a quarter of its bill will come from the carbon tax and RET combined. The RET alone represents almost 10 per cent of the power costs.


We all rely on our experience in this place. Senator Di Natale is a doctor and he brought forward his views on renewables. Before I came into this place I sold hardware products and represented various factories in industry. I know how they work and I know who they employ. I know the value of people having a job and I know the value of low-income earners having a job. Unfortunately we are seeing 27,000 people losing their jobs—not because of the high dollar but because of the high renewable energy and carbon tax costs. They are the people that the Labor Party should be supporting—the lowest paid people and the people on Newstart who get $38 a day—and they have been told to go and find a job. I do not know where these jobs are, because every day you see industry closing—300 jobs at Amcor the other day, Pentair, Origin Energy. If factories are not closing, they are moving to New Zealand, like Heinz, which is shutting down some lines here and moving to process tomatoes and beetroot in New Zealand because the costs are too high here.


When manufacturing businesses make the decision either to close or to turn into distributing businesses, buying products from China or America and distributing them and going from perhaps 300 jobs to 60 jobs, they are announcing that renewable energy and the carbon tax are pushing them out of business. It is the underprivileged, those on low incomes, who are paying the price. They are the processors, the people on the production lines; they are the people who work in factories. They are the people out in the west, where the Labor Party are at the moment, trying to say, 'We support you.' Well, they do not support you. They are keeping you out of jobs. Pentair, the pipe manufacturing people in Western Sydney, had to close down. A couple of hundred jobs went there.


If the Prime Minister is sincere, she will go out there and try to recognise the problems that people from Western Sydney have. They do not live in the eastern suburbs; they live in the western suburbs and they have been traditional Labor Party voters. But, because of the high carbon tax prices and the renewable energy tax, businesses are shutting down every day. Amcor shut down just the other day. There are 700 jobs going from various businesses. I do not think 27,000 is a realistic figure. The Food and Grocery Council said that 7,000 jobs have been lost from the food processing industry, with 350 businesses having shut down.


These are not the people who live in eastern Sydney or on the North Shore; these are the people who live out in the western suburbs. They want a job. They want the dignity of having employment. But you have given them $38 a day and said, 'Go and get a job.' Well, there are no jobs out there; they have been shut down. All the Labor Party have done is come up with an industry policy that has put more cost on businesses. They are trying to embed in business a public servant who is supposed to tell them what to do and how to source local government product. Businesses know where the cheapest product is. That is how they live—by sourcing cheap products to make their product and put it on the market.


Every day we see the government come up with some stupid thought bubble, some stunt that says that business will pay: 'We will shift the cost onto businesses and they will pay.' Businesses cannot pay any more. They have had it up to the neck. They are going underwater, they are closing down and they are shifting offshore. We are going to see a diaspora of Australian manufacturers and Australian food processors right around the world because they cannot live in Australia with the high dollar and the high costs. It is completely closing down. I think the Prime Minister would understand that you cannot just keep putting costs on businesses and expecting them to employ. If you do that, the inevitable is going to happen; they are going to shut down, turn into distributing companies, import their product from overseas or shift overseas and export back into Australia.


A carbon tax and a renewable energy tax are just luxuries that Australia cannot afford to pay. A renewable energy tax does not achieve the lessening of carbon. A carbon tax gets carbon out of the air but renewable energy does not. Therefore, I will support this bill of Senator Madigan’s. I think he should be commended for bringing it before the Senate.

"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-02-28,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (11:11):  I rise to speak to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012, introduced by me and Senator Xenophon. This bill does not actually belong to Senator Xenophon and I; it belongs to and represents a growing number of people in Australia who are affected by wind turbines placed near their homes in rural Australia. The number of people living with wind farms near their home is increasing and will continue to increase. Permits are currently being granted all over the country.


My stance on renewable energy has been questioned, but both Senator Xenophon and I have spoken of the virtues of various types of renewable energy, including geothermal energy, solar energy and tidal energy. In the course of debate on this bill we have spoken about a lot of peripheral issues but not actually about the bill. Even this morning in this place, people have gone off on various tangents. This bill is about people. This bill is about communities. This bill is about people’s health. This bill is about there being an incentive to act and to comply by the proponents of wind farms. If there is no penalty, there is no incentive to act. If there is no regulatory body that actually regulates, it is a toothless tiger.


Earlier today we heard about campaign tactics of fear. The campaign tactics of fear are very broadly used by some in the green movement, which then brings into contention in the community the motives of some in the green movement. Yet I do know that there are many genuine people in the green movement who do have genuine concerns and raise those concerns in the community in a very honest and open way. But the green movement gets tarnished by the actions of some.


Earlier, in Senator Di Natale's contribution, we heard about the contribution of Professor Simon Chapman. Professor Simon Chapman, along with any other person in the Australian community, is entitled to an opinion.


But, when you use the honorific 'professor' in speaking about health, most people in the community believe you are a medical doctor or a professor in the field of medicine. Professor Simon Chapman, however, is a sociologist. Professor Simon Chapman is entitled to an opinion, as we all are. That is his right in our democratic country. But let us be crystal clear about what he actually is and does—while acknowledging that in the past he has done some very good work on the issue of smoking and its effect on people's health.


We have also heard today about the effect on people's health from coal and other forms of energy generation. But how do we know of these impacts? We know coal and other forms of energy have serious health impacts on people because there has been independent, eminent research on the subject. Research is still being conducted today on what is happening to people. I support such research wholeheartedly, whether it is into the impact of coal, coal seam gas or whatever. To question is to learn.


In the midst of all this public debate and toing and froing, people in the community quite often tell me that they feel disempowered. They feel disempowered because they are presented with predetermined outcomes—people turning up at meetings and doing the old tick and flick. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan comes to mind here, and I think the people of Collingullie, west of Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, will attest to that and to their disgust and sense of disengagement with the political process.


As I have said from the first time I raised the issue of wind farms in the Senate, all I want is for there to be independent, rigorous, eminent Australian research under Australian conditions. I want the methodology of and the facts from that research in the public domain so that proponents, opponents and people who are undecided can see how we reached a conclusion. It is important, though, that even when we do reach a conclusion we do not close our minds to new research that may present itself in the future.


I am appalled at how some opponents of this bill have approached this debate. The concerns of men and women around Australia have been belittled, mocked and ignored. Here we are, some 20 months after Senator Siewert chaired the initial Senate inquiry into wind farms, and nothing has been done. I would also like to make it clear that the National Health and Medical Research Council does not itself conduct research. This is something which people in this place fail to be clear about. 'I will hand it to the National Health and Medical Research Council to do it', they say—but the NHMRC does not actually do research itself.


The legitimacy of claims of illness caused by wind farms have been questioned and the people making those claims belittled. We have heard the claims of these people referred to as being the result of 'the nocebo effect' and we heard experts questioned by the inquiry clearly state that a diagnosis of illness caused by wind farms could never be considered until every other possibility had been eliminated. I have always said that the onus of proof should not be on residents to prove that a wind farm is damaging to his or her health; the onus should be on the proponent—the corporation making the profits—to prove that they are compliant and that they are not having an adverse effect on people's health.


I have also raised grave concerns about the way this bill was dealt with in committee. Leading experts on both sides of this argument from around the world gave evidence which, in some cases, was either ignored or distorted. I question Senator Cameron's attempts to explain away all the health complaints by reference to what he also calls 'the nocebo effect'. In doing so, he totally ignores the overwhelming evidence that health impacts from wind turbines can be and have been proven—that they are a legitimate concern.


To date, the objections I and others have received from the wind industry have been about the bill's requirement that they supply the data which will determine whether they are in breach of regulations or not. If they are not in breach, what is the problem? I would have thought that they would be tripping over themselves to provide the necessary information to support their claims that they are compliant with the so-called regulations which govern them.


I find it ironic that the proponents of this industry are the sorts of people who espouse free markets—the so-called level playing field. Yet here we have an industry which is not subject to the same requirements as every other industry in this country. Every other industry in this country is subject to an 'intrusive noise' definition of background noise plus five decibels. This industry is not. When we talk about noise in an urban setting—say, for instance, Redfern in Sydney—the background noise is different from the background noise in a place like Waubra.


People living in the country are used to a different level of background noise from people living in Redfern in Sydney, Brunswick in Melbourne or in the heart of Brisbane. You cannot compare them.


I think the problem is that, like the Waubra wind farm, many wind farms are operating without having been given a certificate of compliance by the state authority, yet they have been accredited by the Clean Energy Regulator and are in receipt of hundreds of millions of dollars in renewable energy certificates. The checks and balances appear to have been pushed aside in the rush to get the turbines up and running and to start the lucrative flow of RETs.


My argument is that this bill is to address people. We are elected by people to represent people. We are not elected to represent corporations and we are not elected to represent an ideology. We, collectively in this place, have a duty of care to people. Today we have heard the economic arguments, but the fact is that we are talking about people. Time and time again this debate has fallen into an economic argument. This debate, this bill, is about people, about their health and wellbeing and about their right to live on their properties and enjoy them the way they have for generations. These people are not political activists, and a great majority of these people are coalition voters. These people, who are also ALP voters and Greens voters, are affected by these things.


I implore all of you to think seriously about this matter and to give this industry the scrutiny that you foist onto other industries—and rightly so—to make them accountable. If this industry can prove that it is compliant, that it is not doing what people claim is affecting their health and that of their families and their communities, I will be the first one to stand up in this parliament and admit that I got it wrong. To date, I do not believe I have got it wrong. Let me assure you that I will stand up here and I will say, 'I got it wrong.' How many people ever stand up in this place and say that they got it wrong? We just carry on regardless. We never say, 'We got it wrong.' But there is a whole group of people whose health is affected. Let us get to the bottom of it, let us stop ignoring it and let us create a real level playing field.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:33):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Thank you, Mr President, and I thank the Senate. I simply seek to make clear the coalition's position in relation to the bill that was just voted down, given that it was last year that my second-reading contribution was recorded. The coalition is extremely disappointed that the Labor Party and the Australian Greens just joined forces to stymie debate on this legislation of Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon. We had sincerely hoped to be able to proceed to the committee stage and had circulated, as all senators are aware, extensive amendments to Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon's legislation. The coalition supported the second reading vote because the coalition hoped to be able to proceed with debating those amendments. Regrettably, that is not going to occur. I indicate to the Senate that the coalition's position at the third reading would have been conditional upon the passage of our amendments, which we are very disappointed not to have had the opportunity to debate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:31):  This bill is certainly one that relates to a topic very much discussed around the Australian community. I refer senators to the speech of Senator Birmingham back in November 2012 which confirmed very serious concerns about the health impacts of the noise coming from wind farms. I understand that since November last year we have proposed some amendments to the bill, effectively calling upon the National Health and Medical Research Council to develop appropriate guidelines for an independent study of the impacts of wind farms and the noise of wind farms on people living in the vicinity.


Mr Deputy President, as you know, I come from the north of Queensland. There are some wind farms up around Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tableland—indeed, they were some of the first wind farms to be established in Australia. There has been concern from residents in that area about health impacts on them from those wind farms. I have to say that, while I am one who believes in renewable power, I have often wondered about the visual pollution that wind farms cause. I remember in the very early days of the Greens political party, they were very vocal about the visual pollution of wind farms. You only have to go out to Lake George near Canberra to see what used to be a wonderful country vista with magnificent rolling hills—





Senator Boswell:
  I just can't understand the Greens on this.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You're right, Senator Boswell. I cannot understand the Greens on this either. Mind you, I cannot understand the Greens on anything. I do understand this and this alone: that they are a very left-wing socialist party and some of their members like Senator Rhiannon make no bones about that. They are quite open about the fact that they were once members of the communist party and believe in that socialist, left-wing dogma. That much I do understand about the Greens—anything else I do not really.


There is the issue of visual pollution. There is a place for wind farms at times, but one has to wonder why the community has not been outraged just at the visual pollution. Senator Madigan's bill refers more to the genuine concerns that many people have about the impact that wind farms are having on their communities, on their lifestyles and on their health. Neither the parliament nor the government should easily dismiss these concerns. You will be aware, Mr Deputy President, that this bill was referred to the Senate's Community Affairs References Committee, which presented a report on the social and economic impact of rural wind farms in June 2011—almost two years ago. The committee recommended that:


… the Commonwealth Government initiate as a matter of priority thorough, adequately resourced epidemiological and laboratory studies of the possible effects of wind farms on human health. This research must engage across industry and community, and include an advisory process representing the range of interests and concerns.


That recommendation was a unanimous one, and I emphasise the words 'as a matter of priority' to do this research. It is typical of the Gillard Labor government that they understand 'a matter of priority' as almost two years later and have ignored issues which really do concern Australians and which many people would say do have an impact on the health of Australians.


Is our Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, looking at these things as a matter of priority or is she campaigning in Australia's longest ever election campaign in Western Sydney? Mr Acting Deputy President, I will bet you that, as she campaigns in Western Sydney, Ms Gillard is not focused on the health concerns many Australians have about wind farms. I suspect that people in Western Sydney would not have to put up with the impact of wind farms, as I suspect there are not too many around that area—



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  And you are right, Senator Boswell, I suspect there are not too many at Rooty Hill, but then I am not sure that Ms Gillard is going to Rooty Hill now. One of Ms Gillard’s ministers actually said that it would be high farce to book in at the Rooty Hill RSL. What a joke of a government. It would be funny if it were not serious, because problems that need the attention of the Prime Minister, problems that are addressed in this bill, are being ignored while the Prime Minister embarks upon Australia’s longest ever election campaign.


On 13 September 2012, a year and a half after the committee's recommendations were made, the government responded by saying that they accepted the recommendations in principle. Again, this shows how focused Ms Gillard is on the real health concerns of Australians! Apparently the government then provided an NHMRC literature review. They said, 'Here are a lot of readings on the subject; that is our response.' But that is not the sort of Australian based research, with thorough epidemiological and laboratory studies, that we think is necessary to provide the robust scientific evidence needed to manage this very concerning issue.


Senator Madigan and most of us on this side of the chamber believe that, where it is important, where it is relevant, we should make our decisions based on science. The government have continually ignored science. You only have to look at the bioregional marine plans to see that the government’s decision in that important area for Australians was based on the lobbying of a foreign environment group which has little concern about the Australians who would be impacted, and there was practically no reference to the science on the subject. One aim of the marine bioregional plan was to save fish stocks in the Coral Sea, near where I come from. The take of fish from the Coral Sea over many, many years has been infinitesimal. Even a year 1 science student would have been able to tell the Gillard government that. But they do not make decisions on the basis of science, as they should; they make them on the basis of political necessity, on the importance of getting Greens preferences at the next election and on the fact that the Greens are supported by some very wealthy people, including the Pew Environment Group. That group commenced some years ago in the United States on the back of very big donations from oil companies in the United States that felt they needed to absolve their consciences by doing something 'positive' for the environment.


We believe that these December isions and what Senator Madigan is calling for in his bill have to be based on science. That is why we have proposed an amendment to this bill which seeks a scientific approach. Senator Madigan will no doubt speak for himself later, but I understand there is some support for the idea that we should insist upon proper and adequate scientific research.


I mentioned my interest in wind farms. There are some in North Queensland. I have always been appalled by their visual pollution, particularly around Canberra, and in the north. There was the CopperString proposal up in North Queensland—




Senator Boswell:
  The Bob Katter proposal?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I am not even sure who you are talking about.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Macdonald, you will ignore the interjections.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I think Senator Boswell mentioned a politician up that way. I am not sure if he is a politician—you never see him in parliament. You never see him voting on important issues. I never take much notice of what the current member for Kennedy says. I do recall, Senator Boswell, that for years he has been talking about development of the north and some water storage facilities on the Flinders and other rivers up that way. When a leaked draft coalition discussion paper on these things hit the newsstands—I do emphasise it is not coalition policy at this stage—all Mr Katter could do was oppose the proposals that I thought he had been calling upon and supporting for a long period of time. But it is always difficult to understand what Mr Katter's view is on anything.


There was a proposal for a power grid in the north. I do not want to go into that; it has fallen on tough times. But part of that proposal was for a wind farm in the plains to the west of Townsville, around Hughenden.


One would think that, if there are to be wind farms, somewhere like that might be a good place—assuming the wind patterns are appropriate there. It is, to a degree, away from population bases, so the sorts of health difficulties which Senator Madigan referred to in his bill would be obviated.


We believe there should be research which, as I said, includes full monitoring and full laboratory and epidemiological studies. It should be research which ensures that the views of industry and community are heard so that areas of concern can be studied and addressed. It should look at audible noise, low-frequency noise—infrasound—electromagnetic radiation and vibration arising from or associated with wind farms, including wind turbines. It should look at transmission lines, substations, telecommunications towers and other structures associated with industrial wind electricity generation. That is why we are moving this motion.


Wind farms and wind power generation are important in achieving the 20 per cent renewable energy target set by the Commonwealth—by the Howard government. As time has moved on, however, more and more questions have been raised about whether that 20 per cent renewable energy target is appropriate for Australia at the present time. I assume Senator Boswell will speak a lot more about that in his contribution to the debate on this bill. Suffice it for me to say that I do think there is a change in community perception and I think that is something the current government and any future government might have to look at very carefully.


In the limited time left to me I will just raise a couple of things. I am a great believer in hydro power. Very often you will hear people from Tasmania—and the Greens political party, for some reason, seem to have a greater following in that state than anywhere else—




Senator Siewert:
  They are sensible in Tasmania.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It is a state which lives on hydro power and yet, when you talk about hydro power in any other state, suddenly it is bad, it is wrong and you cannot have it. You can have it in Tasmania but not anywhere else. Perhaps one of the Greens senators might tell me why it is good in Tasmania but not good in Queensland.


Fortunately, a new government in Queensland is seriously looking at hydro power. The Burdekin Dam has been up for some time—an initiative of the Fraser Liberal government—and now there is considerable money being spent on putting a small hydro-electricity power plant on it. There are opportunities to raise the dam wall and to increase the power supply from doing so. There was also a community meeting, just a couple of weeks ago up in Ravenshoe, at which the Tully-Millstream Koombooloomba Dam extension was discussed at length. Quite a bit of work has been done on that.




Senator McLucas:
  Not Tully-Millstream again!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I see Senator McLucas mumbling to herself. You would think that, as a senator sometimes based in Cairns, she would be aware of community interest in a baseload power station for Cairns—a power station which relies not on fossil fuels but on water power. Rather than mumbling about it, I would have thought that Senator McLucas, who will no doubt take part in this debate later, would have had some interest in it.


I also mention the idea of using the enormous amounts of water which come out of the mountain ranges of Papua New Guinea to supply power—and perhaps even water in times of drought—to Queensland and Australia. The Queensland government some time ago put in place a memorandum of understanding with the PNG government on that proposal. It is something which shows that there alternatives to fossil fuels, that you can use renewable energy and that you can perhaps do so cost-effectively.


I know Senator Boswell and many other people have been concerned at the cost to Australia of the renewable energy program. I lament always that Ms Gillard broke her promise not to introduce a carbon tax. The carbon tax of course does not reduce carbon emissions. Even on the government's own figures, carbon emissions increase under the carbon tax. Australia is responsible for less than 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. One therefore wonders why Australia is burdened with the world's largest carbon tax—$23 a tonne. The Europeans are paying either $5 or $10, depending on which day of the week it is. The New Zealanders are paying $1. I think some Chinese provinces are doing it at 20c. Australia is paying $23, going up to $29, going up to $39, going up to $300 a tonne—and the Labor Party wonders why the jobs of Australian workers are going offshore. Time does not allow me to pursue that further except to lament that our Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, as the Labor leader, would promise not to introduce a carbon tax and then make it the first thing she did. I see that she and her ministers continue to say what a great thing the carbon tax is. If that is true, why did she promise not to introduce it? Did she not understand, back before the last election, that it would be as good as she now claims it to be? It just shows what an absolute farce the current government of Australia is.


Needless to say, this is an important bill. I congratulate Senator Madigan for raising it. I will be supporting the coalition's amendments and I hope that means we will actually get somewhere on this very important issue. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (09:51):  I must admit to some disappointment that we are today debating a bill about wind farm noise. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Windfarms) Bill has its origins in concerns about the supposed health effects of living next to wind farms. As Senator Milne noted in her contribution to the debate, an enormous variety of symptoms have been attributed to wind turbines. The list starts with headaches, nausea, loss of sleep and fatigue, and goes as far as things like terminal cancer. Indeed, allegations have been made that animals keel over dead as a result of wind turbines. As a doctor, many of these symptoms are familiar to me, and they do have much in common with many other conditions that are associated with modern life. I do not doubt for a moment that these symptoms are real, but the cause is much more complicated than the substance of this bill implies.


What we are debating today are matters of scientific fact—are wind farms noisy, how much acoustic energy do they introduce into the environment, does that energy have a direct impact on the human body that can lead to health problems. These are not political questions; they are questions of empirical fact. I will come back to the facts of the health impacts of wind farms in a moment, but I do need to emphasise the importance of science in this debate. Science is the pursuit of truth; the pursuit of knowledge. As a scientist by training I have always respected, indeed have been in awe of, the scientific method and what it has achieved for the human race. The results are all around us. In a few generations, in the blink of history's eye, we have seen air travel, electric power and instantaneous global communication all move from the miraculous to the routine.


My medical training instilled a deep respect for the scientific method as a way of sifting truth from falsehood. Nowhere are the benefits more plain than in medicine. There is a deep respect for this method amongst medical practitioners and researchers. After all, it is not that long ago that medicine concerned itself with balancing the humours and bloodletting. Nowadays a fairly routine trip to the hospital might involve a trip, for example, to a PET scanner. For a PET scan, unstable atomic nuclei are introduced into the body so we can build up a three-dimensional image based on the gamma rays that are emitted. It is just incredible. Few of us would probably stop to consider the centuries of painstaking work that made this possible, but it is reflected in the longer, healthier lives that we lead here today. Many or even most of us would not be alive were it not for the scientific advances of previous decades and centuries.


In other words, science works. Its fruits are on display and cannot be denied. Indeed, we take them for granted. We cannot come up with cogent explanations for the workings of the mobile phone. I use an aeroplane frequently, and I will fly home tomorrow. I trust the phone and the aeroplane, and many other things, because they are built on sound and well tested scientific principles. Science deals with facts in a way that is fundamentally different from politics. Science is not about going into bat for a particular position, about finding some evidence to tailor some predetermined desired outcome. Science is a process; it takes into account the biases inherent in human nature and systematically eliminates them from the final result. Science is not a journey to some predetermined outcome but a commitment to follow the evidence wherever it leads. That is quite foreign to the way public policy is generally made in this place.


It is paradoxical that our lives have become more dependent on science and technology while, at the same time, the status of science in the public debate is eroding. This is a fairly recent phenomenon. It was not that long ago that the polio vaccine, penicillin and even the atom bomb were branded as new reminders of how science is changing everyday lives and the future of our world. As constant scientific and technological innovation has become a part of background life, the significance of science has faded. As a result, scientists now occupy just another voice in the public debate. On a good day they are given equal billing with another lobby group or vested interest, and this is a dangerous thing when we are debating a matter of scientific fact such as whether wind farms are harmful to human health.


Scientists are not always the best people to participate in policy debates—they are often inexperienced and not skilled in the media, and they can be drowned out or outfoxed by those who are much better equipped for these tasks. Cashed-up lobby groups have the skills and resources to distort debates, and it can be difficult for scientific experts to overcome this. We have seen before the dangers inherent in this way of doing things. The tobacco lobby were extraordinarily successful in muddying the waters around science. They did not need to prove that tobacco was safe, that there was no link between smoking and lung cancer—all they had to do was instil in the public mind the idea that the question was not yet settled and then let inertia and commercial interests do the rest. The same thing is happening with climate change—think tanks, pet academics, fake grassroots groups; they have long been sowing doubt about the seemingly undeniable reality of climate change. They are not struggling for cash or access to the megaphone. Powerful and wealthy industries have a commercial imperative to delay action on climate change, and it is frightening to see how successful they have been.


This bill, which I contend is largely the product of such mischief by vested interests, is one small example of the phenomenon that is now playing out all over the world—and critically here in Australia.




Senator Edwards:
  What vested interests?




Senator DI NATALE:
  The irony is that these lobby groups are compelled to cloak their campaigns in the language of science.




Senator Boswell:
  Just like you.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! I remind the chamber that Senator Di Natale has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator DI NATALE:
  Because of their extraordinary success, science and the sciences do command public respect. We still see scientists as disinterested experts we can trust. Politicians and lobby groups do their best to cash in on that. Science suffers from some of its worst abuses when it is misused and twisted to give a veneer of scientific respectability to a specific policy or ideology. This is pseudoscience, and it is rife in the public debate.


Sorting real science from pseudoscience can be difficult for the public at large, and it is a challenge that the media are often not up to. It takes a lot of time and hard-won expertise to do that. After all, an anecdote is very, very powerful. We all know about the power of the personal story. Personal stories are really of little worth when it comes to settling scientific questions, but they do have the power to sway a debate. They make for a juicy and readable story or a compelling TV moment, and the quest for balanced reporting makes it all too easy to give equal time to both sides of the debate. Especially in scientific matters where it may not be apparent where the consensus lies, it is easier to throw in quotes from competing experts. But, in reality, there are not two sides to every story—at least not two equal sides. In a debate like climate change, giving the impression that there are two sides accomplishes precisely what the vested interests want. The science is undermined because it looks like the question is open and the debate is still a live one.


As policymakers, we have to consider a variety of factors. Science is just one of them. Public values, priorities for scarce resources, and even election commitments all need to be taken into account, but we should be honest about it. Hand-picked evidence, friendly experts and data taken out of context are not science. That is just keeping up appearances. The role of science in policymaking is to find out what works. When used honestly, it is not just another tool that one can use to buttress a predetermined ideological position.


Scientists look for evidence that disproves their theories. They know that, if they do not, others will do it for them, and they will look foolish and lazy. No slogan, no matter how well received by a focus group, will help a scientist if her peers have failed to replicate experimental data. An inconsistency in theory cannot be dismissed based on good polling. In other words, integrity is critical in science. When used properly, science brings integrity back into public policy.


On the substance of this bill: what does the science tell us about wind farms? Wind farms are a mature technology. There are over 200,000 of them operating in the world today. That is enough for us to have some confidence in the effects they have on health. According to the NHMRC's public statement on wind farms and health, there is no scientific evidence that indicates that wind turbines have a negative effect on human health. The level of noise caused by a wind turbine at 350 metres, well short of the typical distance of houses from any turbine, is barely discernible from the ordinary background noise in a quiet bedroom. Measurements of the infrasound—that is, sound of a frequency too low to be detectable by human ears—show that levels near wind farms are lower than a typical urban environment. Of course, wind turbines are not completely silent. Experiencing the peace and quiet of the Australian countryside is one of my chief pleasures in life. Everyone should be entitled to a quiet environment and a good night's sleep. However, noise issues are already regulated, and wind farms are not exempt from these laws.


So, on the one hand, we have good evidence that wind farms produce noise at low levels, often undetectable to the human ear, and we have a situation where science can suggest no mechanism whereby such noises could impact the human body. On the other hand, we have a considerable body of stories from people who are suffering severe health impacts from their proximity to wind turbines. What is going on here?


The special interests that are hell-bent on disrupting the scientific debate in our papers and on TV are also having an effect on people's health. When outfits like the Waubra Foundation spread fear, uncertainty and doubt about the safety of wind turbines, this scares people. It is a terrible thing to have to worry about your health and that of your family. I shudder to think of how anxious I would be if I thought a facility was being built next to my family's farm that would pollute the environment and make us ill.


The symptoms attributed to the so-called wind turbine syndrome, including headaches, nausea, tinnitus and loss of sleep, appear to be the invention of a single person. Those symptoms are not unknown. There are many historical examples of illnesses such as these associated with the rise of modern technology. In the 19th century, the symptoms we are discussing here today were given the label 'neurasthenia'. In 1880, George Beard attributed the causes of neurasthenia to a collection of things, including wireless telegraphy, science itself, steam power, newspapers and the education of women.


However, these symptoms did not disappear as we got used to the innovations that caused that anxiety back then. More modern examples include high-voltage powerlines, wireless phone towers, fluoridated water and, indeed, vaccination. All of these have been associated with the symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, headache and so forth. In every case, the best science has failed to find a causative link between these issues and adverse effects on human health. Indeed, with things like wireless internet or powerlines, it is often possible to prove that the symptoms continue as long as the sufferer believes that they are being exposed to the source, even when the source no longer exists. In medical science this is known as the nocebo effect: the belief that something causes you real harm.


These problems, known as psychogenic illnesses, are well documented in the scientific literature. Psychogenic conditions may be on the rise. A growing distrust in science is manifesting itself in a suspicion of conventional medicine and technology. The advent of the internet—which is, incidentally, another one of science's great achievements—has widened access to information and misinformation. Anyone concerned about health impacts can find no shortage of information to fan the flames of their fears. Wind turbines would appear to be but the latest example of this phenomenon.


Simon Chapman, who has made some valuable contributions to this debate and has investigated the situation, has found that only a small minority of wind farms have attracted health complaints.


In evidence he gave to the inquiry into this bill he found that, while nobody in Western Australia has ever made such a complaint, it is where anti-wind-farm activism is present that complaints occur. Complaints about health tend to follow publicity about health effects. In short, there is no substantial evidence that wind farms impact on human health. But the literature on psychogenic illness is very compelling in this case.


Further evidence that has been tendered to the inquiry into this bill points out that people who have financial interests in a wind farm near their properties exhibit none of these symptoms. They are also rare in non-English speaking populations, such as in Denmark, where they have many more wind turbines but less access to the English literature on the supposed ailments associated with wind power.


I want to be clear about this: I do not doubt the testimony of those who are experiencing these symptoms. I believe that those symptoms are genuine and do lead to suffering. When somebody says they are experiencing pain or are in discomfort, we should not deny them that experience. Those symptoms are real. What I do contest is the source of these symptoms. The evidence is very clear that the acoustics of the turbines do not have a measurable impact on human health but, of course, the anxiety created by wind farm opponents does. Stress and worry have enormous consequences for health and wellbeing. Once the seeds of fear have been sown, it is very difficult to undo the health consequences. I therefore heartily condemn those who continue to spread this misinformation. It is the spread of misinformation that harms, not the wind turbines themselves. A bill such as this only exacerbates that fear and aids those who want to hinder the development of wind power for other commercial reasons.


This bill focuses on the supposed negative health effects of wind farms which, as I have pointed out, have no scientific basis whatsoever. Yet it completely ignores the health benefits, which are well documented in the scientific literature. Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, including coal, for power generation. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal. As such, it seems absurd that we are spending time debating whether the noise from distant wind turbines can injure people and not debating the terrible and well-documented effects that coal has on human health.


At every stage of the process, from the mining of coal to the combustion of coal and the transport of coal, there are measurable impacts on our health. Coal fired power in Australia burdens the community with a human health cost—including from lung and heart conditions—of over $2 billion annually. Reducing the burning of fossil fuels for electricity and transport can reduce the incidence of these conditions of heart and lung diseases, including lung cancer. In Australia, air pollution is estimated to kill more people every year than the road toll. That does not even take into account the health impacts of climate change; extreme weather; heat waves; flooding; the spread of vector borne diseases like dengue fever and Ross River fever, and the increase in incidences of diseases like gastroenteritis, all of which the World Health Organisation have stated will increase as a result of runaway climate change. The effects of climate change have already been responsible for the deaths of many Australians.


This bill is a case study in the need for evidence based policy. Those who suffer from 'wind turbine syndrome' are not suffering because turbines are dangerous. They are suffering because they have been poorly served by those who claim to be acting in the public interest but are really acting for vested interests. Scaremongering about the health effects of wind power is irresponsible. It causes enormous anxiety for some people and it threatens to derail a promising and necessary industry for this country. For those reasons, I cannot support the bill.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:11):  I rise today to speak on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012. It would come as no surprise to Senator Madigan that I have strong views on this bill and it would also be no surprise to him that I am taking an active interest. I cannot proceed with my presentation to my Senate colleagues without addressing a number of issues which came up with Senator Di Natale's presentation over the last 20 minutes, given that the first 10 minutes of his presentation was a rambling discourse on the effects of science on everything that matters in life. That is very important, but I fail to see how trying to draw the link between the evolution of science and the way in which it is presented is helping his cause here, because that is the very issue this bill is looking to address.


I say from the onset that the proposed coalition amendment throws the onus back onto that issue of science. Basically it would rely on a report to be commissioned by the National Health and Medical Research Council onto the science of effects of this proliferation of wind farms. I hear all the emotive issues like Meniere's disease and tinnitus. I am not going to speak too much about that, but will address how the case was put to me very simply by a prominent sound engineer who has done work on these wind farms and also for most of the government agencies around the country over the years on issues of sound and its effects on the community. I think we have to be very careful to keep this argument simple because it does get clouded with complexity.


This man said to me, 'Senator Edwards, this issue of infrasound is something which does not affect everybody. Let me put it to you this way: if you and I put to sea on a moderate day and you get seasick and I don't, why is that?' I pondered the question. He said, 'That is the same as infrasound.' The cynical people who do not experience the effects of infrasound sit in judgement of those who do experience it. Let us be very careful when we are talking about the science, because science is something that you can hide behind. This is something that does not affect everybody.


With our amendment—it is a credible amendment; it is not something that should be baulked at by anybody here in this chamber—and a competent agency, and none are more competent than the National Health and Medical Research Council, to undertake with strict terms of reference an inquiry into this issue we will hopefully address the facts, rather than involve ourselves in this political discourse which pits science agencies against each other, depending on who is paying. It is the old story: you can get a very, very credible independent expert's report as long as you are paying.


Let me move on. On this area of renewable energy, everybody who has been listening to my comments and contribution knows that my issue has not been on wind farms and has not been around the issue of health—although I believe it is something that should be addressed and will be addressed, if our amendment is adopted. My issue is that the complexity of the argument of wind farms has 99 per cent of the Australian public completely disengaged. They are completely disengaged because they switch off. It is because of the issue at the very heart of wind farms, which is the 20 per cent renewable energy target.


We are committed to renewable energy at the coalition, but it has to be equitable, it has to be spread around this country and there has to be a network in which we can fully take up the benefits of renewable energy. Last year, I sat in on the Select Committee on Electricity Prices' inquiry. I can assure you, it is a very complex area across this country and one which the average Australian cannot get their head around. I will tell you why: to compare the cost of electricity generation—if you can compare it technology to technology—they use a mechanism called the levelised cost. I warn anybody who is listening that they will have to pay attention here, because the basis of renewable energies and the premise of how it is structured is based on this. I will get into acronyms a bit later too. The levelised cost of energy—the LCOE—is the most transparent metric used to measure electric power-generating costs and is widely used as a tool to compare the generation costs from differing sources. The levelised cost of energy, the LCOE, is a measure of marginal costs—that is, the cost of producing one extra unit—of electricity over an extended period. It is sometimes referred to as long-run marginal costs or LRMC.


The LCOE is representative of the electricity price that would equalise cash flows—that is, the inflows and outflows—over the economic life of the energy-generating asset. It is the average electricity price needed for a net present value, or an NPV, of zero when performing a discounted cash flow, a DCF, analysis. With the average electricity price equal to the LCOE, an investor would break even and so receive a return equal to the discount rate on the investment. The LCOE is determined by the point where the present value of the sum discounted revenues is equivalent to the discounted value of the sum of costs. The analysis of the levelised cost of electricity uses a set of core economic parameters and assumptions to enable a relatively consistent comparison of electricity generation technologies.


These assumptions have had a significant impact on the LCOE calculation—with assumptions about interest rates and policies such as carbon taxes et cetera, which all remain important in any calculation that is based on the economic life of the asset. Who could not be absolutely compelled by that argument? You wonder why people just pay their electricity prices and do not get involved in this discussion about renewable energy! The people that do get involved in this discussion are the people that are affected. That is the people who are affected both visually and regarding their health, which you cannot ignore. Senator Di Natale quite rightly said that those people should be heard—excuse the pun—because any pain should be addressed. As I said earlier, the pain is not experienced by everybody but cannot be ignored by anybody.


The people of Australia are unwittingly paying both high social and economic costs to produce wind energy. This bill is important for ensuring a sustainable balance can be struck between those interests of both local communities and wind farm developments, while still meeting Australia's 2020 commitment to renewable energy targets.


In in my home state of South Australia, we have had significant firsthand experience with wind farms. At Waterloo near my hometown of Clare, in the state's mid-north, TRUenergy announced plans only six months ago to add six new wind turbines to its existing Waterloo wind farm. It is a project worth about $40 million. So it is an issue for me and it is very close to home. It is also an important fact—and if anybody has followed my comments on this they would know—that South Australia accommodates nearly half of the wind power that has been installed to date across the country. Not insignificantly or surprisingly, this has resulted in significant increases in electricity prices throughout the state in recent years. South Australia has the highest rate of electricity in this country. It nearly parallels those with the world's highest power costs.



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  I will take interjections at any time from the Greens, if there is some credible thing that they would like to say about this. But the economics of it is that, with the rising cost of living, Australians are struggling to pay their power bills. You can ignore it as much as like and you can surround it with as much science as you would like to produce—



Senator Ludlam interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Edwards, resume your seat. I remind senators on the right that all senators have the right to be heard in silence.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will continue. Renewable energy certificates have enabled developers of wind farms to maximise their returns. Because of the commitment to the 20 per cent target, we have seen, as I said, this proliferation of wind farms in South Australia and this has seen our state pass the 2020 target in the year 2012. So we are eight years ahead of everybody else.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  I am not sure. There are a lot of reasons that we can attribute that to. So concerned was the South Australian community that my state Liberal colleague David Ridgway MLC, who was the shadow minister for urban development at the time, commissioned an inquiry into the activities of and the lax planning laws for wind farms in that state. Last year, the South Australian state planning minister brought in an interim change to the planning rules governing wind farms, which basically meant that it was a free-for-all for wind farm developers. The change allowed turbines to be built just one kilometre from people's homes and stopped people from being able to use existing laws to stop developments close to their home. The minister took away appeal rights. The minister has made an interim regulation in response to court action taken by a landowner against a wind farm proposal in the state's south-east. The court found in favour of the landowner and the development was dropped. We have a Labor minister in South Australia who is so keen to support the federal Labor Party in the proliferation of wind farms that he is prepared to give up his constituency in an effort to be the golden-haired boy amongst his federal parliamentary colleagues.


Wind farm developers have concentrated on South Australia because of the lax planning regulations and the absolutely unfettered ability to get approvals in that state, and this has been a fault of the Rann-Weatherill Labor government. The guidelines have left South Australia out on its own—out there as an absolute beacon of light for those who want to proliferate the development of wind farms in this country. In relation to that heavy hand of government coming down on people in the south-east of South Australia, the Law Society, when providing evidence to the committee of inquiry into these regulations, shared their deep concern about the power that the planning minister had used in setting up interim regulations. Disturbingly, they provided the minister with unrestrained powers to override the community when approving wind farm developments. No wonder there is deep suspicion and deep division within all communities—particularly in South Australia because we have had much of this development.


Politics is not above people, and if people are continually rallying, as they did in Middleton some two Sundays ago, and are wanting to be heard and are failing to be heard by governments then that is a hallmark of a government out of touch. Why can't and why wouldn't the government support the coalition's amendment to have a proper review of this science? I urge governments of all persuasions to have a look at the economics of it to just see if there is potential market failure. We see a procession of superannuation funds—basically those superannuation funds which are controlled by boards of management or have on them directors with trade union backgrounds—that are all flocking to government sponsored policy which protects investment. We have all found in the past that anything a government gives it can take away. So with the subsidies that exist for renewable energies we have to be very careful that we do not get a distortion of one energy type which can then be taken away by another government. What would happen to the economics of wind farms and wind farm developments if they did not receive a rebate for the purchase of renewable energy certificates? They would collapse. This is the problem with creating a business based on subsidies from governments.


The renewable energy target and the subsidies that go with it are relatively well protected because, generally, it is accepted by all in this parliament that we have to have a target for it. But what happens when governments of the ilk that we have in this country run out of money because of rising debt and mismanagement of the budget? Actually, where is Treasurer Swan at the moment? We have not seen him around for weeks now. He is probably lost out in the western suburbs of Sydney, I suspect, trying to find his fearless leader.


We have a reckless government with a cavalier attitude to their budget. On Christmas Eve, they said: 'That surplus we promised? It's not going to be there. Happy Christmas!' What happens to government policies where they subsidise things—and that it is the case with renewable energy—is that they tend to review them when they run out of money: 'How can we pull back? How can we restrain spending?' That is the risk for the Australian people with anything that is government sponsored welfare, if you like—if it receives a subsidy, a payment. Anything that happens with a change of government policy will see those wind farms stand silent—which is what they have to do, if I may digress, when it is a little bit too hot or, ironically, when the wind is blowing too hard. They have to be switched off.


There are many, many aspects to this whole wind farm debate. I am passionate about it. I know people whose health is affected. There are real people whose lives are affected through the regulation and the lack of compassion or understanding. This bulldozer style is typical of socialistic governments, where they just mandate laws without any consultation. I think they commonly call it 'announce and defend'.


A lot of people, including senators opposite, say that wind is wonderful and it does not increase the cost of living. They say that the carbon tax is a magic pudding for all of us and that, while we export jobs, we will all get healthier. Senator Di Natale attributed the deaths of many people to climate change. I guess that Dorothea Mackellar was a visionary. She must have been a visionary because she spoke all that time ago of the effects on this land of 'droughts and flooding rains'—long before the coal fired power stations that you talk of as the evil of this country came into effect. I urge you to support the coalition's proposed amendment.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:32):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


This Bill seeks to amend the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act to give powers to the Clean Energy Regulator that ensure accredited wind farms do not create excessive noise.


Under the Bill, the definition of excessive noise would be background noise plus 10 dBA.


Should a wind farm be found to be contravening the excessive noise provisions of this Bill, it would be prevented from creating and on-selling large-scale generation certificates.


The importance of having a nationally applicable definition of excessive noise has been explained by Dr Bob Thorne, a well-regarded independent acoustician. Dr Thorne said:




""
The thing that none of us has is a consistency across all states. That leads to my mind to the most important function of this bill: it gives a consistent approach to excessive noise throughout all of Australia... This is where I would see the benefit of this particular bill in that it provides a certainty of approach to all states, it provides a certainty of approach to the industry 
and it gives a clear definition to all the different states
'
 legislation.
""



The benefits of a definition of excessive noise that applies to all states and territories will provide clarity and consistency of application throughout Australia.


Those who live close to wind farms can therefore be assured the wind farms are required to operate in accordance with established noise guidelines so that any disturbance caused by wind farm noise is minimised.


Ultimately, this is about empowering individuals and communities who have felt disempowered as a result of these large industrial structures and the excessive noise they create.


The suggested limit of background plus 10 dBA is in fact generous compared with current Australian noise guidelines.


The South Australian Environmental Protection Authority's noise guidelines impose a limit of background plus 5 dBA in cases not involving wind farms.


So we must consider is that, in some areas, noise from wind farms is limited at 40dBA, or background plus 5 dBA, whichever is greater. This figure completely fails to take into account the fact that background noise — the sounds we hear all the time — is going to be far lower in rural and regional areas than in metropolitan areas, and instead allows the highest possible level of noise to occur.


The comparative 'noise nuisance' of 40dBA will naturally be much higher in the areas where wind farms are built.


During the Environment and Communications committee inquiry into this bill, leading acoustician Dr Stephen Cooper gave the following evidence:




""
The standards say that if a noise is above the background it is likely to be annoying and that exceedances of up to five are of marginal significance. So the concept has been that for general noise you can have noise that is audible but once you get to about five, above the background, it starts to present problems to the community or those people being affected by the noise. So if the background is higher in a city environment, then you can have a higher noise 
level. If you are near a large industrial estate or near a freeway that generates noise, then you are in a noisier environment and you can have a higher level of noise emission from the industrial sources.





This graph clearly shows that, as you move to quieter environments, then the criteria that apply should also drop down.
""



Excessive noise in general has been shown to cause sleep disturbance and disruption, as discussed in the World Health Organisation's 'Guidelines for Community Noise'.


There is so much information flying around in this debate that it important that independent research into the potential health effects of excessive noise from wind farms is undertaken.



I note that the Coalition has circulated amendments which, if enacted, would require the NHMRC to cause research to be conducted into the possible effects of noise from wind farms on human health.


I thank the Coalition members who have spent a significant amount of time working with Senator Madigan and me to construct some workable amendments. While I do have some concerns about their other amendments, I strongly support the need for more research.


Unfortunately the wind farm debate has been tarnished to some extent by certain individuals who choose to attack those who complain that their health has been adversely affected.


Allowing for independent research is something we should all support, no matter which side of the debate you are coming from.


A unanimous report from the Community Affairs References Committee in 2011 into the social and economic impact of wind farms in regional areas recommended that independent research be undertaken into the reported health effects.


And at this stage it's appropriate to pay tribute to the late Judith Adams and her tireless work in this area.


The committee also recommended that further consideration be given to the separation distance between wind farms and residences, and that further research be done on the noise effects of wind farms, including infrasound.


I want to take this opportunity to discuss some of the arguments that have been raised against this bill.


Some, including Senator Milne, have claimed this bill is 'anti-wind farm' and part of a campaign against renewable energy.


With respect, this bill is not anti anything except excessive noise.


We already have laws in place to control noise levels around airports, major roads, and other significant infrastructure.


How is this any different?


Yes, there are state and territory laws in place that put noise limits on wind farms. But these vary from region to region, and can't be enforced anyway because there is no real-time noise data available.


Senator Milne also spoke at length against the reported health effects of wind farms. She went so far as to claim that 'where people have a financial interest in the wind farm... these people do not get sick'.


Firstly, I'd like to mention the case of David and Alida Mortimer in the South East of South Australia. They are turbine hosts — they get a financial benefit from having a turbine on their property — but they have been very vocal about the negative impact this has had on their lives.


This bill is not about the purported health effects of wind farms. This bill is about excessive noise — something that is widely acknowledged can have an impact on sleep and quality of life.


But where is the harm in commissioning research into possible health effects? If there is no link, then what is there to fear?


Senator Milne also said she believed Senator Madigan and I were 'part of a campaign against wind energy and renewables in Australia'.


I repudiate that in the strongest terms.


Professor Simon Chapman, whose work on the plain packaging legislation and tobacco advertising I greatly admire, also accused me of being an ""anti-wind farm zealot"", adding that my interest in this cause brought about a ""sad decline of a once admirable independent.""


At least he thought I was admirable once.


Professor Chapman is of course welcome to express his opinion, and I am pleased to be able to express mine.


I am not anti-wind farm.


In fact, I am pro-renewable energy. It is on the public record that I believe it is important that we have a mandated renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020.


I also believe that we have a very long way to go to achieve that.


My issue is not with that target but with the way the target is achieved through an over-reliance on one specific form of technology — wind turbines.


Wind farms do not provide a reliable baseload power, which means dirty coal-fired power stations need to be kept on standby.


We need to be investing in baseload reliable renewables, and I worry that our reliance on wind energy is in fact stifling investment in other areas, such as geothermal, solar thermal and tidal power.


So I am not anti-wind power.


But I do believe that wind power is only one part of the solution, and we shouldn't focus on it to the exclusion of everything else.


In September last year, The Australian's environment editor Graham Lloyd wrote about a two year analysis of Victorian wind farms, undertaken by mechanical engineer Hamish Cumming.


Lloyd wrote:




""
[Cumming
'
s] analysis shows that despite receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from green energy schemes driven by the renewable energy target, Victoria
'
s wind farm developments have saved virtually zero carbon dioxide emissions in the state.
""



He goes on to describe how, despite the feed of wind-generated power into the grid, fossil fuel generators do not reduce their rate of coal consumption.


In South Australia, Cumming estimated that the cost of greenhouse gas abatement was at $1484 a tonne.


I believe climate change is real and must be addressed urgently. We must do everything we can to mitigate the damage it has and will cause to our environment and our economy.


Part of that challenge is reshaping our economy to move towards less carbon-intensive ways of operating across all sectors. It is a fine balance between using a carrot and a stick.


We are not striking that balance.


For example, the structure of the current carbon tax could act as a positive disincentive to investment in other forms of renewable energy.


So, while I of course commend this Bill, I believe we also need to look at our over-reliance on wind energy and the repercussions for investments in other innovative forms of renewable energy.


I note that the Government does have upcoming legislation to extend a tax rebate to geothermal exploration activities.


This is certainly a step in the right direction.


But geothermal projects still struggle to get access to funding, even when specific amounts have been set aside.


For example, in a response to an estimates question I placed on notice last year, the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism stated that the Government had committed a total of $899 million to renewable energy projects.


Of this, only $302 million was for solar projects and $205 million was for geothermal.


And, even worse, only $104 million had actually been received by grant recipients.


This shows a serious neglect in funding alternative forms of energy.


We put all our eggs in one basket with coal-fired power, and we're now paying the price. Let's learn from that and not make the same mistake again.


I understand there is a lot of controversy about wind farms, and that these arguments make some people uncomfortable.


But ultimately, this is a question about excessive noise. It is fair and reasonable that there be a national standard for noise, and that wind farms publish live information to show their compliance with this standard.


In the end, communities must be empowered. They must have access to real-time information on the noise generated from these turbines, because right now they are fighting legal battles with one hand tied behind their back.


In the same way that aircraft noise near airports is publicly available, the same approach should be taken to wind farms.


Surely in the interests of transparency, the industry should not object to this information being made available to local communities.


As I said before, this is no different from noise restrictions in place elsewhere.


I indicate my support for this bill, and I hope this is only the beginning of the debate on these issues.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:32):  I am pleased to speak today on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012. The bill seeks to establish a definition of excessive noise for wind farms and the impact of noise on sleep and health. My colleague Senator Di Natale has canvassed with great sensitivity and coherence the way that you assess how people are experiencing health impacts. He did it far more coherently than I could. It is a shame that Senator Edwards is leaving the chamber, because I did want to pick up on one of the issues that he mentioned.




Senator Edwards:
  I'm still here!




Senator LUDLAM:
  He is still here, which is excellent. The Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill concluded that the bill is effectively discriminatory against one kind of power generator, that the bill will not prevent wind farms from operating but could in fact have an impact on electricity prices and that the bill involves the Commonwealth taking over planning and regulatory responsibilities that, in my view, properly lie with the states.


But the committee also concluded—and perhaps that is something that we can all agree on, although the Greens will not be voting for this bill—that every resident, whether in a city environment or in a rural area, should be protected from unreasonable environmental impacts by the operation of planning laws and guidelines. Obviously that applies to a much larger degree of industrial phenomena than simply wind farms. It is an important principle, though, and I would like to acknowledge Senators Madigan and Xenophon for bringing that forward, apart from the rather peculiar way in which wind farms have been singled out in this bill.


When the committee held the hearing into the bill, in November last year, there were strong feelings from people who felt that they had been negatively affected by wind farms. I draw senators' attention to the comments made by Senator and Dr Di Natale that those people should not be dismissed out of hand, because these symptoms are clearly real. People are not making these things up. But how we attribute the cause is extremely important.


Every large-scale industrial technology can be done badly. It can be done with poor consultation and it can have negative impacts on people. It is the case that wind farms have an impact. They are not invisible. They are large structures in the landscape. So there is a visual impact and there is a noise impact and there do need to be clear regulations in place about how to manage those. Ironically enough, I have never heard anybody in the wind industry, which I have good contacts with, disputing any of these things. We should study the impacts and we should learn the lessons. We need to acknowledge what exists in the medical literature and what does not exist. Most importantly, from the perspective of the Greens, we need to learn how to improve consultation processes with affected communities, whether it is for a wind farm installation or anything else.


The other thing from our perspective is to do with the placement of wind installations. If you put them across bird or bat fly ways, you can have impacts on wildlife. The industry has already learnt a great deal in the decades that it has been operating about how to place these installations well. It is crucial to learn the lessons and improve the processes about this technology, because this industry has such a large and important part to play in the future of electricity generation here in Australia and around the world.


We need to acknowledge another important report into wind farms, which was tabled in June 2011, from a Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry chaired by my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert. That offered another careful consideration of these issues. I am canvassing this history in order to underline the point that we must not dismiss these issues out of hand. I do not think wind farm developers should get a free run and be able to circumvent proper community consultation and proper planning procedures just because they are part of an industry I support. I think they should be held to the same standards of community engagement, public health and safety, and planning guidelines as other things—as we are so dramatically failing to uphold in the instance of the coal seam gas industry, the coal industry and the uranium industry, to name three examples that are close to my heart, where we see communities being assaulted, effectively, by invasive industrial processes that have very real and present health threats to those communities.


So the report that Senator Siewert undertook also adopted quite a sensitive approach to people who had come forward expressing health concerns and undertook very rigorous analysis, in particular, of the concerns around infrasound because those issues, in my view, had not been canvassed particularly well in Australia before that inquiry was undertaken.


So the Greens do take these issues seriously, but we also take the fortunes and the future of the wind energy industry very seriously because it is such an important part of our future. It has to be part of our future to mitigate the worst impacts of dangerous climate change. We already live in the age of climate change, and it is actually completely immaterial whether people like Mr Abbott and Senator Joyce believe it exists or not; it is occurring around them regardless. They can choose to adopt a policy blindfold and stumble around in the dark—I would prefer that they did not because of the harm that it threatens to the rest of us—but it is happening whether they believe it to be so or not.


Wind energy, as the most mature, large-scale renewable energy technology where economies of scale have long been an important part of the reason why it is being built, does have a very important part to play in the energy mix here in Australia. We need a zero emissions energy sector, and wind is clearly going to be a large part of that. In all of the studies that investigate how to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy networks, including the one that Senators Milne and Bob Brown and the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, were able to incorporate in the negotiations for the Clean Energy Act being undertaken right now into what a 100 per cent renewable energy sector for the national electricity market would look like, wind is going to take up a large fraction of the heavy lifting because it is cheap, it can be installed rapidly and the technology is mature. I would like to see a greater degree of local content of manufacturing and fabrication here in Australia.


Part of that is around the economics. Last week, my colleague Robin Chapple and I launched Energy 2029, which is a more fine-grained study than has yet occurred in Western Australia for how you would get to 100 per cent renewable energy on the South West Interconnected System—the SWIS—in WA. In both of the scenarios that we had commissioned, wind did a very large part of the heavy lifting for the reasons I have expressed.


As of February this year, wind is now cheaper than fossil fuels in producing electricity in Australia—




Senator Boswell:
  Absolute rubbish!




Senator LUDLAM:
  and the LC—




Senator Boswell:
  Absolute rubbish!




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Boswell, just listen quietly and you may learn something.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! Senator Boswell, please cease interjecting.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You'll have a chance to speak.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thank you, Acting Deputy President. You will have a chance to speak, Senator Boswell, and I am so looking forward to hearing your contribution.


Now the LCOE calculations that appear to have completely baffled Senator Boswell's colleague Senator Edwards are just a standard way of assessing one energy technology against another. If you are going to compare the lifetime capital and operating costs of an energy technology in a way that is fair—you can compare a nuclear power station, coal, gas and various forms of renewable energy technologies, new and mature—then you need a metric like the levelised cost of electricity, otherwise you are not operating on a level playing field.


It is a shame that Senator Edwards came in here expressing his bafflement at how these calculations are made, because they are entirely standard in the energy industry. What they tell us is that a new wind farm can supply electricity at a cost of $80 per megawatt hour, compared with $143 or $116 from a new coal or gas fired power station. Senator Boswell, 80 is lower, is less, than 143—



Senator Boswell interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Boswell, please.




Senator LUDLAM:
  so wind electricity is therefore cheaper—cheaper is the word that I will use—than coal or gas. And both coal and gas technologies have important negative health consequences for the people living near them. Most of the focus has been on coal dust and the impacts of the coal industry, but I would also invite senators to contemplate the plume of toxic organic chemicals that come from, for example, Woodside's gas plant on the Burrup Peninsula that then shrouds the populations of Karratha, Dampier and Roebourne. The gas industry has its health impacts as well, and they need to be called to account.


Senator Edwards—I found this enormously amusing—blamed wind energy for increases in electricity costs in his home state of South Australia. I am from WA, where, because of blocking actions by the Barnett government, we have not seen as great a deployment of wind energy as we have in South Australia. They are starting to get the picture, so we are seeing some installations, but SA, nonetheless, are still further ahead than we are. When you are calculating in a deregulated market like SA the merit order effect of who shall we bring on because there is a supply gap, which generators can supply energy at the least cost, wind energy generators are generating electricity at night for an effective marginal cost of zero, of nothing because, once you have put the capital in, the energy of the wind is delivered for free. And so the Essential Service Commission of South Australia—the ECOSA—which regulates retail electricity prices in South Australia, has recently released a draft price determination that proposes an 8.1 per cent reduction. Senator Boswell, that means the price is going down by 8.1 per cent in the electricity standing offer because you have such a high degree of wind installation generating electricity effectively at the cost of nothing at all. And that, ECOSA proposes, is likely to translate to a reduction of $27 per megawatt hour. What that means in South Australia is a fall in electricity bills by an average of $160 per household. Senator Boswell, that is prices going down, which is different to prices going up.



Senator Boswell interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ludlam, I would ask you to talk through the chair, not directly to Senator Boswell, and that may discourage him from interjecting.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I might need your assistance, Acting Deputy President, in spelling out to Senator Boswell the difference between prices going down and prices going up. We can dwell here further if you think that it would be useful to do so.


Renewable energy is capital intensive, and the costs are all up-front, but your fuel costs are zero, and that goes for solar energy as well, which is why it is so exciting to see in Spain, the United States and other markets around the world the development of very large-scale, effectively better than baseload, solar power stations.



Senator Boswell interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Boswell, they had a housing bubble because of rampant speculation in the housing market, and thank goodness they have got out in front and developed a robust renewable energy technology sector. We will shortly be importing componentry from them because they got out in front. It is not too late for Australia to take a lead in this industry and in this sector, but attacking the wind industry in particular and singling them out, I would respectfully suggest to our coalition colleagues and to Senator Madigan, is a rather poor way of doing that.


Wind power has actually grown faster than the booming solar industry but of course it had something of a head start. In 2008, installed wind power capacity rose by 30 per cent and it is the fastest growing type of new electricity generation. That is why the contributions that you will hear from all Greens who will speak in this debate will say that it is very important to get the planning processes right, to make sure that communities do not feel they are being cut out of the consultation processes if these things are going in their communities or close to their communities.


Currently Australia has 59 separate wind farms, which consist of 1,345 individual turbines with 2,480 megawatts of capacity. Generally you would not get them all generating at the same time but if all of those wind farms were operating at maximum output, they would produce almost 2½ gigawatts of electricity—that is, the output of two large nuclear installations. This technology is mature and it does have a very big place in the Australian energy market. I should acknowledge that there are currently over 14 gigawatts of large-scale wind farm energy projects around the country. One of the reasons the industry is finally stepping up here is that we have some of the policy settings right. We have a renewable energy target that was, I acknowledge, introduced by the Howard government.




Senator Boswell:
  Two per cent.




Senator LUDLAM:
  It was two per cent originally, Senator Boswell. I was around then. We thought at the time that that renewable energy target was interesting and, of course, partly because of rapid advances in the wind industry, that target was met years before schedule. It was ramped up to 10, it was ramped up to 20 and now we are seeing, not because this technology is flaky and not because this technology is expensive but because it is so successful, coordinated attacks by fossil incumbents on the wind energy sector. I do not believe for a moment that the individuals presenting with health concerns at these public meetings or the people who fronted Senate inquiries are part of some grand anti-wind conspiracy, but let us not deny that renewable energy technology, capital intensive but having zero fuel costs, is a very effective competitor to fossil fuels. It has the incumbents extremely worried and they are doing everything they can to shut out these competitors.


From a purely commercial point of view you might say that it is their right, as energy incumbents, to protect their investment. The Greens believe there is a public health and an urgent social, economic and environmental imperative to ramp up the output of renewable energy generators across the board. This does not mean cutting regulatory corners, it does not mean putting communities at risk, but the urgency cannot be understated for ramping up this technology. Whether they be mature technologies like wind or encouraging the next generation like concentrated solar thermal plants, the need is absolutely urgent.


To give a sense of the importance of the wind industry, in my home state of Western Australia, the South West Interconnected System, the SWIS, which effectively stretches from Geraldton through to Kalgoorlie and Albany, takes in the big generators in Collie in Kwinana—SWIS is about 50 per cent in the electricity consumed in WA. Of the small fraction of renewable energy on that grid, 75 per cent of the renewable energy is generated by wind farms. Three of the largest ones, Collgar at Merredin, Walk Away at Geraldton and Emu Downs at Badgingarra, are very large-scale utility plants making a large contribution. It is not going to be enough and we believe that the wind energy industry has a big future in WA, as it does elsewhere. We want to see the same results as those we have seen in South Australia where the large-scale deployment of this technology is seeing wholesale electricity prices falling.


The coalition are entitled to their own opinions and that is good. That is why we assemble in this parliament—to have a clash of opinions. But can you at least not invent your own facts and make things up, which Senator Edwards was doing before, insisting that wind energy has pushed prices up when the South Australian electricity regulator is telling us it is pushing prices down. We know to a decimal place how far wind energy is pushing prices down. I want to underline the idea that we start now in a serious way to roll out the next generation of renewable energy infrastructure, which, once it is built, requires maintenance but no fuel. That is what will ultimately push electricity prices down. When we become efficient about how we use electricity and stop wasting so much of it and when we finally have a large amount of infrastructure in the ground which effectively has zero fuel costs, we will start to see electricity prices coming down.


We do not believe that this bill provides the best way forward, although I think all of us who have contributed have acknowledged the motives of Senator Madigan in bringing it forward as being to give some voice to people who have expressed genuine health concerns. All I can really do by way of comfort to Senator Madigan is to call his attention to the way Senator Di Natale, or the other the Australian Greens, spelt out that these people do need to be given a voice, to have their legitimate concerns aired. But let us have a look at the cause and effect relationship, at exactly what is giving rise to these concerns in the first place. We should look in a fairly clear-headed way at Denmark—world leaders in wind energy technology. They have huge onshore and offshore installations and buffer zones; they do not have people living right underneath the turbines for perfectly good reasons. They have zero of the health effects that some claim are causing the impacts which are being reported to Senate inquiries and through various other processes.


The Greens will stand with the wind energy industry. It has a huge part to play in energy policy here in Australia. We will not be giving them free rides. We will not be enabling cutting of corners, regulatory or consultative, but let us at least try to work from an acknowledged body of facts in this debate—to do any less than that really is to let down the constituents who have spoken to Senator Siewert and Senator Madigan expressing these health concerns—so that collectively we can take the urgent actions that are required of this present generation to rapidly expand the installation and deployment of renewable energy in this country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",Nats,2013-02-28,"



Senator BOSWELL
 (Queensland) (10:51):  I have listened to Senator Ludlam carefully, and what he is saying as I understand it is that, if you subsidise something so much, it becomes cheaper and therefore it will give out a cheaper product in the end. If I could put it this way, if the government completely built every house, paid for it and put it on the rental market then of course your rent would be less than for someone that had to build a house and get a return on his investment. That is what Senator Ludlam is saying in a nutshell: the government pays for it—well, the government does not pay for it; the cost gets passed on—the product becomes cheaper and therefore eventually you will not have to pay for it or it will cost less. That works if there is a subsidy on it. If Senator Ludlam can tell me that renewable energy does not need a subsidy, he has got the strongest convert he will ever get. But unfortunately renewable energy does need to be heavily subsidised, and that subsidy is being paid for by industry in Australia.


That is not the subject of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012. The subject of this bill that is presented by Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon is to consider the health issues and the effects on the communities and lifestyles that people are forced into as they live in the vicinity of these particular wind farms and solar energy farms. It is not something I have followed closely, but I have heard and listened to people that say they have definitely been affected, and I think this bill deserves support. I hope the coalition will support it.


But I think there is a bigger effect than that. That is a huge effect, but the effect this is having on prices, the cost of industry, the cost of business and the cost of jobs has to be taken very seriously into consideration. I have here a list of industries that are paying a renewable energy tax and a carbon tax, and I have a list of these people that were paying these taxes in July. I will not mention their names, except for the people that have said that I can. There is a car hire business. You would not think a hire car business would pay much renewable tax or carbon tax. In July they paid $440 of carbon tax and a renewable energy tax of $291. Multiply that out. This is for a very small car hire business. The combined carbon tax and renewable energy tax comes to $8,772 a year. That is a domestic industry. It is a small industry. It probably has an office and not much else. So those self-employed people that drive those cars have to front up for a tax bill of $8,772 every year.


I have another one here called Urangan Fisheries. Urangan Fisheries is owned by a friend of mine called Nicky Schulz. He started off fishing when he was a kid. In fact, he went out fishing in a sailing boat and then developed a fishing business and then, from that, developed an export industry. It employs 60 or 70 people. I asked him to do his carbon tax sums. He said he would in July. In July his carbon tax was $1,967.75 and his renewable energy tax was $1,294.87. So multiply that by 12 and he is up for $39,151.44 in carbon and renewable energy tax. Nick Schulz is a fisherman who worked his way up to be a fish processor, and his product goes on the export market. Because of the high dollar he is having tremendous trouble meeting the market—getting his product away. He has three or four boats of his own, and a number of other fishermen come in and use his facilities to process their fish. He has to meet a high dollar and then pay $39,000 for the privilege of having a carbon tax and a renewable energy tax. How do people compete? How can he compete? How can he sustain his business, which is basically export, when these taxes are inflicted on him? He is having a great deal of difficulty doing it.


There is another one, a Queensland ice distributor. I knew these people. Ithaca Ice Works, as it is known, is run by the Mee family—Jimmy Mee. There have been three Jimmy Mees: I have known his grandfather and his father, who is about my age, and now the son runs Ithaca Ice Works. It is a family business, probably employing 20 or 30 people. They are forced into paying a carbon tax of $4,676.72 for July and a renewable energy tax of $3,093, which comes to $93,236. That is renewable energy and a carbon tax. To say, as Senator Ludlam did, that a carbon tax and renewable energy are not costing anything is just absolutely wrong. They are costing industry a fortune.


I have another one here: a small poultry farm paying $8,446 in combined renewable energy and carbon tax. I can go on and on and on. There is a fairly significant hotel on the Gold Coast paying $13,057 a month in carbon tax and renewable energy tax of $9,209 a month—a total of $267,192. These people are struggling. The tourist industry is struggling because of the high dollar. They are fighting to stay in the game, and then a renewable energy cost and a carbon tax are inflicted on them, and then they have to compete against much cheaper nations for the tourist dollar. It is just hurting them. It is a killing field out there. Twenty-seven thousand jobs have been lost in the manufacturing industry. I am not suggesting it is all because of the carbon tax and the renewable energy tax, but they have taken a toll.


If we want to have a manufacturing sector in Australia, we have to take all this into consideration. It is not only the wind farms; it is the same with other technologies like solar—especially rooftop—which continues to enjoy generous subsidies via the Renewable Energy Target scheme. Australians are paying for energy sources that achieve nothing environmentally and only work to drive power prices higher every year. RET is costing Australia $5 billion a year, not far behind the $9 billion carbon tax. The RET in its current form is unacceptable, and one reason for that is that it was originally a fixed target, but now with 20 per cent by 2020 we are paving the way for around 20 to 28 per cent of power to be sourced from renewables by 2020. We put a target figure of 20 per cent, but, because of the dwindling demand for energy across Australia, AEMO's annual energy and maximum demand forecast in 2012 was significantly lower than the 2011 estimate. Matt Zema said:


We have not seen electricity use drop this much since the National Electricity Market (NEM) commenced.


Energy use in the large industrial sector was expected to decline three per cent between 2011-12 and 2012-13. That is expected to fall even more over the next five years.


You would think with a rising population and a demand for more jobs that our energy use would be going up. Instead, jobs are being cut, factories are shutting down and electricity consumption is falling—all thanks to the sky-rocketing prices that have resulted from the carbon tax and RET. Reducing the LRET to 28,000 gigawatt hours would make it a true 20 per cent target rather than the 41,000 gigawatt hours target that represents around 26 or 28 per cent of the forecast future demand. Power companies, businesses and industry have all flagged a significant cost saving that could be made by doing this. It is chilling to think what the Australian situation could be in 2020, with 26 to 28 per cent of power coming from renewables. Right now around 10 per cent of electricity generated in Australia comes from renewable sources. Of that, seven per cent is from hydro while three per cent is from wind and solar. The Productivity Commission estimated that the abatement of one carbon tonne cost $60 for wind sources and between $473 and $1,043 for solar sources. Hydro is reliable and relatively cheap, but wind and solar are costing us too much and we do not gain anything environmentally.


Just last week the Queensland Competition Authority announced the biggest hike in household electricity prices in years. The typical customer's annual bill went up by $253. Solar rooftop subsidies and the carbon tax were named as the big culprits. Make no mistake—wind and other renewables are just as bad. The cost of RET now stands at 60 to 70 per cent of the cost of the carbon tax. This will only go up as the annual renewable target goes up. The QCA's findings were not isolated. IPART has already reported the average cost of RET compliance for a typical electricity customer will be $102 per household, which is a nearly five per cent increase on the previous year. It is not only householders who are suffering under the wind and solar power induced RET burden; energy retailers have been forced to pass on the cost of overpriced renewable generated electricity to their customers or to shoulder them themselves. Origin Energy will cut 350 jobs by the end of this year, mostly in Queensland and Victoria, on top of the 500 jobs it has already cut this financial year. There were the 500 or so jobs cut last year by Ergon Energy, which has long pinpointed RET and the government's carbon related policies for pushing up prices. If the power companies are struggling with the cost of renewables, it is their business customers who are really bearing the brunt of this destructive policy. I have brought into this chamber several examples of the hundreds of thousands of dollars RET along with the carbon tax is costing Australian business. As long as 2020 renewable target stays in place, these huge Greens influenced imposts will not go away. One large industrial user in Queensland predicted a $5.78 million electricity bill this year—$1 million tied to the carbon tax and $495,000 tied to RET. Over a quarter of its bill will come from the carbon tax and RET combined. The RET alone represents almost 10 per cent of the power costs.


We all rely on our experience in this place. Senator Di Natale is a doctor and he brought forward his views on renewables. Before I came into this place I sold hardware products and represented various factories in industry. I know how they work and I know who they employ. I know the value of people having a job and I know the value of low-income earners having a job. Unfortunately we are seeing 27,000 people losing their jobs—not because of the high dollar but because of the high renewable energy and carbon tax costs. They are the people that the Labor Party should be supporting—the lowest paid people and the people on Newstart who get $38 a day—and they have been told to go and find a job. I do not know where these jobs are, because every day you see industry closing—300 jobs at Amcor the other day, Pentair, Origin Energy. If factories are not closing, they are moving to New Zealand, like Heinz, which is shutting down some lines here and moving to process tomatoes and beetroot in New Zealand because the costs are too high here.


When manufacturing businesses make the decision either to close or to turn into distributing businesses, buying products from China or America and distributing them and going from perhaps 300 jobs to 60 jobs, they are announcing that renewable energy and the carbon tax are pushing them out of business. It is the underprivileged, those on low incomes, who are paying the price. They are the processors, the people on the production lines; they are the people who work in factories. They are the people out in the west, where the Labor Party are at the moment, trying to say, 'We support you.' Well, they do not support you. They are keeping you out of jobs. Pentair, the pipe manufacturing people in Western Sydney, had to close down. A couple of hundred jobs went there.


If the Prime Minister is sincere, she will go out there and try to recognise the problems that people from Western Sydney have. They do not live in the eastern suburbs; they live in the western suburbs and they have been traditional Labor Party voters. But, because of the high carbon tax prices and the renewable energy tax, businesses are shutting down every day. Amcor shut down just the other day. There are 700 jobs going from various businesses. I do not think 27,000 is a realistic figure. The Food and Grocery Council said that 7,000 jobs have been lost from the food processing industry, with 350 businesses having shut down.


These are not the people who live in eastern Sydney or on the North Shore; these are the people who live out in the western suburbs. They want a job. They want the dignity of having employment. But you have given them $38 a day and said, 'Go and get a job.' Well, there are no jobs out there; they have been shut down. All the Labor Party have done is come up with an industry policy that has put more cost on businesses. They are trying to embed in business a public servant who is supposed to tell them what to do and how to source local government product. Businesses know where the cheapest product is. That is how they live—by sourcing cheap products to make their product and put it on the market.


Every day we see the government come up with some stupid thought bubble, some stunt that says that business will pay: 'We will shift the cost onto businesses and they will pay.' Businesses cannot pay any more. They have had it up to the neck. They are going underwater, they are closing down and they are shifting offshore. We are going to see a diaspora of Australian manufacturers and Australian food processors right around the world because they cannot live in Australia with the high dollar and the high costs. It is completely closing down. I think the Prime Minister would understand that you cannot just keep putting costs on businesses and expecting them to employ. If you do that, the inevitable is going to happen; they are going to shut down, turn into distributing companies, import their product from overseas or shift overseas and export back into Australia.


A carbon tax and a renewable energy tax are just luxuries that Australia cannot afford to pay. A renewable energy tax does not achieve the lessening of carbon. A carbon tax gets carbon out of the air but renewable energy does not. Therefore, I will support this bill of Senator Madigan’s. I think he should be commended for bringing it before the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2,speech
"Madigan, Sen John",DLP,2013-02-28,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (11:11):  I rise to speak to the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment (Excessive Noise from Wind Farms) Bill 2012, introduced by me and Senator Xenophon. This bill does not actually belong to Senator Xenophon and I; it belongs to and represents a growing number of people in Australia who are affected by wind turbines placed near their homes in rural Australia. The number of people living with wind farms near their home is increasing and will continue to increase. Permits are currently being granted all over the country.


My stance on renewable energy has been questioned, but both Senator Xenophon and I have spoken of the virtues of various types of renewable energy, including geothermal energy, solar energy and tidal energy. In the course of debate on this bill we have spoken about a lot of peripheral issues but not actually about the bill. Even this morning in this place, people have gone off on various tangents. This bill is about people. This bill is about communities. This bill is about people’s health. This bill is about there being an incentive to act and to comply by the proponents of wind farms. If there is no penalty, there is no incentive to act. If there is no regulatory body that actually regulates, it is a toothless tiger.


Earlier today we heard about campaign tactics of fear. The campaign tactics of fear are very broadly used by some in the green movement, which then brings into contention in the community the motives of some in the green movement. Yet I do know that there are many genuine people in the green movement who do have genuine concerns and raise those concerns in the community in a very honest and open way. But the green movement gets tarnished by the actions of some.


Earlier, in Senator Di Natale's contribution, we heard about the contribution of Professor Simon Chapman. Professor Simon Chapman, along with any other person in the Australian community, is entitled to an opinion.


But, when you use the honorific 'professor' in speaking about health, most people in the community believe you are a medical doctor or a professor in the field of medicine. Professor Simon Chapman, however, is a sociologist. Professor Simon Chapman is entitled to an opinion, as we all are. That is his right in our democratic country. But let us be crystal clear about what he actually is and does—while acknowledging that in the past he has done some very good work on the issue of smoking and its effect on people's health.


We have also heard today about the effect on people's health from coal and other forms of energy generation. But how do we know of these impacts? We know coal and other forms of energy have serious health impacts on people because there has been independent, eminent research on the subject. Research is still being conducted today on what is happening to people. I support such research wholeheartedly, whether it is into the impact of coal, coal seam gas or whatever. To question is to learn.


In the midst of all this public debate and toing and froing, people in the community quite often tell me that they feel disempowered. They feel disempowered because they are presented with predetermined outcomes—people turning up at meetings and doing the old tick and flick. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan comes to mind here, and I think the people of Collingullie, west of Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, will attest to that and to their disgust and sense of disengagement with the political process.


As I have said from the first time I raised the issue of wind farms in the Senate, all I want is for there to be independent, rigorous, eminent Australian research under Australian conditions. I want the methodology of and the facts from that research in the public domain so that proponents, opponents and people who are undecided can see how we reached a conclusion. It is important, though, that even when we do reach a conclusion we do not close our minds to new research that may present itself in the future.


I am appalled at how some opponents of this bill have approached this debate. The concerns of men and women around Australia have been belittled, mocked and ignored. Here we are, some 20 months after Senator Siewert chaired the initial Senate inquiry into wind farms, and nothing has been done. I would also like to make it clear that the National Health and Medical Research Council does not itself conduct research. This is something which people in this place fail to be clear about. 'I will hand it to the National Health and Medical Research Council to do it', they say—but the NHMRC does not actually do research itself.


The legitimacy of claims of illness caused by wind farms have been questioned and the people making those claims belittled. We have heard the claims of these people referred to as being the result of 'the nocebo effect' and we heard experts questioned by the inquiry clearly state that a diagnosis of illness caused by wind farms could never be considered until every other possibility had been eliminated. I have always said that the onus of proof should not be on residents to prove that a wind farm is damaging to his or her health; the onus should be on the proponent—the corporation making the profits—to prove that they are compliant and that they are not having an adverse effect on people's health.


I have also raised grave concerns about the way this bill was dealt with in committee. Leading experts on both sides of this argument from around the world gave evidence which, in some cases, was either ignored or distorted. I question Senator Cameron's attempts to explain away all the health complaints by reference to what he also calls 'the nocebo effect'. In doing so, he totally ignores the overwhelming evidence that health impacts from wind turbines can be and have been proven—that they are a legitimate concern.


To date, the objections I and others have received from the wind industry have been about the bill's requirement that they supply the data which will determine whether they are in breach of regulations or not. If they are not in breach, what is the problem? I would have thought that they would be tripping over themselves to provide the necessary information to support their claims that they are compliant with the so-called regulations which govern them.


I find it ironic that the proponents of this industry are the sorts of people who espouse free markets—the so-called level playing field. Yet here we have an industry which is not subject to the same requirements as every other industry in this country. Every other industry in this country is subject to an 'intrusive noise' definition of background noise plus five decibels. This industry is not. When we talk about noise in an urban setting—say, for instance, Redfern in Sydney—the background noise is different from the background noise in a place like Waubra.


People living in the country are used to a different level of background noise from people living in Redfern in Sydney, Brunswick in Melbourne or in the heart of Brisbane. You cannot compare them.


I think the problem is that, like the Waubra wind farm, many wind farms are operating without having been given a certificate of compliance by the state authority, yet they have been accredited by the Clean Energy Regulator and are in receipt of hundreds of millions of dollars in renewable energy certificates. The checks and balances appear to have been pushed aside in the rush to get the turbines up and running and to start the lucrative flow of RETs.


My argument is that this bill is to address people. We are elected by people to represent people. We are not elected to represent corporations and we are not elected to represent an ideology. We, collectively in this place, have a duty of care to people. Today we have heard the economic arguments, but the fact is that we are talking about people. Time and time again this debate has fallen into an economic argument. This debate, this bill, is about people, about their health and wellbeing and about their right to live on their properties and enjoy them the way they have for generations. These people are not political activists, and a great majority of these people are coalition voters. These people, who are also ALP voters and Greens voters, are affected by these things.


I implore all of you to think seriously about this matter and to give this industry the scrutiny that you foist onto other industries—and rightly so—to make them accountable. If this industry can prove that it is compliant, that it is not doing what people claim is affecting their health and that of their families and their communities, I will be the first one to stand up in this parliament and admit that I got it wrong. To date, I do not believe I have got it wrong. Let me assure you that I will stand up here and I will say, 'I got it wrong.' How many people ever stand up in this place and say that they got it wrong? We just carry on regardless. We never say, 'We got it wrong.' But there is a whole group of people whose health is affected. Let us get to the bottom of it, let us stop ignoring it and let us create a real level playing field.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

 (South Australia) (11:33):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Thank you, Mr President, and I thank the Senate. I simply seek to make clear the coalition's position in relation to the bill that was just voted down, given that it was last year that my second-reading contribution was recorded. The coalition is extremely disappointed that the Labor Party and the Australian Greens just joined forces to stymie debate on this legislation of Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon. We had sincerely hoped to be able to proceed to the committee stage and had circulated, as all senators are aware, extensive amendments to Senator Madigan and Senator Xenophon's legislation. The coalition supported the second reading vote because the coalition hoped to be able to proceed with debating those amendments. Regrettably, that is not going to occur. I indicate to the Senate that the coalition's position at the third reading would have been conditional upon the passage of our amendments, which we are very disappointed not to have had the opportunity to debate.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator CASH:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The 
incorporated 
speech read as follows—



The purpose of this bill is to restore two classes of Temporary Protection Visas (subclasses 785 and 447) that were available under the former Coalition Government for those who arrive illegally in Australia or at an excised offshore place and are found to engage Australia's protection obligations under the Refugee Convention.


This bill is entirely consistent with the Coalition's long held position of providing temporary protection visas for those who arrive illegally by boat as part of a comprehensive suite of measures to stop the boats.


The Temporary Protection (Offshore Entry) Visa (subclass 785) is a visa for people who:


Have illegally entered Australia and/or arrived at an ""excised offshore place' (such as Christmas Island, Ashmore, Cocos Islands) when they first came to Australia;


Do not have protection from any other country


Are found to engage Australia's protection obligations by the Australian Government; and


Meet health and character requirements


The visa is temporary for a term of up to three years, to be set by the Minister or his/her delegate. The visa gives the holder the right to work, to Special Benefits payments and access to Medicare.


Successive temporary visas can be applied for upon conclusion of the term of the visa unless the Minister allows an application for a permanent protection visa to be made.


It does not give the right to family reunion or to return to Australia if he/she leaves


It does not give the holder the right to re-enter Australia if they depart


It is a condition of the visa that the holder satisfy mutual obligation requirements for receiving special benefit payments


The Temporary Protection (Secondary Movement Offshore Entry) Visa (subclass 447) is a visa for people who:


Have illegally entered Australia and/or arrived at an ""excised offshore place"" (such as Christmas Island, Ashmore, Cocos Islands) when they first came to Australia


Are secondary movement persons


Do not have protection from any other country


Are found to have engaged Australia's protection obligations by the Australian Government; and


Meet health and character requirements


The visa is temporary for a term of up to three years, to be set by the Minister or his/her delegate. The bill defines a secondary movement person as someone who is a non-citizen seeking protection having moved beyond their country of first asylum and who transited in a country other than Australia where the person could have sought protection;


Of the country, due to but not limited to, that country being a signatory to the United Nations Convention and/or Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees; or


Through the officers of the United Nations Commissioner for Refugees located in that country;


A secondary movement person cannot be granted a permanent Protection Visa. Such a person may only apply for a further temporary protection visa, or if eligible, one of the mainstream visas for which temporary protection visa holders are eligible.


The visa gives the holder the right to work, to Special Benefits payments and access to Medicare.


It does not give the right to family reunion


It does not give the holder the right to re-enter Australia if they depart


It is a condition of the visa that the holder satisfies mutual obligation requirements for receiving special benefit payments.


Temporary protection visas deny access to permanent residence and family reunion. Once a visa has expired, an applicant's refugee status would be reassessed and they would either return home if it was safe to do so or be reissued with another temporary visa. Temporary protection visas fulfill Australia's responsibilities under the Refugee Convention by providing safe haven for those who are found to have a legitimate claim to refugee status but have entered Australia illegally without a valid visa. There is no obligation under international law to provide permanent residence.


This bill effectively reverses the decision of the Rudd/Gillard Government in 2008 to abolish Temporary Protection Visas that started the chaos, cost and tragedy on our borders and has led to more than 33,300 arrivals of people by boat, more than 1,000 deaths at sea, more than 8,100 permanent protection visas being denied to people who applied for a humanitarian offshore visa because they did not come on a boat and a budget blowout for taxpayers of $6.6 billion.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:45):  The coalition supports this bill. The bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It strengthens the offshore petroleum regulatory regime with respect to compliance, safety, integrity and environmental management objectives. The amendments are largely in response to the report of the Montara commission of inquiry. They clarify and strengthen the compliance monitoring, investigation and enforcement powers of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Environmental Management Authority—NOPSEMA—and ensure that enforcement measures for contraventions of the act are appropriate in application and severity in the context of a high-hazard industry. The coalition believes that it is important that the oil and gas industry in Australia operates not only within its permits and licences, but also within its social licence. The bill ensures that Australia not only has a regulatory regime which provides the safety and integrity and environmental management that we need, but also that we have regulations in place to ensure that the public have confidence in the industry. What we saw with the Montara incident was extraordinary, and, while the industry had operated for almost 30 years without incident in Australia, public concern has increased.


The Montara commission of inquiry recommended a series of amendments to the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. The government consequently undertook a review of the legislation and this bill amends the act to implement a number of the findings of the review. The amendments will see the introduction of a civil penalty regime and an increase in the current criminal penalty levels under the act. This change will bring about some consistency with compliance offences in other major hazard industry legislation. The amendments also ensure that penalties, including custodial penalties, for occupational health and safety offences under the act will be harmonised with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Redrafting the NOPSEMA inspectorate powers will provide greater clarity and consistency between the various powers of each category of inspector and remove unnecessary procedural requirements that are likely to impede NOPSEMA's ability to effectively perform its enforcement function.


The bill also implements a decision to remove the responsible state minister for Tasmania—which I understand is that state's preference—from the joint authority arrangements in the offshore regulatory regime. The bill does not complete the process, and I understand that the minister has already signalled his intention to introduce further amendments later this year. The coalition will support these amendments as we believe they are sensible and necessary to improve a regulatory regime that was seen to be plainly inadequate in its present form. It is our strong view that we must ensure that the industry is able to operate not only effectively and efficiently, but also with the highest degree of safety and integrity, and at the same time ensure that environmental protections are in place. This is an industry which provides a great deal of wealth and employment to Australia, and we must, as I said before, ensure the public has confidence in it. Because these measures are designed in a sensible and measured way to engender that confidence, they have the opposition's support.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:48):  The Greens too will be supporting this bill, but I want to take a few minutes to outline the Greens' ongoing involvement in this and concerns about it, but also remind the chamber about the genesis of these particular series of amendments. As Senator Brandis pointed out, the Montara incident was a key genesis for this series of reforms that have been carried out to offshore petroleum regulation in this country. As the explanatory memorandum points out the Montara incident was part of it, but so was the Deepwater Horizon episode in Gulf of Mexico, which is to this day having ongoing adverse impacts on the environment and those that make their livelihoods in association with that marine environment.


There have been a series of amendments made following the release of the commission's report, but I point out the reason we need such strong environmental regulations and such strong regulation of the oil and gas industry. As the commission of inquiry pointed out in its report, it is unlikely that the actual environmental impact of the oil spill will ever be known as there was little pre- or post-oil spill evidence available to the commission of inquiry about its environmental impacts. The inquiry stated that the observed wildlife toll was only a proportion of the total fatalities because dead animals may not have stayed afloat long enough to be detected in large numbers. We do not know the total impact because there was very little monitoring done. There was certainly no adequate baseline data that was required for the development of the Montara platform, and monitoring did not start for several months down the track from the oil spill. Not only did we miss that potential initial impact but we also do not know what was there in the first place nor, as the report pointed out, did we have any idea how many animals were affected because they did not stay afloat to be counted.


One of the other long-term impacts that we are still concerned about is the impact of the Montara oil spill on the Timor Sea and on the livelihoods of Indonesian fishers. To this day, those fishers are still trying to keep this issue on the agenda and to get a study done of the potential impacts on the marine environment, on coastal environments and on their livelihoods. There has still been no compensation to those fishers, despite the fact that we clearly established that the oil went into Indonesian waters, that it impacted on the fishers and that they had to stop fishing. Those fishers in those communities still have not been compensated. We have written to both the federal government and the company to ask them to speed up this process, because it is those people who have suffered significantly.


In the rolling out of legislation, the government has taken a systematic approach to implementing the recommendations of the Montara inquiry, of which there were over 100. They took on board nearly all of them. There were two that they did not accept and 10 that they took note of, and they are progressively implementing the remainder. The government has undertaken a Commonwealth review of the legislation applicable to offshore petroleum. That, I understand, was completed at some stage last year. It was due in June last year. That overall review has not been released, so the government is implementing the findings of that review, and we support those—as I said, we support this bill and we support the establishment of NOPSEMA and other regulatory changes. It would be good to be able to see that. I have done a search and I have not been able to find it. However, I note that submissions close today on the issues paper that was released late last year on the environmental regulation and canvassing potential amendments, and the government has indicated that it will be bringing those on sometime this year. We will look at those and seek to ensure that they are implemented as soon as possible. It is very important that we get these regulations right because we have seen the catastrophic implications if we do not.


There are a couple of things that I suspect the government will not do and that still need to be reviewed—that is, the way that we release acreage in this country for oil and gas exploration. There is not enough consultation prior to the release of that acreage and we find that we have to mount rearguard actions to get these areas protected. Not long after the Montara incident, we saw the important Mentelle Basin, off the coast of Margaret River, released for exploration. That particular area is deepwater exploration and there is a very strong potential for an environmental impact there, because that is a very important area for species like blue whales and it is another area with very high marine biodiversity. That is not taken into consideration when we release these areas for offshore exploration. Of course, you do not explore if you if you have no intention of eventually producing from there if you find something.


Some of these areas are just too important. The Bremer canyons, off the south coast of Western Australia, near Fitzgerald River National Park, is an area of important marine biodiversity, as are areas off the Scott Reef. The government has now said some of those areas will not be released, but it should not be left up to the community to fight every time one of these areas is released. There should be a much more considered approach to the release of some of these areas. We also believe that, if no-one has applied for these areas, and mistakes have been made in releasing them, there needs to be a much faster process to ensure that they are considered for inclusion on the list of marine reserves around this country.


We are still planning the protection of our marine environment around oil and gas potential productivity, in particular, and we do not believe that is the appropriate way to plan. I have raised this issue in this chamber before. We need to be looking at an area's ecological value and not compromising marine protection because—as is the case along the north-west coast of Western Australia—it might be prospective. They have very important environmental values, and those values should be considered. The primary purpose of marine conservation is, of course, to protect those areas of high conservation value.


We will be supporting these amendments. We will be continuing to watch the implementation of those final recommendations, and I urge the government to look again at the issue of the Indonesian fishers who have been adversely affected by the Montara spill. It has been far too long a process. It will be going on four years this year since that spill occurred, and those fishers need to be fairly compensated.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (13:59):  My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the Prime Minister's plans to visit Western Sydney and her visit to the Rooty Hill RSL on 12 August 2010 in the closing days of the last election campaign. On that election visit, the Prime Minister told the people of Western Sydney and, indeed, Australia that she would bring the budget back into surplus in 2013 and that Australia's net debt would not exceed six per cent of the GDP. It is now around 10 per cent. Given that the Prime Minister has broken both these fundamental election promises about the budget—solemn promises, which in fact underpin her ability to deliver everything else—why should the people of Western Sydney believe anything she tells them when she condescendingly drops in to Western Sydney to see them again in March 2013?

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:03):  Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Given Western Sydney is one of the fastest growing parts of Australia—as expressed to me by the Liberal candidate for Chifley, Isabelle White—does the minister agree that what the people of Western Sydney really want from this government is a plan, not just a visit when the polls turn sour? If the government is fair dinkum about helping the people of Western Sydney, why won't it abolish the carbon tax, which both increases the cost of living and destroys jobs, stop the boats and commit to build the WestConnex?

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (14:01):  I thank the senator for his question. The Prime Minister's visit to Western Sydney next week coincides with a recent confirmation of Australia's AAA credit rating. When those opposite and Senator Abetz talk about 'delivering everything else', this Prime Minister has been delivering everything else. We are delivering a AAA credit rating.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! When there is silence on both sides, we will proceed. The time to debate the issue is after question time, as the honourable senators know.




Senator CONROY:
  No Liberal government has ever achieved this coveted trifecta from all three global ratings agencies; it is the first time in our nation's history. When Senator Abetz talks about 'delivering everything else', what he wants to ignore is all of the promises and achievements of this government that have been delivered. Our economy has grown by 11 per cent since Labor came to office. We have September-quarter growth at 3.1 per cent, compared to the 10-year average of three per cent. Those opposite describe this as having 'no pulse' and 'flat lining', yet three per cent is higher than the 10-year average. There is low unemployment at 5.4 per cent, which is well below the OECD average of eight per cent.


This government takes an exceptional job creation record to the people of Western Sydney: around 847,000 jobs have been created since Labor came to office. We have inflation at 2.2 per cent— (Time expired)

He wants to scrap and cut the schoolkids bonus. He wants to slash funding to schools and rip up the NBN. People in Western Sydney are already feeling the pressure from the savage cuts inflicted by the O'Farrell Liberal government on schools and hospitals.


There will be more to come if Mr Abbott becomes the Prime Minister of this country, because cutting services is what Liberals do—it is in their DNA. They will cut health, they will cut education, they will take away nurses, they will take away hospital beds and they will take away teachers. That is what those opposite are committed to.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (15:38):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senator Payne today relating to western Sydney and the Prime Minister.


Even before the PM's campaign—which she states is not really a campaign because she is governing—has gotten off the ground, one of her most senior ministers has completely pulled the carpet out from under her. Today's papers show the effect of what Minister Butler said. One only has to look at headline from today's Daily Telegraph, 'The Rooty Hill show, five nights only' to see how the good people of Western Sydney have been made fun of. For them to be mocked in this way is absolutely outrageous. Let us look at the other headlines from today: 'PM's Rooty Hill plan raises a laugh', 'Carry on in Rooty Hill', 'Carrying on governing goes west', 'PM plans to carry on lodging in Rooty Hill' and 'Nightmare for PM'. In fact, as the Herald Sun correctly points out, Ms Gillard is likely to have more luck playing the pokies at the Rooty Hill RSL than she is with pressing the flesh in terms of her broken promises.


I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when the Prime Minister rang Minister Butler yesterday. One could only imagine the conversation. But, of course, her comments would have had to have been tempered because Minister Butler holds some very important votes, which is keeping her there, in place. Perhaps there are announcements being planned in Western Sydney—perhaps involving Minister Butler. It is interesting to note in the Australian Ageing Agenda a couple of days ago the talk about the government making a big announcement on the workforce compact; it is to be a very, very soon. If they are planning on doing it in Western Sydney with Minister Butler, Minister Shorten and the Prime Minister, perhaps they will think twice about the optics of all of that. I do not think that Minister Butler is quite welcome in Western Sydney after his latest escapade.


Even Minister Butler's own colleague Ed Husic, the member for Chifley, publicly repudiated Minister Butler when he said:


I was shocked and outraged, I can't have snooty-nosed free settler types making funny comments about Rooty Hill.


The local member! And then, as the mayor of Liverpool advised the Prime Minister—and it is there in the Australian Financial Review today—'Commute if you mean it.' If the Prime Minister really wants to go out to Western Sydney, perhaps she might like to commute there because she would see what the people of Sydney face daily with the traffic congestion in that city. Perhaps if she went along Parramatta Road she would see all the empty shops that are there because of her carbon tax, because of high electricity prices and because of a whole lot of other things. In the end, the Prime Minister would really know this.


Of course, this is a dysfunctional government—a very dysfunctional government. The last time she went out to the Rooty Hill RSL she made a whole series of promises. She told us about the budget surplus. She told us about cutting company tax. She told us about a whole range of other things. I would really like to see whether she will go back to the Rooty Hill RSL and tell the people of Western Sydney that she lied to them then. How could anybody that she meets out in Western Sydney next week ever believe a word that this woman ever says again.


If she does go out and talk about what her government has done—and so we are hearing the ministers now saying, 'Oh, yes, but she is going to have dialogue with the people of Western Sydney'—she might tell them why Chris Bowen, as the relevant minister, could not stop the boats—a very important point out in Western Sydney, or why Jason Clare could not stop the guns, or why David Bradbury wants to increase super tax. That is the record of the ALP in Western Sydney. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just before I call Senator Thistlethwaite, I remind senators to use the correct titles in addressing members of the other house.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (15:43):  The opposition is making much of the comments of the member for Port Adelaide, Mark Butler. There is no doubt that it is not acceptable for any member of parliament to make fun of any person's community or of where they live. I think the minister for Port Adelaide made a mistake and, given his time again, he probably would not make the same comments. But we all make mistakes in life.


The Prime Minister is going to Western Sydney to talk directly to families, to businesses and to communities about what this Labor government is doing in that area and what its plans for the future are.


It is an important region of this country. It is the fourth-largest economic zone in Australia. One in two residents of Sydney live in Greater Western Sydney. By Greater Western Sydney, I mean the WSROC, Campbelltown, Camden, Wollondilly and Hills districts.


This government understands how important Western Sydney is for the economic and social development of this country. That is reflected in this government's commitment to economic development in Western Sydney. It is reflected in the investment that this government has devoted to infrastructure in Western Sydney, which stands in stark contrast to the investment in infrastructure in that area that was made by the Howard government. Over the 12 years of the Howard government, $350 million was invested in infrastructure in Western Sydney—$350 million in the M7 road. That was the total amount that was invested by the Howard government in infrastructure in Western Sydney. In the five years of this Labor government, we have invested 10 times that amount, $3.2 billion, in Western Sydney. That is our commitment to economic growth in that important region.


The figures stack up: $800 million invested in the development of the Moorebank Intermodal, a very important freight investment that will take traffic and big trucks off Sydney roads; $980 million for the construction of the Southern Sydney Freight Line, which has been completed; $93 million to widen the F5 at Campbelltown, which has also been completed; $300 million to upgrade the Great Western Highway, which is underway; and $8.5 million to begin planning for the installation of an electronic freeway management system along the full length of the M4 motorway. That is what has been invested by this government in Western Sydney.


This government, the federal Labor Party, has delivered an initial instalment of $45 million to advance the WestConnex project. We have put aside $150 million in the budget for the progress of the M2 to F3 project. We have dedicated $2.1 billion—and the money is still sitting there on the table—to the Parramatta to Epping rail link, which will be a big connector for Parramatta and will cement its position as the second CBD of Sydney.


That is our commitment to infrastructure investment in Western Sydney, but we are also committed to delivering better services for this area. That is reflected, importantly, in health and education: at Nepean Hospital, $96 million for a new block; at Blacktown Hospital, $31.7 million for 10 rehabilitation beds and 20 beds in a specialist neuropsychiatry subacute unit; $17.6 million to construct the Blacktown Hospital clinical school; $11.5 million to Blacktown Hospital for additional emergency department beds; $15 million to establish a GP superclinic in Liverpool; $1.7 million to south-western Sydney for New Directions mother and baby services and a Strong Fathers Strong Families Program in Liverpool.


In education we have made a lot of investments. One of the areas that I look after is the Macarthur region. We have invested $125 million in new schools in that region through Building the Education Revolution. That money has gone to fund 35 new classrooms, seven libraries, 23 multipurpose halls and five science and language centres—educational services for Western Sydney. That is thinking about the future. We have also built four new trade training centres in the Macarthur area alone. That is our commitment to Western Sydney. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2013-02-28,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:48):  It is a sad day when the Labor Party get excited because their leader, the Prime Minister, announces she is going to spend a couple of days in Western Sydney. You would think they might get excited if the Prime Minister went out and made some really good policy announcements of things that were going to take Australia forward, but no, the Labor Party get excited because the Prime Minister is going to stay in Western Sydney. It is absolutely extraordinary.


It was raised earlier today, during question time, that perhaps the Prime Minister should commute from the city, from Kirribilli House, out to Rooty Hill. My good colleague Senator Fierravanti-Wells followed up and said exactly the same thing, that the Prime Minister should commute from Kirribilli out to Rooty Hill. But apparently it is a little bit too far to go through the traffic for the Prime Minister and she has got to stay out there. It is extraordinary. I drive further than that for bread and milk.


The focus on the Prime Minister's trip to Rooty Hill is nothing short of breathtaking. She is only doing her job. It is what she should be doing. She should be going to Western Sydney. She should be going to talk to people out there. I suspect that they will tell the Prime Minister exactly what they think about what her government is doing. I also suspect that not all of it is going to be positive. That may well turn out to be the biggest understatement we have heard in this place for quite some time, but we shall have to wait and see. People across this country are so fed up with the Labor government and their complete inability to run the country properly, and I suspect the good people of Rooty Hill and Western Sydney are thinking exactly the same thing.


My advice for the Prime Minister is: once she has been to Western Sydney, once she has been to Rooty Hill, keep going. Go over the Great Dividing Range, go over the sandstone curtain, and go to regional Australia. I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, I would be jumping through hoops if there were as much fuss and as much focus from the Prime Minister about going to regional Australia as there is about her going to Rooty Hill. This is a Prime Minister who continues to completely ignore regional Australia.


If the Prime Minister went over the sandstone curtain, she would get to Bathurst and she could talk to some students who would tell her that this Labor government is doing absolutely nothing to give regional students equity of access to education, that she is doing absolutely nothing to change the current unfair rules for independent youth allowance, which mean that our young people who are accessing independent youth allowance, as pretty much the only means of financial assistance when they have absolutely no choice but to leave home, come up against a parental income test cap.


So guess what? If their parents are police officers or schoolteachers, because of what they earn that student is precluded from getting independent youth allowance, and that is absolutely wrong. I suspect the Prime Minister would be told that loud and clear if she went beyond Rooty Hill and further west, further than those 40-odd kilometres west, out into regional Australia. She would get to Orange, where she could talk to medical students, and to CSU about their excellent proposal for a medical school—because it is about time this Labor government started listening to the fact that health in regional Australia needs to be addressed. But this government and this Prime Minister simply are not doing that.


The Prime Minister could then kick up a little bit, still going west, and go to Forbes and talk to dairy farmers. She could explain to them why she said that dairy farmers would not only survive but thrive under the carbon tax. I tell you, Mr Deputy President, there is nothing that will convince those dairy farmers that this Prime Minister has any understanding at all of the dairy industry, because to say that is completely stupid. The imposts going on the dairy industry are enormous.


The Prime Minister could keep going west, to WA. She could tell the beef producers over there that the live export ban that decimated their lives, that was put in by the Prime Minister, was what she called a 'short-term disruption' in her address to the Press Club. The Prime Minister shattered these people's lives with an export ban that was absolutely not necessary, and she calls it a 'short-term disruption'!


If the Prime Minister keeps going west through regional Australia, she will eventually end up in Perth, where the government has stolen $480 million from the regional development fund to put a road around Perth airport. I do not know about you, Mr Deputy President, but that looks pretty much like a city road to me! It is about time the Prime Minister got out into the regions: go to Rooty Hill and keep going west.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (15:54):  I too rise to take note of answers to questions asked of Senator Conroy today and, in particular, those relating to Western Sydney, because I actually agree with Senator Nash: I cannot believe the fuss and palaver that has gone on over the fact that the Prime Minister is visiting Western Sydney with her cabinet colleagues. They are visiting a very large community, over one million people, who deserve the opportunity to meet with their representatives and who deserve the opportunity to raise with ministers and their local members, the concerns that they have. When you think about the extraordinary challenges the communities of Western Sydney will confront over the next few years, you can understand why those conversations are going to be so important.


A recent report actually forecast that half of Sydney's population will be living in Greater Western Sydney by 2036. An example of the impact that that population expansion in the west will have is that it will require about 87,000 new homes to be built in that time. So there are key challenges, but, if 87,000 homes are being constructed in Western Sydney, there are many, many opportunities as well—opportunities for employment; opportunities for planning infrastructure so that social infrastructure in particular does not get left behind and opportunities for drawing on the very diverse multicultural workforce and industry base that will be out in Western Sydney. These are the opportunities, the challenges and the issues that the Prime Minister and the cabinet are going to be dealing with in the next few years.


Senator Nash also said that the Prime Minister will not necessarily like what she hears. I have to say that is probably true. She probably will not be very pleased to hear about the 15,000 jobs being cut from the New South Wales Public Service and the fact that some of those jobs are in significant areas. In policing, for example, the regional commands in rural New South Wales are being quarantined, which means that the real impacts are going to be on policing in Western Sydney. So the conversations that are going on in Western Sydney about gun control, street violence or domestic violence are going to be severely affected by the New South Wales government cuts.


The Prime Minister is probably not going to be very impressed by the fact that New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell originally committed to building the North West Rail Link to connect the North Shore with the Hills district in Sydney's north-west, then asked the government to redirect the funds earmarked for the Parramatta to Epping railway line to the North West Rail Link, and then came back and changed his mind and requested that those funds be redirected to finishing the upgrade of the Pacific Highway—which is hardly going to benefit the people of Western Sydney, I imagine. I would say that we can all expect that the Parramatta to Epping rail line project, to which we have committed $2.1 billion—and we still hold that commitment—and which would free up commuter traffic in Western Sydney, is forever dead under the O'Farrell government. These are the kinds of things that she is going to hear.


The Prime Minister is probably not going to be very happy to hear how people in Western Sydney are so concerned about the dog-whistling policies that we have heard over the last few days about the way in which we treat people seeking refugee and humanitarian status. She is probably not going to be too happy to hear the Leader of the Opposition's ideas about TPVs and freezing bridging visas, or racial profiling, because in Western Sydney we have a very diverse multicultural community that is fantastic. It is an economic and cultural powerhouse of New South Wales and it is the fastest growing regional economy in Australia. So when 43 per cent of the population of Sydney is living in Western Sydney, the Prime Minister deserves to be there.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:59):  I would like to add some comments about the answers to questions by Senator Conroy, representing the Prime Minister. It amazes me how, when Prime Minister Gillard announced the election will be on 14 September that she said this will not be a long election campaign, that it will be about governing the country, carrying on with the role of government. If you were to say to anyone that this week in Western Sydney is not campaigning, I think people would laugh at you. I certainly would not say it. I put on Facebook last night, 'This is not a week of campaigning in Western Sydney—yeah, right!' Comments of varying degrees came back saying that this is a political campaign, that this is what next week is about. There is nothing surer. I found it amazing when Senator Conroy said, 'It pays to stay in Western Sydney.' I can just imagine the Prime Minister out in Western Sydney. She could have Senator Cameron as a chauffeur driving her around. I do not know how they would get on together given Senator Cameron's staunch support for former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. This is simply a political stunt and the people of Western Sydney will not be fooled. And today we heard:


The federal government also announced an investigation into raising NSW's Warragamba Dam. The cost of raising the wall is estimated to be $500 million, and federal funding would be contingent on state government backing for the project.


I have no problem with raising the dam wall. I think that is a good idea because we are using six per cent of our water resource in this country, compared to a world average of nine per cent. It was amazing when the coalition discussion paper on building dams went out a couple of weeks ago, when Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, Dr Craig Emerson, said that this is 'policy in chaos'. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, said that the coalition's draft dam policy is 'incoherent' and 'completely wild'. They are very much against building dams. Minister Bill Shorten added, 'It is cheaper for governments and taxpayers to spend money on mitigation for floods as opposed to clean-up costs subsequently.' So we have Minister Shorten supporting increasing the height of Warragamba dam, while ministers Tony Burke, Dr Craig Emerson and Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young say—and what a crazy quote this is—'The only part of the coalition dam plan that was environmental was the word ""mental"".'


How are we supposed to survive in this county without water? I have travelled much of this big land and thankfully have lived all of my life in rural Australia. Without water, we have nothing. But we now have the irony of all this with the government saying, 'We're going to increase Warragamba dam wall, increase the storage.' I think that is a great thing because we saw a waste of money in desalination plants around the nation, most of them mothballed, as Andrew Bolt said in his column today, when scaremongering Tim Flannery said, 'The dams will never fill.' Go out of Inverell, where I live, to Copeton Dam. It was great to see it overflowing less than two years ago. We know what happened in Brisbane with the floods. Warragamba is releasing water now because of the very heavy and constant rain we have seen for the last couple of years. That is what happens at the end of a drought—it rains. Rain is what breaks a drought, nothing else. But Tim Flannery is scaremongering and saying that the dams will never fill again. I support the increase in the storage capacity of Warragamba Dam because Sydney is a fast-growing area. Those running businesses out in Western Sydney will not be fooled. They know that the cost of doing business has escalated enormously—whether it be carbon tax, the renewable energy target or whatever. They are becoming uncompetitive with the high Australian dollar. They are facing cheap imports. The people who work in those businesses know that, if they cannot make a profit for the business, their jobs are threatened. This visit to Western Sydney by the Prime Minister is simply a political stunt and I do not believe for one second that the people in Western Sydney will be bluffed or fooled. They know what this government has been like. They know what this government has done. Along with many others, including me, they are looking forward to 14 September 2013, election day.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (16:04):  I present the government’s response to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on its inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Removal of Mandatory Minimum Penalties) Bill 2012, and seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The document read as follows—



Government Response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee Report:




Migration Amendment (Removal of Mandatory Minimum Penalties) Bill 2012



November 2012


INTRODUCTION


On 9 February 2012, the Senate referred the Migration Amendment (Removal of Mandatory Minimum Penalties) Bill 2012 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 22 March 2012. On 28 February 2012, the Senate agreed to extend the reporting date to 4 April 2012.


BACKGROUND


The bill seeks to amend the Migration Act 1958 to remove the mandatory sentences relating to aggravated people smuggling offences.


Under Australian federal criminal law, mandatory minimum penalties apply to a very limited number of serious, aggravated people smuggling offences in the Migration Act1958. These penalties were first enacted in 2001, to deter repeat offenders and ensure courts consistently apply penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the crime.


The Migration Act contains four aggravated people smuggling offences which carry mandatory minimum penalties:


Section 234A: Aggravated offences of providing false documents and false or misleading information etc relating to at least five non-citizens.


Section 233B: An aggravated people smuggling offence involving exploitation or danger of death or serious harm.


Section 233C: An aggravated offence involving smuggling five or more persons.


Sections 234A and 233C carry mandatory minimum penalties of five years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years. Offences under section 233B—and repeat offences under any of the provisions—carry a mandatory minimum penalty of eight years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years.


Minors are only prosecuted with people smuggling offences in exceptional circumstances on the basis of their significant involvement in a people smuggling venture, their involvement in multiple ventures or where a serious incident occurs on a venture. However, where the court determines on the balance of probabilities that the accused was a minor when the offence was committed, the mandatory minimum penalties under the Migration Act do not apply (section 236B(2)).



Until recently, the most commonly prosecuted people smuggling offence was the aggravated offence of people smuggling involving five or more persons (section 233C), which attracts a mandatory minimum penalty. However, on 27 August 2012, the Attorney-General gave a direction to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) not to prosecute first time offender, lower culpability crew under section 233C, but to consider prosecution with a lesser offence that does not attract a mandatory minimum penalty. This is consistent with the recommendation of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers that changes to Australian law in relation to Indonesian crew be pursued with options including discretion being restored to Australian courts in relation to sentencing.




Recommendation 1





2.68 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the operation of the mandatory minimum penalties applied to 
aggravated people smuggling offences under section 236B of the 
Migration Act 1958
, with particular reference to:




Alternative approaches to mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, including where judicial officers are given discretion to impose lesser sentences where they are satisfied that the circumstances would make it unjust to impose the prescribed sentence for an offence;




Options for differentiating between the organisers of people smuggling operations and boat crew of these operations in sentencing; and




Specific concerns raised during this inquiry regarding Australia
'
s human rights obligations under international law.





The Government supports this recommendation and has taken steps to implement it.





On 27 August 2012, the Attorney-General gave a direction to the CDPP not to prosecute first time offender, lower culpability crew under section 233C of the Migration Act,


which involves mandatory minimum penalties and to consider prosecution under a lesser offence that does not attract a mandatory minimum penalty.





The direction applies from 27 August 2012, to prosecutions then on foot and to new prosecutions.





The direction does not apply to organisers of people smuggling ventures; to crew who repeatedly come to Australia on such ventures; or to crew involved in ventures where a death occurs.





The CDPP has now re-assessed the 101 people smuggling crew matters that were before the courts, excluding appeals to which the direction does not apply, on 27 August 2012. Of these, the CDPP discontinued 34 matters and 2 matters resulted in directed acquittals. A further 60 matters were recommenced under a lesser people smuggling charge that does not attract a mandatory minimum penalty (s233A or s233(1)(a)), while 5 cases continued under s233C.





The Australian Government is also considering further the effectiveness of the current structure of offences in the Migration Act in light of the 
recommendations made by the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers in its report released on 13 August 2012.





Recommendation 2





2.69 The committee recommends that the Australian Government facilitate and support further deterrence and awareness raising activities in relation to people smuggling offences, with a focus on relevant communities in Indonesia.



The Government supports this recommendation and has taken steps to implement it.

Government Response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee Report:




Migration Amendment (Removal of Mandatory Minimum Penalties) Bill 2012



November 2012


INTRODUCTION


On 9 February 2012, the Senate referred the Migration Amendment (Removal of Mandatory Minimum Penalties) Bill 2012 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 22 March 2012. On 28 February 2012, the Senate agreed to extend the reporting date to 4 April 2012.


BACKGROUND


The bill seeks to amend the Migration Act 1958 to remove the mandatory sentences relating to aggravated people smuggling offences.


Under Australian federal criminal law, mandatory minimum penalties apply to a very limited number of serious, aggravated people smuggling offences in the Migration Act1958. These penalties were first enacted in 2001, to deter repeat offenders and ensure courts consistently apply penalties commensurate with the seriousness of the crime.


The Migration Act contains four aggravated people smuggling offences which carry mandatory minimum penalties:


Section 234A: Aggravated offences of providing false documents and false or misleading information etc relating to at least five non-citizens.


Section 233B: An aggravated people smuggling offence involving exploitation or danger of death or serious harm.


Section 233C: An aggravated offence involving smuggling five or more persons.


Sections 234A and 233C carry mandatory minimum penalties of five years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of three years. Offences under section 233B—and repeat offences under any of the provisions—carry a mandatory minimum penalty of eight years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years.


Minors are only prosecuted with people smuggling offences in exceptional circumstances on the basis of their significant involvement in a people smuggling venture, their involvement in multiple ventures or where a serious incident occurs on a venture. However, where the court determines on the balance of probabilities that the accused was a minor when the offence was committed, the mandatory minimum penalties under the Migration Act do not apply (section 236B(2)).



Until recently, the most commonly prosecuted people smuggling offence was the aggravated offence of people smuggling involving five or more persons (section 233C), which attracts a mandatory minimum penalty. However, on 27 August 2012, the Attorney-General gave a direction to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) not to prosecute first time offender, lower culpability crew under section 233C, but to consider prosecution with a lesser offence that does not attract a mandatory minimum penalty. This is consistent with the recommendation of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers that changes to Australian law in relation to Indonesian crew be pursued with options including discretion being restored to Australian courts in relation to sentencing.




Recommendation 1





2.68 The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the operation of the mandatory minimum penalties applied to 
aggravated people smuggling offences under section 236B of the 
Migration Act 1958
, with particular reference to:




Alternative approaches to mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, including where judicial officers are given discretion to impose lesser sentences where they are satisfied that the circumstances would make it unjust to impose the prescribed sentence for an offence;




Options for differentiating between the organisers of people smuggling operations and boat crew of these operations in sentencing; and




Specific concerns raised during this inquiry regarding Australia
'
s human rights obligations under international law.





The Government supports this recommendation and has taken steps to implement it.





On 27 August 2012, the Attorney-General gave a direction to the CDPP not to prosecute first time offender, lower culpability crew under section 233C of the Migration Act,


which involves mandatory minimum penalties and to consider prosecution under a lesser offence that does not attract a mandatory minimum penalty.





The direction applies from 27 August 2012, to prosecutions then on foot and to new prosecutions.





The direction does not apply to organisers of people smuggling ventures; to crew who repeatedly come to Australia on such ventures; or to crew involved in ventures where a death occurs.





The CDPP has now re-assessed the 101 people smuggling crew matters that were before the courts, excluding appeals to which the direction does not apply, on 27 August 2012. Of these, the CDPP discontinued 34 matters and 2 matters resulted in directed acquittals. A further 60 matters were recommenced under a lesser people smuggling charge that does not attract a mandatory minimum penalty (s233A or s233(1)(a)), while 5 cases continued under s233C.





The Australian Government is also considering further the effectiveness of the current structure of offences in the Migration Act in light of the 
recommendations made by the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers in its report released on 13 August 2012.





Recommendation 2





2.69 The committee recommends that the Australian Government facilitate and support further deterrence and awareness raising activities in relation to people smuggling offences, with a focus on relevant communities in Indonesia.



The Government supports this recommendation and has taken steps to implement it.


In addition to strong law enforcement cooperation with regional partners, the Government is delivering public information campaigns throughout the region to ensure potential irregular immigrants are aware of the perils of a boat journey to Australia. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for the offshore communications effort.


Campaigns are underway in key source and transit countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Indonesia. These campaigns seek to raise awareness of the dangers and costs of seeking to migrate irregularly, as well as promote regular pathways to resettlement.


Australia and Indonesia are committed to working together to raise awareness in vulnerable communities of the dangers of people smuggling and to deter people from becoming involved in people smuggling ventures.


On 2 July 2012, the Prime Minister and the Indonesian President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono agreed that Australia and Indonesia will conduct a joint public information campaign in Indonesia to prevent potential crew from being used by international people smuggling networks by helping them to understand the consequences, both in Australian and Indonesian law.


This campaign has commenced with two information sessions held in Bali and Kupang from 17-19 September 2012 for local Indonesian stakeholders and representatives.


This agreement follows an Australian Government public information campaign delivered by the International Organization for Migration in Indonesia in 2009‑2010 to raise awareness among Indonesian communities of the dangers of people smuggling and the consequences of involvement in this activity. This campaign specifically targeted potential crew members, fishermen, boat owners, boat builders, and coastal industry workers.


The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service has also tasked its contracted communications providers to raise awareness of the new policy arising from the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers' report.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Moore
) (16:04):  In accordance with the provisions of the Auditor-General Act 1997, I present the following report of the Auditor-General: Report No. 26 of 2012-13––Performance audit––Remediation of the lightweight torpedo replacement project: Department of Defence and Defence Materiel Organisation.

Senator PARRY
 (Tasmania—Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman of Committees) (16:05):  I present the first report of 2013 of the Procedure Committee, on the routine of business and electronic petitions.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator PARRY:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


It is with great pleasure that I speak briefly to the report. The Procedure Committee has undertaken consultations with all the parties and the parties independently have consulted internally. After a series of meetings and discussions, the Procedure Committee has a number of recommendations. The Procedure Committee is looking at the routine of the business of the Senate still. The committee will continue to keep these matters under review but we have made two recommendations, which will become the subject of debate and motions next sitting week. I understand the minister shortly will be moving a motion to give that effect.


There are two issues in the report which I want to raise. I would encourage all senators to read the report in its entirety because there are some very good attachments, and I thank the Clerk and the Clerk's office for the fine work they have done in presenting this report.


The first of the two items which senators would like to take note of is the adjournment debate on Tuesdays, which is currently open-ended and which we intend to retain as open-ended. A recommendation is that the standing orders be adjusted or a temporary order be placed to enable the adjournment debate to have three categories of duration in speeches. It would give senators the option of speaking for five minutes, 10 minutes or 20 minutes. Currently the provision exists for senators to speak with leave for 20 minutes at the end of the adjournment debate on Tuesdays. We will now make this so it is not a provision that you need to ask leave to do; you would be able to speak without leave in any of the three categories, and the whips' offices obviously will arrange the order of the list in the order of five-minute speeches, 10-minute speeches and 20-minute speeches. This is done in order to facilitate possibly more speeches and more availability of time without moving into the late hours of the evening, so it would be interesting to see how that progresses and whether senators take up the option of speaking for five minutes and speaking earlier in the evening.


The other matter that we are suggesting that the Senate adopt is in the area of non-controversial legislation on a Thursday when it exists, as it did today. When it commences and goes through the normal process for non-controversial legislation, we would encourage senators to abide by the spirit of the non-controversial legislation, which means legislation that is debated briefly with the idea that it is legislation that all parties agree to. That has been a temporary order for some time. We are suggesting that that now become a permanent standing order, and there is an amendment suggested in the report.


The other matter is electronic petitions. We have clarified some issues in relation to electronic petitions and suggested a way of accepting electronic signatures as time moves forward when the Department of Parliamentary Services and the Senate work out a formula to adopt these. In essence, electronic signatures would form the signature that would normally be attached to a petition. This is something on which there is a detailed paper attached to the committee report, and I would encourage senators to read that.


There is one other matter, in relation to matters of public interest. The Procedure Committee is recommending—and again it is for the Senate to determine—that the time allocated, instead of being at 12.45, commence at 1 pm, so it would be a strict one hour, but that the speech limit be reduced from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. This has a win-win effect: first of all it is a win for senators, as we would get an additional speaker in that timeslot of one hour and, second, the government would gain an extra 15 minutes of government business.


So they are the recommendations in the report. As I indicated, the minister will be moving a motion to give that some effect in the next sitting week, when the report will be adopted, I hope. I encourage the Senate to adopt the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:12):  I rise this afternoon to comment on the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012. This is a very important piece of legislation introduced by the Greens, and it goes to the heart of the question of what sort of nation we want in this century. It goes to the heart of that question because, if you want to make and put in place the kinds of plans and the consequent infrastructure that the country needs, you have to raise the money to be able to do that. The Greens have said for a long time that we need to massively move towards a low-carbon or zero-carbon economy. We would like to see in Australia high-speed rail linking our cities. If you go to Europe or see what is happening in China—Japan did it years ago—it makes eminent sense for this country to move to high-speed rail. If you want to put in place the kind of infrastructure that will anticipate the extreme weather events that global warming is bringing us then you have to have the dollars to be able to do it. Equally, the Greens have secured Denticare, a new capacity to assist people to meet the needs of their dental health, but again it requires funding. My colleague Senator Siewert has been running a strong campaign around the country to get people out of poverty and to make sure that we can allow Newstart to be increased by $50 a week, but the question becomes: where is the money going to come from? The Prime Minister today has announced infrastructure funding to anticipate extreme weather events—with the Warragamba Dam, for example—but $50 million goes nowhere near the kind of infrastructure that is needed. Even $100 million, as she has suggested for the whole nation, goes nowhere near the kinds of changes that need to be made.


Then—the fact is that, in an Asian century, we need to be competitive—we need to lift our education standards. That means a massive investment in education, the arts, innovation and entrepreneurial skills. For that to happen you need to implement the Gonski review, and that requires billions of dollars and should not be back-ended to 2020. Then you have the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I do not think anyone disputes the fact that we need a national disability insurance scheme in this country, and the Greens are the first to agree. But all of these promises are essentially hollow unless there is the money to roll them out. You cannot just put a tiny deposit down in the lead-up to an election and say that somehow you have delivered on these things. You need to raise the money.


That is why Australians should be getting a fair return for the mineral resources which are owned by the people. These mineral resources are not owned by the mining companies; they are owned by the people. And they are, in many cases, non-renewable resources—in fact, in all cases they are non-renewable resources when it comes to ores: you dig them up and ship them away once and that is it. So we need to make sure we are getting a decent return on those.


One of the most grave crimes against future development in the nation occurred in 2006 when the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the then Treasurer, Mr Costello, gave back the huge benefits of the boom at that time by giving tax cuts all around. There were headlines like 'Manna from heaven,' and rivers of gold pouring out all over the nation. That money should have been kept and invested in proofing the country against climate impacts, and, recognising that we are facing peak oil, in building massive public transport infrastructure around the country. There were huge opportunities then to invest the money, but instead it was just thrown out into the community in massive grants to everyone to make everybody feel good, and now we are left with a need for infrastructure—in terms of brains capital and human capital, as well as physical infrastructure—for the country. So the Greens are saying that we should get a fair return from our mineral resources and that the problems with the current minerals resource rent tax need to be fixed.


This bill would amend that tax to correct one of its most egregious flaws, and that is the rebating of any future increases in state royalties, which allows the MRRT revenue to be further eroded by state governments. This flaw gives a blank cheque to state governments. They can lift royalties, knowing that they will effectively be paid by the Commonwealth government rather than by the large mining companies. That is appalling. This bill amends section 60.25 of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012 to provide that any increase in royalties after 1 July 2011 should be disregarded when calculating royalty credits for the MRRT. It is a first step towards ensuring that the mining sector makes a fair contribution to the society whose assets it consumes in generating its wealth. It is essentially the amendment that the Greens sought to make to the bill in March 2012.


This design flaw has not been criticised just by those on the left. It goes against what the original designer of the mining tax, Dr Ken Henry, advised. It has been criticised by the OECD, by conservative economists such as Henry Ergas, and by Nick Greiner and other members of the GST Distribution Review. It is only in the bill because of the weakness of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Resources and Energy, when they sat down with the big mining companies and tried to appease them so that they would call off their advertising campaign. Effectively, the miners wrote their own tax, knowing full well they would never pay it.


The wording used in the heads of agreement between the new Gillard government and the big three mining companies said: 'All state and territory royalties will be creditable.' Then, after the 2010 election, the Policy Transition Group, chaired by former BHP chair Don Argus and resources minister Martin Ferguson, was established to sort out the technical details of the MRRT. It recommended that all current and future state and territory royalties on coal and iron ore should be credited, which the government accepted.


Restricting the crediting of royalties to the rates in place at 1 July 2011 would raise an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates. The government has made a mess of the treatment of royalties in the MRRT, and the Australian people are paying. No group is paying more significantly than single parents, who have had their support payments taken away while the mining industry collectively has only paid $126 million. In fact you have Marius Kloppers walking away with $75 million—as a handshake, as his retirement benefit, as his walking-out-the-door ticket—and single parents left without that support payment, and those on Newstart with none of the extra money that they need. Yet BHP is essentially only paying $77 million in the tax—$2 million more than Marius Kloppers walked away with.


The other significant flaw in the MRRT is the ridiculously generous depreciation provisions. The legislation allows companies a choice for determining their asset base for the purposes of depreciation. One of the choices is a market-value approach. This is an extraordinary departure from standard accounting practice and allows companies to claim deductions for costs they have never incurred. Why on earth would the Treasurer, the minister, Martin Ferguson, and the Prime Minister agree to allow the companies to claim deductions for costs that they have never incurred? Market value is not a measure of costs paid out but of the amount the market is prepared to pay for an asset. This benefits the big miners, who have well-established mines now worth a lot more than their initial investment.


I have circulated an amendment to stop this rort and remove this choice so that only the book-value approach can be used. The amendment commences on 1 July 2013, so it affects payment not for this year but for those years into the future. I note that the book-value approach is generous in its own right as it includes an uplift rate. We should not be giving the billion-dollar multinational mining corporations more than that. If passed, the amendment would raise an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates.


Dr Parkinson, the current Treasury Secretary, identified at estimates five factors that determine the revenue raised by the MRRT: commodity prices and volume, the exchange rate, state royalties, the starting cost base against which the mining companies can claim depreciation, and the difference between prices at the mine and at the docks.


In estimating the depreciation costs Dr Parkinson said Treasury had relied on initial estimates from the mining companies which they may well have changed since. In effect he admitted Treasury had developed their assumptions based on conversations with the mining companies before the tax came in, but the mining companies had had the opportunity, once the tax became law, to rethink what their starting base would be. Why on earth would you have given the mining companies the ability to determine how much they would pay and adjust the formulas according to what they wanted?


Former Treasury Secretary Ken Henry, in an appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy in July 2010, admitted that no Treasury officials were directly involved in the negotiations between the government and BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata. I find it extraordinary that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Ferguson thought that they could manage this negotiation without the expertise of Treasury. That is an extraordinary thing. What it will do is put out there into the heartland of people who perhaps thought that if there was one thing that Labor could do it was actually manage the economy—in terms of accounting practices at least—that, when push came to shove, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Ferguson excused the experts and brought in the people who were looking after their own interests absolutely, 100 per cent—Rio, Xstrata and BHP—and allowed them to determine the terms. You can only assume from that that the deal was that the mining industry agreed to a tax that they knew they would never have to pay and that the government would appear to have a win, to have negotiated an outcome, knowing that in fact the outcome would not deliver anything. That is the only conclusion you can reach.


Again, it goes to the heart of the competence of the negotiators in that negotiation. That is why I have been asking: where is the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Martin Ferguson? He has not been seen for months. Whilst the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been out there trying to defend their role in this, the minister whose job it is to look after resources and energy seems to have gone AWOL. If you go to his website, he has not got a single transcript on there from after September last year. I have to ask: where does that go to in terms of transparency, or is the minister hoping that no-one will notice, that the people of Batman will not notice, that he is nowhere to be found in terms of his accountability, and culpability, in relation to this particular disaster?


The Parliamentary Budget Office has costed a revised mining tax with the following reforms: a 40 per cent rate of tax, royalties credited at rates in place at 1 July 2011 and the depreciation starting base restricted to the book value. If you take those three things together, those three improvements, that would raise an additional $26 billion over the forward estimates. I began my speech by saying it is a hollow promise to say you will deliver the Gonski education reforms or the national disability insurance. There is no hope at all for people out there on Newstart if you are not prepared to take on the mining industry to raise the money to be able to fund these critical pieces of social infrastructure which benefit the entire community. We need to be putting money into physical infrastructure—for example, high-speed rail and public transport systems. There is no use standing up in Western Sydney talking about more freeways; what Western Sydney needs is light rail. As the Parramatta City Council and the Greens have been saying, we need to be able to invest in the infrastructure of the future. We need to get people off freeways and into much more efficient public transport systems. Everywhere you look in the world, the competitive cities are the ones that have got rid of congestion, got people onto public transport and made cities more liveable with more green spaces, more pedestrian access, more public transport, more cycleways and fewer freeways. And that is what is necessary in Western Sydney.


But where are we going to get the money to drive this kind of infrastructure if we do not make the mining industry pay their way? The Greens have argued for a long time that we need a sovereign wealth fund and that it should be set up so that you genuinely use the benefits of the boom to accumulate not only the balance of the fund but the interest on the fund in order to invest in the kinds of social and physical infrastructure I am talking about. We need a first-class education system; we need to invest in research and development; we need public transport; we need high-speed rail; we need to get ourselves rapidly moving off the old coal fired generators and into the new energy providers, 100 per cent renewable energy, as quickly as possible. We need these things and that is why you have to raise the money to pay for them.


The Parliamentary Budget Office costed that royalty change in this bill on their own. They determined that it would mean raising an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates from 2012-13 to 2015-16. The PBO costings showed that making the depreciation amendment on its own would have resulted in the MRRT raising an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates over that same four-year period. So I would encourage the Senate to support this bill. We have the bill in the Senate and we have now successfully moved for a Senate inquiry into the flaws in this bill. We also need to provide for the opportunity to fix it, to improve it, so that we secure the funding. The Greens have no interest in allowing the mining industry to walk away when 80 per cent of the profit from these big miners go to overseas shareholders. These profits leave the country. We want to make sure that those big mining companies actually pay a fair return on the resources that belong to the people in this country.


Surely it is not too much to ask a parliament to secure those resources.


The only reason we have not secured them is political. When you think about how this happened, you will see it happened as a consequence of Prime Minister Rudd losing the prime ministership over the fact that the mining industry bullied the government of the day by running a massive advertising campaign—a $20 million advertising campaign—that has saved them billions of dollars. They are laughing all the way to the bank. After succeeding in bringing down one Prime Minister, they succeeded in diddling the nation through inept negotiations between the next Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the minister. That is what happened. It was the politics of the day that did the Australian people out of a fair return which would have enabled us to spend on the things the nation needs.


That is where the coalition are disingenuous in this, because the coalition do not want a mining tax at all. They do not want the big miners to pay a fair return to the Australian people for our resources; they are more than happy to have the profits leave the country. The question to the coalition is: where are they going to get the money from to be able to invest in improving Newstart, to be able to invest in high-speed rail, to be able to invest in education, to be able to invest in Gonski reforms and to be able to invest in national disability? That is not to mention the five per cent emission reduction that they say they are committed to, which they do not have the dollars to actually do; nor do they have the dollars to upscale to the level of emission reduction necessary as a to face up to the science of climate change. So we have a coalition who do not want the miners to pay at all and a government who have been inept in negotiating with the miners to the point where they have embraced the interests of the miners at the cost of the people.



The Greens are standing here saying: 'We care about the people of Australia. We care about the environment.' We clearly have a vision for the future: to transition to a low-carbon economy and then a zero-carbon economy, and to have a society in which people are well educated and well cared for, where we have a decent health system and Denticare rolled out and we do not have people absolutely constrained in situations of poverty and homelessness because we say we do not have the money to deal with it. We have the money to deal with it if we have the political courage to take on the big miners. The Greens are prepared to stand up to the big miners. I would urge the rest of the Senate to support the bill. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:32):  Before I address the content of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012 before the Senate, I want to rebut some of the points that Senator Milne just addressed in her contribution to the discussion. She made the point at the outset that budget commitments need to be funded. I must say on behalf of the government that we are in staggering and startling agreement on that point. That is why we participated in negotiations and agreed to the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office and funded that; that is why we assisted Treasury and Finance to become parties to the protocol, so that the office can carry out its central function on costing issues associated with undertakings made by any and all political parties. With that little bit of rhetorical flourish, let us just say that the government also shares that view.


Senator Milne then went on to develop a point. Because she is an intelligent woman, I presume the point she addressed is one of rhetorical flourish—that somehow or other all of the minerals and, by implication, all of the oil and gas in and around mainland Australia are owned by all of us, by that amorphous mass called 'the people'. I presume she put that as a rhetorical proposition as we are on broadcast. As everyone in this chamber knows, and they learnt this in their first lesson in Constitutional Law I: minerals under the ground are vested in the Crown in right of the state. That has been the case for I do not know how many centuries and it has certainly been the case in this country since European colonisation in the latter part of the 18th century. But, 240 years since that time, as we consider the utility of the proposition I just outlined in rebuttal to Senator Milne, there is considerable sense in minerals under the ground being vested in the Crown in right of the state: it enables the state, at Commonwealth level, territory level or state level, to essentially regulate and control the use of land, whether that is done in an agricultural sense, a mining sense, an extractive sense or whatever. By 'regulate' I mean allowing access, allowing development and having proper regard for environmental considerations, on both the agricultural side and the mining side.


Consider the only sensible opposition to the Crown not having rights with respect to minerals under the ground. By definition, it would go to some other body. Most logically, that other body would be the individual landholder or leaseholder. We know how that system works, because it works in the United States. One only has to look at the huge degree of development with respect to the coal seam gas industry and the shale oil gas industry in the southern states of the United States, where mining companies pay the owner of the land a fee for access to minerals and the like under the soil, and the development goes ahead willy-nilly. There are a range of benefits from that system to individual landholders and to industry from the cheap gas that emerges from that process. That is probably a debate for another day. On balance, the system we have in this country, of the Crown having control of access to land and land use, is probably a better system. There is a terrible sense of deja vu about this debate. We have been having it every year—we had it in 2009, 2010, 2011 and all of last year—and now, as Senator Milne just said, there is further reference to the application of a minerals resource rent tax.


The bill before the chair attempts to amend the MRRT to achieve two purposes, and Senator Milne succinctly outlined them: firstly, that any increase in state royalties after 1 July 2011 be disregarded when calculating the royalty credits for the MRRT; and, secondly, to disallow provisions of the MRRT so that miners can no longer use the market value method to determine their starting base. So the bill before the chair attempts to remove, to negate, to disallow, the two most critical features of the MRRT Act that is currently proclaimed law in this country. If passed, this bill would totally neuter, make useless, the purpose and intent of the existing MRRT.


When one thinks about that ambition it cannot be described as small. It is no mean purpose that is sought to be achieved in this debate late on Thursday afternoon. But before we can properly discuss the bill before the chair a little bit of a history lesson in the development of the MRRT over the last three or four years would be useful. What does that little bit of history show us? It shows the following. First, the current MRRT Act was one of 11 bills discussed and passed in this chamber on 19 March 2012—almost 12 months ago. That package of bills—there were 10 or 11 bills—addressed a range of matters at that time: an overview of the position of the positive impact of the mining industry; how the MRRT was intended to operate; the revenue forecasts associated with the MRRT; a range of ways in which Australians might share from the benefits of the MRRT; and other tax conveniently avoided up this end but paid in large numbers by firms in the mining industry.


But there were a range of other matters before the chair that day. One went to increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Some of us might have liked to have gone from nine per cent to 15 per cent in one fell hit, bringing it forward in bites of one per cent a year every year for six years until it reached 15 per cent. There was removal of superannuation age limits. There were benefits in low-income superannuation contributions. There was simplification of asset depreciation arrangements. There was the introduction of accelerated initial deductions for the purchase of motor vehicles by small business. And there were a range of other benefits to sectional interests in our community.


So the MRRT Bill, now the MRRT Act, was not the only matter that was up for discussion back in March 2012; it was one bill as part of a total package of 11 or 12 that were discussed at the same time. Those measures affected the mining industry, the offshore petroleum industry, small business, superannuation beneficiaries and those who enjoy depreciation arrangements for capital investment. When the MRRT package of bills was put up for a vote, the Greens and the current government combined 38 to 32 to support that package, including the MRRT, without amendment. The only parties to oppose it were the opposition over there.


Right from day one Labor government and the Greens brought forward a package of bills. Both parties voted for it, there were no amendments, it went to a division and it was carried 38 to 32. What does that mean? It is very simple: the Greens in the bill currently before the chair seek to negate what less than 12 months ago they stood and voted for, stood and supported, stood and endorsed.




Senator Williams:
  Guillotined as well.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  Guillotined as well. Maybe we did guillotine it. That is what happens when you have the numbers. Thirty-nine is more than 37. Welcome to the real world. I do not know if it was guillotined. If it wasn't, it should have been. The point was this: we did not have 39 votes in our own right; we wandered down to the end of the chamber. They said, 'Yeah, that's a good package of propositions in there,' about the capital investment, the superannuation improvements, the bringing forward of write-offs for small business for motor vehicle purchases, the improvements in the petroleum rent resource tax and the imposition of the MRRT. They said, 'Gee, we don't like bits and pieces here.' We responded, 'Hey, we also don't like bits and pieces.' As I said at the outset, some of us would have liked to increase superannuation not to 12 per cent over eight or nine years but to 15 per cent over five or six years. But in the negotiation process the eventual outcome was that what was put in this chamber, and the Greens and the government had full knowledge of its content and supported that package.


So it is a bit rich now, barely 12 months after the ink is dry, and after a little bit of adverse evidence from the Secretary of the Treasury a couple of weeks ago in estimates outlining what everyone in the world knew about the design of the MRRT, to use that as an excuse to come back in here and essentially renege on an agreement fully entered into, fully supported, on the basis of—what?—full information. It doesn't get any better than that. The blind, deaf, dumb and ignorant might have a reason to go back on their word. But when you have participated in all the negotiations, sat through all the committees, sat through the debate here, agreed to a particular outcome and voted for the outcome, you do not get to come back 11 months later and say, 'Hey, we don't like that; we want to do something else.'


The inquiry into the bill before the chair, conducted by the Economics Legislation Committee and tabled earlier this month, addresses that point exactly in paragraph 1.12. It says:


Following negotiations with the mining industry and the deliberations of the Policy Transition Group (PTG), which was established to advise on the implementation and technical design elements of the MRRT, the government agreed to the PTG's recommendation 'that there be full crediting of all current and future State and Territory royalties under the MRRT so as to provide certainty about the overall tax impost on the coal and iron ore mining industries.


That statement was released under the authority of Mr Swan and Mr Ferguson on 24 March 2011. Everyone knew what was going on. The government had accepted the recommendations of the Policy Transition Group and had put out a press release in writing to that effect, and everyone in the government and everyone in the Greens knew that.


The time sequence in this discussion is clear, and for the last four years the Greens have been fully aware, fully consulted and, to a very, very significant extent, involved in a lot of discussions. In December 2010 there was the report of the Policy Transition Group. In March 2011 there was government acceptance of that recommendation that I just read out. In March 2012 there was an inquiry into the then MRRT Bill, and on 19 March, barely a fortnight after the recommendations of that bill inquiry came down, the Greens voted for the two measures that were at the heart of the then bill, now act, and are at the heart of the bill they bring before the chair today to renege on. You cannot do business like that.


Turning now to the bill before the chair, chapter 2 of the Senate Economics Committee report is instructive, and it deserves to be put more fully on the public record. It outlines the process of inquiry into this bill. It is only a very brief report. It is only in two chapters, no more than 10 pages. The inquiry was conducted from November 2012 until February 2013: November, December, January, February. It went for almost four months, knocking off a month for January, of course. There was one significant extension of time granted by the committee at the request of the Greens, presumably to get more submissions into the inquiry so we could have a fuller discussion at the appropriate time.


In that four-month period, do you know how many submissions that committee inquiry into the bill before the chair received? It received only six submissions. There were four months of examination and four months of writing to interested parties. The database in the economics committee of interested players in this debate, as you can imagine, goes to hundreds and hundreds of individuals, groups and associations, and only six put in a written comment. Of those six, a full five opposed the passage of the bill before the chair. So after a four-month inquiry, an extension granted at the request of the Greens, six submissions were received. Of those, five opposed the bill, and only one supported the bill before the chair. The committee, in its wisdom—it must be said—decided not to hold a public inquiry on the basis of only six submitters, five of which opposed the bill. We did the report on the papers, and it is before us today.


But what can one conclude from a bill inquiry on a subject which is apparently of great public notoriety when hundreds and hundreds of individuals, groups, associations, companies, governments and the like are invited to put in a submission that essentially goes to a reworking of the MRRT Act? What conclusion can we draw? The conclusion we can draw is that there is just about no interest in this country in revisiting the design features of the MRRT. You would have thought they would have been lined up in their thousands, seeking to come in and say how onerous it is, how heavy it is, how inefficient it is, how bad it is, how whatever it is. You would have thought that the churches would be organised, along with some of the community groups and some of the NGOs. But, no, there was a wailing silence between November and February, because nobody—I beg your pardon, I mislead the chair—rather, one person in Australia took the trouble to write a submission supporting the bill before the chair. Nobody else cared. Nobody else wrote. Talk about Orphan Annie!


I have never been in a bill inquiry, in all the time I have been here—and I have been in inquiries on a whole range of matters—where there were only six submissions, with five opposed to the content of the bill and only one supporting it. Think back over the years. How many contentious pieces of legislation did we handle in opposition and have been part of government policy for the last five years? How many inquiries have people in this chamber participated in, written reports on and given speeches about? I, for the life of me, cannot recall one where there was only one submission in favour of the bill.


Perhaps I have drawn the wrong conclusion on that; perhaps there is a great deal of interest out there in this proposition. We are going to find out because, in addition to all of those matters that I outlined in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013—legislation inquiries, the Policy Transition Group, the pre-existing bill under Mr Rudd, the reform bill under Ms Gillard and the numerous inquiries—less than an hour ago, the Senate Economics References Committee accepted another reference to inquire into the MRRT. It seems to me that the norm is now that you get about 17 bites at the cherry. We dress up the conclusion, in terms of the argument about wanting to have money to spend on Gonski, or disability— (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:52):  If Senator Milne's speech at the National Press Club was in effect the decree nisi for the political union between the Greens and the Australian Labor Party then the decision to debate the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012 at this time represents the decree absolute. Senator Bishop in effect gave expression to that here today. But the thing that confuses me greatly is why this political marriage between the Greens and the Australian Labor Party happened in the first place. I am certain it is something that confounds Senator Bishop as well—as one of the clearer-thinking members of this chamber. He is turning red, as I know he often does when I speak.


What also confuses me is that, when the Prime Minister assumed that office, one of the three policy areas that she said she would fix was the situation around the mining tax. The Prime Minister went to the election. Subsequent to the election, with the support of the Australian Greens, she formed government. Subsequent to that the Prime Minister had that now famous civil union ceremony with former Senator Brown where all the participants and witnesses were sporting sprigs of wattle in a festive spirit. At the time that the Australian Greens entered that union with the Labor Party, the Prime Minister's intentions were known in relation to the future of the minerals resource rent tax. At the time that the legislation went through the parliament, the union between the government and the Greens was formalised and the Greens had access to full and comprehensive briefings from their alliance partners on this legislation. So the Greens came into this chamber to support the MRRT legislation with their eyes wide open. It was with complete knowledge that they entered this arrangement—certainly more knowledge than the opposition had as to the background of the negotiations behind this legislation. The Australian Greens are in effect co-authors of the MRRT legislation. I think Senator Bishop was quite right to express his surprise that a little more than a year after the legislation passed this place the Greens are now walking away from their own creation. I wanted to give a little background as to the confusion that I have as I stand here today.


Our proposition has always been that the minerals resource rent tax is a bad tax. It has always been that it came out of it an improper process, it came out of a bad process and it came out of the process that the Greens fully, completely supported. Labor's mining tax, we have long contended, is so inefficient, so distorting and so bad for investment in a very important industry for Australia, so bad for our economy and so bad for the budget that it should be scrapped and not further expanded. The bill before us would make a bad tax even worse.


The coalition, not surprisingly, emphatically rejects this bill—for different reasons to the government, obviously. But we do call upon the Senate to oppose this legislation in anticipation of a bill after the next election—should the Australian public bestow the privilege of government on the coalition. After the election we would scrap the MRRT altogether.


The basic premise that this Greens bill is based on is fundamentally flawed. The bill seeks to disregard any increases in royalties after 1 July 2011 when calculating royalty credits for the MRRT. This is of course inconsistent with the commitment the Prime Minister and the Treasurer made in the mining tax deal that they negotiated personally, exclusively and in secret with the three biggest miners, when they promised that all state royalties would be creditable against the mining tax. Despite attempts by the government to revisit the definition of 'all' in relation to state royalties, even Ms Gillard and Mr Swan had to recognise that 'all' meant all and that 'all' included any future increases in state royalties.


It is, of course, not particularly competent that Ms Gillard and Mr Swan signed up to such a commitment without engaging the states and territories first and without seeking their formal agreement in relation to the royalty arrangements. This is not the fault of the states, it is not the fault of the territories and it is not the fault of the miners. Royalty arrangements are a matter for the states. There is nothing the Prime Minister and the Treasurer can do to stop the states from increasing their royalties as they see fit. In fact, their mining tax deal provided a direct incentive to state and territory governments to increase their royalties. The idea advanced by sections of the Labor Party and the Greens that state royalty crediting arrangements and market based depreciation arrangements are actually loopholes in the MRRT is completely wrong. To present these as loopholes is more than wrong; it is dishonest.


These are not loopholes; they are deliberate design features of the MRRT. They are the government's design features and the Australian Greens supported them in this place.


There is much that is wrong with the mining tax deal that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer negotiated, exclusively and in secret, with the three biggest miners. It is important to consider how this all started. Why is it that the royalties are credited under Labor's mining tax in the first place? Even though Labor's mining tax was never anything other than an attempt at a grab for more cash to support the reckless spending of this government, it was sold as important long-term reform designed to make the system simpler, fairer and more efficient. Instead, it made resource taxation arrangements more complex, less fair, more distorting and less efficient. The Henry tax review recommended that a national profit based resource rent tax would replace state and territory royalties. The argument was that royalties were inefficient because they were imposed on production irrespective of profits, whereas a profits based tax would only apply if there were profits.


The problem was that, for a number of states, royalties represented a significant part of their own source of revenue. Yet the Treasurer, whose deficits, I should add, are more than fiscal, never even talked to the states about the implications of the mining tax for them. Instead of replacing royalties, Ms Gillard and Mr Swan came up with complicated crediting arrangements. As soon as they promised to credit all state and territory royalties, they provided an incentive to states and territories to increase their royalties, as any increase in royalties would be creditable against the MRRT. In fact, the MRRT deal removed any incentive for states to keep royalty rates low or provide discounts to attract investment to their states, as part of competitive federalism, because any benefit from discounted royalty rates would go to Canberra through increased MRRT revenue and not actually help attract investment to particular states.


So the entirely rational and predictable result was that five out of six states, including the Labor states of Tasmania and South Australia, have increased royalties on iron ore or coal since the mining tax deal was signed by Ms Gillard and Mr Swan. Every increase in royalties since the deal was signed did, of course, blow a hole in Labor's mining tax revenue estimates, as any increase in royalties courtesy of the deal reduced MRRT revenue.


Labor's mining tax is more complex, distorting, inefficient, costly to administer and costly to comply with than the previous resource taxation arrangements based on state royalties and company tax. The MRRT is a failed tax which came out of a bad and now widely discredited process. The MRRT should be scrapped; it should not be expanded. It is a distorting, inefficient tax grab which inappropriately targets an important industry. As I have said already, it is bad for investment and bad for the economy.


Two previous Senate inquiries into the mining tax have clearly exposed the many deep flaws of Labor's mining tax. Those inquiries predicted the mess that would ultimately result and the fiscal train wreck that it would be. Ironically, as we debate the bill, the Greens have established an inquiry to look at the flaws in the tax which they helped to pass and which they are now trying to make even more economically destructive. The Greens' supposed fix to the MRRT is a grab for more tax by punishing states for the flaws in the Gillard-Swan mining tax design. I repeat: the MRRT is a bad tax because it is bad for investment, bad for the economy and bad for the budget.


It is a complex and distorting tax—I cannot say that often enough. It is designed in a way that favours the bigger miners, who were given the opportunity to sit around the table, at the expense of the smaller miners, who we would want to be the success stories of tomorrow. It has failed to raise any meaningful revenue, when the government have already spent all of the money they thought it would raise and more. When the MRRT deal was announced on 2 July 2010 by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, they said it would raise $4 billion in year one and $22.5 billion over the first four years. In the 2012-13 budget, that shrank to $3 billion in year 1 and $13.4 billion over the first four years. In the most recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, it then shrank to $2 billion in year 1 and $9.1 billion over the first four years. Those were net revenue estimates—that is, they took the company tax effect into account. Given the MRRT is a tax deduction for company tax purposes, 30 per cent of whatever gross revenue came from the MRRT would have been collected anyway.


We now know that the MRRT raised only $126 million in gross revenue in the first two of three instalments for 2012-13. Once we take the company tax effect into account, that becomes a $88 million net revenue figure, which is comparable to the budget estimates. Once we take the $53 million in ATO administration costs for the MRRT into account, that becomes $35 million. Once we take the $38.5 million the government allocated to the RSPT advertising campaign into account, the taxpayer is actually $3.5 million short from the MRRT.


The premise of the MRRT was false from the start. The proposition that the mining industry does not pay its fair share of tax is false. This financial year, iron ore and coal miners will pay more than $8 billion in state royalties alone. They will pay more than $20 billion in royalties and company taxes.


The previous system worked: the more profitable a company, the more tax they would pay; the more valuable the non-renewable resource, the more royalties they would pay under the ad valorem royalty system. Labor's profit based resource rent tax concept is flawed, because the practical consequence of it is that, without profit, miners could extract the valuable non-renewable resources from the ground for nothing—and that is wrong.


Ms Gillard and Mr Swan's handling of the mining tax negotiations was incompetent. They never knew what the cost of the market-value based appreciation arrangements were when they signed the deal, and they still do not know what the cost is. If you are going to have a mining tax—which we do not think you should—then to be internally consistent you would have that feature of the mining tax deal. But a competent government would have had it properly costed before spending the revenue the MRRT would raise. Incredibly, when it came to costing the impact of some of the key features of their mining tax deal on mining tax revenue estimates, they forced Treasury to fly without vision. As the Treasury secretary, Dr Parkinson, made clear in Senate estimates, they were unable to consider the cost impacts of changes in market-value based appreciation and net-back arrangements because they could not see them. These and other matters do deserve scrutiny and report from a further Senate mining tax inquiry because the government have consistently hidden the truth behind the numbers.


The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have persisted with their dishonest talking points, blaming commodity price volatility, exchange rates and state royalty increases as the reasons why revenue from the MRRT came in more than 90 per cent below forecast. Those assertions were comprehensively discredited by Dr Parkinson at Senate estimates. Dr Parkinson made clear that Treasury were able to take commodity price volatility, changes in volumes and in exchange rates, and increases in royalties, into account when revising their MRRT revenue estimates. That is why estimated MRRT revenue went from $4 billion in 2012-13, when the MRRT deal was announced, to $3 billion in the last budget and to $2 billion in the last MYEFO—they could not take the change in cost of the value-market based depreciation arrangements and net-back arrangements into account. Yet, despite that very clear, compelling and independent evidence, the Treasurer continues to peddle his spin on what is to blame for lower-than-predicted mining tax revenue collections.


The other lie is that the people cannot possibly complain about the damage the mining tax has done to the important mining industry because, after all, they did not have to pay much tax. That is false. The mining tax was very much disruptive at a challenging time for an important industry, an industry that helped keep Australia going post-GFC. The tax is complex and costly to administer. Smaller miners alone had to spend more than $20 million in administering increased red-tape requirements under the MRRT while the ATO spent more than $50 million administering the tax.


The bad tax, the tax that was improperly negotiated, has had a detrimental effect on our sovereign risk profile as an investment destination. And, of course, the tax has hardly raised any revenue, when all the money the government thought it would raise—and more—has been spent. That is why we are now dealing with this bill. And for so long as this ineffective MRRT is on our statute books there will be other bills to try to expand the MRRT in one way or another, I am sure.


The MRRT is, as I have said, a bad tax because of the way it was negotiated. The MRRT is a bad tax, as I have said, because of the way that it was designed. The MRRT is a bad tax because it is a red-tape nightmare. And the mining tax is a bad tax because it is a dagger at the heart of Australia's mining prosperity. It introduces a new tax on an important industry on top of existing royalty and income tax arrangements, and that makes our tax system more complex and less fair. It reduces our international competitiveness as an attractive investment destination. It gives an unfair competitive advantage to three big multinational, multi-commodity and multi-project companies, who were given the exclusive opportunity by the government to negotiate the design of this new tax, with all their competitors and other stakeholders locked out.


We need to make sure that our mining industry continues to prosper, that high-paid mining jobs are preserved. The government's poorly designed MRRT will not be fixed by trying to penalise the states to benefit the Commonwealth. The mining industry pays the states for extracting the resource and pays the Commonwealth through company tax. The Greens bill reveals them, and by association the government, for what they really are: desperate for cash from an industry that they have always hated.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:12):  It was worth sitting through that speech just to get to that last bit, Senator Fifield—because that really exposed you. You started with confusion, which I will try and assist you with—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—and you concluded with ignorance, which I am afraid I cannot help you with much at all.


We will start with the confusion, however, because it is a fair question: since Labor senators have looked to us, as Senator Bishop did, and coalition senators did as well, and you passed this tax—so then, in indication to the crossbenchers, how can you now come back and want to review it? I will help with that confusion. Our options in this place, as the crossbenchers, when a bill is brought forward by either of the major parties, are twofold—and we need to choose. This place does not always tolerate ambiguity: when it comes to a vote you need to pick one side of the chamber or the other to sit on. Our options in the instance of the MRRT were twofold: the ALP, the government, on the one hand—a major party that for a brief period of time chose an evidence based approach—set a task before the Treasury secretary and then adopted it, more or less as proposed, after a long process of review and design, such that the extraordinary profits being raked off by the resources sector could be, without any kind of structural damage either to the economy at large or to those individual companies, once the profits got to a certain level, redirected and redeployed through a super-profits tax. This would not be the first jurisdiction in the world, you would be aware, where this has been tried.


Following that initiative by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, there was a $22 million public relations onslaught, which I think unbalanced the government and caught them somewhat by surprise. Because of some of the rhetoric we heard a moment ago from Senator Fifield, you would be aware that the Greens are used to the kind of invective being directed at us by people like Senator Fifield, who effectively just read in a bunch of press statements from the Minerals Council of Australia, and not particularly original work. You do appear to have stolen Mitch Hooke's homework there, Senator Fifield, because there was not an original word spoken.




Senator Fifield:
  I thought I was quite gentle about you.




Senator Mason:
  More gentle than I would have been, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  You will get your chance, Senator Mason. You will get your opportunity. In all honesty I do not think the government was actually prepared for the brutal and dishonest campaign by the mining industry. They passed the hat around and collected $22 million and did you over, and it was an ugly thing to watch. I can recall the television ads that ran. It evidently destabilised the ALP to the degree that it cost Kevin Rudd the prime ministership of the country. We have not seen that kind of thing in modern political history before.




Senator Williams:
  He had lost his way.




Senator LUDLAM:
  A good government that had lost its way, to paraphrase you there, Senator Williams.




Senator Williams:
  The Prime Minister—




Senator LUDLAM:
  That is correct. It was in the aftermath of a really vicious and personal advertising campaign that effectively repeated most of the themes we just heard from Senator Fifield, from whom he pinches his homework. That is what we faced on one side. That was part of our choices. That internal destabilisation then cost a Prime Minister his job. What happened then is that it appears the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, delegating to Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson—the inside man—who handed a pen to the mining sector with which to write their own tax law. And what do you know? What came out of that process was something that was highly permissive and effectively geared towards a form of legalised—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I promise I will get to that Senator Fifield. I promise I will allay your confusion. I can see you struggling with it. I will get there. Here is where I can help to resolve Senator Fifield's confusion. Our other choice is to sit on the other side of the chamber when a bill such as that is put to the vote—notwithstanding the amendments we did move, which I will get to in a moment—where there is the Abbott opposition, a political party that does not have the courage to take on the mining industry at all.




Senator Fifield:
  So it is our fault.




Senator LUDLAM:
  We have a choice between a flawed tax, which we can try to amend through the process available to us, or no tax at all. Senator Fifield, I must have allayed your confusion, because you are on your way.




Senator Fifield:
  It is all so clear.




Senator LUDLAM:
  It is all so clear now. Total capitulation. A policy that has rolled over on its back and is waving its legs in the air that somehow, Mr Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has the political gift to turn into a show of strength. Complete and utter capitulation to the mining industry has somehow been able to be portrayed as tough and fearless leadership and as sticking up for ordinary people. There is real political genius at work there. It is fundamentally dishonest and nasty, but it is very clever.


So these are the choices we face on the crossbenches: a flawed tax or none at all. I can remember this very well because I participated in the debate. The amendments that the Greens moved both at the second reading and at the committee stage were shot down—what do you know?—by the combined numbers of the government and the opposition. That then leaves us with a stark choice at the end of the debate: vote for a tax we know is flawed or vote for no tax at all. So when Senator Fifield reminds us that the tax picked up no more than $126 million in gross revenue in the first two quarters of its operation, that is $126 million better than nothing, because that is the opposition's counterproposal.


The amendments we put at the time were voted down by the major parties on the basis that the Labor Party figured that was the best they were going to get, and the opposition will vote against anything that appears to try to redeploy some of these extraordinary profits back into the public good. We can try again, for example, with the bill we have brought to the chamber tonight, or we can try again through future inquiries, such as the one that Senator Milne, with the concurrence of Senator Cormann, has just initiated. Senator Cormann's motives are very clear. He has not tried to hide them. He wants to destroy the tax. He wants to pull it completely to pieces. At least that is transparent. Our motives are that we will use the mechanisms available to us in this chamber, as is one of our primary roles, to improve the legislation and to bring amendments forward to fix it. That is the purpose of this inquiry and I am very glad it is occurring.


So there are opportunities to fix the mistakes that are made. I will remind senators that the mistakes have been out in the open for all to see. It was a pretty blunt instrument that Minister Ferguson enabled for the mining industry and effectively handed to the big three. We had people with very detailed inside knowledge of the mining industry, people like AMEC, who represent the juniors and the mid-tiers in Western Australia, telling us, 'We are going to get done over in this process. You have given this to the big three to handle in their own interests, and here is what is going to happen.' They spelt it out in detail that even Treasury officials were unable to validate. They said, 'We are going to need to wait to see the figures, for example, on the way that the depreciation provisions are written into the bill.' Treasury would not touch it at the time. They said, 'We are going to need to see industry's numbers.' On the afternoon of the inquiry that Senator Bob Brown and I attended, AMEC spelt out for us exactly what was going to happen.


Professor Henry Ergas is not somebody I tend to quote at great length in this chamber. But he does appear from time to time and offers the benefit of his views on these sorts of matters. He is opposed to the super-profits tax and opposed to the MRRT. Nonetheless he is well aware of how these things would be gained. He spelt it out for the committee and it was quite an enlightening session. He has quite detailed knowledge of the way our tax law works and the way that the targets of taxation can try to wriggle around and sleaze their way out of paying the tax. At the session—it must have been the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, on 21 February 2012—he said:


When you impose a significant tax you are always going to provide incentive for people to minimise the tax that they pay.


It is not necessarily illegal; it is just what happens.


One of the ways in which they are going to do that is to try to shift income out of the taxed pool into the untaxed pool. To that extent, yes, this tax does invite that.


I put to him a question about whether the complexity of the tax and the fact that the miners got to write it open it up to being abused. He essentially agreed in principle. I asked him then, 'What are the vulnerabilities?' As a professor of economics, he was reasonably well placed to answer the question. If he was going to game it and try to write his way out of having to pay any tax under this thing—if he was working for the companies who got to draft the bill—how would he do that? How would he shift income, as he put it, out of the tax pool and into the untaxed pool? Here is what he told us:


In all fairness I have not devoted all that much time to that. But I think the issues that will arise, even under the tax as it is currently proposed, will include timing issues, revenue recognition issues and particularly cost allocation issues; what the allowed rate of return on the downstream assets should be; how that allowed rate of return should be allocated; what the relevant asset base downstream is; and at what pace those downstream assets should be depreciated. All of those issues will doubtless arise in respect of this tax.


There you go, colleagues. I am very happy to agree on this occasion with Professor Henry Ergas, who forecast exactly what it was that the miners were going to do with the tax law that they were allowed to draft by resources and energy minister Martin Ferguson, on behalf of an Australian government, desperate and bruised as it was at that time by the assault of the mining industry on television and in the newspapers through both paid and unpaid coverage of their advocacy. It looked as though new Prime Minister Gillard just wanted the pain threshold turned down—just wanted the temperature turned down—and the assault to stop. And they gave the mining companies the pen.


It is not our role to be apologists for those who did the deal or for those on the other side of the chamber who oppose any deal being done at all. It is our job to recognise the mistakes that have been made and to correct them in the public interest. As Senator Milne said a short time ago, we should not come in here saying that we need to rip money off single parents, we need to delay the introduction of a disability insurance scheme, we cannot afford the rollout of large-scale renewable energy in Australia, we cannot afford the provision of decent public transport, we cannot afford to look after the environment or we need to set aside any of the many priorities that assail us across this country. We have the means to raise the revenue; we know that we do.


The beauty of a profits tax on an industry that does provide a substantial revenue base—and it certainly does in my home state of Western Australia—is that the tax does not kick in until you are doing extraordinarily well. That is the purpose of it. It is not a royalty receipt based on the tonnage that comes out of the ground. It only cuts in when you are doing very well. All the hysterical frothy hyperbole from those on other side of the chamber about how it is designed to assassinate the goose that lays the golden egg are basically them simply reading in statements from the big end of town, which is doing everything it can within the law—which they get to write—to avoid paying tax. It is a game that is probably as old as the concept of tax. It is not good enough for us to stand in here and pretend that there is nothing that we can do about it. As legislators, it is our job to do something about it. We in the Australian Greens take that job very seriously indeed.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:25):  I speak in opposition to the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012. One thing that we can never be certain of is the future. All good governments and businesses prepare budgets about proposed allocations of funding based on revenue sources. But neither the business community nor governments throughout the world can ever be certain of the outcomes in relation to those budgets. When we came to government in 2007, the international economy was flying high. There was an asset boom and particularly a housing boom, not only in Australia but throughout the world. The Australian economy had undergone about 20 consecutive years of growth.


But then the global financial crisis hit, and it hit hard. It affected governments and businesses throughout the world. As a result of the global financial crisis and in particular the effects on businesses and their revenue streams, businesses changed their budget positions. They changed the way that they were investing their funds to deal with those changed circumstances. Governments were no different. Good governments change budget allocations based on revenues received. In the wake of the global financial crisis, this Labor government proved itself to be quite adept at meeting the challenges of falling revenues—revenues that have fallen to the tune of $160 billion since the global financial crisis—finding the money to allocate to programs and, importantly, to continue to grow our economy.


It is in this context that I believe that this bill before the Senate this evening is short-sighted and politically motivated. It is scant on detail and modelled effects and facts. It fails to recognise that the current provisions of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax were developed as a result of a comprehensive review of our taxation system undertaken by Mr Ken Henry. It also fails to recognise that the details of this tax have been extensively negotiated after consultation with participants in the mining industry and the wider Australian public. It is a profits based tax. There will be years in which profit levels in the mining industry will not be the same as in previous years. By its nature, the revenue generated by this tax will fall and rise depending on the profitability of those companies that are subject to its provisions.


The tax has only been in existence for six months—not even one fiscal year. It is way too premature to be sounding the death knell of this particular tax. We need to take a long-term view of the way that this particular tax should work. There are issues associated with it, and the government is aware of them. But we are, as good governments should, consulting with industry participants to work through those issues. In particular, we want to work through those issues using a cooperative federalism model through the COAG process.


The Henry tax review looked at the issue of resource taxes. It determined that Australia needed a form of resource rent tax and found that such a tax would provide a more consistent treatment of resource projects and promote more efficient investment and production outcomes. Such a tax would also ensure that the Australian community received an appropriate return for its non-renewable resources. Australia has an abundant wealth of non-renewable resources, which are expected to continue to command high prices, driven by demand, particularly in China and India. Non-renewable resources such as petroleum and minerals are a significant asset of the Australian community. Australia has the world's largest economically demonstrated resource reserves of brown coal, lead, mineral sands, nickel, silver, uranium and zinc and the second-largest reserves of bauxite, copper, gold and iron ore.


The charging arrangements prior to the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax distorted investment and production decisions, thereby lowering the community's return from these resources. Further, the pre-MRRT taxation arrangements failed to collect a sufficient return for the community, because those royalties were unresponsive to changes in profits, particularly given that they were based on an output calculation method. For example, the taxes as they existed prior to the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax, and the royalties, claimed a declining share of the return to resources over recent years, despite the increased profitability of the resources sector. In the years 2001 to 2002, about $50 billion was collected. That had fallen, pre-MRRT, down to below to $20 billion. That reflects the decreasing nature of the return that Australians were getting from the profits that were increasing in that particular industry.


So, in the wake of the Henry tax review, the government consulted with the industry. And, importantly, we got an outcome; we reached an agreement to levy a tax that was much more efficient than the royalties system and met the needs and requirements of the future, in particular, when it came to raising sufficient returns from non-renewable resources.


There has been much commentary on the royalties refund and the fact that the states have increased their royalties in the wake of the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax. I want to concentrate on that fact for a moment. Those opposite have been claiming for some years now that the introduction of this tax would kill the goose that laid the golden egg, that the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax would put the brakes on the mining sector, would be a job destroyer. Yet, at the same time, Liberal and National Party governments in the various states were jacking up their royalties on these minerals in a much greater capacity and to a much greater degree than the minerals resource rent tax. So, on one hand you have the opposition criticising the minerals resource rent tax—a much more efficient tax—and on the other you have state governments pushing up their royalties. That is the weakness in the opposition's argument when it comes to this issue.


Despite that fact, the issue of royalties refunds and the approach of the states is an issue. The government is aware of this, and we are dealing with it, as all good governments should. Through the Policy Transition Group, the GST distribution process and the review, we have been working with the states to try to iron out these problems. In December last year the Treasurer and the state Treasurers agreed to refer this issue to the Heads of Treasuries process to work on a negotiated outcome. That is the way we should be approaching this. That is the way we should be approaching difficulties between state and federal governments when it comes to raising revenue in this country. Cooperative federalism is the way we should be dealing with the sufficiency of our revenue base to fund the services and infrastructure that our country dearly needs, and those discussions are underway.


The Greens are well aware that this process is being undertaken, yet they have introduced this bill in ignorance of that process—and way too prematurely; we still need to work out the outcomes of this process. They have also sought to amend the starting base for the purposes of calculation for some of the coverage that companies get with the minerals resource rent tax. Under the MRRT, miners get a one-off allowance to recognise the value of their existing assets as at 2 May 2010. Rio Tinto and BHP reported that the value of this allowance is around $1.7 billion in their financial statements in August, several months ago. It is important to note that this allowance is written off over the life of a mine and its assets; it is not on an annual basis. So, this reflects a one-off tax shield against minerals resource rent tax liabilities for up to the next 25 years.


The petroleum resource rent tax, for which a similar structure exists, has been in operation for 25 years and has raised about $28 billion. So it is way too premature to be sounding the death knell of this particular tax. It is much more effective and sensible to look at this as a long-term reform. It is really a reform aimed at delivering a fair return on non-renewable resources to our children and our grandchildren. And it will do that, because we have a strong pipeline of investment in the mining and minerals sector in this country.


I have spoken on many occasions to mining representatives in New South Wales, to those companies that are mining in the Hunter Valley and down around Wollongong, and their views of the long-term prospects of the industry are quite interesting and instructive. They have certainly been considered by the government in the development of this particular tax.


What they say is that there will be peaks and troughs, but the long-term prospect for this industry is growth based on the development of China and India. There will be peaks and troughs but the long-term outcome will be growth. And that is reflected in the companies' investment figures. It is reflected in the figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding mining investment in this country and into the future: $109 billion invested in mining in 2012-13—three times more than was invested prior to the minerals resource rent tax being announced by the government. It was $35 billion, in 2009-10.


Those opposite, again out of touch with reality, have been proclaiming the death knell of the resources sector in this country because of the introduction of this tax but the mining companies are laughing at them and saying, 'You're on your own with that argument—you're way out there with that—because we're going to invest three times the amount that we have invested in the past, prior to the introduction of this particular tax.' So the miners themselves and the people who put their money where their mouths are—the companies and the mums and dads who are investing in this industry—know the value of these assets. They know the value of what we are digging up, and which we can only dig up once. That is why the approach of the opposition, and indeed the Greens, on this is out of touch. Good policy analysis and a good approach is to adopt a long-term view of this particular tax and its benefits for the country.


The minerals resource rent tax is raising revenue. It is raising revenue to fund the programs that the government said it would fund. There is no doubt that collections raised through the tax have been impacted by the fall in commodity prices. The price of iron ore per tonne prior to the introduction of the tax was up around $160 a tonne. Over the last 12 months we have seen a dramatic decrease in the value of the spot price. It got down to around $80 a tonne at some point late last year. Thankfully, it has risen again. As I said earlier, this is a profits based tax, and miners' profits will rise and fall depending, importantly, upon the price that they can secure in the market for that particular commodity. But in that respect it is a much more efficient tax than a royalties based system. A royalties based, output calculated tax, is applied regardless of whether the commodity price is good, regardless of the level of investment; it is purely based on the output. When the price turns down and profits are reduced, miners will still pay the royalties—a much more inefficient system. So it is much more efficient to have a profits based tax in this industry. It is similar to the situation that we have had with the petroleum resource rent tax. As I said earlier, that particular tax has raised $28 billion since its inception.


Based on all of this I think the Greens and those opposite really need to have a Bex and good lie down, and calm down. This is a long-term economic prospect for our nation. We need to adopt a long-term view. As I said earlier, it is about the next generation and future generations of Australians getting an adequate return from these non-renewable resources.


The price of iron ore and coal will fluctuate. It will go up and down and the profits associated with this tax will go up and down, but over the long term—as the miners have said to me on several occasions—the forecast is for growth. As there is growth there will be returns from this particular tax for the taxpayers of Australia and the returns will fund programs that we envisaged they would fund when we developed this tax. The returns from this tax are reflected in the fact that there has been a massive downturn in government revenues—$160 billion since the global financial crisis—but this government has a strong record of finding the necessary savings to ensure that we can continue to provide adequate services and infrastructure, and, importantly, to grow our economy despite difficult circumstances.


Although the MRRT—the minerals resource rent tax—is naturally going to be volatile, it will, over the longer term, fund programs. One of those programs that is particularly important and which will be funded through minerals resource rent tax revenues is the boost in compulsory superannuation levels from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the next 10 years. We will be looking at that in the budget context but, as I said earlier, we have a strong record of delivering necessary savings and finding those savings in the budget to fund our programs. We will do that yet again. For the next year, that will be revealed in the May budget by the Treasurer.


The specifics of the bill we are debating today were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. The committee undertook an inquiry and submissions were sought for a period of four months. I understand that there were not many submissions received by the committee, so the committee determined that they would extend the deadline for the receipt of submissions. They received six submissions from companies and the community. Five of those submissions opposed the provisions of this bill. That was reported by the committee.


So, as I said earlier, the Greens need to calm down. The opposition needs to calm down and we need to take a long-term view of this project.




Senator Williams:
  We're calm; we'll get rid of it.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  The opposition needs to be conscious of the fact that the states see, Senator Williams, that these miners have been making super profits on non-renewable resources that belong to the people of Australia, and that is why they have pushed up their royalties. They know that the community is not getting a fair return on these resources, and they have pushed up their royalties. It has caused some difficulties with this tax, but we will work those out. The crux of the argument, and the philosophy, is still the same. The Australian public were not getting an adequate return from these non-renewable resources, and that is why the government introduced the minerals resource rent tax. Over the longer term it will deliver for the people of Australia, and that is why we should oppose this bill.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-02-28,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:45):  It was interesting listening to Senator Ludlam speaking. He said, 'Looking after the environment: that is what the Greens are about'. I noticed the wording of the formal motion about national parks today, where the feds would take over the national parks and not allow grazing. Just let the fuel levels rise and let the bushfires come along and have the savage, hot fires—like we had a few weeks ago at Coonabarabran, where 50,000 hectares of mainly national park and 33 homes were burnt. I am thinking: this minerals resource rent tax is about the environment.


If we look at the so-called greenest government the New South Wales parliament has ever seen—in one former Premier, now senator, Bob Carr—the Greens ruled that government. We saw them locking up country and leaving it, with virtually no hazard reduction burning and no grazing allowed. It is amazing that they do not allow grazing. They do not want hard-hooved animals in the national parks. It is about environment management, which relates to the very bill we are talking about. It is all right to have brumbies, wild pigs, feral goats or deer, but don't put any cattle or sheep in there to graze the country or get the fuel levels down so we can control the environment! Enough of that, as far as Senator Ludlam's farcical comment that the Greens are concerned about the environment. They actually destroy the environment. Their policies have been wrecking the environment, killing the animals and killing the trees, and savage hot fires have destroyed the seed on the ground for regeneration. I just had to comment on that while we are looking at this bill of the Greens.


Why was the MRRT first introduced? It was because this government got into such a financial mess—we will see the figures again tomorrow—with $263 billion of gross government debt. That is just the federal government. I am sure my colleague Senator Mason will remember the luxury car tax. It put the clamps on General Motors-Holden. No-one should be able to afford to buy those Statesmans! You have worked hard, you have put some money away and you have dreamed of your luxury car, but you had better pay more tax. There was the alcopops tax. That was going to save all the young ones from binge drinking. Instead of buying a can of Bundy and cola they would buy a bottle of Bundy rum and a bottle of coke. What is the effect of that? Then we had the LPG tax—the clean Australian fuel that we produce here. Ninety-five per cent of taxis run on it. What a good way to lose an election: upset the taxi drivers who talk to so many people every day and every night of the week! Then we had the flood tax, the carbon tax that we were never going to have, and then we got to the minerals tax. The brutal, savage, political guillotining of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd—the axing of a prime minister who was elected by the people—will go down in our political history.


We know about the presidential-style elections we have these days. Prime Minister Gillard said the government had lost its way. It was Mr Rudd who proposed the super profits tax. The word 'profit' is a naughty word in the eyes of this government and their left-wing partners in politics, the Greens. This word 'profit' is a dirty word—to have a business run at a profit and to have a business grow. Every big business started off as a small business, and they worked hard and they worked smart.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  We will get to that later on, Senator Polley. I will wait for Senator Heffernan to back me up. So, apparently, this word 'profit' is terrible. The then Prime Minister, Mr Kevin Rudd, said, 'We'll get into these profits; we'll get some of this money off them.' Of course, that all turned to tears. One of the jobs of the now Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard, was to clean up the superprofits tax—and 'We will give you the minerals resource rent tax.'


Senator Mason, I wish you had been on that select committee that I had the privilege to be on with our colleague, Senator Cormann, when they brought out the document signed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying that all state royalties would be credited. We got into a bit of an argument with Senator Cameron—which is not unusual—and I asked one of the witnesses, 'Will you please take on notice and give the committee a definition of ""all""?'




Senator Furner:
  You wouldn't increase the royalties to Queensland.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I take your interjection, Senator Furner. So all the royalties would be credited. Who do the minerals belong to? Who is responsible for them in the ground? The Crown. That is correct, isn't it, Senator Ludwig?



An honourable senator:  The Aboriginals.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  'The Aboriginals', Senator Ludlam says. So they own all the resources? Here is another tack thrown in. The way Campbell Newman has increased his royalties is on a pro rata basis. Once the price of a commodity gets over, say, $100 a tonne, then the royalty increases. But, if the price goes down, the royalty is reduced, to give business a fair go. I have no problem with the states raising the royalties. They have control of the minerals in the ground—the same as coal seam gas and oil, after the then Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, took control off the farmers in New South Wales in 1981. The same thing happened in 1971 in South Australia and back in 1915 in Queensland. Senator Ludlam, that is when the states took control of those resources off the farmers.


I have no problem with the states raising royalties. I think it is only fair that we get a fair share. The states can then use that money on their schools and their hospitals. All this federal government had to say in the COAG meeting was: 'You state blokes, you state guys, you state ladies, you state ministers, raise your royalties and we will give you less money from Canberra,' and do a balancing around the states—of course some states have much more mining than others—and just let the states raise their royalties. It is their commodity; it is their resource. They are finite and we want to get our share to benefit all the people who live in our states. And the feds would just simply pay less money to the states. Money saved is money made. But, no, they wanted to go and get control of it, and the states of course became recalcitrant and said, 'We'll raise our royalties'—as they have every right to do.


That is what this is about. It gets back to the point about the budget surplus. How many times did we hear about the 'not negotiable', 'ironclad' budget surplus that we were going to see in the financial year we are in now? Was it two or three hundred times? It will be interesting when we get to Mr Swan's budget come May to hear what his predictions are for this financial year. But, Senator Mason, we know one thing for sure: there will be no surplus. We need this Labor Party government to go to the dictionary and actually see what the word 'surplus' means, because they do not know what a surplus is. During the 13 years of the Hawke-Keating government the Labor government delivered four surpluses, and we have had five years of this government. So 13 and five is 18. After 18 years in government there have been four years of surplus. It has been many, many years—we are probably talking about decades—since we have seen a surplus from a Labor government. So they have probably forgotten what it means. We know they will not deliver one of them.


As far as this tax goes, we argued that it was no good and we argued that it was rushed—have a look at the recommendations that Senator Cormann's select committee handed down—and we stand here in hindsight and say, 'We told you so.' But it came into this chamber, and the Greens—who are very big supporters of guillotining debate in this place and teaming up with the Labor senators to get the numbers—pulled the guillotine down and said: 'Stop debate. Don't have any more discussions; let's just pass it.'


But now it is all wrong. It has all turned to tears, so we will guillotine the debate on this tax, rip it through the Senate and get it into place. Then it all turns to tears when it does not work. But there is one thing worse: the money that has not been raised has been spent. That is the problem. Labor said, 'Yes, we'll give company reductions to small business.' That would be good, but we never saw them. 'We'll put into superannuation to build up the super funds.' No, stripping the money from these big companies, which are owned in some respects by the super funds, is taking money away from every working Australian. That is where they have their money invested to get a return for their super funds.




Senator Mason:
  Shambles.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Shambles is a very good description. The whole thing has turned to tears and like many other things—just look at the government—this whole minerals resource rent tax was not about a fair share for all Australians of the finite resources in the ground. It was about the federal government's budget that was in a state of disarray. Remember when Labor was elected to government the ceiling of the debt was $75 billion. You raised it to $200 billion. Then you raised it to $250 billion. Then last May, in a year in which we were meant to have a budget surplus, you raised it to $300 billion. Why did you need to raise the ceiling debt, the credit card limit for the Australian people, when you are going to have a budget surplus? Because you knew there was not going to be any surplus—and history will prove that correct.


During the Christmas break when we were away from the cameras, Treasurer Swan said, 'It's unlikely it'll look like a surplus now.' Blind Freddy could have told you that there would be no surplus. Get the equation right: the Australian Labor Party in government equals debt—borrowing, debt, waste. It has happened all my life. I can take you back to the states and I am sure my colleague Senator Ronaldson would remember that the Cain-Kirner government in Victoria set that state back by $60 billion of debt, and Premier Kennett was left to clean up the mess. He was asked why he sold the electricity company. He got $19 billion for the sale and every cent went to pay off debt that the Labor Party had built up. Perhaps we should look at Queensland's finances now.




Senator Mason:
  With $80 billion in debt, a shambles.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Running on a par with Ireland, 4½ million people. The sad thing about this is that Queensland was debt-free for decades. I remember when former Prime Minister Bob Hawke called the tax summit when he won in 1983 and one Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen said: 'Why don't you be like Queensland and not run deficits?' They laughed at him—a debt-free state and now it is on the point of bankruptcy. But that is what happens when you have no idea about running business so you simply borrow, spend and waste.



Senator Furner interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It is late in the week and I will not take your interjection, Senator Furner—only for the reason I did not hear it properly.


The most laughable aspect of all this is what Prime Minister Julia Gillard said. This is a big point and it is what the minerals resource rent tax is all about. The Greens have a bill saying we need a bigger cop, but let me quote the Prime Minister for anyone listening:


You can't run this country if you can't manage its budget.


It is a pretty good statement; the words are good. Let us have a look at the reality of what is happening. I reckon at about $10 billion the penny will drop when we get the actuals in September. When we get the actual debt for this financial year in September, because this minerals resource rent tax has only returned $126 million, two things are going to happen. On 14 September we are going to have an election—you beauty, a lot of people say. Two weeks after that we are going to find out the actuals of this year's financials.


I wonder why they plan the election day two weeks before the Treasurer will give the real budget figures of this financial year? A cynic would say it is because there is going to be another big hole; not a big black hole, but a big red hole, a hole of red ink of more borrowings. If all goes well—

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:12):  I rise this afternoon to comment on the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012. This is a very important piece of legislation introduced by the Greens, and it goes to the heart of the question of what sort of nation we want in this century. It goes to the heart of that question because, if you want to make and put in place the kinds of plans and the consequent infrastructure that the country needs, you have to raise the money to be able to do that. The Greens have said for a long time that we need to massively move towards a low-carbon or zero-carbon economy. We would like to see in Australia high-speed rail linking our cities. If you go to Europe or see what is happening in China—Japan did it years ago—it makes eminent sense for this country to move to high-speed rail. If you want to put in place the kind of infrastructure that will anticipate the extreme weather events that global warming is bringing us then you have to have the dollars to be able to do it. Equally, the Greens have secured Denticare, a new capacity to assist people to meet the needs of their dental health, but again it requires funding. My colleague Senator Siewert has been running a strong campaign around the country to get people out of poverty and to make sure that we can allow Newstart to be increased by $50 a week, but the question becomes: where is the money going to come from? The Prime Minister today has announced infrastructure funding to anticipate extreme weather events—with the Warragamba Dam, for example—but $50 million goes nowhere near the kind of infrastructure that is needed. Even $100 million, as she has suggested for the whole nation, goes nowhere near the kinds of changes that need to be made.


Then—the fact is that, in an Asian century, we need to be competitive—we need to lift our education standards. That means a massive investment in education, the arts, innovation and entrepreneurial skills. For that to happen you need to implement the Gonski review, and that requires billions of dollars and should not be back-ended to 2020. Then you have the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I do not think anyone disputes the fact that we need a national disability insurance scheme in this country, and the Greens are the first to agree. But all of these promises are essentially hollow unless there is the money to roll them out. You cannot just put a tiny deposit down in the lead-up to an election and say that somehow you have delivered on these things. You need to raise the money.


That is why Australians should be getting a fair return for the mineral resources which are owned by the people. These mineral resources are not owned by the mining companies; they are owned by the people. And they are, in many cases, non-renewable resources—in fact, in all cases they are non-renewable resources when it comes to ores: you dig them up and ship them away once and that is it. So we need to make sure we are getting a decent return on those.


One of the most grave crimes against future development in the nation occurred in 2006 when the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the then Treasurer, Mr Costello, gave back the huge benefits of the boom at that time by giving tax cuts all around. There were headlines like 'Manna from heaven,' and rivers of gold pouring out all over the nation. That money should have been kept and invested in proofing the country against climate impacts, and, recognising that we are facing peak oil, in building massive public transport infrastructure around the country. There were huge opportunities then to invest the money, but instead it was just thrown out into the community in massive grants to everyone to make everybody feel good, and now we are left with a need for infrastructure—in terms of brains capital and human capital, as well as physical infrastructure—for the country. So the Greens are saying that we should get a fair return from our mineral resources and that the problems with the current minerals resource rent tax need to be fixed.


This bill would amend that tax to correct one of its most egregious flaws, and that is the rebating of any future increases in state royalties, which allows the MRRT revenue to be further eroded by state governments. This flaw gives a blank cheque to state governments. They can lift royalties, knowing that they will effectively be paid by the Commonwealth government rather than by the large mining companies. That is appalling. This bill amends section 60.25 of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Act 2012 to provide that any increase in royalties after 1 July 2011 should be disregarded when calculating royalty credits for the MRRT. It is a first step towards ensuring that the mining sector makes a fair contribution to the society whose assets it consumes in generating its wealth. It is essentially the amendment that the Greens sought to make to the bill in March 2012.


This design flaw has not been criticised just by those on the left. It goes against what the original designer of the mining tax, Dr Ken Henry, advised. It has been criticised by the OECD, by conservative economists such as Henry Ergas, and by Nick Greiner and other members of the GST Distribution Review. It is only in the bill because of the weakness of the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Resources and Energy, when they sat down with the big mining companies and tried to appease them so that they would call off their advertising campaign. Effectively, the miners wrote their own tax, knowing full well they would never pay it.


The wording used in the heads of agreement between the new Gillard government and the big three mining companies said: 'All state and territory royalties will be creditable.' Then, after the 2010 election, the Policy Transition Group, chaired by former BHP chair Don Argus and resources minister Martin Ferguson, was established to sort out the technical details of the MRRT. It recommended that all current and future state and territory royalties on coal and iron ore should be credited, which the government accepted.


Restricting the crediting of royalties to the rates in place at 1 July 2011 would raise an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates. The government has made a mess of the treatment of royalties in the MRRT, and the Australian people are paying. No group is paying more significantly than single parents, who have had their support payments taken away while the mining industry collectively has only paid $126 million. In fact you have Marius Kloppers walking away with $75 million—as a handshake, as his retirement benefit, as his walking-out-the-door ticket—and single parents left without that support payment, and those on Newstart with none of the extra money that they need. Yet BHP is essentially only paying $77 million in the tax—$2 million more than Marius Kloppers walked away with.


The other significant flaw in the MRRT is the ridiculously generous depreciation provisions. The legislation allows companies a choice for determining their asset base for the purposes of depreciation. One of the choices is a market-value approach. This is an extraordinary departure from standard accounting practice and allows companies to claim deductions for costs they have never incurred. Why on earth would the Treasurer, the minister, Martin Ferguson, and the Prime Minister agree to allow the companies to claim deductions for costs that they have never incurred? Market value is not a measure of costs paid out but of the amount the market is prepared to pay for an asset. This benefits the big miners, who have well-established mines now worth a lot more than their initial investment.


I have circulated an amendment to stop this rort and remove this choice so that only the book-value approach can be used. The amendment commences on 1 July 2013, so it affects payment not for this year but for those years into the future. I note that the book-value approach is generous in its own right as it includes an uplift rate. We should not be giving the billion-dollar multinational mining corporations more than that. If passed, the amendment would raise an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates.


Dr Parkinson, the current Treasury Secretary, identified at estimates five factors that determine the revenue raised by the MRRT: commodity prices and volume, the exchange rate, state royalties, the starting cost base against which the mining companies can claim depreciation, and the difference between prices at the mine and at the docks.


In estimating the depreciation costs Dr Parkinson said Treasury had relied on initial estimates from the mining companies which they may well have changed since. In effect he admitted Treasury had developed their assumptions based on conversations with the mining companies before the tax came in, but the mining companies had had the opportunity, once the tax became law, to rethink what their starting base would be. Why on earth would you have given the mining companies the ability to determine how much they would pay and adjust the formulas according to what they wanted?


Former Treasury Secretary Ken Henry, in an appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy in July 2010, admitted that no Treasury officials were directly involved in the negotiations between the government and BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata. I find it extraordinary that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Ferguson thought that they could manage this negotiation without the expertise of Treasury. That is an extraordinary thing. What it will do is put out there into the heartland of people who perhaps thought that if there was one thing that Labor could do it was actually manage the economy—in terms of accounting practices at least—that, when push came to shove, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Ferguson excused the experts and brought in the people who were looking after their own interests absolutely, 100 per cent—Rio, Xstrata and BHP—and allowed them to determine the terms. You can only assume from that that the deal was that the mining industry agreed to a tax that they knew they would never have to pay and that the government would appear to have a win, to have negotiated an outcome, knowing that in fact the outcome would not deliver anything. That is the only conclusion you can reach.


Again, it goes to the heart of the competence of the negotiators in that negotiation. That is why I have been asking: where is the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Martin Ferguson? He has not been seen for months. Whilst the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been out there trying to defend their role in this, the minister whose job it is to look after resources and energy seems to have gone AWOL. If you go to his website, he has not got a single transcript on there from after September last year. I have to ask: where does that go to in terms of transparency, or is the minister hoping that no-one will notice, that the people of Batman will not notice, that he is nowhere to be found in terms of his accountability, and culpability, in relation to this particular disaster?


The Parliamentary Budget Office has costed a revised mining tax with the following reforms: a 40 per cent rate of tax, royalties credited at rates in place at 1 July 2011 and the depreciation starting base restricted to the book value. If you take those three things together, those three improvements, that would raise an additional $26 billion over the forward estimates. I began my speech by saying it is a hollow promise to say you will deliver the Gonski education reforms or the national disability insurance. There is no hope at all for people out there on Newstart if you are not prepared to take on the mining industry to raise the money to be able to fund these critical pieces of social infrastructure which benefit the entire community. We need to be putting money into physical infrastructure—for example, high-speed rail and public transport systems. There is no use standing up in Western Sydney talking about more freeways; what Western Sydney needs is light rail. As the Parramatta City Council and the Greens have been saying, we need to be able to invest in the infrastructure of the future. We need to get people off freeways and into much more efficient public transport systems. Everywhere you look in the world, the competitive cities are the ones that have got rid of congestion, got people onto public transport and made cities more liveable with more green spaces, more pedestrian access, more public transport, more cycleways and fewer freeways. And that is what is necessary in Western Sydney.


But where are we going to get the money to drive this kind of infrastructure if we do not make the mining industry pay their way? The Greens have argued for a long time that we need a sovereign wealth fund and that it should be set up so that you genuinely use the benefits of the boom to accumulate not only the balance of the fund but the interest on the fund in order to invest in the kinds of social and physical infrastructure I am talking about. We need a first-class education system; we need to invest in research and development; we need public transport; we need high-speed rail; we need to get ourselves rapidly moving off the old coal fired generators and into the new energy providers, 100 per cent renewable energy, as quickly as possible. We need these things and that is why you have to raise the money to pay for them.


The Parliamentary Budget Office costed that royalty change in this bill on their own. They determined that it would mean raising an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates from 2012-13 to 2015-16. The PBO costings showed that making the depreciation amendment on its own would have resulted in the MRRT raising an additional $2.2 billion over the forward estimates over that same four-year period. So I would encourage the Senate to support this bill. We have the bill in the Senate and we have now successfully moved for a Senate inquiry into the flaws in this bill. We also need to provide for the opportunity to fix it, to improve it, so that we secure the funding. The Greens have no interest in allowing the mining industry to walk away when 80 per cent of the profit from these big miners go to overseas shareholders. These profits leave the country. We want to make sure that those big mining companies actually pay a fair return on the resources that belong to the people in this country.


Surely it is not too much to ask a parliament to secure those resources.


The only reason we have not secured them is political. When you think about how this happened, you will see it happened as a consequence of Prime Minister Rudd losing the prime ministership over the fact that the mining industry bullied the government of the day by running a massive advertising campaign—a $20 million advertising campaign—that has saved them billions of dollars. They are laughing all the way to the bank. After succeeding in bringing down one Prime Minister, they succeeded in diddling the nation through inept negotiations between the next Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the minister. That is what happened. It was the politics of the day that did the Australian people out of a fair return which would have enabled us to spend on the things the nation needs.


That is where the coalition are disingenuous in this, because the coalition do not want a mining tax at all. They do not want the big miners to pay a fair return to the Australian people for our resources; they are more than happy to have the profits leave the country. The question to the coalition is: where are they going to get the money from to be able to invest in improving Newstart, to be able to invest in high-speed rail, to be able to invest in education, to be able to invest in Gonski reforms and to be able to invest in national disability? That is not to mention the five per cent emission reduction that they say they are committed to, which they do not have the dollars to actually do; nor do they have the dollars to upscale to the level of emission reduction necessary as a to face up to the science of climate change. So we have a coalition who do not want the miners to pay at all and a government who have been inept in negotiating with the miners to the point where they have embraced the interests of the miners at the cost of the people.



The Greens are standing here saying: 'We care about the people of Australia. We care about the environment.' We clearly have a vision for the future: to transition to a low-carbon economy and then a zero-carbon economy, and to have a society in which people are well educated and well cared for, where we have a decent health system and Denticare rolled out and we do not have people absolutely constrained in situations of poverty and homelessness because we say we do not have the money to deal with it. We have the money to deal with it if we have the political courage to take on the big miners. The Greens are prepared to stand up to the big miners. I would urge the rest of the Senate to support the bill. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:32):  Before I address the content of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012 before the Senate, I want to rebut some of the points that Senator Milne just addressed in her contribution to the discussion. She made the point at the outset that budget commitments need to be funded. I must say on behalf of the government that we are in staggering and startling agreement on that point. That is why we participated in negotiations and agreed to the creation of the Parliamentary Budget Office and funded that; that is why we assisted Treasury and Finance to become parties to the protocol, so that the office can carry out its central function on costing issues associated with undertakings made by any and all political parties. With that little bit of rhetorical flourish, let us just say that the government also shares that view.


Senator Milne then went on to develop a point. Because she is an intelligent woman, I presume the point she addressed is one of rhetorical flourish—that somehow or other all of the minerals and, by implication, all of the oil and gas in and around mainland Australia are owned by all of us, by that amorphous mass called 'the people'. I presume she put that as a rhetorical proposition as we are on broadcast. As everyone in this chamber knows, and they learnt this in their first lesson in Constitutional Law I: minerals under the ground are vested in the Crown in right of the state. That has been the case for I do not know how many centuries and it has certainly been the case in this country since European colonisation in the latter part of the 18th century. But, 240 years since that time, as we consider the utility of the proposition I just outlined in rebuttal to Senator Milne, there is considerable sense in minerals under the ground being vested in the Crown in right of the state: it enables the state, at Commonwealth level, territory level or state level, to essentially regulate and control the use of land, whether that is done in an agricultural sense, a mining sense, an extractive sense or whatever. By 'regulate' I mean allowing access, allowing development and having proper regard for environmental considerations, on both the agricultural side and the mining side.


Consider the only sensible opposition to the Crown not having rights with respect to minerals under the ground. By definition, it would go to some other body. Most logically, that other body would be the individual landholder or leaseholder. We know how that system works, because it works in the United States. One only has to look at the huge degree of development with respect to the coal seam gas industry and the shale oil gas industry in the southern states of the United States, where mining companies pay the owner of the land a fee for access to minerals and the like under the soil, and the development goes ahead willy-nilly. There are a range of benefits from that system to individual landholders and to industry from the cheap gas that emerges from that process. That is probably a debate for another day. On balance, the system we have in this country, of the Crown having control of access to land and land use, is probably a better system. There is a terrible sense of deja vu about this debate. We have been having it every year—we had it in 2009, 2010, 2011 and all of last year—and now, as Senator Milne just said, there is further reference to the application of a minerals resource rent tax.


The bill before the chair attempts to amend the MRRT to achieve two purposes, and Senator Milne succinctly outlined them: firstly, that any increase in state royalties after 1 July 2011 be disregarded when calculating the royalty credits for the MRRT; and, secondly, to disallow provisions of the MRRT so that miners can no longer use the market value method to determine their starting base. So the bill before the chair attempts to remove, to negate, to disallow, the two most critical features of the MRRT Act that is currently proclaimed law in this country. If passed, this bill would totally neuter, make useless, the purpose and intent of the existing MRRT.


When one thinks about that ambition it cannot be described as small. It is no mean purpose that is sought to be achieved in this debate late on Thursday afternoon. But before we can properly discuss the bill before the chair a little bit of a history lesson in the development of the MRRT over the last three or four years would be useful. What does that little bit of history show us? It shows the following. First, the current MRRT Act was one of 11 bills discussed and passed in this chamber on 19 March 2012—almost 12 months ago. That package of bills—there were 10 or 11 bills—addressed a range of matters at that time: an overview of the position of the positive impact of the mining industry; how the MRRT was intended to operate; the revenue forecasts associated with the MRRT; a range of ways in which Australians might share from the benefits of the MRRT; and other tax conveniently avoided up this end but paid in large numbers by firms in the mining industry.


But there were a range of other matters before the chair that day. One went to increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Some of us might have liked to have gone from nine per cent to 15 per cent in one fell hit, bringing it forward in bites of one per cent a year every year for six years until it reached 15 per cent. There was removal of superannuation age limits. There were benefits in low-income superannuation contributions. There was simplification of asset depreciation arrangements. There was the introduction of accelerated initial deductions for the purchase of motor vehicles by small business. And there were a range of other benefits to sectional interests in our community.


So the MRRT Bill, now the MRRT Act, was not the only matter that was up for discussion back in March 2012; it was one bill as part of a total package of 11 or 12 that were discussed at the same time. Those measures affected the mining industry, the offshore petroleum industry, small business, superannuation beneficiaries and those who enjoy depreciation arrangements for capital investment. When the MRRT package of bills was put up for a vote, the Greens and the current government combined 38 to 32 to support that package, including the MRRT, without amendment. The only parties to oppose it were the opposition over there.


Right from day one Labor government and the Greens brought forward a package of bills. Both parties voted for it, there were no amendments, it went to a division and it was carried 38 to 32. What does that mean? It is very simple: the Greens in the bill currently before the chair seek to negate what less than 12 months ago they stood and voted for, stood and supported, stood and endorsed.




Senator Williams:
  Guillotined as well.




Senator MARK BISHOP:
  Guillotined as well. Maybe we did guillotine it. That is what happens when you have the numbers. Thirty-nine is more than 37. Welcome to the real world. I do not know if it was guillotined. If it wasn't, it should have been. The point was this: we did not have 39 votes in our own right; we wandered down to the end of the chamber. They said, 'Yeah, that's a good package of propositions in there,' about the capital investment, the superannuation improvements, the bringing forward of write-offs for small business for motor vehicle purchases, the improvements in the petroleum rent resource tax and the imposition of the MRRT. They said, 'Gee, we don't like bits and pieces here.' We responded, 'Hey, we also don't like bits and pieces.' As I said at the outset, some of us would have liked to increase superannuation not to 12 per cent over eight or nine years but to 15 per cent over five or six years. But in the negotiation process the eventual outcome was that what was put in this chamber, and the Greens and the government had full knowledge of its content and supported that package.


So it is a bit rich now, barely 12 months after the ink is dry, and after a little bit of adverse evidence from the Secretary of the Treasury a couple of weeks ago in estimates outlining what everyone in the world knew about the design of the MRRT, to use that as an excuse to come back in here and essentially renege on an agreement fully entered into, fully supported, on the basis of—what?—full information. It doesn't get any better than that. The blind, deaf, dumb and ignorant might have a reason to go back on their word. But when you have participated in all the negotiations, sat through all the committees, sat through the debate here, agreed to a particular outcome and voted for the outcome, you do not get to come back 11 months later and say, 'Hey, we don't like that; we want to do something else.'


The inquiry into the bill before the chair, conducted by the Economics Legislation Committee and tabled earlier this month, addresses that point exactly in paragraph 1.12. It says:


Following negotiations with the mining industry and the deliberations of the Policy Transition Group (PTG), which was established to advise on the implementation and technical design elements of the MRRT, the government agreed to the PTG's recommendation 'that there be full crediting of all current and future State and Territory royalties under the MRRT so as to provide certainty about the overall tax impost on the coal and iron ore mining industries.


That statement was released under the authority of Mr Swan and Mr Ferguson on 24 March 2011. Everyone knew what was going on. The government had accepted the recommendations of the Policy Transition Group and had put out a press release in writing to that effect, and everyone in the government and everyone in the Greens knew that.


The time sequence in this discussion is clear, and for the last four years the Greens have been fully aware, fully consulted and, to a very, very significant extent, involved in a lot of discussions. In December 2010 there was the report of the Policy Transition Group. In March 2011 there was government acceptance of that recommendation that I just read out. In March 2012 there was an inquiry into the then MRRT Bill, and on 19 March, barely a fortnight after the recommendations of that bill inquiry came down, the Greens voted for the two measures that were at the heart of the then bill, now act, and are at the heart of the bill they bring before the chair today to renege on. You cannot do business like that.


Turning now to the bill before the chair, chapter 2 of the Senate Economics Committee report is instructive, and it deserves to be put more fully on the public record. It outlines the process of inquiry into this bill. It is only a very brief report. It is only in two chapters, no more than 10 pages. The inquiry was conducted from November 2012 until February 2013: November, December, January, February. It went for almost four months, knocking off a month for January, of course. There was one significant extension of time granted by the committee at the request of the Greens, presumably to get more submissions into the inquiry so we could have a fuller discussion at the appropriate time.


In that four-month period, do you know how many submissions that committee inquiry into the bill before the chair received? It received only six submissions. There were four months of examination and four months of writing to interested parties. The database in the economics committee of interested players in this debate, as you can imagine, goes to hundreds and hundreds of individuals, groups and associations, and only six put in a written comment. Of those six, a full five opposed the passage of the bill before the chair. So after a four-month inquiry, an extension granted at the request of the Greens, six submissions were received. Of those, five opposed the bill, and only one supported the bill before the chair. The committee, in its wisdom—it must be said—decided not to hold a public inquiry on the basis of only six submitters, five of which opposed the bill. We did the report on the papers, and it is before us today.


But what can one conclude from a bill inquiry on a subject which is apparently of great public notoriety when hundreds and hundreds of individuals, groups, associations, companies, governments and the like are invited to put in a submission that essentially goes to a reworking of the MRRT Act? What conclusion can we draw? The conclusion we can draw is that there is just about no interest in this country in revisiting the design features of the MRRT. You would have thought they would have been lined up in their thousands, seeking to come in and say how onerous it is, how heavy it is, how inefficient it is, how bad it is, how whatever it is. You would have thought that the churches would be organised, along with some of the community groups and some of the NGOs. But, no, there was a wailing silence between November and February, because nobody—I beg your pardon, I mislead the chair—rather, one person in Australia took the trouble to write a submission supporting the bill before the chair. Nobody else cared. Nobody else wrote. Talk about Orphan Annie!


I have never been in a bill inquiry, in all the time I have been here—and I have been in inquiries on a whole range of matters—where there were only six submissions, with five opposed to the content of the bill and only one supporting it. Think back over the years. How many contentious pieces of legislation did we handle in opposition and have been part of government policy for the last five years? How many inquiries have people in this chamber participated in, written reports on and given speeches about? I, for the life of me, cannot recall one where there was only one submission in favour of the bill.


Perhaps I have drawn the wrong conclusion on that; perhaps there is a great deal of interest out there in this proposition. We are going to find out because, in addition to all of those matters that I outlined in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013—legislation inquiries, the Policy Transition Group, the pre-existing bill under Mr Rudd, the reform bill under Ms Gillard and the numerous inquiries—less than an hour ago, the Senate Economics References Committee accepted another reference to inquire into the MRRT. It seems to me that the norm is now that you get about 17 bites at the cherry. We dress up the conclusion, in terms of the argument about wanting to have money to spend on Gonski, or disability— (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2013-02-28,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:52):  If Senator Milne's speech at the National Press Club was in effect the decree nisi for the political union between the Greens and the Australian Labor Party then the decision to debate the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012 at this time represents the decree absolute. Senator Bishop in effect gave expression to that here today. But the thing that confuses me greatly is why this political marriage between the Greens and the Australian Labor Party happened in the first place. I am certain it is something that confounds Senator Bishop as well—as one of the clearer-thinking members of this chamber. He is turning red, as I know he often does when I speak.


What also confuses me is that, when the Prime Minister assumed that office, one of the three policy areas that she said she would fix was the situation around the mining tax. The Prime Minister went to the election. Subsequent to the election, with the support of the Australian Greens, she formed government. Subsequent to that the Prime Minister had that now famous civil union ceremony with former Senator Brown where all the participants and witnesses were sporting sprigs of wattle in a festive spirit. At the time that the Australian Greens entered that union with the Labor Party, the Prime Minister's intentions were known in relation to the future of the minerals resource rent tax. At the time that the legislation went through the parliament, the union between the government and the Greens was formalised and the Greens had access to full and comprehensive briefings from their alliance partners on this legislation. So the Greens came into this chamber to support the MRRT legislation with their eyes wide open. It was with complete knowledge that they entered this arrangement—certainly more knowledge than the opposition had as to the background of the negotiations behind this legislation. The Australian Greens are in effect co-authors of the MRRT legislation. I think Senator Bishop was quite right to express his surprise that a little more than a year after the legislation passed this place the Greens are now walking away from their own creation. I wanted to give a little background as to the confusion that I have as I stand here today.


Our proposition has always been that the minerals resource rent tax is a bad tax. It has always been that it came out of it an improper process, it came out of a bad process and it came out of the process that the Greens fully, completely supported. Labor's mining tax, we have long contended, is so inefficient, so distorting and so bad for investment in a very important industry for Australia, so bad for our economy and so bad for the budget that it should be scrapped and not further expanded. The bill before us would make a bad tax even worse.


The coalition, not surprisingly, emphatically rejects this bill—for different reasons to the government, obviously. But we do call upon the Senate to oppose this legislation in anticipation of a bill after the next election—should the Australian public bestow the privilege of government on the coalition. After the election we would scrap the MRRT altogether.


The basic premise that this Greens bill is based on is fundamentally flawed. The bill seeks to disregard any increases in royalties after 1 July 2011 when calculating royalty credits for the MRRT. This is of course inconsistent with the commitment the Prime Minister and the Treasurer made in the mining tax deal that they negotiated personally, exclusively and in secret with the three biggest miners, when they promised that all state royalties would be creditable against the mining tax. Despite attempts by the government to revisit the definition of 'all' in relation to state royalties, even Ms Gillard and Mr Swan had to recognise that 'all' meant all and that 'all' included any future increases in state royalties.


It is, of course, not particularly competent that Ms Gillard and Mr Swan signed up to such a commitment without engaging the states and territories first and without seeking their formal agreement in relation to the royalty arrangements. This is not the fault of the states, it is not the fault of the territories and it is not the fault of the miners. Royalty arrangements are a matter for the states. There is nothing the Prime Minister and the Treasurer can do to stop the states from increasing their royalties as they see fit. In fact, their mining tax deal provided a direct incentive to state and territory governments to increase their royalties. The idea advanced by sections of the Labor Party and the Greens that state royalty crediting arrangements and market based depreciation arrangements are actually loopholes in the MRRT is completely wrong. To present these as loopholes is more than wrong; it is dishonest.


These are not loopholes; they are deliberate design features of the MRRT. They are the government's design features and the Australian Greens supported them in this place.


There is much that is wrong with the mining tax deal that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer negotiated, exclusively and in secret, with the three biggest miners. It is important to consider how this all started. Why is it that the royalties are credited under Labor's mining tax in the first place? Even though Labor's mining tax was never anything other than an attempt at a grab for more cash to support the reckless spending of this government, it was sold as important long-term reform designed to make the system simpler, fairer and more efficient. Instead, it made resource taxation arrangements more complex, less fair, more distorting and less efficient. The Henry tax review recommended that a national profit based resource rent tax would replace state and territory royalties. The argument was that royalties were inefficient because they were imposed on production irrespective of profits, whereas a profits based tax would only apply if there were profits.


The problem was that, for a number of states, royalties represented a significant part of their own source of revenue. Yet the Treasurer, whose deficits, I should add, are more than fiscal, never even talked to the states about the implications of the mining tax for them. Instead of replacing royalties, Ms Gillard and Mr Swan came up with complicated crediting arrangements. As soon as they promised to credit all state and territory royalties, they provided an incentive to states and territories to increase their royalties, as any increase in royalties would be creditable against the MRRT. In fact, the MRRT deal removed any incentive for states to keep royalty rates low or provide discounts to attract investment to their states, as part of competitive federalism, because any benefit from discounted royalty rates would go to Canberra through increased MRRT revenue and not actually help attract investment to particular states.


So the entirely rational and predictable result was that five out of six states, including the Labor states of Tasmania and South Australia, have increased royalties on iron ore or coal since the mining tax deal was signed by Ms Gillard and Mr Swan. Every increase in royalties since the deal was signed did, of course, blow a hole in Labor's mining tax revenue estimates, as any increase in royalties courtesy of the deal reduced MRRT revenue.


Labor's mining tax is more complex, distorting, inefficient, costly to administer and costly to comply with than the previous resource taxation arrangements based on state royalties and company tax. The MRRT is a failed tax which came out of a bad and now widely discredited process. The MRRT should be scrapped; it should not be expanded. It is a distorting, inefficient tax grab which inappropriately targets an important industry. As I have said already, it is bad for investment and bad for the economy.


Two previous Senate inquiries into the mining tax have clearly exposed the many deep flaws of Labor's mining tax. Those inquiries predicted the mess that would ultimately result and the fiscal train wreck that it would be. Ironically, as we debate the bill, the Greens have established an inquiry to look at the flaws in the tax which they helped to pass and which they are now trying to make even more economically destructive. The Greens' supposed fix to the MRRT is a grab for more tax by punishing states for the flaws in the Gillard-Swan mining tax design. I repeat: the MRRT is a bad tax because it is bad for investment, bad for the economy and bad for the budget.


It is a complex and distorting tax—I cannot say that often enough. It is designed in a way that favours the bigger miners, who were given the opportunity to sit around the table, at the expense of the smaller miners, who we would want to be the success stories of tomorrow. It has failed to raise any meaningful revenue, when the government have already spent all of the money they thought it would raise and more. When the MRRT deal was announced on 2 July 2010 by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, they said it would raise $4 billion in year one and $22.5 billion over the first four years. In the 2012-13 budget, that shrank to $3 billion in year 1 and $13.4 billion over the first four years. In the most recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, it then shrank to $2 billion in year 1 and $9.1 billion over the first four years. Those were net revenue estimates—that is, they took the company tax effect into account. Given the MRRT is a tax deduction for company tax purposes, 30 per cent of whatever gross revenue came from the MRRT would have been collected anyway.


We now know that the MRRT raised only $126 million in gross revenue in the first two of three instalments for 2012-13. Once we take the company tax effect into account, that becomes a $88 million net revenue figure, which is comparable to the budget estimates. Once we take the $53 million in ATO administration costs for the MRRT into account, that becomes $35 million. Once we take the $38.5 million the government allocated to the RSPT advertising campaign into account, the taxpayer is actually $3.5 million short from the MRRT.


The premise of the MRRT was false from the start. The proposition that the mining industry does not pay its fair share of tax is false. This financial year, iron ore and coal miners will pay more than $8 billion in state royalties alone. They will pay more than $20 billion in royalties and company taxes.


The previous system worked: the more profitable a company, the more tax they would pay; the more valuable the non-renewable resource, the more royalties they would pay under the ad valorem royalty system. Labor's profit based resource rent tax concept is flawed, because the practical consequence of it is that, without profit, miners could extract the valuable non-renewable resources from the ground for nothing—and that is wrong.


Ms Gillard and Mr Swan's handling of the mining tax negotiations was incompetent. They never knew what the cost of the market-value based appreciation arrangements were when they signed the deal, and they still do not know what the cost is. If you are going to have a mining tax—which we do not think you should—then to be internally consistent you would have that feature of the mining tax deal. But a competent government would have had it properly costed before spending the revenue the MRRT would raise. Incredibly, when it came to costing the impact of some of the key features of their mining tax deal on mining tax revenue estimates, they forced Treasury to fly without vision. As the Treasury secretary, Dr Parkinson, made clear in Senate estimates, they were unable to consider the cost impacts of changes in market-value based appreciation and net-back arrangements because they could not see them. These and other matters do deserve scrutiny and report from a further Senate mining tax inquiry because the government have consistently hidden the truth behind the numbers.


The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have persisted with their dishonest talking points, blaming commodity price volatility, exchange rates and state royalty increases as the reasons why revenue from the MRRT came in more than 90 per cent below forecast. Those assertions were comprehensively discredited by Dr Parkinson at Senate estimates. Dr Parkinson made clear that Treasury were able to take commodity price volatility, changes in volumes and in exchange rates, and increases in royalties, into account when revising their MRRT revenue estimates. That is why estimated MRRT revenue went from $4 billion in 2012-13, when the MRRT deal was announced, to $3 billion in the last budget and to $2 billion in the last MYEFO—they could not take the change in cost of the value-market based depreciation arrangements and net-back arrangements into account. Yet, despite that very clear, compelling and independent evidence, the Treasurer continues to peddle his spin on what is to blame for lower-than-predicted mining tax revenue collections.


The other lie is that the people cannot possibly complain about the damage the mining tax has done to the important mining industry because, after all, they did not have to pay much tax. That is false. The mining tax was very much disruptive at a challenging time for an important industry, an industry that helped keep Australia going post-GFC. The tax is complex and costly to administer. Smaller miners alone had to spend more than $20 million in administering increased red-tape requirements under the MRRT while the ATO spent more than $50 million administering the tax.


The bad tax, the tax that was improperly negotiated, has had a detrimental effect on our sovereign risk profile as an investment destination. And, of course, the tax has hardly raised any revenue, when all the money the government thought it would raise—and more—has been spent. That is why we are now dealing with this bill. And for so long as this ineffective MRRT is on our statute books there will be other bills to try to expand the MRRT in one way or another, I am sure.


The MRRT is, as I have said, a bad tax because of the way it was negotiated. The MRRT is a bad tax, as I have said, because of the way that it was designed. The MRRT is a bad tax because it is a red-tape nightmare. And the mining tax is a bad tax because it is a dagger at the heart of Australia's mining prosperity. It introduces a new tax on an important industry on top of existing royalty and income tax arrangements, and that makes our tax system more complex and less fair. It reduces our international competitiveness as an attractive investment destination. It gives an unfair competitive advantage to three big multinational, multi-commodity and multi-project companies, who were given the exclusive opportunity by the government to negotiate the design of this new tax, with all their competitors and other stakeholders locked out.


We need to make sure that our mining industry continues to prosper, that high-paid mining jobs are preserved. The government's poorly designed MRRT will not be fixed by trying to penalise the states to benefit the Commonwealth. The mining industry pays the states for extracting the resource and pays the Commonwealth through company tax. The Greens bill reveals them, and by association the government, for what they really are: desperate for cash from an industry that they have always hated.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-02-28,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:12):  It was worth sitting through that speech just to get to that last bit, Senator Fifield—because that really exposed you. You started with confusion, which I will try and assist you with—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—and you concluded with ignorance, which I am afraid I cannot help you with much at all.


We will start with the confusion, however, because it is a fair question: since Labor senators have looked to us, as Senator Bishop did, and coalition senators did as well, and you passed this tax—so then, in indication to the crossbenchers, how can you now come back and want to review it? I will help with that confusion. Our options in this place, as the crossbenchers, when a bill is brought forward by either of the major parties, are twofold—and we need to choose. This place does not always tolerate ambiguity: when it comes to a vote you need to pick one side of the chamber or the other to sit on. Our options in the instance of the MRRT were twofold: the ALP, the government, on the one hand—a major party that for a brief period of time chose an evidence based approach—set a task before the Treasury secretary and then adopted it, more or less as proposed, after a long process of review and design, such that the extraordinary profits being raked off by the resources sector could be, without any kind of structural damage either to the economy at large or to those individual companies, once the profits got to a certain level, redirected and redeployed through a super-profits tax. This would not be the first jurisdiction in the world, you would be aware, where this has been tried.


Following that initiative by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, there was a $22 million public relations onslaught, which I think unbalanced the government and caught them somewhat by surprise. Because of some of the rhetoric we heard a moment ago from Senator Fifield, you would be aware that the Greens are used to the kind of invective being directed at us by people like Senator Fifield, who effectively just read in a bunch of press statements from the Minerals Council of Australia, and not particularly original work. You do appear to have stolen Mitch Hooke's homework there, Senator Fifield, because there was not an original word spoken.




Senator Fifield:
  I thought I was quite gentle about you.




Senator Mason:
  More gentle than I would have been, Senator Ludlam.




Senator LUDLAM:
  You will get your chance, Senator Mason. You will get your opportunity. In all honesty I do not think the government was actually prepared for the brutal and dishonest campaign by the mining industry. They passed the hat around and collected $22 million and did you over, and it was an ugly thing to watch. I can recall the television ads that ran. It evidently destabilised the ALP to the degree that it cost Kevin Rudd the prime ministership of the country. We have not seen that kind of thing in modern political history before.




Senator Williams:
  He had lost his way.




Senator LUDLAM:
  A good government that had lost its way, to paraphrase you there, Senator Williams.




Senator Williams:
  The Prime Minister—




Senator LUDLAM:
  That is correct. It was in the aftermath of a really vicious and personal advertising campaign that effectively repeated most of the themes we just heard from Senator Fifield, from whom he pinches his homework. That is what we faced on one side. That was part of our choices. That internal destabilisation then cost a Prime Minister his job. What happened then is that it appears the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, delegating to Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson—the inside man—who handed a pen to the mining sector with which to write their own tax law. And what do you know? What came out of that process was something that was highly permissive and effectively geared towards a form of legalised—



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  I promise I will get to that Senator Fifield. I promise I will allay your confusion. I can see you struggling with it. I will get there. Here is where I can help to resolve Senator Fifield's confusion. Our other choice is to sit on the other side of the chamber when a bill such as that is put to the vote—notwithstanding the amendments we did move, which I will get to in a moment—where there is the Abbott opposition, a political party that does not have the courage to take on the mining industry at all.




Senator Fifield:
  So it is our fault.




Senator LUDLAM:
  We have a choice between a flawed tax, which we can try to amend through the process available to us, or no tax at all. Senator Fifield, I must have allayed your confusion, because you are on your way.




Senator Fifield:
  It is all so clear.




Senator LUDLAM:
  It is all so clear now. Total capitulation. A policy that has rolled over on its back and is waving its legs in the air that somehow, Mr Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has the political gift to turn into a show of strength. Complete and utter capitulation to the mining industry has somehow been able to be portrayed as tough and fearless leadership and as sticking up for ordinary people. There is real political genius at work there. It is fundamentally dishonest and nasty, but it is very clever.


So these are the choices we face on the crossbenches: a flawed tax or none at all. I can remember this very well because I participated in the debate. The amendments that the Greens moved both at the second reading and at the committee stage were shot down—what do you know?—by the combined numbers of the government and the opposition. That then leaves us with a stark choice at the end of the debate: vote for a tax we know is flawed or vote for no tax at all. So when Senator Fifield reminds us that the tax picked up no more than $126 million in gross revenue in the first two quarters of its operation, that is $126 million better than nothing, because that is the opposition's counterproposal.


The amendments we put at the time were voted down by the major parties on the basis that the Labor Party figured that was the best they were going to get, and the opposition will vote against anything that appears to try to redeploy some of these extraordinary profits back into the public good. We can try again, for example, with the bill we have brought to the chamber tonight, or we can try again through future inquiries, such as the one that Senator Milne, with the concurrence of Senator Cormann, has just initiated. Senator Cormann's motives are very clear. He has not tried to hide them. He wants to destroy the tax. He wants to pull it completely to pieces. At least that is transparent. Our motives are that we will use the mechanisms available to us in this chamber, as is one of our primary roles, to improve the legislation and to bring amendments forward to fix it. That is the purpose of this inquiry and I am very glad it is occurring.


So there are opportunities to fix the mistakes that are made. I will remind senators that the mistakes have been out in the open for all to see. It was a pretty blunt instrument that Minister Ferguson enabled for the mining industry and effectively handed to the big three. We had people with very detailed inside knowledge of the mining industry, people like AMEC, who represent the juniors and the mid-tiers in Western Australia, telling us, 'We are going to get done over in this process. You have given this to the big three to handle in their own interests, and here is what is going to happen.' They spelt it out in detail that even Treasury officials were unable to validate. They said, 'We are going to need to wait to see the figures, for example, on the way that the depreciation provisions are written into the bill.' Treasury would not touch it at the time. They said, 'We are going to need to see industry's numbers.' On the afternoon of the inquiry that Senator Bob Brown and I attended, AMEC spelt out for us exactly what was going to happen.


Professor Henry Ergas is not somebody I tend to quote at great length in this chamber. But he does appear from time to time and offers the benefit of his views on these sorts of matters. He is opposed to the super-profits tax and opposed to the MRRT. Nonetheless he is well aware of how these things would be gained. He spelt it out for the committee and it was quite an enlightening session. He has quite detailed knowledge of the way our tax law works and the way that the targets of taxation can try to wriggle around and sleaze their way out of paying the tax. At the session—it must have been the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, on 21 February 2012—he said:


When you impose a significant tax you are always going to provide incentive for people to minimise the tax that they pay.


It is not necessarily illegal; it is just what happens.


One of the ways in which they are going to do that is to try to shift income out of the taxed pool into the untaxed pool. To that extent, yes, this tax does invite that.


I put to him a question about whether the complexity of the tax and the fact that the miners got to write it open it up to being abused. He essentially agreed in principle. I asked him then, 'What are the vulnerabilities?' As a professor of economics, he was reasonably well placed to answer the question. If he was going to game it and try to write his way out of having to pay any tax under this thing—if he was working for the companies who got to draft the bill—how would he do that? How would he shift income, as he put it, out of the tax pool and into the untaxed pool? Here is what he told us:


In all fairness I have not devoted all that much time to that. But I think the issues that will arise, even under the tax as it is currently proposed, will include timing issues, revenue recognition issues and particularly cost allocation issues; what the allowed rate of return on the downstream assets should be; how that allowed rate of return should be allocated; what the relevant asset base downstream is; and at what pace those downstream assets should be depreciated. All of those issues will doubtless arise in respect of this tax.


There you go, colleagues. I am very happy to agree on this occasion with Professor Henry Ergas, who forecast exactly what it was that the miners were going to do with the tax law that they were allowed to draft by resources and energy minister Martin Ferguson, on behalf of an Australian government, desperate and bruised as it was at that time by the assault of the mining industry on television and in the newspapers through both paid and unpaid coverage of their advocacy. It looked as though new Prime Minister Gillard just wanted the pain threshold turned down—just wanted the temperature turned down—and the assault to stop. And they gave the mining companies the pen.


It is not our role to be apologists for those who did the deal or for those on the other side of the chamber who oppose any deal being done at all. It is our job to recognise the mistakes that have been made and to correct them in the public interest. As Senator Milne said a short time ago, we should not come in here saying that we need to rip money off single parents, we need to delay the introduction of a disability insurance scheme, we cannot afford the rollout of large-scale renewable energy in Australia, we cannot afford the provision of decent public transport, we cannot afford to look after the environment or we need to set aside any of the many priorities that assail us across this country. We have the means to raise the revenue; we know that we do.


The beauty of a profits tax on an industry that does provide a substantial revenue base—and it certainly does in my home state of Western Australia—is that the tax does not kick in until you are doing extraordinarily well. That is the purpose of it. It is not a royalty receipt based on the tonnage that comes out of the ground. It only cuts in when you are doing very well. All the hysterical frothy hyperbole from those on other side of the chamber about how it is designed to assassinate the goose that lays the golden egg are basically them simply reading in statements from the big end of town, which is doing everything it can within the law—which they get to write—to avoid paying tax. It is a game that is probably as old as the concept of tax. It is not good enough for us to stand in here and pretend that there is nothing that we can do about it. As legislators, it is our job to do something about it. We in the Australian Greens take that job very seriously indeed.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:25):  I speak in opposition to the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Amendment (Protecting Revenue) Bill 2012. One thing that we can never be certain of is the future. All good governments and businesses prepare budgets about proposed allocations of funding based on revenue sources. But neither the business community nor governments throughout the world can ever be certain of the outcomes in relation to those budgets. When we came to government in 2007, the international economy was flying high. There was an asset boom and particularly a housing boom, not only in Australia but throughout the world. The Australian economy had undergone about 20 consecutive years of growth.


But then the global financial crisis hit, and it hit hard. It affected governments and businesses throughout the world. As a result of the global financial crisis and in particular the effects on businesses and their revenue streams, businesses changed their budget positions. They changed the way that they were investing their funds to deal with those changed circumstances. Governments were no different. Good governments change budget allocations based on revenues received. In the wake of the global financial crisis, this Labor government proved itself to be quite adept at meeting the challenges of falling revenues—revenues that have fallen to the tune of $160 billion since the global financial crisis—finding the money to allocate to programs and, importantly, to continue to grow our economy.


It is in this context that I believe that this bill before the Senate this evening is short-sighted and politically motivated. It is scant on detail and modelled effects and facts. It fails to recognise that the current provisions of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax were developed as a result of a comprehensive review of our taxation system undertaken by Mr Ken Henry. It also fails to recognise that the details of this tax have been extensively negotiated after consultation with participants in the mining industry and the wider Australian public. It is a profits based tax. There will be years in which profit levels in the mining industry will not be the same as in previous years. By its nature, the revenue generated by this tax will fall and rise depending on the profitability of those companies that are subject to its provisions.


The tax has only been in existence for six months—not even one fiscal year. It is way too premature to be sounding the death knell of this particular tax. We need to take a long-term view of the way that this particular tax should work. There are issues associated with it, and the government is aware of them. But we are, as good governments should, consulting with industry participants to work through those issues. In particular, we want to work through those issues using a cooperative federalism model through the COAG process.


The Henry tax review looked at the issue of resource taxes. It determined that Australia needed a form of resource rent tax and found that such a tax would provide a more consistent treatment of resource projects and promote more efficient investment and production outcomes. Such a tax would also ensure that the Australian community received an appropriate return for its non-renewable resources. Australia has an abundant wealth of non-renewable resources, which are expected to continue to command high prices, driven by demand, particularly in China and India. Non-renewable resources such as petroleum and minerals are a significant asset of the Australian community. Australia has the world's largest economically demonstrated resource reserves of brown coal, lead, mineral sands, nickel, silver, uranium and zinc and the second-largest reserves of bauxite, copper, gold and iron ore.


The charging arrangements prior to the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax distorted investment and production decisions, thereby lowering the community's return from these resources. Further, the pre-MRRT taxation arrangements failed to collect a sufficient return for the community, because those royalties were unresponsive to changes in profits, particularly given that they were based on an output calculation method. For example, the taxes as they existed prior to the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax, and the royalties, claimed a declining share of the return to resources over recent years, despite the increased profitability of the resources sector. In the years 2001 to 2002, about $50 billion was collected. That had fallen, pre-MRRT, down to below to $20 billion. That reflects the decreasing nature of the return that Australians were getting from the profits that were increasing in that particular industry.


So, in the wake of the Henry tax review, the government consulted with the industry. And, importantly, we got an outcome; we reached an agreement to levy a tax that was much more efficient than the royalties system and met the needs and requirements of the future, in particular, when it came to raising sufficient returns from non-renewable resources.


There has been much commentary on the royalties refund and the fact that the states have increased their royalties in the wake of the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax. I want to concentrate on that fact for a moment. Those opposite have been claiming for some years now that the introduction of this tax would kill the goose that laid the golden egg, that the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax would put the brakes on the mining sector, would be a job destroyer. Yet, at the same time, Liberal and National Party governments in the various states were jacking up their royalties on these minerals in a much greater capacity and to a much greater degree than the minerals resource rent tax. So, on one hand you have the opposition criticising the minerals resource rent tax—a much more efficient tax—and on the other you have state governments pushing up their royalties. That is the weakness in the opposition's argument when it comes to this issue.


Despite that fact, the issue of royalties refunds and the approach of the states is an issue. The government is aware of this, and we are dealing with it, as all good governments should. Through the Policy Transition Group, the GST distribution process and the review, we have been working with the states to try to iron out these problems. In December last year the Treasurer and the state Treasurers agreed to refer this issue to the Heads of Treasuries process to work on a negotiated outcome. That is the way we should be approaching this. That is the way we should be approaching difficulties between state and federal governments when it comes to raising revenue in this country. Cooperative federalism is the way we should be dealing with the sufficiency of our revenue base to fund the services and infrastructure that our country dearly needs, and those discussions are underway.


The Greens are well aware that this process is being undertaken, yet they have introduced this bill in ignorance of that process—and way too prematurely; we still need to work out the outcomes of this process. They have also sought to amend the starting base for the purposes of calculation for some of the coverage that companies get with the minerals resource rent tax. Under the MRRT, miners get a one-off allowance to recognise the value of their existing assets as at 2 May 2010. Rio Tinto and BHP reported that the value of this allowance is around $1.7 billion in their financial statements in August, several months ago. It is important to note that this allowance is written off over the life of a mine and its assets; it is not on an annual basis. So, this reflects a one-off tax shield against minerals resource rent tax liabilities for up to the next 25 years.


The petroleum resource rent tax, for which a similar structure exists, has been in operation for 25 years and has raised about $28 billion. So it is way too premature to be sounding the death knell of this particular tax. It is much more effective and sensible to look at this as a long-term reform. It is really a reform aimed at delivering a fair return on non-renewable resources to our children and our grandchildren. And it will do that, because we have a strong pipeline of investment in the mining and minerals sector in this country.


I have spoken on many occasions to mining representatives in New South Wales, to those companies that are mining in the Hunter Valley and down around Wollongong, and their views of the long-term prospects of the industry are quite interesting and instructive. They have certainly been considered by the government in the development of this particular tax.


What they say is that there will be peaks and troughs, but the long-term prospect for this industry is growth based on the development of China and India. There will be peaks and troughs but the long-term outcome will be growth. And that is reflected in the companies' investment figures. It is reflected in the figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding mining investment in this country and into the future: $109 billion invested in mining in 2012-13—three times more than was invested prior to the minerals resource rent tax being announced by the government. It was $35 billion, in 2009-10.


Those opposite, again out of touch with reality, have been proclaiming the death knell of the resources sector in this country because of the introduction of this tax but the mining companies are laughing at them and saying, 'You're on your own with that argument—you're way out there with that—because we're going to invest three times the amount that we have invested in the past, prior to the introduction of this particular tax.' So the miners themselves and the people who put their money where their mouths are—the companies and the mums and dads who are investing in this industry—know the value of these assets. They know the value of what we are digging up, and which we can only dig up once. That is why the approach of the opposition, and indeed the Greens, on this is out of touch. Good policy analysis and a good approach is to adopt a long-term view of this particular tax and its benefits for the country.


The minerals resource rent tax is raising revenue. It is raising revenue to fund the programs that the government said it would fund. There is no doubt that collections raised through the tax have been impacted by the fall in commodity prices. The price of iron ore per tonne prior to the introduction of the tax was up around $160 a tonne. Over the last 12 months we have seen a dramatic decrease in the value of the spot price. It got down to around $80 a tonne at some point late last year. Thankfully, it has risen again. As I said earlier, this is a profits based tax, and miners' profits will rise and fall depending, importantly, upon the price that they can secure in the market for that particular commodity. But in that respect it is a much more efficient tax than a royalties based system. A royalties based, output calculated tax, is applied regardless of whether the commodity price is good, regardless of the level of investment; it is purely based on the output. When the price turns down and profits are reduced, miners will still pay the royalties—a much more inefficient system. So it is much more efficient to have a profits based tax in this industry. It is similar to the situation that we have had with the petroleum resource rent tax. As I said earlier, that particular tax has raised $28 billion since its inception.


Based on all of this I think the Greens and those opposite really need to have a Bex and good lie down, and calm down. This is a long-term economic prospect for our nation. We need to adopt a long-term view. As I said earlier, it is about the next generation and future generations of Australians getting an adequate return from these non-renewable resources.


The price of iron ore and coal will fluctuate. It will go up and down and the profits associated with this tax will go up and down, but over the long term—as the miners have said to me on several occasions—the forecast is for growth. As there is growth there will be returns from this particular tax for the taxpayers of Australia and the returns will fund programs that we envisaged they would fund when we developed this tax. The returns from this tax are reflected in the fact that there has been a massive downturn in government revenues—$160 billion since the global financial crisis—but this government has a strong record of finding the necessary savings to ensure that we can continue to provide adequate services and infrastructure, and, importantly, to grow our economy despite difficult circumstances.


Although the MRRT—the minerals resource rent tax—is naturally going to be volatile, it will, over the longer term, fund programs. One of those programs that is particularly important and which will be funded through minerals resource rent tax revenues is the boost in compulsory superannuation levels from nine per cent to 12 per cent over the next 10 years. We will be looking at that in the budget context but, as I said earlier, we have a strong record of delivering necessary savings and finding those savings in the budget to fund our programs. We will do that yet again. For the next year, that will be revealed in the May budget by the Treasurer.


The specifics of the bill we are debating today were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. The committee undertook an inquiry and submissions were sought for a period of four months. I understand that there were not many submissions received by the committee, so the committee determined that they would extend the deadline for the receipt of submissions. They received six submissions from companies and the community. Five of those submissions opposed the provisions of this bill. That was reported by the committee.


So, as I said earlier, the Greens need to calm down. The opposition needs to calm down and we need to take a long-term view of this project.




Senator Williams:
  We're calm; we'll get rid of it.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  The opposition needs to be conscious of the fact that the states see, Senator Williams, that these miners have been making super profits on non-renewable resources that belong to the people of Australia, and that is why they have pushed up their royalties. They know that the community is not getting a fair return on these resources, and they have pushed up their royalties. It has caused some difficulties with this tax, but we will work those out. The crux of the argument, and the philosophy, is still the same. The Australian public were not getting an adequate return from these non-renewable resources, and that is why the government introduced the minerals resource rent tax. Over the longer term it will deliver for the people of Australia, and that is why we should oppose this bill.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-02-28,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:45):  It was interesting listening to Senator Ludlam speaking. He said, 'Looking after the environment: that is what the Greens are about'. I noticed the wording of the formal motion about national parks today, where the feds would take over the national parks and not allow grazing. Just let the fuel levels rise and let the bushfires come along and have the savage, hot fires—like we had a few weeks ago at Coonabarabran, where 50,000 hectares of mainly national park and 33 homes were burnt. I am thinking: this minerals resource rent tax is about the environment.


If we look at the so-called greenest government the New South Wales parliament has ever seen—in one former Premier, now senator, Bob Carr—the Greens ruled that government. We saw them locking up country and leaving it, with virtually no hazard reduction burning and no grazing allowed. It is amazing that they do not allow grazing. They do not want hard-hooved animals in the national parks. It is about environment management, which relates to the very bill we are talking about. It is all right to have brumbies, wild pigs, feral goats or deer, but don't put any cattle or sheep in there to graze the country or get the fuel levels down so we can control the environment! Enough of that, as far as Senator Ludlam's farcical comment that the Greens are concerned about the environment. They actually destroy the environment. Their policies have been wrecking the environment, killing the animals and killing the trees, and savage hot fires have destroyed the seed on the ground for regeneration. I just had to comment on that while we are looking at this bill of the Greens.


Why was the MRRT first introduced? It was because this government got into such a financial mess—we will see the figures again tomorrow—with $263 billion of gross government debt. That is just the federal government. I am sure my colleague Senator Mason will remember the luxury car tax. It put the clamps on General Motors-Holden. No-one should be able to afford to buy those Statesmans! You have worked hard, you have put some money away and you have dreamed of your luxury car, but you had better pay more tax. There was the alcopops tax. That was going to save all the young ones from binge drinking. Instead of buying a can of Bundy and cola they would buy a bottle of Bundy rum and a bottle of coke. What is the effect of that? Then we had the LPG tax—the clean Australian fuel that we produce here. Ninety-five per cent of taxis run on it. What a good way to lose an election: upset the taxi drivers who talk to so many people every day and every night of the week! Then we had the flood tax, the carbon tax that we were never going to have, and then we got to the minerals tax. The brutal, savage, political guillotining of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd—the axing of a prime minister who was elected by the people—will go down in our political history.


We know about the presidential-style elections we have these days. Prime Minister Gillard said the government had lost its way. It was Mr Rudd who proposed the super profits tax. The word 'profit' is a naughty word in the eyes of this government and their left-wing partners in politics, the Greens. This word 'profit' is a dirty word—to have a business run at a profit and to have a business grow. Every big business started off as a small business, and they worked hard and they worked smart.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  We will get to that later on, Senator Polley. I will wait for Senator Heffernan to back me up. So, apparently, this word 'profit' is terrible. The then Prime Minister, Mr Kevin Rudd, said, 'We'll get into these profits; we'll get some of this money off them.' Of course, that all turned to tears. One of the jobs of the now Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard, was to clean up the superprofits tax—and 'We will give you the minerals resource rent tax.'


Senator Mason, I wish you had been on that select committee that I had the privilege to be on with our colleague, Senator Cormann, when they brought out the document signed by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer saying that all state royalties would be credited. We got into a bit of an argument with Senator Cameron—which is not unusual—and I asked one of the witnesses, 'Will you please take on notice and give the committee a definition of ""all""?'




Senator Furner:
  You wouldn't increase the royalties to Queensland.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I take your interjection, Senator Furner. So all the royalties would be credited. Who do the minerals belong to? Who is responsible for them in the ground? The Crown. That is correct, isn't it, Senator Ludwig?



An honourable senator:  The Aboriginals.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  'The Aboriginals', Senator Ludlam says. So they own all the resources? Here is another tack thrown in. The way Campbell Newman has increased his royalties is on a pro rata basis. Once the price of a commodity gets over, say, $100 a tonne, then the royalty increases. But, if the price goes down, the royalty is reduced, to give business a fair go. I have no problem with the states raising the royalties. They have control of the minerals in the ground—the same as coal seam gas and oil, after the then Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, took control off the farmers in New South Wales in 1981. The same thing happened in 1971 in South Australia and back in 1915 in Queensland. Senator Ludlam, that is when the states took control of those resources off the farmers.


I have no problem with the states raising royalties. I think it is only fair that we get a fair share. The states can then use that money on their schools and their hospitals. All this federal government had to say in the COAG meeting was: 'You state blokes, you state guys, you state ladies, you state ministers, raise your royalties and we will give you less money from Canberra,' and do a balancing around the states—of course some states have much more mining than others—and just let the states raise their royalties. It is their commodity; it is their resource. They are finite and we want to get our share to benefit all the people who live in our states. And the feds would just simply pay less money to the states. Money saved is money made. But, no, they wanted to go and get control of it, and the states of course became recalcitrant and said, 'We'll raise our royalties'—as they have every right to do.


That is what this is about. It gets back to the point about the budget surplus. How many times did we hear about the 'not negotiable', 'ironclad' budget surplus that we were going to see in the financial year we are in now? Was it two or three hundred times? It will be interesting when we get to Mr Swan's budget come May to hear what his predictions are for this financial year. But, Senator Mason, we know one thing for sure: there will be no surplus. We need this Labor Party government to go to the dictionary and actually see what the word 'surplus' means, because they do not know what a surplus is. During the 13 years of the Hawke-Keating government the Labor government delivered four surpluses, and we have had five years of this government. So 13 and five is 18. After 18 years in government there have been four years of surplus. It has been many, many years—we are probably talking about decades—since we have seen a surplus from a Labor government. So they have probably forgotten what it means. We know they will not deliver one of them.


As far as this tax goes, we argued that it was no good and we argued that it was rushed—have a look at the recommendations that Senator Cormann's select committee handed down—and we stand here in hindsight and say, 'We told you so.' But it came into this chamber, and the Greens—who are very big supporters of guillotining debate in this place and teaming up with the Labor senators to get the numbers—pulled the guillotine down and said: 'Stop debate. Don't have any more discussions; let's just pass it.'


But now it is all wrong. It has all turned to tears, so we will guillotine the debate on this tax, rip it through the Senate and get it into place. Then it all turns to tears when it does not work. But there is one thing worse: the money that has not been raised has been spent. That is the problem. Labor said, 'Yes, we'll give company reductions to small business.' That would be good, but we never saw them. 'We'll put into superannuation to build up the super funds.' No, stripping the money from these big companies, which are owned in some respects by the super funds, is taking money away from every working Australian. That is where they have their money invested to get a return for their super funds.




Senator Mason:
  Shambles.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Shambles is a very good description. The whole thing has turned to tears and like many other things—just look at the government—this whole minerals resource rent tax was not about a fair share for all Australians of the finite resources in the ground. It was about the federal government's budget that was in a state of disarray. Remember when Labor was elected to government the ceiling of the debt was $75 billion. You raised it to $200 billion. Then you raised it to $250 billion. Then last May, in a year in which we were meant to have a budget surplus, you raised it to $300 billion. Why did you need to raise the ceiling debt, the credit card limit for the Australian people, when you are going to have a budget surplus? Because you knew there was not going to be any surplus—and history will prove that correct.


During the Christmas break when we were away from the cameras, Treasurer Swan said, 'It's unlikely it'll look like a surplus now.' Blind Freddy could have told you that there would be no surplus. Get the equation right: the Australian Labor Party in government equals debt—borrowing, debt, waste. It has happened all my life. I can take you back to the states and I am sure my colleague Senator Ronaldson would remember that the Cain-Kirner government in Victoria set that state back by $60 billion of debt, and Premier Kennett was left to clean up the mess. He was asked why he sold the electricity company. He got $19 billion for the sale and every cent went to pay off debt that the Labor Party had built up. Perhaps we should look at Queensland's finances now.




Senator Mason:
  With $80 billion in debt, a shambles.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Running on a par with Ireland, 4½ million people. The sad thing about this is that Queensland was debt-free for decades. I remember when former Prime Minister Bob Hawke called the tax summit when he won in 1983 and one Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen said: 'Why don't you be like Queensland and not run deficits?' They laughed at him—a debt-free state and now it is on the point of bankruptcy. But that is what happens when you have no idea about running business so you simply borrow, spend and waste.



Senator Furner interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It is late in the week and I will not take your interjection, Senator Furner—only for the reason I did not hear it properly.


The most laughable aspect of all this is what Prime Minister Julia Gillard said. This is a big point and it is what the minerals resource rent tax is all about. The Greens have a bill saying we need a bigger cop, but let me quote the Prime Minister for anyone listening:


You can't run this country if you can't manage its budget.


It is a pretty good statement; the words are good. Let us have a look at the reality of what is happening. I reckon at about $10 billion the penny will drop when we get the actuals in September. When we get the actual debt for this financial year in September, because this minerals resource rent tax has only returned $126 million, two things are going to happen. On 14 September we are going to have an election—you beauty, a lot of people say. Two weeks after that we are going to find out the actuals of this year's financials.


I wonder why they plan the election day two weeks before the Treasurer will give the real budget figures of this financial year? A cynic would say it is because there is going to be another big hole; not a big black hole, but a big red hole, a hole of red ink of more borrowings. If all goes well—

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (18:01):  I rise to take note of the Australian War Memorial annual report for 2011-12. I am sure that all honourable senators who are listening tonight will be aware that since 1947 there have been 48 peacekeepers who have died during non-warlike service who nonetheless were looking after this country and serving this country. At the moment, those 48 men are not on the roll of honour at the War Memorial.


All sides of politics respect the independence of the War Memorial. It has been such a successful organisation because of being above politics. But the Council of the War Memorial is in the process of reconsidering a previous decision in relation to these peacekeepers—young men who died in the uniform of the military of this country.


I am sure honourable senators are aware that there are two books at the War Memorial—and I must acknowledge that I got them wrong in a press release that I put out recently; and I apologise for that—there is the Commemorative Roll and the Remembrance Book, and it is the Remembrance Book that has in it those young men who died in the service of this country since 1947.


I have spoken to a number of families of these young men and one of the most poignant comments that was made to me was a father talking about his son: 'His service and memory are put away in a cupboard and virtually forgotten. This really hurts.' No family should be left to feel that the ultimate sacrifice of their son or daughter, brother or sister is forgotten. What he is referring to in relation to the memory being 'put in a cupboard' is that the Remembrance Book is effectively locked away.


This has been a very difficult issue for the ex-service community and there is a variety of views about whether the roll of honour should have peacekeepers on it.


On the back of that conversation with the father of that young man who died serving this country, I wrote to Rear Admiral Ken Doolan, the Chairman of the Australian War Memorial, and Dr Brendan Nelson, the new Director of the AWM, a man who of course was a defence minister, indicating to them I was not in any way wanting to impose our—as in the coalition's—will on the council and was acknowledging that ultimately they have the responsibility for these sorts of decisions. I did however, on behalf of the coalition—and this is in the letter to Rear Admiral Doolan and Dr Nelson—indicate that indeed at this forthcoming council meeting if the decision were made to reverse this decision and put these young men on the roll of honour it would have the full support of the coalition. I believe that with the Centenary of Anzac coming, as we all know, in 2014, there is a great opportunity—indeed, a unique opportunity—for the council to ensure that the roll of honour remains relevant and central to the story, understanding and commemoration of Australians at war. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-02-28,"




Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:43):  I would like to make some comments on the committee's report on the statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. I note that recommendation (1) has been accepted by the government. The committee recommends that ASIC amend its website to include an explanation of the meaning and significance of holding an Australian financial services licence. That, to me, would be common sense. I have concerns with ASIC and some of the things they are doing, but mainly with the lack of government action. It was years ago now that we handed down the recommendations of the Senate inquiry into liquidators, administrators and receivers. What action has the government taken? I will tell you the action the government has taken: absolutely nothing. We recommended that an ombudsman be set up to oversee some of the charges that the liquidators are charging. I think some of the charges are outrageous—$700 an hour et cetera.


We recommend that the liquidators be licensed, so that ASIC has the power to cancel or suspend a licence at any stage. Of course, the liquidator would have the right to go to court to have that licence put back in place. We recommend that if any liquidator allowed their public indemnity insurance to lapse there would be immediate suspension of their licence. But that industry still goes untouched, and there are some 660 registered liquidators in our country.


I will not comment on a case I am watching very closely. The court wound up on that case this week. That was one of the reasons that I called the inquiry into this industry. When the decision comes down—and I have a fair idea which way the judge is going to rule—ASIC will have a lot more questions to answer, I assure you, come next Senate estimates or if I happen to be in the vicinity when the judge hands down his decision on that court case. I will not go into any details, of course.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Affairs has oversight of ASIC. I see nothing wrong with that. My opposing colleague Senator Cameron might want to comment on the fees and charges of many in this industry, which he learnt about at a recent Senate inquiry we had. I make the point: why would a committee do all the work, put forward 17 recommendations to the government, handed down in September 2009, and the government does not act? A lot of change is required in this industry—regulations need to be changed to give ASIC the powers to do their job properly—but it requires the government to act, and this government has not acted. To me, that is unacceptable. I do not know how many tens of thousands of dollars it costs to run an inquiry. We travelled to Adelaide, Sydney and Newcastle.


There are people out there who have simply been done over by a rogue liquidator, Stuart Ariff, who is now in jail for six years. Of course, ASIC did not act on him until the courageous Adele Ferguson came forward in the media to highlight what this man had done. After three or four years of complaints, ASIC finally it took him to court where he pleaded guilty to 83 counts of wrongdoing. I asked the DPP, 'Have you had a referral from ASIC?' and the answer was no. We had to write to ASIC to get a referral to the DPP, where charges were actually laid, the jury made a decision and then the judge sentenced him. I know that people were done over by the rogue liquidator Stuart Ariff. I know it has destroyed their lives in many respects. I know they live with the problems.


There is a Malaysian owned car-wash company whose name has slipped my mind. The liquidator got in control of the company and it cost the company $1.8 million to have Stuart Ariff removed from the company. When a company is in liquidation or administration, who has a spare $1.8 million to remove a rogue liquidator? Luckily that company did have the money to do that, but it is devastating for them to see what was happened. I blame ASIC for not doing their job properly. I continued to ask Mr D'Aloisio, when he was CEO of ASIC, whether they were resourced enough and he said they were. Of course, now the answer from Mr Medcraft is that they could always do with more funds.


As far as I am concerned, the government needs to look at the recommendations of these Senate committees. If it does not, why are we having the committee hearings? Why are we doing the work? Why are we spending taxpayers' money to have no change in what happens?


By the way, that Malaysian owned company is Car Lovers, which does car washes around Australia. It has spent $1.8 million in legal fees to remove a shonky liquidator. That was the recommendation of the committee: to see that ASIC had the power, with one phone call, to cancel their licence. The liquidator could go to court to apply to have it reinstated, but we need to give ASIC the power, with one phone call, to suspend the licence of a liquidator. That in itself would send a clear message to this industry: 'If you do the wrong thing and the evidence is put forward to ASIC, in one phone call you will be sat on your backside. You will be out of business because your licence has been suspended.' That in itself would be of huge benefit in returning confidence to the liquidating and insolvency practitioner industry, in which I believe so many Australians have very little confidence.


In commenting on the one recommendation from the government for ASIC to upgrade its website, I hope that the government actually does something. But I think it is a little too late. Hopefully after 14 September I will be in the position of being in government where I can see those changes introduced.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:51):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This is about natural disaster recovery work in Queensland and Victoria. They indicate that I was minded to speak on this issue after the performance of Senator Macdonald in his earlier contribution where he talked about the issue of climate change.


I want to talk about it in the scientific terms—I have been advised by the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Climate Commission and the Australian Academy of Science—and actually get back to some of the real issues that we are dealing with.


Senator Macdonald has been here are very, very, very, very long time. I think we are starting to see that he is really not injecting much sense into the debates. In my view it is about time he gave it away, because he is so predictable. He is absolutely predictable on every issue he stands upon. He is no more predictable on any issue than he is on climate change.


You only have to look at the weather patterns that we have around the country to understand that there are real issues. The problem for the coalition is that they do not seem to understand the difference between weather and climate. Weather is a short-term phenomenon that we deal with; climate is a long-term phenomenon. You have to look at what is happening with weather over a period of time to determine what is happening in the climate. I would rather listen to the CSIRO, the Australian Academy of Science, the Bureau of Meteorology and the academy of science of every developed country in the world, who say that there are huge issues that the world has to deal with.


The glib nature in which the coalition deal with this issue is just not in the interests of future generations of this country. Their Direct Action Plan is a joke. It will not deliver the changes that are required. It will not demonstrate to the rest of the world the Australian leadership that John Howard, the previous coalition Prime Minister, said we should. It will not do that. It is a Greg Hunt, patched together approach to try and say there is a policy that is different from the government's policy. When you look at that policy you have to shake your head, because it is really not dealing with the issues that the CSIRO say we have to deal with. Mr Malcolm Turnbull, in the other place, has clearly described Mr Hunt's policy as 'not very good', and that is being kind. It is like that because he does understand that from time to time governments and oppositions have to deal with the scientific facts. And the scientific facts are clear—that climate change is on us, we have to deal with it, we have to mitigate against it, and we have to protect future generations.


Senator Macdonald should actually be an advocate for mitigation and an advocate for science—the advocate for North Queensland that he says is. If he was a real advocate for Queensland and North Queensland he would be saying, 'We have to do something real in relation to climate change,' because the storms that we have had recently are consistent with the modelling that has been done internationally as to what is going to happen in Australia. It is consistent with the modelling that has been done by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, which shows that more extreme weather incidents will take place. That is what we are seeing. We are seeing communities now being wiped out—homes and businesses that have been insured for years and years not being able to get insurance.


When you trace the issues that we are facing it goes back, as the Bureau of Meteorology point out, to the start of the Industrial Revolution. You can trace the increase in CO2 from the Industrial Revolution to where we are now. You can model that where it is going to head. You can model the implications. It is physics. I was hopeless at physics at school. I do not know anything about physics—except the advice that we get from the people that actually do physics for a living, the scientists.


The scientists would scoff at Senator Macdonald's performance tonight. It is easy to come in here and run all the glib lines that might go down well with the climate change deniers in the coalition: 'Ho, ho, ho!' 'What a job you did, Senator Macdonald. You were your usual self. You were there denying there was any change to the climate. Senator Macdonald, how good are you!' But, really, that is just really a denial of the future for future generations in this country. It really is disgraceful.


Senator Macdonald could not help himself. He is back. And so he should be back. If he would deal with the science and not the politics of climate change, he would actually be putting future generations before political opportunism. That is what Senator Macdonald does all the time in here. It is political opportunism mixed with a bit of smear, mixed with a bit of vitriol and mixed with a bit of attack on individuals—and we will see that again tonight. That is Senator Macdonald's bread and butter. He is a one-trick pony. He has been here far too long. That is the reality.


I take the view, not being a physicist and not understanding science to a great degree, that I take advice. I take advice from the CSIRO. I take advice from the Bureau of Meteorology. I take advice from the Academy of Science. And I say: 'Give the planet the benefit of the doubt. Give the kids of the future the benefit of the doubt. Do not come here and play short-term politics with the climate.'


Do not come here and play short-term politics, as Senator Macdonald does every day he is on his feet in this chamber. Actually think about the future generations of this country and give future generations the benefit of the doubt that the scientists have got this right. The scientists are saying to politicians around the world that you have to deal with this issue. I would say to Senator Macdonald, who was speaking on the CSIRO the last time he was on his feet: 'Have a read of what the scientists in the CSIRO say about climate change. Read the climate change book that the CSIRO have produced.' Senator Macdonald, you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself because you are putting yourself and your political position before the needs of the North Queensland, before the needs of future generations in this country and before the needs of the environment. I think it is time, Senator Macdonald, that you stopped being a one-trick pony and you started looking at these issues and the reality of the scientific facts that are before us. Australians deserve better from their politicians.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-02-28,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (19:42):  I rise tonight to speak about advances in mobile technologies and the benefits that they are bringing to our society. The use of mobile technologies is growing at a rapid rate. Mobile broadband traffic in Australia is expected to grow by an extraordinary 14-fold between 2011 and 2016. The development and widespread adoption of mobile technologies will result in a change to our society as fundamental—or perhaps more so—as that caused by the development of television or radio.


A few weeks ago I attended here in parliament the launch of the report commissioned by the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association entitled Mobile Nation: the economic and social impacts of mobile technology. The Mobile Nation report provides an important snapshot of the use of mobile technology in Australia. Anything that we can do on a PC we now have the capacity to do on a mobile phone or tablet device. The report illustrates that the use of mobile technologies is changing the way that we work, socialise, conduct business and deal with government. They are changing our work-life balance, our communities and, for many, their relationships.


The report outlines the efficiency gains and the productivity growth due to emerging technologies. We are entering an exciting new era. In the coming years, our mobile devices will be able to perform tasks that we cannot imagine. While capable of downloading data from 3G and 4G mobile networks, mobile devices still do not download the majority of the data from fixed networks—that is, networks in the home, office or cafe. The report states that mobile devices can be used with both mobile and fixed networks. They are a complementary means of accessing data. The growth of mobile devices is likely to be a significant driver of NBN demand.


While we are talking about the NBN, I would like to say how pleased I was to attend with the member for Franklin, Julie Collins, the Future Tasmania event held at the Kingston Beach Digital Hub just a couple of weeks ago. This was launched by Minister Conroy. The Future Tasmania event featured a high definition hook-up from six locations around Tasmania.


The event demonstrated that the NBN has the power to allow seamless teleconferencing between locations as distant as Kingston Beach, St Helens, Smithton, George Town, Triabunna and Sorell. It demonstrated that teleconferencing for business, social or tele-health purposes is not only feasible but easily and seamlessly achievable.


We were also able to see firsthand the benefits of the NBN for education. The Kingston Beach Digital Hub hosted a demonstration of cartooning, using tablet technologies and the NBN from Illawarra Primary School students. In just a short lesson with a professional illustrator, Bradfield Dumpleton, the students were able to construct short animated videos on iPads that were uploaded instantly to YouTube to show their classmates, friends and families. I would like to thank the principal, Nick Donnelly, for letting me spend time talking to the students about their experiences with the technology. They told me they had so much fun making these cartoons. I said, 'It's amazing how much you can learn when you've got a good teacher', and they said, 'We didn't actually realise we were learning.' I think that says a lot about the interaction technology has and the way young people adapt to it and use it while learning as well.


I am pleased to say that the Tasmanians who have spoken to me regarding the NBN have only ever asked me, 'When can I get it?' Tasmanians want the NBN—and they will get it first, with Tasmania on track to be the first state to complete the NBN rollout by the end of 2015. The NBN will complement emerging mobile technologies, delivering a faster backbone for the nation's telecommunications infrastructure and allowing us to connect to each other and the world quicker and more reliably. These technologies will revolutionise the way business is conducted, from the consumer to product design and generation. Mobile technology is moving from a device for individuals to a platform underpinning all business ICT. The structure of the industry is being transformed from a simple supply chain to an emerging ecosystem of mobile technologies that are transforming the economy.


The Mobile Nation report discusses the potential benefit of mobile technologies to business productivity. The report states:


Mobile devices can increase productivity by: increasing the effectiveness of employees or managers, or by saving them time; or by increasing the effectiveness or reducing the need for computers, vehicles, office space or other capital.


The labour productivity benefits stem from a number of sources. Workers can now communicate with others in the office while they are travelling, whether via talk, text, or email. This allows for business to continue while in a cab, at the airport or using hands-free while driving. Such unutilised or underutilised down time, which was formerly unable to be spent effectively due to not being able to access a desktop computer, is no longer unproductive. Numerous apps on smartphones and tablets, not available on desktop environments, allow users to utilise their time better. Inbuilt voice recorders, calendar applications, the ability to research on the go, and various apps designed specifically for an industry or a task can streamline repetitive tasks and increase overall efficiency. All these features can allow people to better utilise their time. Use of mobile technologies can allow decision making to be conducted more efficiently.


I would like to quote the report again, where it says:


As managers can be contacted, review information, and communicate with the office, without being physically present, they are able to increase the speed of information transfer and make timely decisions which can enable other follow-on tasks to be accelerated, improving the efficiency of business.


As I mentioned earlier, there are also capital productivity benefits from improvements in the efficiency of capital. These include efficiencies in ICT equipment, premises, software and choice of business location. By supplying employees with laptops or allowing employees to use their own laptops to connect to the workplace's wireless network, fixed infrastructure costs can be reduced.


Mobile devices are also able to help improve efficiencies through the use of so-called machine-to-machine technology. These 'smart technologies' allow data to be transmitted to tablets or smartphones from sensors to provide accurate, real-time readings. This will provide particular benefit in the electricity, irrigation, agriculture, health, transport, and broadband and communications sectors. In 2009 Access Economics found that adoption of intelligent technologies would result in a significant increase in the net present value of GDP. This increase would be between $35 billion and $80 billion over the first 10 years, depending on the amount of spare capacity in the economy.


Mobile technology can improve capital productivity by facilitating telework. Telework involves working regularly from a place other than the office—in most cases from a home office, using high-speed telecommunications. It is a core feature of the emerging workplace of the future as we transition to the digital economy. Telework has the potential to improve productivity, reduce costs and enable employers to better access and retain skilled staff. By using smartphones, laptops and mobile broadband while working at home, teleworking can reduce business costs in terms of reduced rent, less desk space and lower electricity costs. Combined with the rollout of the National Broadband Network, it can also help people living in regional Australia to access a wider range of job opportunities, improve work-life balance and reduce the time, stress and cost of commuting and related traffic congestion and help to reduce our carbon footprint.


The increase in sales of smartphones via apps and online shopping, known as e-tailing or m-commerce, can lead to cost savings for bricks-and-mortar stores through reductions in occupancy cost, as a smaller floor space will result in a lower rent. Operations can be conducted out of back offices or even from people's garages. Of course, the new mobile technologies provide challenges as well opportunities. As chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety I know full well some of the challenges that face young people in particular, but also senior Australians, concerning safety on mobile devices. As mobile technologies emerge and develop, applications that we cannot currently conceive will become a fundamental part of our daily lives.


Combined with the power of the National Broadband Network, mobile technologies offer an extraordinary opportunity to revolutionise the way we conduct business, the way we socialise and how we interact with our peers. The future will be mobile, and it will be a bright one.
