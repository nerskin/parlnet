That the Senate take note of the report.
This is a report whose preparation I enjoyed being part of, and I was very much a part of it. I hope that if the people who were on the committee do not speak this morning they will speak later, because—and I see Senator Mason here—it was very much an amalgam of great minds, at least in so far as the others are concerned. I wish to go through the committee members and thank them. I pay tribute to Senator Winston Crane, who is the Deputy Chairman, and to his advice and wisdom and to his staff. In fact, on this report I have to pay tribute not only to the people who were on the committee but also to their staff and, of course, to the secretariat, which I will come to in a minute. To Senator Crane, Senator Crossin, Senator Ferris, Senator Mason, Senator Murray and all their staff I give thanks, as well as to those in the secretariat: Mr James Warmenhoven, Ms Margaret Lindeman, Mrs Sue Blunden and Mrs Bev Orr. Perhaps I can indicate the work they did by pointing out that, in fact, there has been a number of rewrites of the report and this is the tenth. That indicates the strength of the committee and the diligence and energy with which they went about preparing the report.
What is this report to do with? Perhaps that is best explained by this: there are people in this society who can enter our offices here in Parliament House, can break down the doors of our houses, can take our documents away and keep them, and can go into our business premises, our homes and whatever else. There are people that we, as it were, allow to do that. Clearly, the ones that first come to the mind are the police, but there is also the National Crime Authority. Also there are such people as those from the tax office, who can just walk into premises and ask for documents. Other bodies able to do that include the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service; the Health Insurance Commission, in certain circumstances; the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; and auditors, who have rights that are not ones that include breaking down doors but can include coming to inspect your books. So, as you think about it, there is this whole array of people and organisations who can, to varying degrees depending on who they are, break down your doors—although the tax office cannot do that—enter your premises and take your documents away, all without your consent. Of course, if you consent, there is no problem about it. This is a dimension of modern life. 
The bodies that I have mentioned and others as well need to detect crime when it is committed, to gather intelligence for the interdiction of crime and to get evidence to present before a court if they want to pursue a trial. So there are reasons at that level why people might want to come upon your premises. There is also the need to find out whether people have complied with acts that impose a levy or that give people a right to obtain money subject to them being checked upon. In other words, there is a whole variety of reasons why people might want to come upon your premises to monitor whether you have done the right thing and whether you are complying with the law. The tax office can come upon your premises simply to see whether or not you have put in your tax return correctly. 
There is a whole array of people who can invade your premises and who can take away your goods—I keep coming back to that. They can take away your papers and, in certain circumstances, they might take papers that you need and keep them for a considerable period of time. I am sure we all remember the adage we grew up with that an Englishman's house is his castle. Whether or not you are an Englishman, as an Australian from any background you should be able to say the same thing. Your home should be your castle. At the same time, we understand that you have to have a society that is properly administered. You have to suppress crime. You have to have the ability to monitor acts and regulations. You have to have the ability to get information. How do you balance that? You balance that by having a set of principles so that, if you licence people or you give people permission to come onto your premises, they have to do it in a proper way. This report sets out, amongst other things, a set of principles that should be addressed by an authority before it invades your space. Particularly in the situation where he, she or it is going to break down your door, there should be a warrant. An obligation should be placed upon the people who are going to carry out the entry to be held responsible if they do it in a way that is not in accordance with the law. This is such a dramatic power to give to authorities that it should be exercised only in strict accordance with the law.
The interesting thing—and this was pointed out by James Warmenhoven—is that these powers are very much the creation of legislators and parliaments. Judges in the history of the law that we follow have emphasised the concept that every person's house is his castle. It is mainly the legislator who has come in and said, `We've got to administer. We've got to make sure things run right, so we're going to give permission to the police and a whole array of authorities to enable them to get this information and evidence. We're going to give them permission to do that and we're going to put that in a statute.' It is very much a parliamentary matter. But if parliament is going to do that, then there is an obligation on parliament to set out the rules by which that is done. I will quote from the report to give you an idea of what it says in this context. Under the heading `Principles governing the grant of powers of entry and search by Parliament', it says:
... people have a fundamental right to their dignity, to their privacy, to the integrity of their person, to their reputation, to the security of their residence and any other premises, and to respect as a member of a civil society;
no person, group or body should intrude on these rights without good cause ...
The next main heading is `Principles governing the choice of people on whom the powers are to be conferred'. You would not want an inexperienced person, a person without maturity, a person of tender years, to be wandering around doing these things.
The orange light has come on and my time has expired. This is a matter that I would like to dilate on further. I am not going to ask for leave to continue my remarks because Senator Mason is going to have something to say, and he might seek leave at the end of his no doubt outstanding speech.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-04-06,"—I rise to join Senator Cooney in his remarks on the tabling of the report from the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills on search and entry provisions in Commonwealth legislation. When dealing with the area of search and entry provisions, the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills was faced with a dilemma. There are important issues here: the need for effective law enforcement, the need for the effective administration of the law and the need to ensure that citizens are protected from arbitrary and unwarranted interference by the state and its agencies. This report commences by saying, and perhaps this says it all:
At common law, every unauthorised entry onto private property is a trespass. 
As Senator Cooney said, every man's home is his castle.
The modern authority to enter and search premises is essentially a creation of statute. As such, it should always be regarded as an exceptional power, not a power granted as a matter of course, and any statutory provisions which authorise search and entry should conform with a set of principles.
The committee proceeded to develop a series of principles governing: the grant of powers of search and entry by parliament, the authorisation of entry and search, the choice of people on whom that power is to be conferred, the extent of the power granted, the kinds of matters which might attract the grant of that power, the manner in which the power to enter and to search is exercised, the provision of information to occupiers, and principles relating to the behaviour and protection of people carrying out entry and search.
In these principles the committee attempted to encompass what it considered to be the best of the past practice in this area. As Senator Cooney pointed out, considering the very intrusive nature of search and entry, the committee was of the opinion that those principles that I mentioned should apply to both existing search and entry provisions and to any proposed new provisions, should be administered by the Attorney-General's department and should have statutory force. While there might be exceptional circumstances, in general the committee felt that, for the sake of transparency, any departure from the model and the reasons for departure from the model provisions should be made explicit in the bill and the explanatory memorandum accompanying any bill.
The committee has recommended that the principles governing search and entry in this nation should be enshrined in stand-alone legislation, and that legislation should take as its starting point the search warrant provisions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. The committee also recommended that the powers available under the Crimes Act to the Australian Federal Police should constitute a high-water mark for such powers generally, and hence powers available to any other agency or person should exceed the powers available to the Australian Federal Police only in very exceptional circumstances. There should be a model provision and that should be detracted from only in exceptional circumstances. The committee recommended that all existing search and entry provisions in legislation and regulations should be reviewed and amended by 1 July 2001 to ensure that they conform with the principles set out by the committee. This point particularly relates to the inconsistencies mentioned in the report in relation to the Australian Taxation Office and ASIO. The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Ombudsman undertake a regular random sample audit of the exercise by the ATO of its entry and search provisions to ensure that those provisions have been exercised fairly and appropriately. The committee also dealt with matters relating to fairness and the effectiveness of search and entry provisions, including training and review of people exercising those powers.
I would like to join our chairman, Senator Cooney, in thanking the secretariat, whose patience at times I think was tried, and also all the other members of the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,21,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-06,"—There are three committees which guard the legislative portals of the Senate: the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, the Selection of Bills Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Selection of Bills Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee are the only committees in the Senate which look at every single bill which comes before the Senate. Whilst the selection of bills by and large can be described as a redistributive mechanism to send bills either straight to the Senate or off to committees, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is the nearest we have to a committee which looks at all bills on a non-partisan basis and on the basis of essential principles which should protect both the way in which the Senate looks at bills and the general rights and liberties in the community at large. I do not want to overstate its role, because it certainly does not have the wide brief of attending to legislation on the basis of a charter of rights or a bill of rights, but at least it is a move in that direction and is supported now by a growing band of such committees nationwide. 
It is my favourite committee. As senators here probably realise, I am a senator who now has great experience of Senate committees and in fact of joint house committees. It is a committee which attends to matters which are dear to my heart personally. But it also is a committee populated by senators who in the exercise of their duties exhibit what is best about the Senate, and that is the ability of senators to rise above their particular ideology or party position and examine matters pragmatically and practically but always on a bedrock of principle. I think I have been particularly blessed, quite frankly, by the experiences I have had in that committee and by being able to experience the benefits of the wisdom of the senators who sit on it. In that, of course, we are assisted by the good professor who looks after us, Jim Davis, and by the secretariat. I think we are also particularly blessed by the chair, a gentle and sometimes idiosyncratic man but one who nevertheless holds very strong and very good principles in the practice of his duties, and in the deputy chair, Senator Crane, who has a very deep attachment to the ordinary person not being roughed up by the institutions of the state. With regard to this report, I want to particularly thank the secretary, James Warmenhoven, and his immediate offsider, Margaret Lindeman, not just for patience but for a real contribution to the quality of the report.
You would gather from my introduction that I am particularly moved by the report. I am moved on this basis: having probably participated in hundreds of reports now in the nearly four years I have been in the Senate, I think this might be the most important report we have brought down in my time in the Senate. It is certainly one of the most important reports. Why do I say that? I say that because it is an attempt to establish Australia-wide principles about the ways in which our citizens shall be dealt with by the state, be it Commonwealth, state or territory government. It is my hope that this report will be taken up by the other parliamentary jurisdictions in this country and will result in a commonality of approach to what is a very fundamental, intrusive and aggressive power that the state takes for itself through search and entry provisions.
Many of you would know that much of my strong addiction to a human rights agenda comes from my background, particularly from my experiences in southern Africa. If you want to know how search and entry provisions can be perverted, you just need to have a little bit of experience in that part of the world. It is something that is a protection for all of us, from the highest to the lowest. I find that one of the greatest weaknesses of our federation is the fact that Australian citizens and residents of Australia cannot expect common treatment in terms of fundamental rights and obligations in the different jurisdictions of the country. It seems extraordinary to me that there are different ages, different processes and different procedures for fundamental issues which attach to the citizenry. One of those is search and entry. It is an aggressive power and the fact that it is exercised differentially in Australia is not something to be proud of. I hope that the principles that have been laid down will prove to be a great advance for our country.
The effect of these principles will, I think, also be welcomed by the agencies concerned. Frankly, most of the people who came before us impressed me with their desire to be guided by better standards and a better approach to the powers they have. I felt that numbers of them were uncomfortable with having to exercise power which they recognised was capable of being abused in the wrong hands or with the wrong processes. That was not universally so, of course. I got the impression from some of the witnesses that they rather enjoyed the powers they were given. A brief check list of some of the organisations in federal authority which have these powers includes: the Australian Customs Service; the Australian Federal Police; the Australian National Audit Office; the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; the Australian Taxation Office; the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre; the Director of Public Prosecutions; the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, which I think should get a special mention as being appalling in their use of these powers; the Health Insurance Commission; the National Crime Authority, which I feel needs a great deal more restraint; the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme; the National Registration Authority; and then the non-government agencies, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the trade union movement. 
If the powers of search and entry are so widespread in our society and are replicated in the states and territories, it really is important that our most fundamental area of protection—which is our home, principally, but also our person and our personal business—should have guidelines and principles framing it to assist the state in going about its legitimate statutory duties. So for me, the production of this report, which has had a long and weary gestation, is the Senate acting as a practical guardian of principles which affect Australians. This is not an idealistic report; this is a very practical, workable document, based on the experience of agencies which have employed these powers and based on the development of law and principles as a result of the experience of their exercise. The recommendations in this report are the sorts of recommendations that any government should take up. I do not see that there is much that is controversial here. I think there is a great deal to be applauded.
There are those who should take note of the report. Amongst them are business organisations, directors of public prosecutions, heads of police unions, law departments of universities, the chief justices, the bar associations, the criminal law associations, other law associations and councils, law reform commissions, speakers and presidents of upper and lower houses, attorneys-general, civil liberties organisations and other scrutiny of rights committees. In other words, let's spread the message, particularly to those of our senators who have responsibility in the portfolios affected by this report. I thank the Chairman of the committee, Senator Cooney, and commend him for an excellent piece of work. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

The committee proceeded to develop a series of principles governing: the grant of powers of search and entry by parliament, the authorisation of entry and search, the choice of people on whom that power is to be conferred, the extent of the power granted, the kinds of matters which might attract the grant of that power, the manner in which the power to enter and to search is exercised, the provision of information to occupiers, and principles relating to the behaviour and protection of people carrying out entry and search.
In these principles the committee attempted to encompass what it considered to be the best of the past practice in this area. As Senator Cooney pointed out, considering the very intrusive nature of search and entry, the committee was of the opinion that those principles that I mentioned should apply to both existing search and entry provisions and to any proposed new provisions, should be administered by the Attorney-General's department and should have statutory force. While there might be exceptional circumstances, in general the committee felt that, for the sake of transparency, any departure from the model and the reasons for departure from the model provisions should be made explicit in the bill and the explanatory memorandum accompanying any bill.
The committee has recommended that the principles governing search and entry in this nation should be enshrined in stand-alone legislation, and that legislation should take as its starting point the search warrant provisions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. The committee also recommended that the powers available under the Crimes Act to the Australian Federal Police should constitute a high-water mark for such powers generally, and hence powers available to any other agency or person should exceed the powers available to the Australian Federal Police only in very exceptional circumstances. There should be a model provision and that should be detracted from only in exceptional circumstances. The committee recommended that all existing search and entry provisions in legislation and regulations should be reviewed and amended by 1 July 2001 to ensure that they conform with the principles set out by the committee. This point particularly relates to the inconsistencies mentioned in the report in relation to the Australian Taxation Office and ASIO. The committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Ombudsman undertake a regular random sample audit of the exercise by the ATO of its entry and search provisions to ensure that those provisions have been exercised fairly and appropriately. The committee also dealt with matters relating to fairness and the effectiveness of search and entry provisions, including training and review of people exercising those powers.
I would like to join our chairman, Senator Cooney, in thanking the secretariat, whose patience at times I think was tried, and also all the other members of the committee.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,21,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-06,"—There are three committees which guard the legislative portals of the Senate: the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, the Selection of Bills Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Selection of Bills Committee and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee are the only committees in the Senate which look at every single bill which comes before the Senate. Whilst the selection of bills by and large can be described as a redistributive mechanism to send bills either straight to the Senate or off to committees, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is the nearest we have to a committee which looks at all bills on a non-partisan basis and on the basis of essential principles which should protect both the way in which the Senate looks at bills and the general rights and liberties in the community at large. I do not want to overstate its role, because it certainly does not have the wide brief of attending to legislation on the basis of a charter of rights or a bill of rights, but at least it is a move in that direction and is supported now by a growing band of such committees nationwide. 
It is my favourite committee. As senators here probably realise, I am a senator who now has great experience of Senate committees and in fact of joint house committees. It is a committee which attends to matters which are dear to my heart personally. But it also is a committee populated by senators who in the exercise of their duties exhibit what is best about the Senate, and that is the ability of senators to rise above their particular ideology or party position and examine matters pragmatically and practically but always on a bedrock of principle. I think I have been particularly blessed, quite frankly, by the experiences I have had in that committee and by being able to experience the benefits of the wisdom of the senators who sit on it. In that, of course, we are assisted by the good professor who looks after us, Jim Davis, and by the secretariat. I think we are also particularly blessed by the chair, a gentle and sometimes idiosyncratic man but one who nevertheless holds very strong and very good principles in the practice of his duties, and in the deputy chair, Senator Crane, who has a very deep attachment to the ordinary person not being roughed up by the institutions of the state. With regard to this report, I want to particularly thank the secretary, James Warmenhoven, and his immediate offsider, Margaret Lindeman, not just for patience but for a real contribution to the quality of the report.
You would gather from my introduction that I am particularly moved by the report. I am moved on this basis: having probably participated in hundreds of reports now in the nearly four years I have been in the Senate, I think this might be the most important report we have brought down in my time in the Senate. It is certainly one of the most important reports. Why do I say that? I say that because it is an attempt to establish Australia-wide principles about the ways in which our citizens shall be dealt with by the state, be it Commonwealth, state or territory government. It is my hope that this report will be taken up by the other parliamentary jurisdictions in this country and will result in a commonality of approach to what is a very fundamental, intrusive and aggressive power that the state takes for itself through search and entry provisions.
Many of you would know that much of my strong addiction to a human rights agenda comes from my background, particularly from my experiences in southern Africa. If you want to know how search and entry provisions can be perverted, you just need to have a little bit of experience in that part of the world. It is something that is a protection for all of us, from the highest to the lowest. I find that one of the greatest weaknesses of our federation is the fact that Australian citizens and residents of Australia cannot expect common treatment in terms of fundamental rights and obligations in the different jurisdictions of the country. It seems extraordinary to me that there are different ages, different processes and different procedures for fundamental issues which attach to the citizenry. One of those is search and entry. It is an aggressive power and the fact that it is exercised differentially in Australia is not something to be proud of. I hope that the principles that have been laid down will prove to be a great advance for our country.
The effect of these principles will, I think, also be welcomed by the agencies concerned. Frankly, most of the people who came before us impressed me with their desire to be guided by better standards and a better approach to the powers they have. I felt that numbers of them were uncomfortable with having to exercise power which they recognised was capable of being abused in the wrong hands or with the wrong processes. That was not universally so, of course. I got the impression from some of the witnesses that they rather enjoyed the powers they were given. A brief check list of some of the organisations in federal authority which have these powers includes: the Australian Customs Service; the Australian Federal Police; the Australian National Audit Office; the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission; the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation; the Australian Taxation Office; the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre; the Director of Public Prosecutions; the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, which I think should get a special mention as being appalling in their use of these powers; the Health Insurance Commission; the National Crime Authority, which I feel needs a great deal more restraint; the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme; the National Registration Authority; and then the non-government agencies, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the trade union movement. 
If the powers of search and entry are so widespread in our society and are replicated in the states and territories, it really is important that our most fundamental area of protection—which is our home, principally, but also our person and our personal business—should have guidelines and principles framing it to assist the state in going about its legitimate statutory duties. So for me, the production of this report, which has had a long and weary gestation, is the Senate acting as a practical guardian of principles which affect Australians. This is not an idealistic report; this is a very practical, workable document, based on the experience of agencies which have employed these powers and based on the development of law and principles as a result of the experience of their exercise. The recommendations in this report are the sorts of recommendations that any government should take up. I do not see that there is much that is controversial here. I think there is a great deal to be applauded.
There are those who should take note of the report. Amongst them are business organisations, directors of public prosecutions, heads of police unions, law departments of universities, the chief justices, the bar associations, the criminal law associations, other law associations and councils, law reform commissions, speakers and presidents of upper and lower houses, attorneys-general, civil liberties organisations and other scrutiny of rights committees. In other words, let's spread the message, particularly to those of our senators who have responsibility in the portfolios affected by this report. I thank the Chairman of the committee, Senator Cooney, and commend him for an excellent piece of work. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-04-06,"—I present the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services on the provisions of the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Bill 2000, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and submissions.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate the tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services
As Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, I wish to present our report on the Superannuation (Entitlements of same sex couples) Bill 2000 together with the submissions received and the proof Committee Hansards of the two public hearings held on 3rd and 13th  March 2000.
Under our Terms of Reference, the Committee was required to examine the provisions of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to remove discrimination against same sex couples in respect of superannuation benefits.
The Bill would effectively put same sex relationships on the same basis as heterosexual relationships and therefore the Bill is initiating significant social change.  The Bill will:
repeal the definition of `spouse' in subsection 10 (1) of the SIS Act;
repeal the definition of `dependant' in subsection 10(1) of the SIS Act and substitute the definition so that `dependant' in relation to a person would include `the spouse, de facto partner, and any child of the person or of the person's spouse or de facto partner;'
insert into subsection 10(1) of the SIS Act a definition of `de facto partner' so that in relation to a person , `de facto partner' means `a person who, whether or not of the same gender as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis as a partner of the person;' 
add to subsection 52(2) of the SIS Act a provision to prevent discrimination in relation to a beneficiary `on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, transgender status, marital status, family responsibilities, religion, political opinion or social origin.'
The Bill exempts Commonwealth public sector and defence force superannuation schemes established under the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 from the application of the above amendments.
On the whole, we found that there was considerable support for the objectives of the Bill, coupled with significant concern about the existence of discrimination against same sex couples.  Nonetheless, the Committee received a small number of submissions in opposition to the Bill. Certainly feelings run high about this Bill and the need for reform to address discrimination in general.
The issues are extremely complex and involve significant ethical issues.
Consequently, the Committee was divided as to its final conclusions and recommendations.  
Firstly, all members of the Committee consider that there are a number of shortcomings in the provisions of the Bill which warrant further attention and that without significant amendment to the proposed definitions in the bill, there could be some serious unintended consequences. For example, the definitions as proposed may cause problems in the areas of annuities and insurance premiums where there currently exists positive discrimination in favour of women.  The removal of the word 'spouse' may also have ramifications for other legislation recently passed.
However, the majority of the Committee (Labor and Democrat Senators) consider that the resolution of these issues is possible through negotiations with the stakeholders and that these issues should not unnecessarily hinder the passage of the Bill.
Secondly, all Committee members noted that the Bill as drafted exempts Commonwealth public sector and defence force schemes. The Government members of the Committee also note that amending the proposed legislation to remove the exemption of Commonwealth public sector and defence force schemes from the provisions of the Bill will only be achieved at a cost to the Commonwealth. 
Thirdly, all Committee members noted that inequities in the taxation treatment of the entitlements of same sex couples to superannuation benefits are not addressed by the Bill, and that the Bill  does not address the inequitable treatment of persons of the same sex in relation to social security payment eligibility.  As such, amendments to both taxation and social security legislation would be required to remove discrimination in the treatment of same sex couples in respect to superannuation. 
Fourthly, all members of the Committee agreed that the legislation should not apply retrospectively, if the Bill were to be passed. 
Finally, all members of the Committee accept that many in the community acknowledge the existence of discrimination and are anxious for change and that this Bill is seen as an incremental step in an overall process of change.  
Arising out of these differing conclusions, the Committee was therefore unable to agree on all recommendations. The majority of the Committee (Labor and Democrat members) recommend that:
a maximum period of one month be given for advice to be sought from stakeholders, including the superannuation industry, on how best to draft appropriate amendments to the Bill to avoid the possibility of unintended consequences and that the Bill then be passed;
the Bill should not apply retrospectively; 
the Government establish a Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee, coordinated by the Attorney-General's Department, to examine the full range of Commonwealth legislation with respect to discrimination on the basis of same sex relationships.
The Government Senators are not in agreement with all of these recommendations.
As noted previously, we agree that the Bill should not apply retrospectively and that the Government should establish a Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee, coordinated by the Attorney-General's Department, to examine the full range of Commonwealth legislation with respect to discrimination. 
However, the Government Senators do not believe that this review should be confined to examining discrimination associated with the superannuation entitlements of same sex couples, but rather such a study should take a more holistic view of removing discrimination in other areas. We believe that such a review should take into account the likely impact on traditional families and traditional values. We do not consider that superannuation should be the 'lead vehicle' for the implementation of the significant social change envisaged in this Bill. 
Consequently, we do not agree that the Bill as currently drafted should be passed because of its limitations and the need to consider this area of reform in a holistic way.
The Committee also notes that the Australian Democrats in addition to supporting the Labor Senators' recommendations, have included some further comments in the Committee's report.
Before concluding my remarks, I would like to thank my colleagues Senators Allison, Chapman, Conroy, Hogg, Lightfoot and Sherry for the co-operative and diligent approach which they have brought to the inquiry.
I would also like to thank the Secretariat for their work—Sue Morton, Robyn Hardy, Celia Tancred and Saxon Patience.
Lastly, I would like to thank each and every witness who came before the Committee and those individuals and organisations who contributed to the inquiry through attendance at the hearings, providing submissions and by way of correspondence and e-mails.  
I commend our report to the Chamber.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (ENTITLEMENTS OF SAME SEX COUPLES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of Superannuation and Financial Services Committee</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-04-06,"—From the outset, I declare an interest in this committee report, being a gay man, a superannuant and somebody who has been in a long-term relationship. Having said that, I wonder how many heterosexual couples feel compelled to make that preamble when they speak on superannuation in the general sense. This issue is of burning interest to many people, not only to lesbian and gay couples. It goes to the very core of much of the discrimination which same sex couples experience, and it was that which the committee was investigating. In particular, it was looking at superannuation.
As I said in my first speech, when I was new to the chamber, this is a particular sore point for many in the lesbian and gay community on the basis that payment of superannuation is, for the most part, compulsory—that is, as working citizens we are compelled to comply with superannuation laws and to contribute. Yet having been compelled to contribute our personal funds to superannuation companies or through the Commonwealth, we find that we are then directly and unashamedly discriminated against in terms of those payouts in relation to death benefits. So you have, for example, the scenario with a same sex couple where, no matter how long they have been together, whether it was two years or 25 years, if one partner should die and he or she is a superannuant, the surviving partner is not eligible to receive that superannuation money as a death benefit. I really find that appalling. I cannot understand how anybody can argue in any way that there is some validity in or justification for that. 
We heard through much of the committee process looking into this particular bill, which originated in the House of Representatives, from those opponents of the bill. I do note that there were only four, possibly five, out of a total of some 1,200 submissions, who were strongly opposed to the bill. They were the usual suspects and presented the standard arguments based not on reason but, frankly, on homophobia, religious intolerance and bigotry. Indeed, I have heard American commentators talk recently of the need to remove the word `homophobia' from the language and replace it with `homo-hatred' on the basis that it is more accurate.
We have heard very often that it is essential to deny gay and lesbian people their human rights, including their human and civil rights to superannuation, because that somehow strengthens the family unit. It is beyond my comprehension how families can be strengthened by beating up on gay and lesbian people, whether it is administratively, financially or through direct discrimination. However, in noting that, I read through the conclusions of the committee that, in essence, the majority of the committee is supportive of the bill. Conclusion 6.1, for example, makes the bold statement that the committee concludes in the majority report—although I note that the government senators produced a minority report—that `discrimination against same sex couples can no longer be tolerated'. Hear, hear, I say; but if it is to be the case that we are no longer going to tolerate discrimination against same sex couples, then we need to do something about it. 
There have been numerous attempts through the parliament, including through the Senate, to redress this issue, the most comprehensive of course being the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the Spender bill, the Sexuality Discrimination Bill. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President McKiernan, that you will recall that committee. I think it was in fact the first time we really met, when you were in Perth chairing that committee. I was there discreetly and confidently giving evidence, only to find that I was on the front page of the West Australian the following day, having been accused of outing members of the Court government, which I had not done. That is neither here nor there. As I said, that was the nation's first and most comprehensive investigation into sexuality discrimination. The committee's report is rich with information which, as you will recall, dealt with the topic of superannuation. So to some extent I am quite exasperated by the fact that here we are once more looking into the issue of same sex couples, and in this case superannuation, and coming up with a range of conclusions which are unnecessarily hazy.
Mr Acting Deputy President, when I was at a national conference of the Democrats party some months ago, there were a number of corporate businesspeople and lobbyists there and a large number of them came up to me and wanted to speak about the issue of superannuation. I pointed out to them that I was not the Democrats spokesperson on superannuation and they said, `Yes, but we particularly want to talk to you about the way in which it discriminates against same sex couples. We know you have a particular interest in that and we just want to put it on the record that, as a corporation, we support this. We oppose the discrimination that exists against gay and lesbian people. We do not understand why the government do not move on this. We think it is perfectly justified.' I thanked them for their comments and encouraged them to talk to the government.
I note, too, that through the committee process into this bill, and in its report and recommendations, the fact is noted that many large financial corporations, AMP being just one of them, are singing the same chorus. They are all saying, `Look, we do not have a problem with this. This is the 21st century. This discrimination is unjustified. This is a basic civil and human rights issue. Something ought to be done.' This bill is only one of those steps towards that. I note, for example, that this bill originated in the House of Representatives, tabled by Mr Anthony Albanese, the member for Grayndler, who has a large gay and lesbian constituency in his New South Wales electorate. But I also note with some sadness that this bill did not originate from a frontbencher in the opposition, nor from the opposition spokesperson on superannuation. So I am a little cynical about the way in which this has eventuated, and I would much rather see the Labor Party be front-footed on this issue.
I note also that the bill, although it originated in the House of Representatives, does not expand to include Commonwealth employees. So there is this flaw in the bill in as much as the vast majority of working people, those in the civil service, would not be covered or protected by this. I understand the technical and constitutional reason for that. Without knowing the full and proper wording for this, I understand that technically the bill could not extend itself to the Commonwealth. But I believe that can be addressed. When that was explored by the committee I understand that the committee indicated that there would perhaps be some technical difficulty in doing that anyway if we were to go down the path of properly recognising same sex couples for the purposes of superannuation. I totally reject that, Mr Acting Deputy President. I do not see that there is any great difficulty with this at all. 
I think it comes back to the key argument that what really needs to be amended here is the Commonwealth's superannuation act. Quite simply, it means we need to address the definitions of spouses and partners that exist in the act. That is the fundamental problem at its heart. `Spouse' is defined to mean opposite sex partners, as is marriage, understandably; but the general term `partner' is specifically deemed to be opposite sex partners only. There have been some test cases, if you like, to try and test these definitions, the most celebrated one being that of Mr Brown in Melbourne who argued that, under the definitions of the superannuation clause, he was living in a marriage-like relationship, although not legally married. The tribunal in that case found that that was not an adequate coverage or adequate protection, therefore he was denied the right to a death benefit through superannuation from the loss of his then partner of several years. It was a tragic case but is not the only one by any means. 
I recall clearly that in I think it was the 1996 campaign, the one in which Prime Minister Howard was ultimately and initially successful, there was a television debate on Channel 9 which Ray Martin chaired. There was a period where there was a range of questions fired backwards and forwards to both then Prime Minister Keating and opposition leader, Mr Howard. One of the questions which Mr Ray Martin threw in was, `Do you support the notion of gay marriage?' It was interesting to watch what followed from that, because both men fell over themselves in terms of their hypocrisy, both claiming very strongly, `No, we do not support the notion of gay marriage,' an agenda, I should add, that has never been advocated by the gay and lesbian community. It was a Ray Martin agenda. But to follow up, both men said that while they did not support the notion of gay marriage, at the same time they did not support discrimination against gay and lesbian people. In truth, we cannot end discrimination against gay and lesbian people until we address the discrimination that exists with gay and lesbian people in terms of their relationships. Superannuation is just one part of it. There is so much more work to be done, whether it is in relocation expenses, discrimination in the ADF or the police forces and a wider range of discriminatory practices that exist in the Commonwealth. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-04-06,"—Yesterday I was talking about the fringe benefits tax and the impact it has on service personnel, and what a serious problem this was, and also the conflicting advice that the shadow minister, Mr Laurie Ferguson, had received from Senator Newman and Mr Scott. I ended up by saying that it is quite surprising that these two ministers do not seem to communicate with each other. The government has tried to clean up this mess by arguing that the fringe benefits reporting exemption is unrelated to the issue of child support liabilities. This claim is totally refuted by the government's media release of 19 August, which specifically referred to child support liabilities. Furthermore, on the following day, 20 August 1999, the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, issued a separate media release welcoming the government's announcement of the previous day. His release included this statement:
The decision to exempt housing assistance will address the primary concerns of ADF families about the effect on take home pay due to loss of Government benefits and increased payments such as child support.
To any fair-minded person, reading these two media releases would have given defence personnel the impression that the value of their subsidised housing would not be considered in determining any child support liability. Seven months later we are fed the preposterous proposition that the two issues are totally unrelated. This whole situation is obviously a total debacle. I really think the two ministers should get together and sort out what the actual advice is. I totally agree with the shadow minister when he said:
The Prime Minister must clarify without delay whether housing assistance to Defence personnel has really been `totally exempted'--or whether their take home pay will continue to suffer due to loss of Government benefits and increased payments such as child support. 
To this date, neither Minister Scott nor Minister Moore has seen fit to respond to the opposition's latest revelations. This has done nothing to clarify the position of our serving men and women in the Defence Force.
There are areas other than housing that will be hit by the FBT. They include things such as the living away from home allowance, travel entitlement, remote locality allowance, reunion travel, spouse emergency travel and other small but important benefits defence force personnel receive. The government seems to have washed its hands of the issue after saying housing would be exempt. Unfortunately, the government does not recognise that these other benefits help to compensate for the impact of defence force life. These other benefits help compensate for the frequent transfers, the frequent changing of schools for children and other major impacts on family life. It really is time the government sorts out this terrible mess, which is having a negative impact on the morale of the Australian Defence Force. Like on so many other issues, the government is too stubborn to admit that it has made a mistake in this area. The government has shown it has little understanding of issues affecting personnel in the defence forces.
The government's continual dithering on this issue has meant we are in danger of losing many of our trained defence force personnel. Just last week, the Australian National Audit Office released a performance audit detailing the retention of military personnel in the Australian Defence Force. As part of the audit, the Audit Office interviewed 236 Australian Defence Force members about issues relating to personnel retention. One of the issues that those defence personnel identified as affecting retention was housing. In general, the personnel interviewed said that in recent times there had been a considerable improvement in the housing situation. But, while the soldiers themselves have been finding an improvement in the housing situation recently, the government has been punishing them financially, reducing their access to various benefits. Retaining our defence force personnel is a very important issue. The people who risk their lives to defend this country are one of our most valuable assets. We should not underestimate the crucial national role performed by the service personnel across this country. Not only are they there to defend us in times of war; they are also there to play important humanitarian and antiterrorist roles and to evacuate Australian citizens from anywhere in the world at a moment's notice. 
The Audit Office realises this. The report recommended that action be taken towards assessing personnel replacement costs to help guide decisions on resources to be applied to career management and personnel retention, establishing a management framework that details retention policies and assigns responsibility for personnel retention, promoting the services and assistance available to Australian Defence Force members and their families, evaluating the cost effectiveness of quality of life measures designed to avoid separations from the Australian Defence Force, developing a system for gaining a good understanding of the factors that motivate members to remain in the Australian Defence Force and making recruitment more effective in gaining long-term members of the Australian Defence Force and in retaining recruits for cost-effective periods. 
All of those recommendations are quite sensible. I hope they can in time be fully adopted. But I would like to point out in particular the third and fourth recommendations. Those recommendations related specifically to promoting the services and assistance available to personnel and their families and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of measures designed to retain personnel. I have been told by numerous defence force personnel that these changes to the fringe benefits tax are going to make it even harder for them to stay in the Defence Force. I wonder whether the government has any idea that these people have valuable skills outside of the Defence Force. Does the government have any idea that a lot of these personnel can earn higher wages outside of the forces? Certainly these changes seem to indicate that the government has absolutely no concept of these issues. 
Despite the contradictions raised by the shadow minister, we have heard nothing on this issue from either Mr Moore or Mr Scott, as I said before. Maybe they think the issue has gone away. It has not. The sooner this situation is sorted out, the better it will be for everybody.  ",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-04-06,"—I rise to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1999-2000 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1999-2000. I wish to speak about the abandonment of regional, rural and remote communities in Queensland. This government has withdrawn services, and it has not stopped there. Not only has it continued to withdraw its services, but it has failed to provide adequate infrastructure. The government has not taken a proactive role and stepped in where it needs to. 
This government has set about to systematically dismantle government services to rural and regional Queensland. It has underpinned this withdrawal of services with policies that promote business to follow suit. It does not nurture business, nor is it sensitive to the needs of the rural communities. Instead, it plays politics with the sale of assets. In my travels around Queensland to places like St George, Emerald, Roma, Monto, Charleville and others too numerous to mention—I guess I will be in trouble for not mentioning all of the places I have travelled to and lived in, in regional and rural Queensland--it is clear to me that the policies the government has adopted are underpinning the shift from rural to urban areas. The attitude this government has demonstrated by not supporting rural and regional Queensland will only exacerbate the current service differential. 
People in these communities are not unrealistic. They understand only too well that there are benefits in living in urban populations. They understand only too well that there is, and always will be in some respects, a different lifestyle and different expectations. But what they are dismayed at and complain about--in a fair tone, I must say--is that there seems to be a great gulf developing between the urban populations and the rural and regional community. The situation is at the point where it is being demonstrated very noisily that the advantages of living in rural and regional Queensland--particularly in the great places that do exist in Queensland--are becoming fewer and fewer. People are contemplating shifts from the rural to the regional areas, and even to the urban areas. 
People in these communities do not expect the government to step in at all times. They are realistic about what governments can do. They are dismayed that this government is not prepared to listen carefully to their concerns and to act proactively to address them. People in these communities make it clear to me that the growth in urban Queensland should not be at their expense; that they should receive some benefits of that growth. It seems clear now that this will not occur either in the short-term or the long-term whilst this government continues with the policies it promotes. The non-interventionist policies of this government are causing hardship. The government is allowing services in rural Queensland to be run down. But the communities in rural Queensland are not blind. They understand only too well that if some of these service were made available it would vastly improve their lifestyle and, more importantly, their ability to engage in businesses in competitive and innovative ways. 
Many businesses in rural communities could compete more effectively if the lack of services were positively addressed, rather than the government hoping there will be a trickle-down effect which will supposedly lift up regional and rural Queensland. These policies are not working. A recognition that these policies are not working is what is called for by this government. The government should intervene with positive policies to address the lack of services that is out there.
It is not a case of hoping that the trickle-down effect will spread out so that the urban sprawl will then continue out into regional and rural Queensland. People out there are realistic. They understand that will not happen. They were told it would happen, and that is what they find very disappointing. They were told that the trickle-down effect would spread not necessarily the urban sprawl out to regional and rural Queensland—they quite accept that—but they understood there would be spin-offs that might allow their businesses to grow and be competitive, and that is just not happening. The programs that have been talked about are mere puffery. Obviously rural and regional Queensland want to share in such economic benefits as improved education, training, access to universities, improved health services, telecommunications and the delivery of online services. It is not a case of saying that the gulf is too wide, that it should not even be attempted to be bridged. They are listening for an indication that this government is sensitive to their concerns and their needs. They are not saying, `Come out with a bucket of money and put it into regional and rural Queensland.' They understand only too well that that is not about to happen. What they expect to hear from this government is, `We will target our policies; we will assist in programs that will reach out and try to bridge some of the gulf that divides.' They also understand that the urban population has to address regional Queensland in a decentralised and proactive way. They also understand that the urban areas require addressing. They understand that. They come to the cities and understand what is going on and that governments have to deal with urban populations. But they say, `Also, while you are dealing with those, understand that we have concerns as well.' 
A Senate committee produced a report, Riding the waves of change. It recognised that rural communities were being subjected to a variety of impacts which were not only economic but social as well. The impacts of national competition policy, general micro-economic reform and the effects of globalisation are taking their toll in regional and rural Queensland. They are eroding the social cohesion of some communities. The social costs and benefits that arise are being devalued by economic objectives such as productivity and efficiency. This government needs to urgently address the matters raised in that report, among other matters I have spoken about this morning—issues such as ensuring that the national competition policy agenda is oversighted and that this government is taking an interest in the impact of national competition policy on areas such as employment and the lack of training being provided in regional and rural Queensland. 
Employees are too easily overlooked. But if you do not have motivated, skilled employees living in and wanting to work in regional Queensland, the greatest businesses in the world will not thrive and flourish. The spark for new ideas to be spawned out in regional and rural Queensland will not be found; nor will there be the motivation for employees to provide the multiplier effect and create vibrant businesses. Employees who are retrenched by councils because of the lack of support by federal government—because NCP is driving outcomes—will depart from those regions. Then incomes are lost from communities; families are taken from regional and rural Queensland. They say, `If we can't find long-term employment in these regions, we are better off moving to urban places to find employment or at least to benefit from some of the services that urban communities can provide.' It has a knock-on effect. If a council retrenches employees, if businesses find it is easier not to employ new staff, not to encourage skills or provide training for new staff, you then have a knock-on effect, as I have just said. What happens is that no-one goes into the child-care centres, no-one goes into the schools. The local hospitals when they do their numbers find they are limited in the services they can provide because of funding shortfalls. The community suffers. It can suffer more dramatically because, where you have small communities—around 5,000 is bandied about as a nice number, or even where you have fewer than that—as soon as you take even one family out of that community, you have a knock-on effect in the whole community. You then end up with a slow slide. The community knows that and feels that and there is a depressed feeling. It is certainly not a vibrant feeling you get when you go out and talk to these people. But they do understand.
The shadow minister for regional development, infrastructure, transport and regional services recently cited an initiative in a recent report which would see the return of some of these services to regional Australia. When you talk to people in regional Australia, they say, `Well, why not? Some of these initiatives might just provide that spark.' It would have the effect of putting services and government jobs into regional Australia. But the report did not even hit the deck. The shadow minister reported to the other chamber, but it was dismissed overnight. It did not even manage to find favour anywhere, not even with the government or the National Party. Instead, to date, we get six regional transaction centres—one in Queensland and a couple on the drawing board to replace the loss of services occurring in those areas. Wouldn't it be better to empower these regions? This government has lost the trust of regional Queensland, and time is running out for this government, as the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services states quite clearly. The report is aptly named, I think—Time is running out. This report only serves to highlight the fundamental mismanagement of the programs for revitalising regional Queensland. In fact, what this government is doing—which will harm regional Queensland—is introducing a goods and services tax. But all we get is rhetoric. 
Senator Macdonald mentioned his interest in Northern Australia and even mentioned large infrastructure projects that I note he has raised in a number of press releases that he has put out. One of his press releases lists a minefield of extensive projects—the Burdekin Dam extension; the Bradfield scheme; the Tully Millstream electricity project; the PNG to Brisbane natural gas pipeline; a gas pipeline from the Timor Sea to the east coast; the Outback Highway from Winton to Laverton; a northern development road from Cairns around the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Top End and on to Darwin; the completion of the Darwin to Alice railway; the Melbourne to Darwin railway through inland New South Wales and Queensland; a road from Alice to Broome; alternative energy projects in the north-west of Western Australia, which is obviously over the other side of Australia; and the Ord River scheme, which too is outside of Queensland. 
—It's a bridge too far.
—It certainly is. What we find is that Senator Macdonald puts all of these projects out there and says, `Well, they're out there.' But that is where they are. Where is this government saying, `These are the initiatives that we are going to then look at; these are the ones that we are going to address; this is the program we are going to put in place'? Where is the strategic plan of this government to address some of these issues, to prioritise them, to say, `Let's look at the ones that will make the most difference, that will give the area a competitive advantage, that will help rural, regional and other areas of Queensland'? Where is the forward thinking minister on these issues? Nowhere. All we can find are press releases about what is out there.
What is clear is that some of those projects are worthy of consideration. In addition, if Senator Ian Macdonald went out there and started to talk to people in Queensland and in other states, I suspect the same might occur and he might find others that are worthy of mention. It is not a case of just simply spraying around and saying, `I'll listen to all of them. I'll write them in a press release, and I will shoot it out.' What we really need to hear about is a strategic plan that is put down, looked at and considered. This government should play a proactive role and not just simply say, `I'll put out a press release, and I will put them in print and maybe I will get a bit of a glad feeling about it all.'
In my view, there is no doubt that the minister should get serious about these things. Instead, what we sometimes get is the minister coming out with a manual aimed at promoting recreational activities for Brisbane's older adults, which was the case in a recent press release the minister put out. I can understand that it is very important for the Brisbane City Council to deal with Brisbane's older adults; it is certainly very important for them to talk about promoting recreational activities. These are of great importance to them. What regional and rural Queensland want to hear are his views on, or his step-by-step guide about, how his government can help regional and rural Queensland. No doubt we will get—and we should get—a step-by-step manual on business opportunities in regional Queensland and a step-by-step guide on employment and training opportunities and other matters that people in regional and rural Queensland are crying out for to be addressed by this minister. It is certainly a matter that should be considered, dealt with and put high on the government's agenda. I await with extraordinary interest for that to occur. 
We find in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services report Time running out: shaping regional Australia's future that people are concerned about telecommunications. When I travel around regional and rural Queensland—I guess you would call it a complaint, although sometimes that would be putting it at too high a level—I find that people are concerned about the lack of mobile coverage. They are concerned about the basic telephone service. They understand that they are in regional and rural Queensland, but what they are looking forward to is positive action from this government on how it is going to address their needs. If they do not have reasonable access, if they do not have proper service, then the lack of these services will be telling in their business ventures. Businesses will go unrealised and opportunities and employment, as a consequence, will go unrealised. The report that I mentioned earlier says:
To date, the high capital costs associated with rolling out telecommunication services to regional Australia have generally deterred investment in infrastructure beyond that required to fulfil the universal service obligation.
It is commonly called the USO. To continue:
The USO is the telecommunications safety net for basic telephony and advanced telecommunications (ie access to a particular level of bandwidth).
They understand what this report is telling them: that there is generally deterred investment in infrastructure beyond that required to fulfil the universal service obligation. And even then they worry that they are going to get the USO.
The report deals with information technology at chapter 6, `Developing regional competitive advantage'. This refers to the matters I spoke about earlier. In short, where you can have information technology being developed in regional areas then they can gain a competitive advantage. There are some very bright people in regional and rural Queensland who like the lifestyle, who understand that the lifestyle is important but who also want to contribute to the growth and investment in Australia. They want to contribute positively. They want to create a business environment that can nurture and employ people in regional Queensland and that allows regional Queensland to participate in the growth that Australia enjoys in some of its urban areas. 
On that point I will conclude—although it is a point I will come back to at other opportunities to discuss this very important report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services and the ability of this government to address the recommendations. I call on the minister, Ian Macdonald, to take the bull by its horns and to start looking at some of these issues in a proactive way and to say, `It is not enough to simply mouth off about these matters in press releases; it is important to sit down and progress them in order'--a chronology of some of the matters in the projects I have covered today is worth looking at--and not simply spray about them, but go forward and actually look at a strategic plan—a proper look at what needs to be done to address some of the shortfalls—and be proactive about it, because that is what Labor will do.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-04-06,"—There have been a number of issues raised by senators in dealing with these bills. There is one point that I do think needs addressing, and that is the point made by Senator Carr in relation to Greenwich University. Senator Carr knows full well that there is an inquiry pending in relation to this university.
—Because of the incompetence of Senator Macdonald 
—Quite unfairly, and incorrectly, Senator Carr accused Senator Macdonald of incompetence in relation to this matter. Senator Macdonald is the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. What Senator Carr was dealing with was the question of maintaining standards in education. That has nothing to do with Senator Macdonald's portfolio. Senator Macdonald has handled this in the most appropriate manner. The establishment of a university on Norfolk Island is a matter for the Norfolk Island government, but I think that, for the record, the Senate should know that Greenwich University applied to be accredited on the AQF, which is where we maintain a list of accredited universities and institutions and the standards that we would require of those bodies. To suggest that that is the responsibility of Senator Macdonald is totally wrong. It is not. Dr Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, who does have responsibility in this area, has taken this matter on board. In fact, there is an inquiry into the Greenwich University, and Senator Carr has conceded that. The government is considering this issue in an entirely appropriate manner. I think Senator Carr does a disservice to the tertiary education sector by saying that Greenwich University is an example of the lack of standards in this country in relation to tertiary education. It is not. The tertiary education sector in Australia is one that is respected worldwide; so much so that we have people coming to this country to study. The situation is that we have an education system that we can be proud of. 
Senator Carr also said that it was possible to use the term `university' without any sanction or check. I need to advise the Senate that all states and mainland territories of Australia protect the use of the term `university' in legislation regulating the use of business names. In addition to this level of protection, four states have specific education legislation that protects the use of the term directly. I refer to New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria. These states, plus the Northern Territory and South Australia, also regulate the offering of higher education awards. The Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia regulate the establishment and operation of universities solely by policy.
Arrangements are now in place in all jurisdictions for the corporate affairs agencies responsible for the approval of business names to seek advice from the relevant education and accreditation agency before approving a business name that includes the title `university'. The national protocols for higher education approval processes, which were agreed last week by the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, specify that all jurisdictions should provide legislative and administrative protection for the title `university'. The protocols specified that the relevant higher education authority should undertake an investigation of the educational credentials of an applicant before providing advice on the use of the title `university' in a business or corporate name. That council also agreed that Dr Kemp, the federal minister for education, as chair of MCEETYA, would write to the chair of the Ministerial Council for Corporations, confirming the importance of controlling the use of the title in business names and continuing the cooperation of corporate affairs officers in consulting with the relevant education agency before approving use of the title.
I add that trade practices legislation also protects against misleading and deceptive conduct. The national protocols that I have mentioned and the new Australian Universities Quality Agency will strengthen the protection of Australian higher education and enhance its reputation internationally. That totally refutes the assertion by Senator Carr that there is no regulation and no assurance of quality in this area. The government has acted, with other state and territory governments, to ensure that you just cannot use the term `university'. In fact, I think Senator Carr said that there was somebody who was using the term and operating out of a `grog' shop, or some shop somewhere. I can say to the Senate that what I have outlined here is protection and assurance in relation to the highly regarded reputation of Australia's education sector. Senator Carr's comments on this subject have been quite wrong and, in fact, are scare tactics. They do no service to the education sector in this country. Apart from that, I thank other senators for their contributions, and I commend these bills to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-04-06,"—I rise to speak on the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999. In doing so, I have to express my gratitude at the outset that this area of government policy is not within the control of Senator Macdonald. If it were I would be very concerned about the state of our fisheries into the future. But, having said that, I indicate that the opposition is prepared to support the passage of the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999. It is a very important bill in that it introduces further new measures for the monitoring and control of foreign and domestic fishing operations. Indeed, this bill follows on from changes which have been implemented in previous legislation, including the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Act 1999 and the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999. 
There is, of course, a significant problem with respect to ensuring that any operations carried out by either foreign fishing vessels or domestic fishing vessels within our territorial waters are conducted legally. Unfortunately, as has been highlighted over more recent years, there has been an increase in illegal foreign fishing activity in our fishing zone. Australia has therefore had to take action to protect this vital industry and also to ensure our rights under international obligations, particularly the Fish Stocks Agreement, are protected. This legislation has a number of provisions directed towards that end. Firstly, it will enable observers to be placed on foreign fishing vessels operating in international waters where such observers are authorised by a treaty or agreement to which Australia is a party. That, of course, is an important measure. It will enable Australian observers to be in a position to check on the activities of foreign fishing vessels and ensure that they are not illegally fishing or, particularly, overfishing the stocks outside our fishing zone.
Another provision is to extend the definition of foreign fishing boats so that that includes support vessels and vessels not originally designed for fishing. There has been a growing practice of using mother ships as a means of ensuring that fishing boats can stay in a fishing zone for longer periods and boats that were not originally designed as fishing vessels being subsequently altered to enable fishing to occur. It is important, therefore, that the definition of a foreign fishing boat in the legislation is broadened to incorporate those changes. Otherwise, those sorts of vessels may, after they have been converted or used in that way, be acting illegally but may not necessarily be caught by the appropriate legislation. The legislation also provides for an increase in the penalty for providing false or misleading information about how much fish has been taken. There is a substantial increase from the current figure of $6,600 to $27,500. The legislation will require fishers to collect data on bycatch of fish and non-fish species, including sea birds. This issue of bycatch is one that is prominent in the whole debate about fishery sustainability. The legislation will require appropriate data to be collected to ensure that the fishing industry itself and AFMA—the Australian Fisheries Management Authority—have the appropriate data to develop their management plans to minimise incidental catch and to ensure sustainability. 
We discussed yesterday some issues regarding the fishing industry with respect to the Northern Prawn Fishery. As was demonstrated yesterday—indeed, as we are all aware—this is a vitally important industry to our economy. It is an industry that has great potential if it is managed properly. It is therefore one which all of us could debate at some length in this chamber. However, time is short today and I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting the passage of this bill. I understand that the Democrats will be moving an amendment. The opposition will not be supporting that amendment, but I will leave any further remarks to that part of the debate. ",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-04-06,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 encompasses a range of measures that will improve and tighten regulations in relation to the operation of foreign fishing boats, requirements for sustainable fishing management plans, record keeping and increased penalties for a range of offences. They complement measures introduced in the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) and the Border Protection Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. These measures have been well and truly outlined in the House of Representatives Hansard and I do not propose to comprehensively cover these again here in the Senate. The one bone of contention in this bill seems to have been in relation to the new measures that the bill introduces with regard to bycatch data collection. As indicated in the Bills Digest, the bill contains a proposed change to section 17(6D) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 relating to the incidental catch of fish and non-fish species: 
The problem with the proposed new section 17(6D) is that, due to definitional issues, it doesn't appear to reflect at least the spirit of the 1999 National Policy on Fisheries By-catch, The By-catch policy, which has been agreed to by all Governments, including the Commonwealth, provides that implementation actions should aim to `ensure the widest adoption of by-catch mitigation measures'. While the Commonwealth has yet to release its detailed implementation plan, there seems no reason why section 17(6D) shouldn't be fully consistent with the definitional terms used in the By-catch policy in relation to `incidental catch' and `by-catch'.
The Democrats remain concerned that this bill does not seek or try to water down in any way or back away from the commitments of the 1999 National Policy on Fisheries Bycatch. The bill departs from the definition of `bycatch' from that of the draft Commonwealth bycatch policy and the national bycatch policy. The term `incidental catch' is defined very narrowly in the bycatch policy as having commercial value, whereas `bycatch' is defined more broadly. We believe the Commonwealth one—that is, the national definition—ought to be used as it is both a good definition and provides for consistency in definitions, ensuring maximum clarity for the industry.
I also note that is also the position of Humane Society International, HSI, a tremendous, reputable environmental organisation with a particular focus on marine life. It too argues that the Commonwealth/national definitions of bycatch ought to be used as they are better definitions and provide the consistency and clarity of which I spoke. To that end, I propose that when we are in the committee stage I will present my amendment. I understand at this late stage that it has not attracted the support of the government or the opposition, which is disappointing. I want to put on the record that the effect of this amendment is clearly in accord with what the Democrats believe would make this bill better. So I shall move that amendment at the appropriate time. 
In summary, the bill in general has the Democrats' broad support. It continues with what appears to be a range of fisheries related legislation that has appeared of late and which is indicative of an increasingly healthy industry. It is an industry which I have some experience of and a keen interest in.",SENATE,<title>FISHERIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2000-04-06,"—The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 contains a collection of amendments to fisheries legislation and those amendments flow from the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's experience with the administration of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991. As we all know, fisheries management occurs in a dynamic environment and, as a result, there is a need to introduce new provisions to address the evolution of fisheries management. As well, there are requirements to refine various provisions including addressing some anomalies which have been identified by AFMA since its establishment in 1992.
We also note that fishing management is changing to have much more emphasis on echo system management and the need to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment. Recognising this development, this bill contains provisions requiring fisheries management plans to address incidental catches and collection of bycatch data. But Australia cannot manage highly migratory species and straddling stocks in isolation and therefore several provisions in the bill relate to fishing by foreign fishing boats on the high seas adjacent to the Australian Fishing Zone. These foreign vessels' activities may or may not undermine agreed regional fisheries management arrangements such as the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna Arrangements. The proposed measures involve the ability to place observers on foreign fishing boats on the high seas to collect data, and they amend the definition of a foreign fishing boat for the purpose of port access regulation. I understand that in this context the minister, the Hon. Warren Truss, issued today a press release detailing the fact that two Belize flag boats were denied port access because of suspect unregulated fishing activities and that in fact 15 boats have been apprehended since December 1999. 
Several fisheries have moved from management involving limits on the numbers of boats, and on the fishing equipment used, to control outputs in the form of individual transferable quotas. Where these can be implemented, they are the preferred management approach, providing for economic efficiency and at the same time containing catches. Amendments are proposed in two areas to enhance enforcement of quota management that relies on accurate reporting and recording of catches. Firstly, the types of offences for which a penalty infringement notice and on-the-spot fine may be issued are widened to allow an alternative to prosecution for minor transgressions. This may well be a more efficient use of enforcement resources to secure compliance. Secondly, recognising that misreporting of catches is for the purpose of fishing without quota, it is proposed to increase the penalties for providing false and misleading information. The amendment increases fines from $6,600 to $27,500 so that this offence is comparable with unlicensed fishing by a domestic boat. If convicted, the amendment enables a court to order forfeiture of a boat, equipment, catch or the proceeds of the sale of a catch. In response to Senator Greig's proposed amendment: the government will not be supporting the amendment to the bill to be moved by the Democrats, and I will detail the reasons for that at the proper time. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-06,"—The Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999 will facilitate minor amendments to the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997. The amendments will improve the efficiency of the Australian Communications Authority—ACA—in its administration of the act as well as provide some carriage service providers with some administrative efficiencies.
The Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997 provides for imposition of charges in relation to certain telephone numbers allocated to carriage service providers. The amendments contained in this bill concern the definition of a transferred number for the purposes of the act and the date on which the numbering charges are imposed.
As the act stands, carriage service providers who are resellers are liable for annual numbering charges in relation to allocated numbers they hold on the charging date. These resellers, or secondary providers, have usually obtained their numbers from a provider who was allocated the numbers by the ACA, a primary provider. The large number of transfers of numbers from primary to secondary providers greatly adds to the administrative complexity of collecting the charges.
This bill will explicitly define a transfer for the purposes of the act. The effect of this will be that certain number movements from primary to secondary providers will not be classed as transfers for the purposes of the act and will not therefore cause the numbering charge liability to be transferred. This will significantly reduce the number of invoices the ACA has to prepare. 
The effect of the act as it currently stands is that number charges are imposed on 22 May each financial year. Carriage service providers have to pay these by 15 June to ensure that they are processed prior to the end of the financial year. Between these two dates, carriage service providers have to provide details to the ACA of the numbers they hold. The ACA then has to calculate the charges and dispatch the invoices. Then the carriage service providers have to make the payment. These time frames are unnecessarily tight and can increase the risks of miscalculations or errors.
This bill will move the charging date to a day in April which will be determined by the ACA. The ACA will be required to determine the date before 16 February each financial year. This arrangement will provide the ACA with a limited degree of flexibility in setting the date while providing the carriage service providers with a certainty of the date being in April. It is not intended that the ACA will use this flexibility to alter the date arbitrarily. Rather, should it be necessary, it will allow the ACA to determine a date in order to address exceptional circumstances. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-06,"—This is a debate on three bills, and I will deal with them in the order in which they were introduced into the House of Representatives. The Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Amendment Bill 2000 updates the annual heavy vehicle registration charges for the ACT and provides a model for consistent national charges by amending the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993. The 1993 act gave effect to the national charges in the ACT from 1 July 1995 and set the model for other jurisdictions. The Victorian and Northern Territory governments referenced the charging regime in the 1993 act in their own legislation. Other states and the Commonwealth reproduce the system and level of charges in their own legislation. This bill also changes some definitions for charging purposes. 
The second bill, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2000, implements the updated annual heavy vehicle registration charges for federally registered vehicles by amending the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. That 1985 act applies the existing national charges to vehicles registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. This scheme is administered under the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 by the states and territories on the Commonwealth's behalf. New charges for the federally registered vehicles are intended to come into effect on 1 July this year. States and territories are also targeting that date. It ensures that federally registered heavy vehicles continue to pay the same charges as state and territory registered vehicles. 
The third bill, the Interstate Road Transport Amendment Bill 2000, is part of implementing the new charges for federally registered heavy vehicles. It amends definitions in the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 referred to by the other act. 
The opposition is pleased to support these bills. They form part of a system of nationally consistent road transport laws. It is pertinent to remind the Senate that the previous Labor government initiated a national approach to road transport reform in 1991. Road reform got the teeth that it needed with the intergovernmental heavy vehicles agreement in 1991 and then the light vehicles agreement in 1992 and also through the formation in 1991 of the National Road Transport Commission and the valuable work it does to drive reform and keep the industry informed and consulted.  
Labor retains a commitment to achieving a consistent national regulatory framework aimed at improving transport efficiency, improving road safety and reducing the compliance cost of regulation. The current charges were calculated by the NRTC back in 1992, and between 1995 and 1996 were put in place in the various jurisdictions. The updated charges contained in the bill are the first since that time. It appears that there is fairly consistent support for these charges across the states and within the transport industry. I think that is in no small part a result of the consultations that were undertaken by the NRTC and, importantly, an acknowledgment by the heavy vehicle industry of the impact of their vehicles and a preparedness to take responsibility for that damage. 
What we see in the road transport industry associations is some leadership on some of the hard issues--environment, accessible transport and road user charges. However, it is a pity that the responsible minister is not reciprocating on the leadership front. In the House of Representatives, the minister in his second reading speech raised the issue of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grant Scheme. This grant scheme arose out of the deal with the Democrats on the tax package. In the House of Representatives, Labor's shadow minister, Mr Martin Ferguson, went into some detail about the shortcomings of that scheme resulting from the lack of detail and thought about how it would operate in practice. Lack of definition about where the metropolitan or conurbation boundaries would begin and end is a problem. The minister handballed these issues to the Commissioner of Taxation and here we are, five months after the administration and compliance aspects for the scheme were tabled in the House of Representatives and almost 10 months after the government did the original deal with the Democrats on this scheme, and, might I say, the industry is still uncertain about how the scheme will operate and what the boundaries are. 
Having said that, as I said earlier, the opposition will be pleased to support these bills and is prepared to cooperate in their speedy passage through this chamber.",SENATE,<title>ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2000-04-06,"—Yesterday, I had an opportunity to speak about two aspects of charges in relation to road transport and to talk about usage, and today we are talking about access charges which, essentially, are the registration costs. All I want to speak about briefly are some of the anomalies that I see in this legislation. The minister may wish to reply to them. The first one is that throughout the bill and the summary of the bill there is reference to the need for recovery costs to be consistent with articulated vehicles, B-doubles and road trains. It is taken as a fact that at the moment they do not provide the full cost recovery for the damage that they do to our road structure, the roads and bridges and pavements. The NRTC says in the document that it believes that at the moment articulated vehicles are not recovering up to 10 per cent of their costs and road trains and B-doubles up to 20 per cent of their costs. However, under this proposed charging system that is about to be introduced, two- and three-axle trailers will have their costs increased by only two per cent to four per cent, B-doubles will be going up 15 per cent, and road trains will be going up 30 per cent. So there is a significant difference between the heavy vehicle end, where it is acknowledged that 10 per cent is not being recovered now and it is going up 15 per cent, 20 per cent for B-doubles and it is going up 15 per cent, and 20 per cent for road trains and it is going up 30 per cent. Those larger vehicles, particularly in regional and rural Australia, are moving the freight. So I see that some additional costs are going to be incurred by people who want to move goods in that part of the country. 
The second anomaly I see is that, as acknow-ledged in the report, 80 per cent of vehicles will not have their charges increased. Ess-entially, those are the rigid vehicles. Essen-tially again, most of those vehicles operate in the suburban and outer urban areas of Aust-ralia. They carry goods to consumers in those areas. It is acknowledged by the NRTC that, at the moment, rigid vehicles are paying too much registration. However, because of some real `bureaucratese' in the legislation, it says on page 51 or 52 that, if we decided to reduce these costs to be consistent with the fact that they are overrecovering in their costs, it would send a perverse message if we actually reduced the costs of registration of rigid vehicles. I think that is a strange term to use. Nevertheless, that is what is used in the summary of the legislation.  
At the moment, between 18 per cent and 23 per cent of the cost of a good that you receive is related to road transport costs. As a result of these changes—particularly since, over the last few years, there has been a steady increase in articulated vehicles and up to a 21 per cent decrease in rigid vehicles—the costs will keep being incurred at the high-er end where there is more and more freight moved. Equally, people will be penalised in suburban areas, because up to 51 per cent of the freight task is in urban areas. Forty-nine per cent obviously is in non-urban areas. There is going to be no relief for consumers, be-cause rigid vehicle charges are not going down. Because higher vehicles are being more heavily taxed now, there will be increa-sed burdens on consumers and operators.
Equally, something that the federal government and the ministers have agreed to recently was tying the charges to the CPI. I understand that that may increasingly overcompensate or overrecover costs for the use of roads. Once again, I can see that that will flow through to consumers and operators. Those are some of the anomalies that I think are in the legislation. Maybe the minister may wish to reply to them.",SENATE,<title>ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-04-06,"—I thank the two senators who have contributed to this debate. The purpose of the bill was set out in the second reading speech that was tabled and in the explanatory memorandum. Senator O'Brien has also explained in some detail the purpose of the bills, and so I will not do that, except in a very general way.
I thank the previous speaker for his contribution. I know his interest and, dare I say, even expertise in the transport area. What he says he says obviously with the backing of wide experience in the industry. Senator, I am pleased to take your comments on board. Certainly, in our ongoing reform of road transport, what you have said will be considered. You have indicated that the recovery cost by this increase is only to be a small part of the actual cost. I then got a little confused in respect of your third point when you were saying that a CPI increase would overcompensate, and I do not know whether they are contradictory thoughts.
I am advised in relation to your first point that the large rises for B-doubles and road trains are due to inadequate information being available in 1992 when these were last looked at. Data from the ABS survey of motor vehicle usage in updated calculations shows usage underestimated for the heaviest vehicles. This caused the higher increase in the first lot you mentioned. However, lower road costs on remote roads were taken into account for road trains. These charges are acknowledged by the industry—as you would be aware—as being reasonably fair. Certainly, they have been accepted by all of the state transport ministers. I take your point—and I have no reason to doubt you—that 80 per cent of vehicles are basically those rigid vehicles running around in metropolitan areas. Certainly, I will pass on your comments on that to Minister Anderson. Perhaps that is something that could be discussed at future meetings of the road transport ministers.
Senator, you said that 18 per cent to 23 per cent of the cost of goods is in transport. For that reason, I cannot help but ask why you are then not supporting the goods and services tax. But, of course, we know now that your party is, and you are just going to roll it back at the edges. No doubt one of the reasons why you are is that, whilst the fuel concessions do not apply in metropolitan areas, certainly the reductions to transport costs will apply. I hesitate to use the terminology `big trucks', so I will not. You are not talking about big trucks; you are talking about medium sized trucks. Their capital costs will go down by 22 per cent of the wholesale price. There will be a 10 per cent GST added to the retail price. But, because it is always in a business, that 10 per cent will be refunded. So there will be a saving in the capital costs, but not just in the capital costs. From your interest in road transport, you would know that tyres are a huge cost in running a vehicle. Spare parts are also a very significant cost. The cost of most of those, again, should fall by the wholesale sales tax component of the wholesale price. Again, a 10 per cent GST will be added but, because it is a business usage, the 10 per cent will be refunded. So again there should be substantial savings on the cost of tyres, parts and things that currently have a wholesale sales tax. But notwithstanding that, I will make sure that Minister Anderson is aware of your comments. We, of course, always will look forward to contributions from the opposition on ways of getting a better, more efficient and fairer system for our road transport industry. 
Again, I thank senators for their contribution. I commend these bills to the Senate. In doing so, I also extend appreciation to state and territory transport ministers for their contribution and cooperation, and also to the road transport industry as a whole. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-04-06,"—The second reading speech sums up well in its first three paragraphs what this bill is about, and perhaps I will just read them into Hansard:
The Albury-Wodonga Development Act 1973 established the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation—AWDC—to acquire and develop land and other real estate in and around the Albury-Wodonga area. An agreement was also signed at that time between the Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales and Victoria which provided for a new integrated urban complex to be developed in the Albury-Wodonga region.
Those states each established a state corporation to operate in conjunction with the Commonwealth corporation. The Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council, comprising the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian ministers with regional and development responsibilities, was established to provide general oversight and direction to the three corporations and the development scheme in general.
The Commonwealth and the states of New South Wales and Victoria now consider that this approach to regional development in Albury-Wodonga is no longer appropriate. The Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council decided at its 1995 and 1997 meetings to wind up the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and to dispose of all its land and assets, in an orderly manner and without distorting the market. The Albury-Wodonga Development Amendment Bill 1999, which I am introducing— 
this is the minister speaking—
into the House today, puts into effect those decisions.
The opposition supports that. There is an amendment to which Senator Allison will be speaking shortly. I would now like to talk about the fact that this was a great scheme. I would hate this bill to be passed into law and for any implication to be left that the Albury-Wodonga development plan was not a great plan. It was a plan from the Whitlam years, those years when I think people of great vision were ruling the country. I think Mr Whitlam himself was a great visionary and so were his ministers.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember that the minister who was in charge of this was Tom Uren. He has since written a book called Straight Left, and I can confirm that he was both a very straight and a very Left man. Along with the Prime Minister at that time, he was a great visionary. In fact, he came back as a minister under the Hawke government, as you will well remember, Mr Acting Deputy President. Great tribute is paid, as it should be, to Mr Whitlam. I think he was the great visionary amongst the Prime Ministers we have had this century—and not only in this century but in the last century as well. He was joined by some great figures—Moss Cass, for example. Tom Uren was one of these. Tom had an interesting history. I think I am correct in saying that he was the last member of this parliament to have fought in the Second World War. Gough Whitlam certainly fought in the Second World War and he left parliament before Tom Uren left. I think Tom Uren was the last member. That can be checked, but I think I am right in saying that.
I want to pay tribute to Tom Uren and to the government that got this scheme going. That was not the only government to have tried to regionalise Australia, as it should be. This government has plans for that; the opposition has plans for that. The areas of Australia outside the capital cities are now very much on the agenda and have been for many years. All I want to say about this scheme is that it came from the magic era. A great friend of Tom Uren's was Lloyd Rees, whose paintings contained a sort of timeless magic. Tom Uren, who was a great friend of his, had a bit of that about him himself. I simply want to note that, as we agree to wind up that plan, it was not a plan that was mindless; it was not a plan that was recklessly visionary; it was a good plan. It was a plan that is another example of how governments quite properly try to develop the regions, but this was a plan that came from a great and practical visionary.",SENATE,<title>ALBURY-WODONGA DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-04-06,"—I want to speak about two of the recommendations that the committee made when it was looking into this legislation and to propose in my second reading amendment that a message be given to the government in line with the recommendations of the report. The committee recognised the inequity that has existed since the establishment of the AWDC by ex gratia payment of rates to local government authorities in Victoria but that there was no similar treatment for the Albury City Council and Hume Shire Council in New South Wales. The committee recommended:
a) that the responsible NSW Minister consider ex-gratia payments equivalent to rates on AWDC (NSW) Land since 1992;
b) that, once the Commonwealth's amending legislation commences and the land assets pass to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth address this inequitable treatment of local government authorities by instituting ex-gratia payments equivalent to rates for Corporation land in both NSW and Victoria.
The committee also noted that the AWDC held assets of $138.4 million as at 30 June last year, the sale of which will continue over the next 10 years and, accordingly, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth consider reinvesting the interest-free payments made by the AWDC to the Commonwealth into infrastructure projects in Albury-Wodonga.
This leads me to the very contentious issue of the so-called internal bypass which is being proposed for Albury. It is very contentious and survey after survey of the residents of Albury have shown that 75 per cent would prefer this so-called bypass to be not internal but external. Only a slightly smaller number, 60 per cent of Wodonga residents, say they too would like to see an external bypass just like every other major town along the Hume Highway. The sticking point in all of this has appeared to be the second river crossing, that the internal bypass was an opportunity for there to be a second river crossing where the Victorian highway reaches the river. That is much needed and has been much talked about in the Albury-Wodonga area for some time. The argument was that, if we go the internal route, we get the second river crossing and we still get a so-called bypass. However, the internal route has been promoted because of this supposed advantage. It has been said for some time that it is also the cheaper option. 
That opposition, as I said, goes right back to the 1970s. Residents in Albury and Wodonga have been, I suppose, in a situation in which they have had no-one to turn to. The local council and the state government in New South Wales have said over and over again that they want to see the internal route proceeded with—for that second river crossing problem. This is an opportunity to feed back into the community some of that money which was not paid in rates during the life of the AWDC, to use it for infrastructure that, as I understand it, was the purpose behind the whole AWDC—that is, to see infrastructure developed in this region for the economic development of the area. That has been very successful. The money which was forgone in rates throughout the time of the AWDC could be returned in this way and allow a much more sensible solution to this problem to be found.
I want to draw on some of the arguments for going external as opposed to internal. Right now there are 3,000 to 4,000 semitrailers and tankers going through Albury-Wodonga every day. That is expected to double over the next 10 years. Most of those go through at night. At least 82 per cent, according to Environment Australia, and 76 per cent, according to the EIS, are externally bypassable. So the noise, pollution and risks of spills are ever-increasing problems that affect the majority of residents in both towns. The Road Transport Authority in New South Wales openly acknowledges that they will have to soundproof homes in order to achieve the EPA noise levels.
We need to take another look at the figures that were put together. There is certainly some evidence that the cost estimates for the so-called internal bypass have been constructed in a way which would suggest that that option is still cheaper than the external route, but I think this has been very satisfactorily and completely dispelled by other cost assessments of the figures that have been put up. In fact, the residents in Albury-Wodonga say that the RTA has consistently understated the costs for the internal solution, even though there are obvious extras and difficulties of building through an urban area. They left out bridges. They left out overpasses and underpasses—or undervalued themon and off ramps, sections of the road surface, noise barriers and many other things. In recent times when they had to admit to those omissions, they inflated the cost of the external bypass without doing any further design, I might add, or having any further information to hand. So the benefits of the internal solution have been overstated and the benefits of the external solution have been understated.
I propose my second reading amendment as a way forward, a way in which we can take a proper, objective look at the solution to the bypass problem in Albury-Wodonga. The external solution would certainly meet the needs of the residents who very much fear having their city divided in two by a very noisy corridor of constant traffic and the sorts of noise barriers that need to be erected. It could allow us to go forward with a solution which, as I say, overcomes the problems associated with putting very heavy traffic through a highly urbanised area. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate calls on the Government to address the inequities identified in the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the bill in relation to local government rates foregone by Albury City Council and Hume Shire Council since 1973, by granting an amount of money equivalent to repayments made by the Corporation to the Commonwealth since 1989, plus interest, for infrastructure investment to enable a second road link across the Murray River to be built, thereby obviating the need for the highly unpopular internal Hume Highway by-pass”. ",SENATE,<title>ALBURY-WODONGA DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-04-06,"—Essentially, this bill will simplify the structure and streamline the functions of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation in preparation for its abolition by a future act of this parliament once its duties have been finalised in many years to come. The bill will also facilitate the withdrawal of the states of Victoria and New South Wales from the 1973 joint Commonwealth-state scheme to develop the Albury-Wodonga region. I pause there and refer to Senator Cooney's comments about some of the architects of this bill. I acknowledge, as Senator Cooney does, Mr Whitlam and certainly Mr Tom Uren. I agree with Senator Cooney. Whilst I would never be caught commenting favourably on Mr Uren's political philosophy or view on life, he certainly is a great Australian. I recently had the real pleasure of sitting near him at a function in Sydney. It was a pleasure to talk to him and hear of his vision and views. He certainly has not abated his particular philosophy on life and philosophy on politics. He is a great Australian and one who will be remembered for many things. Senator Cooney, not only was he a member of the armed forces who fought in the war; he was a prisoner of war at Changi, as I understand—
—He was captured in East Timor.
—Captured in East Timor? That also has a resonance in this day and age. He is certainly a great Australian.
The bill before us implements the decisions of successive federal governments and the Albury-Wodonga Ministerial Council to wind up the corporation and the Commonwealth-state scheme that first started, as I said, in 1973. The bill provides for the negotiation of a complementary winding-up agreement to detail the arrangements of the withdrawal of the states from the scheme. That will be tabled later, as I understand, and will be a document that can be set aside by this parliament. The bill also provides for the repeal of the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Act. That act will no longer be relevant with the withdrawal of the states from the scheme.
I understand what Senator Cooney has said, and I thank him for his comments. I acknowledge that Senator Allison has a deep and ongoing commitment to the external route around Albury. Whilst I am advised that she is wrong—I do not have a personal view; it is a bit outside my expertise—the New South Wales government, which does a lot of the planning and management work of the highway on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth's experts themselves still say that the internal route is the way to go. You may or may not be surprised to know, Senator, that we will not be supporting your second reading amendment, but I accept your interest in the matter.
Both Senator Cooney and Senator Allison spoke about the recommendations of the Senate committee looking into the bill, the principal recommendation of which was that the bill be passed, which we accept. There was a recommendation, too, which talked about the question of payment of rates to the three councils that really comprise that Albury-Wodonga corporation area. By decision of the Victorian government some years ago, I understand, the Victorian government decided to pay rates in Wodonga and has been doing that for some years. Many years ago the New South Wales government made a decision that it would not do that for, I understand, reasons of uniformity across the whole of the state. I was not around then and can only indicate my understanding of what the reasons were at the time.
The committee has said in its report that we should ask the New South Wales minister to consider ex gratia payments equivalent to rates back from 1992. I think the New South Wales government has made a decision on that, Senator. I will certainly make the minister aware of the recommendation of the committee, but I could not urge the adoption of the recommendation with any great enthusiasm.
There is also a suggestion by the committee in recommendation 2 that, once the Commonwealth amending legislation commences and the land assets pass to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth address this inequitable treatment for local government authorities by instituting ex gratia payments equivalent to rates for the corporation land in both New South Wales and Victoria. That is a matter that was raised with me by the Albury City Council some time ago.  
The payment of rates on land-holdings to shire councils is at the present time a matter for state corporations. The request by the Albury City Council is something I am currently giving some consideration to and currently getting some advice about. As I say, I cannot speak for the New South Wales government for the past, but I am considering the second element, that is, what the Commonwealth's attitude should be for the future. As soon as I have come to a conclusion, I will let all of the relevant parties know and let them know of our decision. I thank the committee for considering that and for its recommendation.
The third recommendation--I guess this goes to Senator Allison's amendment--does talk about reinvesting some of the proceeds of sale that the Commonwealth will receive from the AWDC into infrastructure projects in the Albury-Wodonga area. I have said that we do not support the senator's amendment, which is a specific reference to that general recommendation. 
In relation to the recommendation generally, we have to be careful in hypothecating moneys from a particular area of Commonwealth government investment. The original investment, made of course in Albury-Wodonga, was made by Australian taxpayers as a whole. It was not made just by the people of Albury-Wodonga. Commonsense and basic fairness would suggest that, if all of the Australian taxpayers made the investment, then any return on the investment should really go back to all of the Australian taxpayers. Of course, that means putting it back into general revenue. That has been the general approach over the years. 
That is not to say that the Commonwealth will not look at proposals that come from Albury-Wodonga, or any other area, I might say, for infrastructure payments, but I would not want to start the precedent of hypothecating payments, because it is simply unfair. There are many parts of Australia in which the Commonwealth in 1973 or subsequently has not made that investment. Of course, there are no returns from those other places that could be hypothecated, even if we thought that was a good idea, which we do not. While I understand some of the sentiments behind recommendation 3, it is not really one I could endorse wholeheartedly.
I thank those senators who spoke for their contributions. I thank all of the current and past members of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and colleagues in the New South Wales and Victorian governments--the ministers over the years who have joined with the Commonwealth minister as the Albury-Wodonga ministerial council--for their contributions and hard work over a long number of years. Time has moved on. It is time to change, as the states are interested and anxious to withdraw. Now is the time to do it. That is what this bill does and I commend it to the Senate.
Amendment negatived.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-04-06,"—My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill. Is the minister aware that the cutting-edge solar energy solutions developed by Solar Systems Pty Ltd are not currently eligible to access the Photovoltaic Rebate Program on the basis that their development post-dates the program? Is the minister aware that this ineligibility will result in a financial advantage to more outdated technology? Is the minister further aware that Solar Systems Pty Ltd has recently been contracted to supply solar generated electric power to a major project—namely, a $400 million multistorey residential building in Victoria? And is the minister aware that both the Commonwealth and the Victorian governments seem to have no objections to Solar Systems Pty Ltd accessing the PVRP but that this issue remains unresolved at a bureaucratic level?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-04-06,"— I do not recall the issue. If I understand what Senator Ray—
—He's on a roll.
—I certainly recall the enlightened and constructive government policy which supports the community in taking on photovoltaic power by considerably subsidising them to do so to the extent of about—
—What is the supplementary?
—I got an interjection. It subsidises them to the extent of about 50 per cent of the cost of a normal system for a house. It is an opportunity that we are giving to the community to contribute to a better greenhouse outcome for Australia, and it is something which I would like to think all Australians would applaud. What Senator Ray is suggesting, as I understand his question, is that we have in some way restricted the equipment to that which was available at the time the policy was first implemented, which was only a couple of months ago. That seems to me to be somewhat surprising because this scheme is going to continue for a number of years. I cannot immediately see why we would limit it to equipment that might be overtaken by alternatives that are more efficient or less costly or have some other advantage. I will examine the criteria and see if in fact that is a problem.

The question and answer read as follows—
Senator WEST - Can he (Senator Herron) also confirm or advise how many letters have been sent to the families of the residents, apart from the one on 6 March? Is it true that they have received no further advice from the department on the matter, since that particular day?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the Honourable Senator's question, in accordance with advice provided to her:
There has been consistent and ongoing communication with residents of the former Riverside residential facility who moved to St Vincent's Hospital on or after Monday 6 March and with their family members or representatives.
A meeting was held at St Vincent's with relatives and representatives on Wednesday 8 March to discuss their relative's stay in St Vincent's. A letter was handed out outlining arrangements for handling laundry, storage of personal possessions and transport arrangements for family members. A process was commenced to develop profiles for each resident regarding their preference for suitable long term accommodation.
Case managers were appointed who, starting on 9 March, made contact by telephone with relatives and had direct discussions with residents at St Vincent's. A further letter confirmed case management arrangements.
The case managers have continued to work closely with each resident and family on a one on one basis to work towards the outcome that best meets the need of each individual resident and their family, and to deal with any issues or concerns. They are in constant contact with families and residents and are available 24 hours a day. This arrangement will stay in place until all residents find suitable accommodation and all outstanding concerns have been addressed.
A hot line has also been maintained since early March 2000. However, use of this service has now markedly decreased as the case manager arrangements have proved to be so comprehensive.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-04-06,"—I table a statement on the 2001 Census of Population and Housing by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, together with an information paper and the government response to a House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The statement read as follows—
I wish to inform the House that the Australian Bureau of Statistics will conduct the next national Census of Population and Housing on 7 August 2001.
Mr Speaker, many Australians will view this Census as a very significant event given that it takes place in the centenary year of Federation, and that it is the first Census of the 21st century.
Australians 100 years from now will take a similar view of this particular Census. 
Indeed, in 1000 years time, Australians will be able to use this Census as a snapshot of how their country looked at the dawn of the passing millennium.
We are celebrating the 2nd Millennium of one of the most famous Censuses of all time, the Roman Census, which occurred around the time of the birth of Jesus Christ. 
Mr Speaker, this Census is the most wide-ranging collection ever undertaken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and involves contact with each and every household in the nation.
It provides a statistical snapshot of the whole population in terms of number, age, geographical distribution plus a range of other statistics.
The vast numerical output that the Census generates is used for the benefit of all Australians. Government agencies at the Federal, State and local level, social service organisations, churches, research institutions, businesses and private individuals use Census information to help in their planning, administration, policy development, program evaluation and research. 
Census information also tells us about our community and about the society in which we live.
Mr Speaker, the Government acknowledges that a Census involves some intrusion and some workload for the community.  However, the benefits of the Census far outweigh the inconvenience of filling out the necessary forms. In fact, it is a time-investment of less than half an hour per household every 5 years.
Australians understand these benefits and as a result, the Census has always received a very high level of public cooperation.
It is essential that this continues so that we can ensure all Australians get the benefit of only the highest-quality data.
To make sure this happens, there will be a public awareness campaign before and during the 2001 Census.
This campaign aims to maintain high-quality responses to the Census by showing the public that the statistics are useful and that they will be treated with total confidentially.
The campaign will also promote the availability of help for any Australians who may, for language or other reasons, have difficulty completing the Census form.
Mr Speaker, The Census and Statistics Act 1905 requires that Census topics must be prescribed in regulations. So that the Parliament and the general public are fully informed about the questions in the Census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has written an information paper entitled 2001 Census of Population and Housing: Nature and Content which describes the topics to be included and the procedures for conducting the Census. 
Mr Speaker, for the first time an Australian Census will include questions on access to computers and Internet use.
Given the growth of the new economy and the potential impact of the World Wide Web on the lives of everyday Australians, the inclusion of these questions is most timely.
Understanding just who has access to computers and who uses the Internet will be invaluable to both government and private organisations, particularly in regional and rural areas.
The 2001 Census will also repeat the 1986 question on ancestry to better identify the ethnic background of first and second-generation Australians.
Mr Speaker, the Government considers that the topics selected for the Census represent a reasonable balance between the need for information, the appropriateness of the Census as a means for collecting different data, the cost of the project and the need to ensure that it does not impose too great a burden on the public.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics will conduct final testing for the 2001 Census in the first half of this year to decide on the final definitions, the wording and the sequencing of questions.
Mr Speaker, this 2001 Census is the result of much research and public consultation. And I am happy to say the Government has decided to accept the thrust of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Saving our Census and Preserving our History.
The Government agrees with the Standing Committee that saving name-identified Census information 'for future research, with appropriate safeguards, will make a valuable contribution to preserving Australia's history for future generations'. 
The Government also recognises the historical value of this sort of information, particularly with the 2001 Census coinciding with the Centenary of Federation, and considers the data will be a valuable commemorative activity and a 'gift' to future generations from the nation of today.
For this reason, the Government has decided to retain name-identified Census information from the 2001Census, but only from those people who agree to their information being kept.
In other words, the Census will have an 'opt-in' clause. This means Australian's will have to specifically agree to have their name-identified Census data being kept for a closed-access period of 99 years. During this time no one will have access to the information.
Mr Speaker, the Parliament has considered and accepted the necessary legislative changes to effect this one-off retention of name-identified Census data of Australians who have chosen to be part of this initiative. 
For the information of members, I table the Australian Bureau of Statistics information paper and Government response to the Saving our Census and Preserving our History report.  The regulations specifying the matters to be included in the 2001 Census in accordance with sections 8 and 27 of the Census and Statistics Act 1905 were tabled on 3 April 2000.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Census of Population and Housing 2001</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1,speech

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
REPORT ON FINDINGS INTO THE FOR-MAT OF PORTFOLIO BUDGET STATE-MENTS
ATTACHMENT A
Recommendations and Government Response
1. DOFA publish and annually update a best practice outcomes/outputs framework guide on its website.
Response:
Agree - DOFA will highlight agencies who have had success with their definitions of outputs and outcomes, so that other agencies can share this information.  The Committee may wish to note that DOFA has recently revised its Budget website, to make it a consolidated source of information on budget related matters.
2.	In the PBS, information on appropriations should be disaggregated to the output level.
Response:
Agree - while appropriations are at the outcome level in the Appropriation Bills, providing a breakdown at the output level in PBS's will give Senators more information to assist their scrutiny.  It is worth noting that a number of agencies provided information at the output level in 1999-2000 PBS's.  By incorporating this requirement in the guidance for agencies in preparing their 2000-01 PBS, output level information will be available for all agencies. 
3. In the PBS, administered items should be itemised.
Response:
Agree - the itemising of administered expenses/revenues will provide greater information to Senators, particularly where large administered appropriations are involved.  To minimise the additional requirements placed on agencies, it is proposed to keep itemising to a relatively high level.  This requirement will be incorporated into the guidance for agencies in preparing their 2000-01 PBS.
4. Forward estimates for outcomes and outputs should be itemised.
Response:
Disagree - there is already extensive reporting of forward estimates information in budget documentation.  For example, forward estimates information is provided at an aggregate level (cash and accrual), as well as for agency expenses, measures and on a functional basis.  This information is published at both Budget and the Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook update.
The introduction of an accrual based budgeting framework is in line with international best practice and provides comprehensive financial information.  Accordingly, the Government does not intend to adopt this recommendation.
5. Significant differences or variations from budget predictions to actual expenses or revenues should be disclosed in a suitable publicly available document.
Response:
Agree - to avoid introducing more budget related documentation, it is proposed to include this information in the Final Budget Outcome document, which is published and tabled in September each year.  DOFA will liaise with the Committee further, to ensure that its requirements are met in this document.
6. Notes to the financial statements should be expanded to include an explanation of the opening and closing asset values and amount and application of the capital user charge (CUC).
Response:
Agree - this additional information will aid the understanding of accrual presentation of financial data.  This requirement will be incorporated into the guidance for agencies in preparing their 2000-01 PBS.
7. In the short term, the ANAO should consider the development of a “best practice” performance information guide and in the longer term - but not later than 2002-03 - the ANAO should consider across-the-board performance information audits.
Response:
ANAO has advised that:
“The ANAO proposes to update its Better Practice Guide on Performance Information as part of its 2000-01 audit program.  The audit program will also increase the focus on performance information in its audit coverage generally.
Consideration will be given to including in the 2001-02 and future audit programs across-portfolio performance audits of performance information included in Portfolio Budget Statements.
In accordance with existing arrangements, the ANAO consults with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and relevant agencies prior to the finalisation of its annual work program.”
8. Explanatory briefing documentation given to legislation committees at pre-hearing briefings for budget estimates should be incorporated in the relevant legislation committee's additional information volumes and published on the committee's website, if relevant.
Response:
This is a recommendation for Legislation Committees themselves.
9. Legislation committees should continue to report in each budget estimates report on the adequacy of the PBS provided for their use and in each additional estimates report on the performance information examined.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,2000-04-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak on this response by the government to this report because, when this inquiry was carried out by the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, I was chair of the committee. With the kind consent of the current chairman, Senator Mason, it was agreed that I should comment on this document on behalf of the committee. The portfolio budget statements are the documents provided by the departments that fit in between the budget documents and the annual reports. They are a very important part of the reporting and accountability process of the government to the parliament. Why am I getting up to speak on this? Because I had a hand in persuading the government, when we were in opposition, to go for full accrual accounting and its associated reporting framework of outcomes and outputs. I am pleased to say that, as soon as the Howard government were elected in 1996, we made a decision to go ahead with full accrual accounting, and we are in the final year of adopting it. The annual reports coming out later this year will basically complete the cycle. 
This particular inquiry has been one of many that the Senate has requested over the last 15 years. In fact, the Senate has requested that the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee—or its predecessor—look at this matter about five times. But this was the first time that the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee was asked to look at the PBSs, the portfolio budget statements, on a full accrual basis—as it has done for this financial year—combined with the outcomes and outputs reporting framework. In looking at that matter, the committee was concerned to balance the requirements of senators for details about what is going on with the practical realities of the departments' preparation and compilation of the PBSs. I am pleased that the government saw fit to accept and implement all but one of the committee's recommendations. In particular, I am pleased that the guidelines for the 2000-01 portfolio budget statements now incorporate a requirement to provide a breakdown of appropriations at output level and an itemisation of administered items. The absence of those details in the PBSs in the past has been the factor most criticised by senators in the budget estimates rounds.
I am also pleased that the government has indicated that the Department of Finance and Administration will provide information on its web site on best practice definitions of both outcomes and outputs. I might add that the experience of the ACT parliament and Victoria suggests that it will take some time for the reporting frameworks to stabilise, because it takes quite a time for the members, the people in the agencies and the senators to learn the system and to understand and make use of the system. However, I am sure it is the right way to go. Wearing my hat as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I look forward to the Audit Office's increased focus on performance information.
In conclusion, may I echo the words of Tony Blunn, who was the secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, who indicated that one of the real dangers in any changed accounting and reporting framework is the tendency to romanticise what we had in the past. Do we really want to go back to the days of itemising and questioning what the department spent on paperclips or pot plants? I think not. The new system, by concentrating on outputs and outcomes and being done on a full accrual basis, which means that capital items in particular are taken into account, will lead to much better management of government. 
I remind the Senate and listeners that Australia is the third country in the world to adopt full accrual accounting, after New Zealand and Iceland. We are certainly in the forefront of full reporting and full accountability to the parliament by adopting that stance. I wish the new chair of this committee and the committee itself well in monitoring the performance of the portfolio budget statements.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,31,2,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2000-04-06,"—I was about to respond to Senator Forshaw before I deferred to Senator Stott Despoja. I must now join her with Senator Forshaw, in terms of the comments that she has made with regard to this tabling of the government response to the Senate Economics Committee report on a new reactor at Lucas Heights. Senator Forshaw and Senator Stott Despoja are engaging in nothing more than sensationalist, scaremongering opposition to what is an important scientific resource for Australia. They do not rely on any substantial evidence to put forward their arguments in opposition to the government's response to this report but they simply perpetuate a lot of the false and emotional claptrap that we have heard in regard to this issue not only over months but in fact over years.
Both Senator Forshaw and Senator Stott Despoja referred to the Research Reactor Review report—the so-called McKinnon report of several years ago—and claimed that the government's response to the Senate economics committee report ignored some of the recommendations that were proposed as conditions laid down by the McKinnon report. That is simply not true. If both of them had read the government's response very closely, they would have seen that that response in fact deals in detail with the five conditions laid down by that report. The first issue that was raised by Senator Forshaw and repeated by Senator Stott Despoja was dealing with high level radioactive waste. The fact is, as is confirmed in the government's response, that high level radioactive waste will not be an issue with regard to the new reactor at Lucas Heights, in terms of its storage— 
—That's your view.
—In terms of the facts laid down by the government, Senator Forshaw. The government chose very clearly. In the policy provision it has made for the waste coming out of the new Lucas Heights reactor, the government's strategy is that the spent fuel will be sent for processing overseas. The government has allocated some $88 million to fund its proposed management of the spent fuel from HIFAR. Indeed, it was announced as long ago as 3 September 1997 that that money had been allocated and that the spent fuel would be sent overseas for reprocessing. It then involves, in 2015, the return of intermediate level waste to Australia after that reprocessing has occurred. So there is no issue of high level waste because the high level waste is being sent overseas for reprocessing and returning here as intermediate level waste. The McKinnon report referred to the way that high level waste should be dealt with. It says quite specifically:
If at the end of a further period of five years a high level waste site has been firmly identified and work started on proving its suitability, then it would be appropriate to make a positive decision regarding a new reactor.
A method of dealing with the high level waste has been identified, so it is not true to say that the government has ignored the Research Reactor Review condition proposed with regard to that issue.
The other issue that was raised by both speakers is the issue of consultation. The fact is that there has been extensive consultation with the local community on this matter. In the first instance, there have now been three parliamentary inquiries on this issue. There was the inquiry undertaken by the Senate Select Committee on Radioactive Waste, which I chaired. I might add, in relation to the comments of Senator Stott Despoja, that this committee put down unanimous recommendations with regard to a nuclear waste storage facility in Australia. The announcements made with regard to a waste depository by Senator Minchin as the minister are consistent with those recommendations. Not only was the Labor Party represented on this committee but the Democrats through their current leader Meg Lees were also represented and supported that unanimous recommendation. There was that inquiry. Then there was the Public Works Committee inquiry which, again, unanimously recommended that the new nuclear reactor be installed at Lucas Height—a committee that contains a number of your Labor colleagues, Senator Forshaw.
—They got it wrong.
—Your colleagues. `I am the only one in step', says Senator Forshaw, `and all my colleagues are out of step.'
Next we had the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry in which a majority but not a unanimous recommendation was orchestrated by Senator Forshaw and Senator Stott Despoja, which said we should have further inquiries on this matter—further inquiries, after three parliamentary inquiries, the Research Review Reactor inquiry and a number of other investigations including an environmental impact statement. There has been quite adequate inquiry, as was determined by Senator Gibson and myself as the government members of the Senate  Economics References Committee inquiry into this matter. We concluded on the basis of the evidence, not on the basis of our own prejudices, as Labor and the Democrats did, but on the basis of the evidence put before that committee, that there had been adequate inquiry and adequate consultation and, in fact, the benefits of a nuclear reactor, which even the opposition members of the committee acknowledged, were such that there should not be further delay with regard to the establishment of that reactor. 
It is perhaps worth highlighting the benefits of a new reactor. The products of a new reactor will benefit nuclear science and technology across a wide range of areas: medicine, industry, mining and minerals processing, energy, agriculture, the environment, science, education, and the provision of advice to the government itself. Unless we replace the existing reactor, all of those benefits will be lost, including, most importantly, the benefits of nuclear medicine for people who need the treatment from the isotopes which are produced by the existing nuclear reactor and which will be produced by a new nuclear reactor. 
The existing reactor is 41 years old. It has reached the end of its useful life. It has operated quite safely at Lucas Heights for 41 years. The new reactor, because of its up-to-date technology, will be even safer and even more secure than the existing facility, which has caused no problems whatsoever to the local community. 
—Senator Forshaw is again saying: `Why should they have it?' I have already talked to him about the extent of local consultation. As part of the research undertaken in the decision making process for this new reactor, detailed community research was undertaken in the Sutherland Shire, and 57 per cent of those surveyed were supportive of a replacement reactor being built on the current site at Lucas Heights. Contrary to what has been said opposite, ANSTO has also undertaken extensive community consultation. Senator Forshaw would well know that the parliamentary committees that have inquired into this matter have given enormous opportunity for local community consultation to be undertaken. The benefits of this new facility far outweigh any offsetting negative aspects of it. 
There are specific reasons why the facility should be at Lucas Heights. Amongst those is that it needs to be located in close proximity to the national medical cyclotron at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Campbelltown. Also there will be the need for ongoing maintenance of the existing HIFAR reactor. There is also a need for the facility to be close to Sydney airport to facilitate arrangements for the distribution of radio pharmaceuticals. 
So against all the scaremongering that we hear from the opposition, there is no argument that this facility will be safe--indeed, safer than the existing facility—that it is needed, that it is beneficial for the Australian community and that it should certainly proceed without delay. There has been adequate study of this matter over a number of years now. The government has given detailed study to that. It has given detailed opportunity for community consultation. The evidence to support the establishment of a new nuclear facility is overwhelming. There should be no further delay with its establishment.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-06,"—I would like to speak to one of these documents—there are actually 10 in this group—which is the communication from the United Nations Committee Against Torture. It relates to a case that has had a fair bit of attention and which is still ongoing, so I will need to be a little careful about how I approach it. The case is to do with a man from Somalia who is known as Mr S. E. I note that, despite the desire to protect people's identities, this document, which has now been tabled and is on the public record, contains his full name and a lot of other details. It might seem a bit redundant; nonetheless, it was the one that received a fair bit of attention back towards the end of 1998, when Amnesty International specifically requested the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs not to remove the person from Australia. Indeed it took out a very rare—in terms of Australia, anyway—urgent action requesting people from various parts of the world to urge the Australian government not to send this person back; they have not, which is, I guess, a good thing. 
The person in question arrived in Australia in October 1997 and since that time has been held in detention, and is still being held in detention, in Australia. He went through the usual processes and through the Refugee Review Tribunal. The minister chose not to use his powers to intervene on humanitarian grounds, and it was initially attempted to deport him on 29 October 1998. Because of the person's refusal to board the plane, the captain of the aircraft refused to take him on board. He was taken back to the detention centre. There were attempts to remove him, or he was informed that he would be removed again the next day. He put in some court appeals, which held that up a little. But, again, towards the end of that the government intended to remove the person. Having exhausted all available domestic remedies, which he is required to do before he can appeal to the UN committee, he then appealed to the UN Committee Against Torture. This committee assesses a nation's performance in upholding their obligations to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Australia is a signatory to that convention, and under that convention it is obliged not to return somebody to a situation where they are likely to face torture. That is what was assessed.
The person's claim that they were likely to face torture was disputed very vigorously by the Australian government but the committee found, after examining all the issues, in a detailed report that has been tabled in the Senate, that substantial grounds do exist for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture if he returned to Somalia. This is a person whose father and one brother have already been killed and with a sister who had been raped repeatedly, I think on three separate occasions, by members of armed Somali clans, eventually leading to her suicide. Those facts were not disputed by the government. What was disputed was that this person would specifically face persecution because of grounds under the refugee convention or under the torture convention. So the fact that they may face torture was not the issue according to the Australian government: it was that they did not come under the technical arguments of the convention.
I do not have time to go through the circumstances in detail, and it is probably not appropriate that I do. But, given the debate in recent times about UN conventions, it is worth highlighting again this process and, indeed, the government's apparent fading regard or increasing disregard for the operations of our obligations under the convention against torture. Leaving this case to one side—and this person is still in Australia and has started back through the process again—the government did not respond to the committee's ruling by saying, `Okay, we'll let them stay, then.' They said, `Okay, he can start the process all over again,' even though he has been in detention for two years. That is still ongoing.
We now have a situation where people have been deported—people who were the subject of a Four Corners report a few weeks ago and who the minister was informed had put in a communication to the Committee Against Torture that their case be investigated. He knew that was the case and he still refused to allow them to remain in Australia. He still deported them, despite the fact that he knew their case was being considered by that UN committee. I think that is a tragic and terrible development, and one that shows an increasing disregard by this government for their obligations under the convention. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-04-06,"—I rise to speak on the report of the Superannuation and Financial Services Select Committee on the roundtable on choice of superannuation funds held at the end of last year. It is a very important area as many Australians now are seeing their superannuation balances grow as a result of award superannuation which was introduced back in the 1980s. At that stage there was quite a battle over who was going to get their hands on the funds. The industry funds invariably came out on top over the life funds, and that was a very healthy thing as far as the individual members of the funds were concerned.
I view this attempt now to bring about choice of superannuation funds as being yet another attempt by the life companies to claw back the area that was taken from them some time ago. The report itself is of the actual deliberations of the committee on that day, without coming to any decision, so in that sense it is a report of the facts of the meeting rather than the committee arriving at a decision. Nonetheless, if one looks at the issue of choice of superannuation funds, one must consider that already there is choice of investments available to many people in superannuation funds, and the uptake on that is very limited indeed. So one finds it hard to believe that having access to choice of funds will be any more attractive for a large number of people in the superannuation funds. In my view, it shows that it is nothing more than a ploy to claw back the ground that has been lost previously by the life funds over a long period of time.
On the issue of choice, the report did note that there were three broad categories of views: those who support fund member choice with a few reservations, those who believe fund member choice will not be in the interest of fund members, and those who believe fund member choice can be made workable subject to a range of conditions being met. I clearly fall into the category of those who believe that it is not in the interest of fund members, like my colleague Senator Bishop and also Senator Conroy, who undoubtedly believes likewise.
Whilst those are the broad categories within which the views fall, the report highlights in chapter 4 the concerns that do exist in respect of the choice of funds. This part of the report gets to some of the underlying objections that I have in respect of choice of fund. Firstly, the roundtable focused on the issue that disclosure is one of the most important elements of making an informed choice. It was brought to our attention that, unless an informed choice is made, those who are investing in superannuation in a compulsory manner, as it is in this nation, will undoubtedly find themselves subjected to scams. So clearly the notion of an informed choice was very important indeed. Secondly, it noted that during the 1999 roundtable most participants agreed that disclosure was the key to an efficient, prudent and reliable choice environment, and that industry regulators and government had already been working strenuously to achieve reforms in this area. Having said that, there was concern expressed by a number of consumer groups and unions that the disclosure was a vital precondition for the implementation of any choice. Whilst there was an undercurrent of view at the roundtable that choice was going to be a matter of fact in the future, not everyone accepted that that was necessarily going to be the case.
My real concern was summarised at page 20 of the report in terms of education and awareness. The report drew attention to the fact that 15 per cent of Australians are functionally illiterate. When one considers that figure alone, it makes it very difficult for those people to make an informed choice—to know fully what the options are that are confronting them in the most important investment that they will make for their lives. The investment of superannuation is an investment for their retirement. These people have the right to security in their retirement. Not only are some of those people functionally illiterate but many of them have a problem with English because it is their second language. 
When you look further on in the report, you see that the report cited the fact that a recent ABS survey had shown that 46 per cent of Australians have an unsatisfactorily low level of literacy. When one considers that in conjunction with the 15 per cent of Australians who are functionally illiterate, one then has a major concern about the capability of a large number of Australians confronted with the need or the option to make a wise choice of fund. As I have already outlined, some of them do not even exercise the right now to make a choice of investment because they have before them a major obstacle in an inability to understand the information that is put before them which enables them to make a choice.
I think the roundtable conference itself should be commended. The concept was very valuable indeed for the committee. But I thought it was worth while raising for the attention of the Senate this evening those fundamental underlying concerns that I have, firstly, about disclosure and, secondly, about the education and awareness that people need to have if they are to make an informed choice. The AMP Society acknowledged at that roundtable that there will be a percentage who will never understand the concepts involved. So when we are dealing with something as important as a person's retirement benefit—the savings that will see them through their retirement—then it is important, if choice is to be embraced, that every protection be put in place to ensure that those who are least able to cope with the new environment are able to at least be defended from the vultures just lurking out there seeking to feast on their retirement benefits. That is the major concern that we all should have, and when this legislation comes before this parliament I will speak at greater length about that particular issue.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-04-06,"—A few weeks ago I had the great pleasure and honour to meet Father Andrew Nguyen Huu Le, Catholic priest, former prisoner of conscience, and now activist for religious freedom and human rights in his native Vietnam. Father Nguyen in many ways is typical of the extraordinary, often unsung, heroes of the struggle for human freedom and human dignity. The struggle against the tyranny of totalitarianism has always been, above all, a struggle of brave individuals whose strong moral compass and unbending determination make them unwilling to live their lives on their knees. It was a struggle that from a rational point of view looked almost futile and almost hopeless, a struggle of everyday Davids naked before the overwhelming might of Goliaths of the total state. Yet history showed that, against all human odds, men and women of great heart have prevailed. Modern heroes like Lech Walesa in Poland, Vaclav Havel in Czechoslovakia, Alexander Solzhenitsyn in Russia and thousands of others whose names will never appear in history books, have written, far too often with their blood, the new pages in the book of freedom. Father Nguyen has a proud place among them. His struggle and victory are a triumph of the human spirit.
Father Nguyen was born in 1943 as the youngest of six children in a peasant family in Vietnam. Ironically, in direct contrast to Marxist dogma, Father Nguyen's background did not make him part of the revolutionary vanguard but instead its mortal enemy. After answering a calling at the age of 27, he became a Catholic priest administering to the poor in the countryside of southern Vietnam. He soon became known as `the Father for those without voice.' After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the new regime, ostensibly dedicated to those who were in need and without a voice, decided to silence his. On account of his non-cooperation with the communist government and criticism of its excesses, Father Nguyen was arrested in 1976 and denounced for being a `reactionary reverend'. He spent the next 13 years in various prisons and re-education camps both in the north and the south of the country, including the infamous Gate of Heaven prison camp in the northern part of the country near the Chinese border. He spent three years there chained to the wall of a dark cell. While there, Father Nguyen told me, he was beaten often and repeatedly and his friends were as well, and some of them died in his arms. He cries for his friends still, and for all the others tortured by the enforcers of an ideology now tottering on the edge of extinction. 
Following a long campaign by Amnesty International, Father Nguyen was released from jail in 1988. Three months later he managed to escape to Thailand and from there went to New Zealand. For the past 12 years he has been a tireless campaigner for religious and political freedom in Vietnam. He is currently the Executive Director of the Committee for Religious Freedom in Vietnam. In that capacity he has travelled extensively throughout the world. He has testified before the United States House of Representatives, as well as much more informal groups, such as the one where I met him.
The presence among us of people like Father Nguyen is a constant and a necessary reminder that the great work of liberation and liberalism has not ended with the close of the twentieth century. While more countries and peoples around the world are freer now than they ever have been in human history, we cannot forget that in a few isolated pockets around the world dictatorship still holds sway, and communism—the great god that failed last century—still exacts a terrible toll in terms of human life, dignity and freedom in places like Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and perhaps to a lesser extent today the People's Republic of China. The bloodiest ideology ever known to man is now cornered by freedom.
The work of Father Nguyen and thousands like him has borne in the past, and still continues to bear, fruit in all parts of the world. According to the Freedom House survey for 1998-99, 88 out of the world's 191 countries were considered free, with another 53 countries rated as partially free; 2.3 billion people now live in free societies and another 1.5 billion in partly free societies. In 1981, 20 years ago, 2.6 billion people lived in free and partly free societies and in 1999 that number had risen to almost four billion. In the decade between 1988-89 and 1998-99 the number of democracies has increased from 69 to 117.
In listening to Father Nguyen and his story of courage and hardship, I was acutely aware of my own political generation. I am part of the post Vietnam War generation. For many of those born a few years before me, Vietnam will forever be associated in their minds with mass protests and with conscription—the defining political experience of their early lives. My Vietnam, the Vietnam I know about, is the Vietnam of poverty, oppression, re-education camps and hundreds of thousands of boat people escaping to freedom. Theirs is the Vietnam of Ho Chi Minh; mine is the Vietnam of people like Father Nguyen.
It still saddens me today to think of that dark chapter of our recent history—the Whitlam government's reluctance to come to the assistance of the Indochinese refugees for the fear that, if brought to the safety of Australia, they might become another anti-communist and anti-Labor voting block, just like people from the Baltic States after the Second World War. 
—Don't demean Father Nguyen like this.
—Senator Conroy interrupts. Let me quote John Menadue in his recent book. Whitlam's chosen head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet called it `a low point in the Whitlam government'. It was perhaps the lowest point in the Whitlam government since in its crude political opportunism it contrasted so glaringly with the Whitlam government's support for multiculturalism. That is my point.
Almost 25 years ago, on 30 April 1975, the North Vietnamese Army entered Saigon, ending the independent existence of South Vietnam. Most people thought that the Vietnam War ended then and there, but it didn't. I have visited Vietnam on several occasions. Everywhere and often I have been stopped by locals. Careful not to be overheard by agents of state security, they have told me of the failed promise and hardship of Vietnam's socialist experiment. For them and for those fortunate enough to escape from Vietnam, the war has continued for the past 25 years. The good news is that democracy and free enterprise are winning. I am looking forward to coming back to a united democratic Vietnam that has rejoined the family of nations. As Jewish people used to say to each other throughout the centuries of their exile and their wandering, `Next year, Jerusalem,' so do I say to all my Vietnamese friends `Next year, Saigon.'",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Nguyen, Father Andrew</title>",Adjournment,40,1,speech

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-04-06,"—The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) There have been two reviews of aged care advocacy services in the Central Australian region. The first was included in the development of the Three Year Strategic Plan for Aged Care Services prepared by Territory Health Services in December 1996. The second review was the Review of the Central Australian Advocacy Service dated April1997 and was commissioned by the Central Australian Advocacy Service, later named Aged Care Advocacy Service, with funds provided by the then Department of Health and Family Services. A written report was delivered directly to the service by the consultant conducting the review in June 1997.
(2) 24 May 1999.
(3) There was no public announcement. A letter was sent to the Aged Care Advocacy Service on 27 May 1999 confirming the verbal advice given on 24 May regarding the department's preferred approach.
(4) The Three Year Strategic Plan for Aged Care Services prepared by Territory Health Services in December 1996 recommended the amalgamation of the two services in Central Australia. This option was again put forward for reconsideration in the, Review of Central Australian Advocacy in April 1997 but not acted upon. The matter of a cooperative working relationships between the two advocacy services was the subject of discussions between the Department and the services during 1997 and 1998. Amalgamation was again discussed at a meeting with both services and the Department in August 1998 and again not agreed to. The next discussion between the Department and the services occurred on 24 May 1999.
(5) 2.5 full time equivalent positions were utilised by the Aged Care Advocacy service for the Alice Springs and Barkly region of which all three positions included duties other than advocacy, such as administrative duties, clerical duties, education duties and cultural advisor duties. 1 full time equivalent position was employed in the cross border region by the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (NPY) Womens' Council for services in the cross border region.
(6) Aged Care Advocacy Service - 2.5 and NPY -1.
(7) 2
(8) Centacare - 1 and NPY - 1.
(9) An expert tender assessment panel was established, consisting of an independent contracted consultant, an officer of Territory Health Services, resident in Alice Springs, and the Co-ordinator of the Territory Older Persons Support Service of Frontier Services, based in Darwin.
(10) Nil. Any savings realised in the Alice Springs and Barkly regions will be redirected to advocacy services in other regions which are less well resourced.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Aged Care: Central Australia</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,42,1,answer
