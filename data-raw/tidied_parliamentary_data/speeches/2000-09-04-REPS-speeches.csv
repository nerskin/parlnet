"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled From phantom to force: towards a more efficient and effective army, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed. 
—This report on our Army comes from an inquiry held under unique circumstances. When the defence subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade commenced this inquiry some 15 months ago, Australia's regional circumstances were different from those of today. During that period, Australia was engaged in military commitments not seen for a generation. Most of these commitments were being borne by the Army. These circumstances and the Army's role in them have inevitably impacted on our report. While justifiably proud of our Army, the evidence we received over the last 15 months has left us concerned for its future capability.
Members of this House should be aware that the brigades within our Army have on average only 50 per cent of the soldiers they require for operations. If these brigades were fully staffed, they would still need a hefty injection of equipment for deployment in operations. In dollar terms, it is estimated that this injection would cost $4½ billion. While the performance of our Army over the last decade has been impressive, much of it has been and remains hollow. It could be characterised as a `phantom army'. From the evidence received by our committee and from talks with both reserve and regular soldiers, we believe that this situation must be improved. It is clear that partially staffed units with little equipment are a major source of dissatisfaction. These hollow units destroy morale, encourage separation from the service and probably inhibit recruitment. Most significantly, they do not deliver capability to the nation.
This report is very much about improving the Army's capability. To do that we have not felt constrained by traditional concepts for structuring, equipment and staffing. We believe that the stakes are too high to approach the suitability of the Army in any other fashion. In practical terms, our report recommends the effective doubling of the Army's capability to respond to short warning contingencies by the creation of four capable, fully staffed and ready brigades. It also recommends increasing the Army's capability to respond to more significant threats by the development of a force expansion capability 30 per cent greater than the current force—that is, we believe that the Army must be able to expand to 12 brigades within a reasonable warning time. Finally, we recommend the reinvigoration of the Army's personnel structures by aligning the regular and reserve components into a single entity for the purposes of employment arrangements, training and operations.
Our committee will circulate this report and then seek the views of the community on the recommendations we have made. In this report, we present a model for a future army. If this model is to be successful in increasing the capability and efficiency of the Army, it will need to be refined through consultation and discussion, and it will need to be broadly owned and supported by the community and by the Army. We believe that, as a consequence of this approach, we can help create a highly capable and efficient army. It will evolve from being a hollow phantom into a more efficient, effective and sustainable force.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the many people who took time to contribute to this inquiry. This includes many private citizens, non-government organisations, academics and departmental staff. It also included serving soldiers and officers within both the regulars and the reserve. I believe their efforts have resulted in a significant contribution to the current national discussion on our defence policy and the future of our armed forces. I would also like to thank all members of the committee, in particular the Deputy Chairman, the member for Chifley Mr Roger Price, and the very efficient and effective secretariat headed up by Margaret Swieringa. The committee would also like to thank Lieutenant Colonel Leo Hogan and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Ward for their help. The committee expresses its deeply felt thanks to the secretariat. I commend this report to the House. ",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,0,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I congratulate the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and endorse his remarks. When I proposed the terms of reference of the inquiry to the committee after its reformation following the last election, I had in mind the looming trouble in East Timor. I could not have imagined the outcome being such a radical report. Our recommendations are very broad and limited in number but focused. We resisted the temptation to get into the detail, but there is plenty in this report and its real impact is in its implications and implementation. It provides a realistic model upon which the Army can be radically restructured to meet our national security needs.
 The defence of Australia is not solely dependent on the ADF or, indeed, the Army. It starts with diplomacy and regional engagement. National security requires a formal and informal whole of government approach, and a national security council is recommended. Only this government could be relaxed and comfortable that Australia is still not reconciled with Indonesia, our largest and closest neighbour and our most important regional friend. 
An area of difficulty for the committee was dealing with concepts such as the defence of Australia, the planning anarchy that resulted from ASP 97, abandoning ten-year warning time and providing no warning time guidance and whether peacekeeping is or is not a force determinant. The report has identified Australia's area of critical strategic interest and calls upon Army to be able to mount concurrent operations of one brigade and one battalion of low- to mid-level intensity in coalition or under UN mandate, and be able to man, equip and sustain it. Our four brigade type formations would be able to do that, something that our current army cannot. We provide for a warning time of two years in which a serious threat would need to be met, providing a surge capability of a further eight brigades. 
Our serving men and women performed so well in East Timor, but even that effort was managed with great difficulty and it would have been unsustainable had the initial numbers been required to stay longer. The committee found that we have phantom brigades, phantom equipment and phantom dollars. The committee has blown away the sandcastles. It cuts out phantom brigades and boutique capability and requires uniform equipment provision. It provides a model to sustain our army into the future.
Whilst we appreciate the contribution of reservists serving in East Timor, we reject the current fashion for slot theory in the utilisation of reserves which of itself demonstrates the failure of this government's reserve policy. The committee has removed all distinctions between reserve and regular units. A Ready Reserve type component could be reconstituted under our proposals. The committee has rejected technology edge for a capability edge. It's the punch you pack that counts, not whether you have the most glamorous glove. In fact, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain a technology edge in our region anyhow.
`Totally integrated fighting force' is a concept used in the report which will become increasingly important. No single service can operate on its own. It is the way they operate together that delivers the biggest punch. The committee's desire to cost our proposals was hampered because Army did not appear to provide figures upon which the committee could rely. About the change process, we suggest that the Russell Hill mandarins and brass should get down and dirty and talk to all levels within Army rather than being overly reliant on chain of command and e-mails which are no substitute for face-to-face meetings. Implementation of the report will entail great political courage and leadership, if not will. I worry about Australia if the Minister for Defence does not sign up to the report. Then I worry, if he does sign up, will he cancel out at the last moment? I hope we do not have to have body bags to establish the veracity of this report. 
I wish to acknowledge the contribution of Lieutenant Colonel Leo Hogan, our military adviser, without whom this report could have not been written, and his predecessor, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Ward. I also thank Margaret Swieringa who made a seamless transition from Human Rights to Defence. I commend the report to all honourable members.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Chapter 2 of this report begins with a quotation attributed to the philosopher George Santayana:
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
The overall strength of this report, which I join the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Defence Subcommittee in commending to the House, is its realism and relevance. It achieves the intentions of the Defence Subcommittee because it bases its proposals for where we intend to go on the acute awareness of where we are and where we have come from. There is no doubt that this report is challenging. It challenges assumptions and it poses challenges to the policymakers. In particular, it challenges Army, the Australian Defence Force and the government to confront the issues it points to and deal with them to create an army that is relevant to our needs and flexible enough to meet emerging trends. And, instead of proposing a `behind closed doors' arrangement, it says that there needs to be a willingness to go and talk to the Australian people about the document and its implications. We are all stakeholders in the defence of this country and I for one am pleased to see this recognition of the fact. I hope that Defence listens carefully to the wider community and listens with equal care to the diverse voices within the Defence family. The Armed Forces Federation of Australia, as representative of the interests of ADF members, should be closely involved in negotiating change.
The chairman and deputy chairman have already taken the House through the key issues addressed in the report. It looks in detail at the issues of restructuring, logistics and the force structure. The report defines the key issues of hollowness and the inability to function operationally and looks at the balance of capabilities and the stagnation of the structure in peacetime. But I would like to stress the importance of the recognition of the hollowness of the current army to consideration of this report's recommendations. I believe it is as important as recognising the changing strategic environment and the level of resources needed to make our army effective. It is a matter of which we in the Northern Territory are acutely aware. Not only do we have a hollow structure, but that structure is threatened by shortcomings in supply and logistics. I hasten to add that these shortcomings are not the fault of the commanders in the field. Rather, they are explicitly the fault of a dysfunctional system that fails to provide anywhere near the appropriate level of resources—financial, human and material. 
During a subcommittee visit to the Northern Territory recently, we became aware of such issues as, for example, the Army's only tank regiment having no ammunition for the next year's training needs; artillery short of 155 millimetre, with one regiment having only 1,300 rounds to fire over a 12-month period; soldiers voicing their opinion that Army is at the bottom of the food chain for resources and equipment; removal of the requirement for the army individual readiness notice for a 33-round shoot to save ammunition and an overall reduction annually on ammunition available for training; and three-man crews for tanks that need four-man crews. And the list goes on. There are also serious questions about the level of morale in the ADF generally and in Army in particular. Some of these relate to the above matters.  
But there is a significant threat to morale in the inability of Defence management to deal with ongoing personnel issues. I refer firstly to the arbitrary and unilateral decision to reduce the remote locality leave travel entitlement which was raised during the course of this inquiry. There are also very real fears that the application of fringe benefits tax reporting requirements will have a direct and negative impact on real income levels because of the potential to lift rounded-up income beyond the levels for family allowance and other income support to which all Australians are entitled. Members will be aware that I brought these matters to the attention of the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence two months ago. He said at the time that he understood these were serious issues and that he would investigate them. His investigation has resulted in a bureaucratic explanation of the application of normal departmental liability to RLLT and the reduction of offset entitlements.
I understand the definition of NDL, and I am very clear on the fact that this has been a cost-cutting exercise, but I also understand that these arguments do not wash with the troops. It makes them angry to be offered such gratuitous statements to explain away their legitimate grievances. The issue here is not the real changes but the fact that the troops in the field feel misled. The ADF was asked in mid-1999 what they thought about the future of RLLT and their answer was a resounding, `Leave it alone.' Defence personnel executives came back in late 1999 and the typical response was, `Leave it as is because if we do not get a lump sum we will not be able to afford a holiday.' DPE reduced the entitlement by coming to a fare deal with Qantas and told the ADF about the new deal after it had begun to take effect. 
I might also point that ADF members who went to Timor and those who stayed behind in Northern Australia to support them did not take their leave at Christmas time and so they missed out on offsetting their RRLT at full value—a full fare Darwin-Adelaide economy return for those serving in Darwin. If they take their leave now they will only get a reduced amount because that has now become the normal departmental liability. Similarly, the ADF has now belatedly recognised that the FBT might be an issue. These are issues which need to be addressed urgently. I would like to acknowledge and thank the committee secretariat for their diligence and hard work.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—by leaveI would like to thank my colleagues from the Defence Subcommittee who have made a contribution to this debate on the report Towards a more efficient and effective army, but more importantly I thank them for their very diligent work on the inquiry and in the preparation of this report. I emphasise that this is a significant report. It will have a big impact on the debate. It is a report that the committee would like to think will have a big impact on the future role that the Army is going to play in defending this country. It is all about taking the Army into the next century. It is all about facing up to the current shortcomings, which the member for Chifley so effectively has outlined, adding to the points that the member for the Northern Territory and I have made. It is all about taking effective action. As we have titled the report, it is all about making our army more efficient and effective. We feel that it will be cost effective and affordable. 
The timing of these recommendations is significant. There is a window of opportunity, which will not be there beyond about the year 2007, to bring the Army up to the standard that all members of this House and indeed all Australians would expect. We are all very aware of the equipment requirements of the Navy and the Air Force towards the end of this decade and the likely budgetary impact that will have. Addressing these issues, we have made 12 very important recommendations. They are all about getting a better, tighter focus on defence. They are all about getting a proper national security policy. As we have pointed out, they address the issues of the regulars and the reserves and come up with what we believe is a very good solution that will address the concerns that have been raised. It is all about follow-up as well. Appendix G of the report proposes an Army capability enhancement project which is all about working through the recommendations of the report and putting them into place. We also talk about ongoing monitoring for the purposes of the parliament. Every six months a report comes back to the parliament so that all members are aware of what is happening.  
I recommend this report to all honourable members and to the wider Australian community. It not only is an eminently readable report but has a wealth of information. It also puts things in historical perspective. In the last century, while the Australian Army and the troops have done an outstanding job, I am not sure that the same can be said of some of the planning that has been done, particularly in preparation for earlier engagements.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I am very pleased to be reintroducing my private member's bill, the Aviation Noise Ombudsman Bill 2000, into this House. This bill is aimed at establishing an Australian Aviation Noise Ombudsman who would be empowered to hear complaints from the community affected by aircraft noise. The ombudsman would also be empowered to examine any proposed changes to aircraft routes, breaches of curfews or the cap on movements. This legislation is modelled on similar legislation which has been in operation in the United States for nearly four years and has been extremely successful. Last year, as a guest of the Australian Mayoral Aviation Council, the former US Aircraft Noise Ombudsman, Mr William Albee, visited Australia and met with a number of communities who suffer from aircraft noise, in order to promote this as a partial solution to at least ensuring that there is proper accountability over the issue of aircraft noise.
I first introduced this bill into the House of Representatives on 20 September 1999. It is unfortunate that this bill lapsed and that it needed to be reintroduced into the House. The reason is that the government does not seem to want to hear the truth about how their policies regarding various airports around Australia have failed. The government has failed to support this mechanism which is one of accountability. It is unfortunate that members such as the member for Hindmarsh in Adelaide, members in Brisbane and members from around Coolangatta and Perth—the four airports where there seem to be most problems—have failed to speak up in support of this bill and have failed to ensure that the government has a proper debate. A majority of members of  the Sydney Airport Community Forum, a body established and appointed by this government, owe their allegiance to government political parties. With the exception of the aircraft representatives, they have unanimously supported this bill. It is yet another example of the political representatives of this government having two faces—one when they are in their community and another when they are in parliament. The Liberal Party representatives on that committee have all supported this bill in the forum but have failed to ensure that this government debates and carries this bill. 
The inquiry earlier this year into the precision radar monitoring system at Sydney airport is a very clear example of why we need an aircraft noise ombudsman. The PRM inquiry into Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and the unnecessary delay in announcing whether a second airport will be constructed in Sydney are causing great frustration in my electorate of Grayndler and throughout Sydney. My electorate is perhaps the worst affected by aircraft noise from Sydney airport, given that the parallel runways to the north point directly at the most densely populated area of Australia. Over the next months, Sydney airport will be inundated with planes carrying athletes, officials and spectators to the Olympic Games. Over 300,000 people live within a radius of 10 kilometres of Sydney airport. Their lives will be seriously affected by the increase in noise over their heads. This will give residents a taste of what is predicted to occur in years to come with the expanding demand for air travel.
I want to give a practical example of a constituent of mine who would benefit from being able to go to an aviation noise ombudsman. Patricia Campbell lives in Tempe in my electorate, less than one kilometre from the runway of Kingsford Smith airport—not from the terminals but from the runway—yet this government says that her residence falls outside the contour for aircraft noise insulation. It is not surprising that the current Minister for Transport and Regional Services has not paid a visit to the area around Kingsford Smith airport in St Peters, Tempe and Sydenham, unlike, to his credit, the previous transport minister, John Sharp, and the previous chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, Joe Hockey. At least they were prepared to come down and see what it was like to live that distance from the airport. This minister would not have a clue.
Patricia spends all day every day at home as a full-time carer for her aged mother who needs constant care. She is literally bombarded by aircraft noise from 6 a.m., waking her up on queue as the 747s line up to come into Sydney airport, until 11 p.m., seven days a week, 12 months of the year. The only time Patricia gets away from the noise is during respite care which she ends up spending at her psychologist because the aircraft noise has brought her to the verge of a nervous breakdown. I have written to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services on her behalf, but to no avail. There has been no response from this minister. In this instance, an aviation noise ombudsman would look at the complaint in an objective and impartial way. That is the Australian way. It is an absurdity to have the current situation where, if you have a problem caused by aircraft noise as a result of the administration of Airservices Australia, the complaint body is Airservices Australia itself. We need an independent umpire to determine these matters.
In Patricia's case, if it were in place, the Aviation Noise Ombudsman would have the power to refer the matter to the Commonwealth Ombudsman for determination. Aircraft noise insulation continues to be a major issue for constituents seeking assistance from my office, particularly since the election of this government in 1996. Since that time, we have seen a huge reduction in homes entitled to be insulated—homes that had been granted funding for insulation by the previous Labor government. As part of the announcement of the minister for transport on noise sharing measures, he removed the entitlement that had been given in writing to those residents.
This government continues to ignore the needs of residents in the inner western suburbs of Sydney as it refuses to take a realistic approach towards insulation of properties. In January this year the Minister for Transport and Regional Services announced a further allocation of funding for approximately another 600 homes in Petersham and Stanmore. That announcement was quite telling. Unlike previous occasions, the minister acknowledged that there were things called hills in Sydney and that some people were more affected due to the natural contours around Sydney airport. If he visited the area, he would know that. I invite him once again to visit the area and to see what the problems are. It was also a clear indication that the government's noise sharing modes and long-term operating plan are simply not functioning. After a consultative process in which the member for Lowe, me, the member for Barton, the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Watson all participated, we were told there would be a sharing of noise. It simply has not happened. The government must acknowledge the need to revert to the original SANIP boundary for the noise amelioration program. 
The aircraft noise complaints line, run by Airservices Australia, continues to field hundreds of calls each month about the failure of noise sharing, about flight path deviations and about breaches of the curfew. Recently we had the startling, indeed scary, news that a power cut caused the air traffic control system to shut down. The planes might not land in Red Hill, where the minister lives in Canberra, but they do land in my electorate and the electorate of the member for Lowe, and we are concerned about this. To top this off, the PRM trials currently being undertaken are causing a massive increase in flights over the suburbs just north of the airport. In spite of the fact that the Sydney Airport Community Forum unanimously adopted a position that there should be meetings in the inner west of Sydney, the public meetings were held nowhere near where people were worst affected—they were held on the North Shore of Sydney, which shows the bias of this government. It is not just at Sydney airport that there is a problem, although the final comment on that is that, on 23 June, the Sydney airport cap was broken. The cap was introduced as a result of a private member's bill I introduced in this House, yet there were 87 movements at Sydney airport in one hour. I hope that is not a sign of things to come.
These are all examples of how an aviation noise ombudsman could help people in the community who suffer from increasing levels of aircraft noise, which certainly is not just a problem in my electorate and not just at Sydney airport. This bill is to be seconded today by the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd. The member for Griffith has been a longstanding and tireless campaigner for his constituents, who are badly affected by the noise from Brisbane airport. I am pleased to see my colleague Craig Emerson in the House. He supports the bill and the member for Lilley also supports the bill.
The Perth airport continues to create major problems with the expansion of air travel. As part of an invitation from the member for Swan, Kim Wilkie, I met with local government representatives from the City of Canning and the City of Belmont, who expressed their desire for this bill to be carried. Stephen Smith, as the member for Perth, has also organised meetings on this issue with local residents, who all demand that this bill be carried. The Coolangatta airport, in the federal electorate of Richmond, has seen a significant increase in aircraft noise. When I introduced the bill last year, I called upon the member for Richmond to come out in support of this bill. He has failed to do so. In spite of that, the state member for Tweed, Neville Newell, is standing up for the residents of Richmond. I have tabled in this House a petition from more than 500 residents from the electorate of Richmond, arguing that this bill has to be debated and determined in this House.
I also ask why the member for Hindmarsh has been so silent on this bill, given the fact that her constituents are affected so badly by Adelaide airport. Steve Georganas, a local community activist from Adelaide who has been endorsed as the ALP candidate for Hindmarsh, has been very active in organising and supporting those residents in that community who are concerned about aircraft noise at Adelaide airport. The good news for them is that, after the next election, they will have a local member who will stand up for their interests. 
Right across Australia—Adelaide, Perth, Coolangatta, Brisbane, Sydney airport and increasingly Melbourne airport and other airports as well where this will be an issue—there are concerns which point to the need for an Aviation Noise Ombudsman. I am pleased that the member for Bradfield, who is the chair of the Sydney Airport Community Forum—which has the unanimous support of all of the community representatives—is in the chamber today. Why is it that this government has to be dragged kicking and screaming to make an appointment which would simply bring some accountability to the operation of airports around Australia? As aircraft travel continues to grow, this issue will affect a lot of the regional airports as well. I know that Coffs Harbour, in the electorate of Cowper, is becoming increasingly affected by aircraft noise with the expansion of tourism there. I am very pleased that the member for Griffith, who holds a Brisbane based seat, is seconding this bill. It shows that this bill is not just about Sydney airport but about the proper functioning of aviation policy in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I am pleased to announce that the Olympic torch will enter the city of Blacktown at about 5.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 13 September. The Blacktown City Council has arranged special viewpoints for Blacktown residents in the following areas: at Minchinbury Reserve, the torch will arrive at 7 a.m.; at Kareela Reserve East, the torch will arrive at 8 a.m.; at Alpha Park Blacktown, the torch will arrive at 9 a.m.; and, at Seven Hills North Public School, the torch will arrive at 9.50 a.m.
One of the torch carriers will be Julia Blair, who has been a school assistant at Maryong South Public School for 26 years. Julia has run gymnastics clubs for children for 26 years and 12 of these clubs are for disabled children. Julia and her husband, Terry, are among the most highly qualified gymnastics coaches for disabled children in New South Wales. On weekends, Mr and Mrs Blair can often be found at the Blacktown Police Boys Club and on Sundays they are at Homebush, running classes. This is amazing because it is all done on top of regular visits to Concord Hospital to treat Mr Blair's serious medical condition. Mrs Blair says that the torch run is special to her family and friends. I wish Mrs Blair and the torchbearers good luck for the run on the 13th, and I wish all the athletes the best of luck for a successful 2000 Olympic Games.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Greenway Electorate: Olympic Torch Relay</title>,Statements by Members,2,1
"Lawler, Tony, MP",NP,2000-09-04,"—I move:
That the House:
(1) notes the crucial importance of water to the ongoing growth of the Australian economy and to the environment of rivers and wetlands;
(2) acknowledges the many initiatives implemented over the past decade to achieve more efficient use of water;
(3) commends the Government for the directions created by the Natural Heritage Trust National Rivercare Program initiatives, particularly in regard to the Murray Darling Basin and the upper reaches of the Snowy River; 
(4) calls for all future water allocations to be used for environmental purposes to be only taken from savings from the NSW and Victorian distribution system and only after satisfying a test of the national interest; and
(5) calls for proper financial compensation to be awarded to those who have their right to water taken away.
This motion acknowledges a number of key issues concerning water resources. These issues arise due to the importance of water to the economic and environmental wellbeing of regional areas such as my electorate of Parkes, but certainly not confined to that area. A more efficient balance of these two competing interests has been a source of increasing public debate and considerable government activity of recent times. For example, the federal Natural Heritage Trust was started in July 1996 and is the single biggest effort by the government and local communities to ensure the ecological sustainability and economic viability of Australia's natural resource base—with almost $1.5 billion committed over six years. One of the programs under the Natural Heritage Trust targeted at improving the management and condition of our rivers is the National Rivercare Initiative. Through the National Rivercare Initiative the government has invested $83 million over five years, starting from 1997-98 and continuing to 2001-02. Other river focus programs under the trust that complement the National Rivercare Initiative include the Murray Darling Basin 2001 program, Waterwatch Australia, the National River Health Program and the Fisheries Action Program.
It is more than evident that the ecological concerns of the community have been acted upon by this government and by previous governments and that these measures are comprehensive and ongoing. What is of concern is that the same due care has apparently not been given to the economic concerns of individual irrigation farmers or to the regional communities which rely on the irrigators' continued viability. For example, not only have water licence allocations been slashed in many cases—proposed up to 47 per cent—but also federal money allocated to governments, such as the New South Wales government, to compensate these irrigators has not been paid to them. I understand that in the COAG agreements there is no legal obligation for the states to use the competition payments for this purpose, but they certainly have a moral obligation to do so. I draw attention to the Queensland government which has passed on about 11 per cent of its competition payments to offset the burden carried by local governments due to competition policy, but not one razoo has been forwarded by the New South Wales government in this regard.
 This means that the financial burden for water reform in the state of New South Wales has fallen squarely upon the shoulders of irrigation farmers. These farming families made business decisions based on the amount of water they believed was rightfully theirs to use, only to have the goalposts effectively moved without notice—and it is threatened that they will be moved again. To then refuse compensation for this loss is an outrageous injustice upon these hard-working people, and I would like this government to take greater steps to force the New South Wales and Queensland administrations especially to pay them their due. Certainly on the Cooper, the Queensland government went so far as to encourage investors to irrigate along that river, but then, having spent the money, they had the rug pulled out from under them following community outrage over the fact that it was done. I have no problem with communities voicing their opinions, but the investor certainly should not be the one who is left holding the can.
It is also essential that the broader, long-term implications that the dramatic reduction in water availability will have on the economy of rural areas be fully addressed. Many country towns gain much of their economic viability from the modest success of surrounding irrigators, and that portion has increased with the relative decline of more traditional commodities like wool. Take the example of Bourke, a thriving centre of just under 3,500 people, that provides over $75 million in irrigation produce annually using just two per cent of flows from the Darling River. The irrigation industry provides 700 full-time jobs in Bourke, but it is feared that water allocations could be cut by up to 47 per cent. This would have disastrous ramifications for the region. The Bourke Shire Council rightly points out that such a reduction would have flow-on results in the way of job losses—up to 329 full-time positions by their estimates. The council also argues that such a reduction would lead to less income for local business houses, fewer children in the schools and therefore fewer teachers, and less funding for police, schools and hospitals. These are the projected short-term results over a few years, but the long-term results would be far more alarming. 
Centres such as Bourke have few alternative income sources and even fewer options by way of diversification. Within a decade a community such as Bourke would dwindle from a self-sustaining, economically vibrant community to one more shrivelling welfare village that this country—and my electorate—could well do without. And no-one is more acutely aware of this precarious balance than the community's irrigators themselves. As a consequence, farmers in the district are among the industry's most innovative, constantly trialing better river management techniques while optimising end-of-river flows by self-regulating rotational pumping. There are between 30 and 36 water licences in the Bourke area that have not as yet been developed and, despite the community's expectations that these assets will be utilised, there are now fears that these permits may be cancelled altogether—again with no compensation to the holders. This entire scenario would be catastrophic for Bourke and all the other towns served by surrounding irrigators—Narromine, Trangie and Warren. I would like the government to back moves restricting so-called environmental flows to only water that has been saved through more efficient water management. This efficiency is already being achieved through the programs and federal funding I mentioned earlier.
It is my information that of the total water loss in the river system of the Murray Darling between the upper catchment and Adelaide only three per cent is attributable to irrigation. This would indicate that the slashing of an allocation of irrigators by 50 per cent would only have an impact of about 1½ per cent on the total flow of the river. The catastrophe of having their irrigation halved that would befall towns like Bourke along the river that rely on irrigation is almost indescribable. During a recent flood period, approximately 10,600,000 megalitres flowed past Bourke, of which about 7,100,000 megalitres reached Wilcannia. After storage and flood plain losses, less than 2,500,000 megalitres reached the Murray River. Clearly these losses have a far greater impact on the water flowing into South Australia than any impact that the irrigation industry may have. It could be argued that there are producers who do not make optimal use of their water in either their irrigation practices or in their choice of crop. However, it would appear to me that a 45 per cent reduction in water allocation would penalise the very farmers who have already optimised their water usage and are using the water in its most efficient way. For example, the Mansell family of Back O'Bourke Fruits have in excess of 95 per cent of their horticulture production under drip irrigation and control all of their water flows by computer. These people simply cannot gain much more in the way of efficiencies whereas a farmer who is irrigating fodder crops may be able to do so. A blunt regulation instrument is not the way to address these issues. 
No-one denies the need to maintain our environmental assets, and it is clear that enormous steps are already being taken in pursuit of this goal. I must say at this point that farmers are not looking particularly for compensation but just for a fair go and a reasonably scientific approach to the problem, but adequate compensation must accompany any forced reduction in the amount of legitimately purchased water resources that farmers are ultimately able to use. Tradability of water is an underpinning principle of COAG, but you can only have true tradability if you have secure property rights. You cannot simply trade without having secure property rights. But by hastening the process to establish a more ecologically focused water usage arrangement, the relevant authorities are threatening the future of the very towns in western New South Wales that are prospering. There are many valid reasons for changing our attitude to water use. State governments of both persuasions have erred in overallocating our rivers. The health of the river is important. But salinity and water quality are also important, and they are issues of extreme concern to areas such as South Australia. I am told that one of the reasons for the silting of the mouth of the Murray is in fact the erection of barriers at the mouth of the Murray to impede tidal flows. I am also told that some of the areas at the mouth of the Murray are amongst the worst salt-producing areas in the Murray Darling Basin. I say this not to criticise people in South Australia but to highlight the mistakes that have been made in the past all through the Murray Darling Basin, and to make the point that it is a small group of people that are apparently being left to pay. It is all very well to pay heed to regional and rural areas' calls for economic support, but if simultaneously the hatchet is applied to one of the few industries bringing genuine growth to some of those centres—and arguably helping several others in the district to survive—then it is all for nought.

"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—The contribution by the honourable member for Parkes outlines completely the cause of the problem. What we are talking about here is, without question, Australia's major economic and environmental national problem, for which we have to find solutions. An article in the Financial Review published on the weekend draws attention to the fact that the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the CSIRO are all in agreement that this is now a $64 billion problem—if it can be fixed at all. We have had a plea from the member for Parkes that, `As you go about fixing it, leave the irrigators alone.' As I will make clear in my contribution, I am not about taking water off irrigators. I am about treating irrigators fairly. But for heaven's sake—when a member of the parliament purports to be representing the National Party, purports to be caring about an issue such as this, then he ought to at least have some grasp or understanding of the problem. 
The problem primarily is this. We all acknowledge that there are two few stream flows remaining in the Murray River from its tributaries. The Snowy is one that has come to public note, as a result of the Victorian election in particular. We know we have a problem. There is not enough water left in the river to sustain the outcome. We have known this for a long time. The first serious step taken by the Murray Darling Commission, with the cooperation of the state governments involved, was the introduction of the cap to at least limit what would be taken out from this point on. It was conceded that savings in future had to be made in two areas. They had to be made in the public delivery system, in the way water is stored and delivered to farms, and in on-farm distribution. 
I think any serious observer of this whole issue since the change of government in 1996 would say that what has been totally missing in Australia is national leadership. The first action taken by the Howard government in 1996 in slashing the former Labor government budget was to cut funds to a whole range of areas, fundamentally including a number of programs that were applied to the Murray Darling Commission and a number of environmental programs, which had begun to build momentum, for alternative land use in the Murray Valley, programs which tackled the issues of salinity and water use and support for the state governments which had imposed the cap, against the screams of the users of the water.  
For two years this whole thing went into abeyance because of the budget decisions of the federal government. Then along came the sale of Telstra and the great $1 billion for the Natural Heritage Trust—`the world's greatest environment program'. When you study it, all that happened was that the former programs were put back. They were all rebadged. Over a five-year period there was not a single extra dollar of funding and in that hiatus the problem just got worse. Now we have the premiers of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia all pulling their hair out because the federal government is providing no leadership on, and no coordination even of, genuine solutions to the problem. A CSIRO report, which landed in about March this year, said, `This has all gone so far that it cannot be repaired.' The response from the Farmers Federation and the ACF is: `Yes, we think it can, but it needs $65 billion over the next 10 years.' Where on earth are we going to find $65 billion? 
At the last federal election, Labor became the first party to take to a federal election a national water and salinity strategy which would have provided national leadership and an intelligent approach to cooperatively upgrading the public delivery system and encouraging farmers to move to more on-farm savings. Let us talk briefly about upgrading the public delivery system. The water authorities concede that measures to upgrade the public delivery system would deliver savings in the order of 10 per cent of total irrigation use. Conservationists and academics say it is more in the order of 30 per cent. I have worked on a figure at the bottom end, about 15 per cent—a conservative estimate. 
What have we seen in the last two years? Labor spelled out how we could do this as a federal government. The shadow minister sitting at the table, Mr Kerr, who was then the environment minister, worked through this negotiation about what we would do. We spelled it out for them. There has not been a single word, not a single step taken. Now we get the member for Parkes standing up here bleating, `Whatever happens, you cannot take it off the irrigators.' I fully understand—probably much better than him—the importance of water in country areas. I fully understand the importance of security of supply. I fully understand the need for us to encourage and invest in high value added activities on-farm, major water saving techniques on-farm and major development and upgrading of the public delivery system.
 I say there are solutions. In fact, now there are quite simple solutions. You have actually got the four state governments prepared to commit considerable resources to matching a federal package. The only thing missing is the federal package. It is not as if there is not the money to do it; the key point is that they have neither the wit nor the will to tackle these sorts of problems. 
I find it astounding that the member for Parkes would be silly enough to include in the private members' business section of our agenda a debate about water, acknowledging that it is such a huge issue in Australia now. It will be a big topic at the next federal election in the action agenda of both the government and the opposition. But I know where the intelligent proposals will be coming from; I know where the cooperative proposals will be coming from. I know right now where there are no ideas and where there is no willingness to provide leadership. Most importantly, since 1996, there has simply been populist cant about investment in river care and the rebadging of all these programs, but not a single dollar or a single unit of energy has been expended on providing the national leadership so badly needed in this area.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Water</title>,Private Members' Business,10,1
"Causley, Ian, MP",NP,2000-09-04,"—Well, well, well. Hyperbole and cant. Did we hear it? No wonder he lost his shadow portfolio. In fact, he came to the electorate of Page to talk to my constituents and could not find the township of Maclean so he could not talk to them.  
—Play the ball. You've only got five minutes.
—The member for Paterson well might chant, because I will start to tell him a little bit about the allocation of water in the—I can't even think of the river now; the Paterson River. I do not think this is a subject that need get down to politics. That is exactly what we are seeing from the Labor Party. This is a very serious issue; an extremely serious issue. Having been, I think, the longest serving minister for water resources in New South Wales, I have had a little bit to do with it. I think that the one thing we must remember in this country is that we have very little water and we do need it desperately for the industries that we have. That is not to say that we should not take note of the environment and the needs of the river. In fact, under my portfolio guidance, we were the first government to give an allocation to the river in New South Wales. This is more to do with states than it is with the federal government. Yes, the Murray-Darling council has a role to play, but overall it is the management of the states that defines the water allocations and the water management. 
We cannot deny that irrigation is very important in Australia. Many studies have been done. I took the opportunity while I was a member in New South Wales to look through the debates about the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme. The debates started right back in 1915. It was very interesting to read through those debates about the need for water and the need for development in what was really a semi-arid desert around Leeton and Griffith, which has now become the food bowl of Australia. It is a very important debate. In those days—or even four or five years ago—we did not know the extent of the environmental damage that was being done. Some of it was not from irrigation; some of it was from land practices that were encouraged by previous governments and that the owners of the properties who are now being blamed did not realise were causing a problem. 
We do know now that there are some effects that are causing problems, and it seems that the easy action is to blame the irrigators and take the water away from them. The irrigators have never said to me—not once—that they are opposed to looking at better management of water. In fact, when we raised these issues in the past in New South Wales, they willingly sat down and cooperated with government as to how they could better use water. They introduced laser levelling, they introduced drip irrigation in horticulture, they tried by all means to alleviate the salinity problems by planting trees around the perimeters of farms. The users and the farmers in those areas are quite willing to sit down and talk about this and try to work their way through—quite willing. But when you get a white paper like we have in New South Wales which suggests that all this should be managed through management committees, and the only input that producers will have is two on a board that practically can be of 20, what sensible debate are we going to get? The only way we are going to resolve these issues is to sit down with the people who are using the resource, explain to them the problems and get some input from them as to how they can change their practices to alleviate the problem. And they are willing to help.
So I think in these parliaments—not just this parliament, but parliaments around Australia—we have to get away from this finger pointing and saying, `You're causing the problem,' because these people have acted on the best advice available from all government departments over many years. Yes, our knowledge has changed. Now we have to look at ways in which we can alleviate the situation. I do not believe it is going to be achieved by just blaming one particular section. It is not going to be achieved by a particular interest group coming into this argument and saying, `We want more of this resource,' without sitting down and scientifically proving what the result will be. We also need to look at the economic results. We often forget about that. If we just go in with a quick action—a quick reaction probably—in some of these affairs, we will destroy country communities. It is a very delicate subject. It needs to be handled very carefully. It needs input from local people and it needs some sensible reactions from governments. If we get those, I am sure we can start to reverse some of the problems that we see out there in the community at the present time that we all agree are causing some angst.

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—As often, I fully agree with the member for Page: this should be a non-political issue if we are going to resolve it. I will also say that I fully commiserate with the member for Parkes—I was going to say Dubbo—because he has identified a problem that is not going to be fixed quickly, that is not going to go away. As the member for Page indicated, Australia indeed has become a world leader in irrigation techniques that require a minimum amount of water. We do it very well. 
But again I refer to a comment the member for Page made: that a virtual desert has been transformed into a food bowl. That tells something of how our farming community—our society—has felt that it had the right simply to divert resources and change forever the environment. And we have done that specifically without knowing what we were doing. From a little research in a few papers that I have read and from my own property in the Hunter, I know that levee banks, considered by many to be a panacea because they prevent flooding, of course simply divert water to other places. Similarly with clearing snags—clearing logs to hurry up the flow of water. These are the sorts of issues that we have to address. The salinity issue is estimated to cost $64 billion, and I do not think anyone says that that figure is wrong. The whole of the remainder of the sale of Telstra could go to trying to resolve the problem that we have with land salinity in this nation—something that has evolved since European settlement simply because of land management practices.
In his introduction, the member for Parkes used the word `sustainability', and that is what it comes down to—sustainability. It is vital that we find a sustainable way of managing our land practices. There is no doubt of the prosperity that a variety of crops have brought to inland Australia. I was reading today about Dirranbandi and the effect that cotton has had on that town alone. I think that is in the electorate of the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It has changed it from a broken down rural community into a thriving community. But it is all about sustainability. How long can it go? How long can it continue? How long can it continue to use water in the way it is currently using it? Perhaps, like our predecessors, we do not have the answer to that and that is why we need to study it. We have cotton in the north, we have fruit trees in the MIA, we have rice in the MIA. Perhaps it seems a bit ridiculous that some of these crops are grown where they would not naturally grow. They are only there because of the way we use our irrigation water.
So I respect the argument put forward by the member for Parkes. I know what it is to be in a rural and regional electorate. Those communities need us to determine that they have a place in the future. I sincerely hope that we can work together to resolve this. I fully support the fact that we should not go pointing the finger only at the New South Wales government, only at the Queensland government or only at the Victorian government. I heard the flow rates that were mentioned. In I think it was the 1998 flood, a major flood occurrence in south-western Queensland and north-western New South Wales, virtually none of that water got to flow out at the Murray mouth in South Australia. I would also point out that the statistics show that something like 56 per cent of the flow of the Murray-Darling Basin in 1998-99 was diverted from its normal flow. All I can say is that if we continue to use those practices, then we are heading for disaster.
The other thing that we have to look at is the seasonal variation. Unfortunately, it is spring and early summer when the flow is high but it is late summer when the demand is great. (Time expired)

This week will mark National Child Protection Week. It should provide an opportunity to take stock of our progress in addressing this major problem in our society and setting goals for future action. Instead, it is likely that it will simply provide an opportunity for government window-dressing. The real situation hardly warrants the round of self-congratulating that these affairs turn out to be. The February 2000 report on government services, under `Protection and support services', shows that notifications of child abuse and neglect have greatly increased in recent years. Comparing notifications for the years 1996-97 and 1998-99, we find that notifications increased in Victoria by nine per cent, in Queensland by 21 per cent, in Western Australia by 22 per cent and in South Australia by an alarming 30 per cent. There is cause for alarm. These levels of notifications have occurred despite the work of the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse and its predecessor, the National Child Protection Council. They have occurred despite the efforts of all state governments as well as community based organisations working in this field.
The Commonwealth's obligations for the protection of children from abuse and neglect are covered in article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Commonwealth has a clear responsibility to act in this area, but there are more important reasons than simply that international obligation. In economic terms, child abuse and neglect lead to high costs to governments and the community. Studies in the United States claim that for every dollar spent intervening in a supportive way in a family with young children, seven dollars is saved later on down the track in welfare, health costs, crime fighting and the jail system. The trouble is that you do not get the benefit of these savings for 14 to 15 years. It is a long-term investment. Don Weatherburn, Director of the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics, gave some idea of the costs in a recent interview on Radio National:
For every thousand neglected children in New South Wales, about a quarter of them, we estimate, will end up in the Children's Court, and they'll be committing upwards of 11 or 12 break-and-enters a month during those four or five years, so they'll generate an enormous burden on the community in terms of crime.
That is just part of the price paid by the community. The victims of abuse and neglect may copy the abusive behaviour, the cycle of neglect and abuse will continue and another generation of children will suffer as a result. We cannot continue to fund child protection agencies on a shoestring budget. Most of the tragic histories of abuse and neglect that we hear of reveal overstretched agencies failing to respond in time to reported cases of abuse. If we are to break this cycle of abuse and neglect and if we are to save future generations from abuse and neglect, the scale of intervention must be great enough to break this cycle. We have to be prepared to properly fund programs of intervention—and we have to be patient; the results will not appear for another generation. 
A national approach is needed. The work done by the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse has barely scratched the surface. Unless the resources necessary to back up strategies are made available, we will continue to see increases in child abuse and neglect notifications. Unless we have a national approach which includes assessment of resources necessary for prevention, repair and intervention as well as research, we will continue to lose the race against child abuse and neglect. Not every problem can be fixed by throwing dollars at it. A national approach to protecting children from abuse and neglect can result in savings where individual states and agencies combine their experience and research to develop better strategies. But in the end all the policies and strategies are worth little if resources do not match the need.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—I rise to strongly support the motion moved by the member for Fowler and I commend both the member for Fowler and the member for Braddon for having the foresight to put it on for debate here this afternoon. The 19th century poet George Eliot said:
Childhood is only the beautiful and happy time in contemplation and retrospect: to the child it is full of deep sorrows, the meanings of which are unknown.
For the 103,000 cases of child abuse and neglect reported to Australian authorities last year, the cause of their `deep sorrows' is certainly known. One-third were emotional abuse cases, 30 per cent were physical abuse, about a quarter of cases were neglect of children and 16 per cent were cases of sexual abuse. In fact, I read only yesterday a report from the People's Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse published under the heading `You're the Voice' and in it a number of facts are reproduced from the Children's Commission of Queensland report on the 1997 inquiry into paedophilia. For example:
One in 4 girls and one in 8 boys are sexually abused by the time they reach the age of 18 years. More than 150,000 children under 17 years in Queensland have been sexually abused and an estimated 420,000 Queenslander's over the age of 18 years are survivors of sexual abuse—
in one form or another, according to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence studies referred to in the commission's report. It says:
Close to 70% of psychiatric patients are known to have been sexually abused as children. 40% to 60% of women in care suffering depression, phobias, obsessive compulsive disorders, personality disorders and schizophrenia had been the victims of significant sexual abuse as children.
It goes on to say that child abuse could trigger the development of future violent behaviour resulting in criminal convictions—to which the member for Fowler just referred.
Some experiences do not ever leave your memory. I remember, as a fourth year medical student in 1980 in Adelaide, having chosen to spend my six-month elective term attached to the Crisis Intervention Unit in South Australia. Until that time I think it is fair to say that I had enjoyed a life sheltered from the far extremes of human emotion and behaviour. The nature of this extraordinary service was that social workers would take calls from people suffering a variety of stresses and then, if appropriate, would dispatch people in a car to do a home visit. I went on one such home visit and we arrived at a home expecting to speak to a distressed woman about a sexual assault only to be met at the door by a man brandishing a shotgun. When the police arrived and talked him into letting the authorities in, the scene was one where this man, fuelled by alcohol, had raped his six-year-old stepdaughter while she had been forcibly restrained by her own mother. Similarly I recall a visit as a young doctor to a modest home in the northern suburbs of Hobart in the early hours of the morning to provide comfort to a mother of three who had found her husband having sex with their eight-year-old daughter. What is it about some human beings that they can be so cruel, if not depraved, when it comes to children? 
The extent to which we nurture the idealism of young people and protect the vulnerable transition of children to adulthood is a critical measure of a caring society, and in this regard Australia has some considerable distance to go. There are all kinds of neglect and all kinds of abuse. My electorate on the upper North Shore of Sydney, which is amongst the most affluent electorates in the country, has the same problems that many other lower income, lower levels of education electorates have. But in some areas of my electorate my experience, based on people with perhaps high levels of education, is that we sometimes project on to our children our own unfulfilled ambitions and children feel increasingly under great stress to meet the expectations of their parents. In other instances I have also seen parents project with aggression those ambitions onto their children, which manifest themselves in all forms of self-harm, including but not confined to drug use and alcohol abuse, the extreme end of which is suicide.
This week marks our efforts to reduce child abuse and neglect. With the annual number of reported cases of child maltreatment increasing and Kids Help Line run off its feet, we have little in this area of which we can be proud. The Kids Help Line, for example, answers about 350,000 calls a year. Many more calls are attempted, but there are not enough volunteers to take the calls. The help line is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and there are about 85 counsellors. The major issues include child abuse, which ranks No. 4. When children are asked why they have attempted or contemplated suicide, child abuse is the most often mentioned reason. As far as the Kids Help Line is concerned, child abuse refers to physical, sexual and mental abuse, as well as neglect. The help line answered over 6,000 calls about child abuse last year alone. Three-quarters of the callers are female.
One specific challenge which faces Aboriginal Australia in this regard is reflected in some of the disturbing data which has been collected about child abuse and neglect over the last decade. Though comprising only three per cent of the population, indigenous Australians comprise eight per cent of reported and substantiated child abuse. They also represent more than one in eight cases of neglect, according to Broadbent and Bentley. For example, many are unaware that since 1990 the death rate from Aboriginal domestic child abuse has increased to a level 30 per cent above that of Aboriginal adult deaths in custody. 
Australia desperately needs a nationally coordinated approach to child abuse and neglect. The public response to child sexual abuse and physical and emotional abuse is fragmented. It is poorly coordinated and generally not well informed, tragically so when you consider the long-term effects, which include, but are not confined to, eating disorders, self-harm, suicide, nightmares, drug and alcohol abuse and intractable psychiatric and psychological disorders. There is still no good national child sexual abuse database, but we do have different sources of information—the police, the courts, correctional services, protective services, health-care providers, victims services, community agencies—all of which are put together to deal with these things, in many cases in an uncoordinated fashion. Reporting, policing, education, counselling, prevention and early intervention programs still rely far too much on cake stalls, raffles and the goodwill of volunteers and the agencies for which they work.
Commonwealth initiatives in this area include the 1994 National Prevention Strategy for Child Abuse and Neglect. The 1997 National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse was formed to provide community perspectives, advice and recommendations on child protection issues to the relevant Commonwealth minister and also to fund and oversee research and the promotion of annual awards, the National Child Abuse Prevention Awards. Commonwealth initiatives also include organisational and research grants, and the Commonwealth has supported accommodation programs, which are jointly funded with the states. This year we have seen the year 2000 stronger families strategy, which has committed $240 million over four years for nine new initiatives, including a special focus on effective parenting and early childhood. All of those measures are to be commended and supported, but any scholarly examination of this issue, if not acting as a practical exposure to the problems of day-to-day life facing everyday Australians, suggests we have a lot farther to go. Surely this issue is pressing enough to warrant a strategic approach, including significantly more funds. We should also ask ourselves what it is about modern society that more children will have reasons as adults to nod in painful agreement with Eliot's assessment of childhood.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—The birth of a child is unique. From birth until young adulthood, children are emotionally and physically dependent on those who are responsible for their day-to-day care. Their belief systems and emotional wellbeing are formed by the direct and indirect systems they are engaged with. Tragically, every year too many children suffer and even die due to abuse and neglect within the very systems that are set up to protect them from harm. Child maltreatment and trauma are complex phenomena that are found not only in families but also in the government systems they come into contact with. These systems to some extent have not recognised, and still do not recognise, their failure by ignoring the fact that children who voluntarily go, or are mandated, into the Family Court system continue to be harmed.
In 1995 the then federal Attorney-General required the Law Reform Commission and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to hold an inquiry into and to report back on matters relating to children and young people who were involved in the legal process, including that of the Family Court. The report stated that in 1996 Australia had 1.8 million children aged between zero and 18. Sadly, during the period of 1995-96 there were 91,734 cases of alleged child abuse and 67,816 of those cases were investigated by child protection authorities. Children continue to be abused within our communities, and the systems they reach out to for help continue to perpetuate that abuse. Our Family Court system, along with the system of agencies that are protecting children, is fragmented and is trying to deliver a service to children that it cannot deliver. This system is severely underfunded and underresourced.
As a society, Australia has increasingly begun to speak openly about child abuse to break the silence in order to protect our innocent children. Why are we still getting it so wrong? One of the key things that need to be addressed is the lack of coordination of services that deal with child sexual assault. For instance, it is not uncommon for a minimum of five different agency workers and organisations to be dealing with one child at any one time. 
The North West Centre Against Sexual Assault, headed by Vicki Russell, in Burnie in my electorate, deals with systems abuse of children every day. Sexual assault services such as these are part of the front line attack trying to deal with children every day who are victims of sexual assault. One particular case comes to mind of a small child aged five who had been sexually assaulted. He disclosed the abuse to one of his parents. The parent made a notification to child protection and took the child to the North West Centre Against Sexual Assault for assessment and counselling. Upon this disclosure, the child can be interviewed by more than five different professionals in the course of the investigation. That is five different faces, five different strangers and five different systems. Each worker who is now involved with this one child may not even speak to any of the others during the case. He may be interviewed by the police, the sexual assault worker, the child protection worker, the Family Court counsellor, a psychologist and even a lawyer who has been ordered by the Family Court to represent the child. He may then be placed on a protection order and placed in temporary care whilst the investigation is completed—another system and another strange face. 
The child is abused not only by one of his parents but also by the system that has been set up to protect him. I cannot even imagine what it would be like for this small child to experience such a trauma. He is a victim of the system that has been set up to care for him. What is needed is reform—and we need it now. Sadly, a sexual assault worker may work intensively with this child for six months whilst the case proceeds through the Family Court system, and not once will this professional be consulted about the information that the child has disclosed. Not once may this worker be contacted by any of the other agencies involved with his case.
It is time for a coordinated approach to the care of children who have been sexually assaulted. Section 65 of the Family Law Act provides a number of means by which a child or young person can have their wishes and concerns expressed. A child can be appointed a separative representative to be their voice in court. But I am shocked to hear that, on some occasions, the appointed representative may not even speak to or see the child before they represent them. This child has become a faceless name on a piece of paper. We have created an adult system based on adult thinking and adult experiences. I commend all of those who try to work in this system, undermanned and underresourced. I believe, like most of them, that we must listen to the children as they speak out or, as the Kids Help Line says, cry out for help.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Child Abuse</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—I am a dad. I am the father of two children: a son and a daughter. For the life of me, I do not understand and could never contemplate ever being involved in sexually abusing a child. But it happens, and it happens too often. I guess everyone in this House would recognise that one of the major challenges facing Australia, as earlier speakers said, is ensuring that kids do have the best start in life, that they do not have to endure the sorts of things we are talking about this afternoon and that they can realise their hopes and their dreams.
One would think in a thinking society that the protection of children should just be taken for granted. However, neither I nor my fellow colleagues would be so naive as to suggest that now. A basic tenet of our society is that there are children out there who do suffer this abuse, and there are many of them. I heard the figures quoted by the member for Bradfield. He indicated that one in four girls and one in eight boys suffered this kind of abuse before they were 18. That is a very sobering statistic for the member to bring into this House and for us all to think about. It is somewhat appropriate that this week marks National Child Protection Week, which is organised by the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect and funded by the coalition government, and that this year's theme is `Family—Australia's most important team'. Too right it is.
It gives me great assurance to announce that the coalition government is offering real assistance to strengthen `the family'. The coalition government has focused on the need to address problems relating to family breakdowns, including early intervention and prevention, working with the community and social coalition to provide better services and support, and holistic approaches to problems and using activities to build better approaches. Our track record on this issue has shown a strong interest in children's issues and provides leadership in various areas such as research and the provision of specialist services such as children's contact services.
Just last week I was very privileged to open the new children's contact centre in Townsville. I know that Relationships Australia, the organisation that will be undertaking that tender on behalf of the federal government, are very pleased that they have been able to win this particular tender because they know that it is a vital service that has to be provided. There has been tremendous inquiry and interest already, particularly from the legal profession and also from parents who want to take advantage of this new children's contact centre. I know too that Relationships Australia will provide valuable assistance to those affected by child abuse. It reassures the Townsville community that there is a helping hand out there if they need it. Relationships Australia in Townsville are very actively involved in this week's events. They have a family support worker organising and presenting many seminars and workshops on this particular situation. 
I have been fortunate to have been involved in Child Protection Week in Townsville. This week will mark several events highlighting the awareness of child abuse in my electorate and ways of preventing it from happening. There will be several workshops on effective discipline, forums on prevention, the inaugural network meeting, and family day this Saturday. I would encourage all of the constituents in Townsville and Thuringowa to take part in those very good programs.
However, the coalition government recognises that the community cannot heighten awareness alone, nor can it make considerable policy change on this matter. The government has recently increased financial assistance to families with children through the family tax benefit introduced on 1 July. Over two million Australian families with children will benefit from this initiative. This represents assistance of over $2 billion each year provided to over 90 per cent of all Australian families with dependent children. I think everyone on all sides of the House and on all sides of the political spectrum would agree that any level of child abuse is unacceptable. I certainly do. I am pleased to support the member's motion today and to see the uniform agreement that we have across the chamber.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—It is just possible that something important and special is happening here today in relation to the problem of child abuse. I am honoured to speak to the motion put forward by the member for Fowler and seconded by the member for Braddon. I commend the member for Bradfield, a doctor of medicine, who has spoken from the heart and eloquently about the tragedy of child abuse in this country. Evidence suggests that the incidence of child abuse is on the rise. Each year 100,000 notifications of child abuse occur in this country. More than 25,000 of those are substantiated. This call to break the silence of abuse is a reflection of the fact that there must be more cases of child abuse than those notified. That is why I agree with the national call to break the silence on child abuse. That call has been made by the People's Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse and I also support the work of NAPCAN, the Kids First Foundation, the Abused Child Trust, the Purple Ribbon Committee and other organisations dedicated to dealing with this problem.
 Abused children suffer in silence. They are defenceless and in many cases wonder, as a result of the abuse, whether they are at fault. Professor Kim Oates, the CEO of the New Children's Hospital in Sydney, reporting on his research, said:
... almost half of sexually abused children are sad or depressed, have low self-esteem and a higher level of anxiety five years after the incident.
I find the plight of abused children sad and depressing. They are our precious children and as parents we have a heavy responsibility to create for our children a nurturing environment and a world of hope and delight. We know already that the victims of abuse are far more likely to become abusive parents. Therefore, it is imperative to break the cycle of abuse. But that needs government resources. Traditionally, governments, advised by treasuries and finance departments, have found it very easy to support hard-hat projects, often based on bodgie calculations and benefit cost analysis. It is a very male thing to do because you get to open big projects and it looks terrific on TV, but traditionally the departments of community services have been underfunded and, until recently, prevention programs have been virtually non-existent. 
I think there is new hope for positive changes in this area. For example, in my state of Queensland, the Minister for Families, Youth and Community Care, Anna Bligh, and the Minister for Health, Wendy Edmond, are committed to providing support for abused children and struggling families. Anna Bligh fought very hard for extra funding in response to the Forde inquiry and she won that extra funding. Wendy Edmond has presided over a very successful start to positive parenting programs. Within those portfolios as well there is an important home visiting program. I take the opportunity to commend Peter Beattie for his support and also, ironically, Queensland Treasury, because they are now recognising in Queensland that it is not just the hard benefit cost analysis which is needed to justify these programs. They know that there are big gains to be had from investment in prevention. As a result, Queensland is putting money into this.
I want to talk about three projects: the Elmira Pre-natal and Early Infancy Project, a home visiting program in the United States which seems to work quite well, the Birth to Three program in Oregon and Hawaii's Healthy Start program. The US General Accounting Office has done an analysis to support the benefits of such early intervention. Labor supports early intervention and, within a spirit of bipartisanship, we believe there is a growing need for a comprehensive, national, early assistance strategy aimed at strengthening parenting skills and early childhood development to support the fundamentals of family life, whatever pressures there are from the outside world. As part of this strategy, we believe there is a need to establish a comprehensive network of early childhood and parenting services. It is tremendous to be associated with this motion. I think everyone has spoken in a spirit of bipartisanship. As I said at the beginning, it gives me some hope that we may be able to achieve something by raising awareness of the problem of child abuse in this country and the value of early intervention and prevention programs.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—This afternoon, I desire to speak on the government's neglect of the needs and aspirations of many Australians. The problem is that, while ordinary Australians are striving to move forward in their own lives, they are not getting the support of the national government. Too many people in too many places are missing out on the benefits of change. Too many Australians are finding it hard to embrace change because they do not feel that their national government cares about who wins and who loses. The truth is that Australians, particularly those who are missing out, do not feel secure. In public debate there has been a tendency to see the insecurity and a fear of change as the same thing. Insecurity is not the fear of change but the fear of being helpless in the face of change. It is the inability to cope with change. Unfortunately, as the Howard government has slashed funding for education and regional development, many people in more places have felt unable to cope with change. If you do not have the skills and capacity to adapt, then change hurts. That is the truth of the matter. That is why people are feeling insecure.
The story is worse than the Howard government's neglect of education and regional development. When people are insecure about their future, it fosters more than a simple rejection of change. It feeds the urge to find scapegoats. If you want to find a few popular scapegoats since Pauline Hanson left this place, I suggest you need to go only to the media statements of the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr John Anderson—that is right, the man who is our Acting Prime Minister. If we believe that the scourge of One Nation is gone, then we had better think again. Just listen to the rhetoric of the Acting Prime Minister. Every week, he is out there telling people in regional Australia that the pains associated with change are due to the decline of family values, too much immigration or too much welfare for our Aboriginal community. He is out there peddling like a dog whistle the soft Hanson line. 
The Acting Prime Minister fails to understand that Hansonism did not rise on the back of ordinary Australians being racist or being innately conservative; it arose out of the feeling that people's voices were not being heard. When you get out there and talk to people in regional Australia and the outer suburbs of our cities, you realise that this problem is just as relevant today as it was a few years ago. People simply do not believe that the Howard government is on their side. The Acting Prime Minister fails to understand that it is fundamental to engage with the people and the places that are missing out. While he is out there spouting the rhetoric about family values, about immigration and about Aboriginals, the real work is not being done. The hard work of listening to and working with people and communities is not being done. If the Acting Prime Minister were listening, he would know that people will not forgive massive cuts to education, to employment programs, to support for child care and for families, inflicted by the government on our struggling communities within the suburbs of metropolitan Australia and in regional, remote and rural Australia. People will not forgive the government for the proceeds of these cuts in services being handed back to the wealthy as tax cuts.
Australians do not want leaders who are not prepared to lead, and they do not want leaders whose leadership is based on populist rhetoric rather than on engagement with ordinary people. If leaders fail to articulate a vision that is more inclusive and closer to the concerns of ordinary people, we cannot claim to be surprised at the outcomes. When leaders fail to lead, populism and traditional scapegoats—fear, habit and rhetoric—will provide a ready substitute. Populist moralising will not improve the lives of ordinary Australians. If there is one thing Australia needs at the moment, it is genuine leadership. If there is one thing that we are missing as a community at the moment, it is genuine leadership. Instead, we have a government that not only lacks courage and commitment but is out there fuelling the fires of division. Meanwhile, if people lose their job today, they do not know whether the government will help them find one tomorrow. If their local mill closes today, communities do not know whether the government will help to attract new industry opportunities tomorrow—unless it is in a marginal seat that worries the government's electoral prospects at the next election. Leadership requires a commitment to the people and the places missing out. Leadership requires that we invest in the people missing out, but the Howard government is the only government of any developed nation that has chosen to go backwards on education, training and research. Leadership requires that we invest in the regions missing out, but the Howard government, in contrast with the rest of the world, does not believe in investing in regional development. The Acting Prime Minister should be worried more about that than about the so-call regional backlash. The real backlash is against politicians such as the Acting Prime Minister, who peddle false hopes in their rhetoric but abandon people in their policy. It is a backlash against politicians who say one thing in Canberra and another in the community. People want to see political parties articulate a broader vision for society rather than use traditional scapegoats. The truth is that we have a rupture between the Howard government and ordinary Australians. We have lost a sense of community. 
A good society does not want handouts; it does not want manna from heaven. A good society is built and sustained through the efforts of its citizens and promoted by the leadership of government. Our citizens are willing to do the hard work. They are prepared to put in the effort and the hard yards, but they want to know that the national government is on their side—that it is actually barracking for them. Everywhere I go, people are telling me that they do not believe that the Howard government is barracking for them—more importantly, they believe it is barracking only for some friends at the top end of town. They say that actions speak louder than words—that actions really do tell a story. The truth is that the Howard government funds the elite private schools to the detriment of struggling communities. This government refuses to put one additional dollar into the regional TAFE network, and it refuses to act on the fact that a number of regional university campuses are at risk. People are worried about the consequences of the Howard government's leave-it-to-the market mentality and what it means for workers, families and communities, particularly in regional Australia. You would think that the Howard government would have got the message loud and clear by now, and that the Prime Minister himself would stand up for regional Australia in the same forceful manner that he stands up for the Packers.
You would think that the national government would have got the message loud and clear by now. Judging by the recent rhetoric of the Acting Prime Minister and by his inability to get anything through the citycentric cabinet, it is clear that the National Party has not learned at all. People no longer trust the Howard government to do what is right. Importantly, country people no longer trust the national government to do what is right. They know in their hearts that the National Party is a rump that is continually rolled in the cabinet room, that the Deputy Prime Minister has no clout and that in essence the National Party is just an organisation that is used for the electoral prospects of the Liberal Party in Canberra—when it suits them.
People are not prepared to accept the argument that government is irrelevant. People want a government that works with them to revitalise community confidence—to rebuild a sense of community in Australia. People want to believe that the national government is on their side—that it is a government that is prepared to barrack for and do something for regional Australia. They are sick of the government being more concerned about the prospects of a member who lives in the seat such as that represented by the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, on the North Shore of Sydney, than those of someone who lives in a seat such as Indi in the northern area of Victoria.
People clearly want the national government to be on their side. We need to have empathy and understanding. We need to work with people to give them the support and the resources they need to have the confidence to give it a go. I suppose the great tragedy of the Acting Prime Minister's agenda is that it is gutting our people of their ambitions. He is not leading in his own portfolio, let alone as Leader of the National Party. He is, in essence, a person who is unable to come to terms with his own portfolio responsibilities—a person who is unable to make a recommendation to his cabinet because of his fear of being rolled yet again. Be it on the Speedrail, on the airport needs of Sydney, on the orbital road in Sydney, on the ordinary needs of regional Australia or on education and health, the Deputy Prime Minister has gone missing because he is sick of being rolled by the citycentric Prime Minister and the Treasurer. There are not many sadder sights than when people lose hope, especially in rural, remote and regional Australia and in the outer suburbs of our cities. The trouble is that, for more than 10 months after the Regional Australia Summit—a summit that cost Australian taxpayers quite a substantial amount of money—the government has failed to do something with respect to these responsibilities. The issue, therefore, is that the government has done nothing to improve the lives of ordinary Australians. The time has come for us to get a government into Canberra that is prepared to barrack for the people doing it tough in rural, regional and remote Australia and in the suburbs of some of the metropolitan areas. It is time for a government that is prepared to make decisions, not just for the elite but for all Australians.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 provides Commonwealth government funding for every school in every state and territory, public and private, from 2001 to 2004. Raising the standard of education is the greatest challenge our country faces. Improving educational opportunities for every student at every school must be our goal. As members of parliament, we meet many school students through presenting flags at school assemblies, at the Anzac Day services in April and at the presentation days and graduation balls at the end of the year. Local members also face tough interrogation when primary school students visit Parliament House here in Canberra or when we are invited to speak to civics classes. On a typical day there are three million students attending school somewhere in Australia. While many students do not have the opportunity to travel to Canberra because of the distance or the cost, on a typical day there are 380 students visiting Canberra on official excursions. On most sitting days at question time, if you look up, there are dozens of students looking down from the public galleries.
We could debate here tonight how important this bill is to the three million students at all Australian schools. Or we could debate the hundreds of students who will visit parliament today and how they will be affected by this bill. Or we could focus on its impact on the students who will be in Parliament House at question time tomorrow. Instead, today I want to focus on what this debate and what this bill can mean to just one of those children. For that young Australian, the whole debate about the future of education can be summed up in one question. It is a question we were all asked many times when we were young, and it is still probably the most common question that adults ask children: what do you want to be when you grow up? That question is so frequently asked that we may not think about the hidden assumptions, the hidden questions that lie behind it. What can you do? What can you expect to do?
Our focus on education and training is about lifting expectations so that every child not just believes but knows that they have a chance to go on to obtain a decent, satisfying, secure job. The next time you look up at one of those students in the gallery—or the next time you ask a child what they want to be when they grow up—if Australia is doing the right thing in education, if you look hard enough you will perhaps see a policeman, an electrician, a nurse, a farmer, a scientist, a builder, a tour-bus driver, a designer, an actor, a doctor, a plumber, a lawyer, a hairdresser, an engineer, a computer programmer, a small business operator, a biologist or a teacher. If Australia's education and training is outstanding, that child will have all of those choices. That child will reach his or her full potential. 
Raising the standard of education and training in Australia does not just open up new career choices for young people who are at risk of dropping out or disconnecting from our society and it does not just open up better career choices for students; it also opens up new possibilities for our country. Every unemployed person, every untrained worker, every underemployed researcher is not just a personal tragedy; it is a lost opportunity for all of us. It is a lost opportunity for the whole nation.
This bill proposes to set the funding available from the federal government for schools. Funding is important if you want to improve schools—and I will say more about that later. But improving education is about more than money. That is why, as Labor's shadow education minister, I set out earlier this year to signal that the Labor Party believes that one of the most important questions that we have to face up to is: how can we improve the quality of teaching in the classroom?
There is an enormous amount of research, particularly from the United States by Professor Linda Darling-Hammond, indicating that the American states which have invested the most in improving the quality of teaching in the classroom have shown the greatest improvement in performance in literacy and numeracy. In the United States, it is the states which have invested the most in training their teachers which have shown the biggest improvement in the performance of students.
Let me say a few things about teachers. After our family, teachers have the greatest influence on our learning. Students even spend twice as much time with their teachers as they do watching television—which perhaps is hard to believe. I am sure everyone in this chamber tonight can remember at least one outstanding teacher from their school days. For me it was our science teacher. Phosphorus was set alight, cubes of sodium danced on water, chlorophyll separated into its components on blotting paper and esters were made from pineapple juice—Queensland pineapple juice, I am sure.
—I made copper sulphate crystals.
—And others made copper sulphate crystals, as the member indicates. Unfortunately, most of us were too young to remember the early primary school teachers who helped us learn numbers, letters and words, or the teacher who provided remedial help when our reading slipped behind the rest of the class. So many teachers are still changing people's lives every day in every school. The best teachers know that, no matter how well they teach today, they are going to have to do even better in the future. The future of young Australians depends in large measure on how well teachers and their families prepare them for the rapidly changing society in which we live. We are demanding more and more from our teachers, our schools and our students. Young people do not need just a thorough grounding in the basic skills to read, write and add up. They need to be competent in using a computer and the Internet. They need inquiring minds, a thirst for knowledge and skills for the workplace. They need to be equipped to deal with changing social problems and, most importantly, they will need to be able to undertake a lifetime of learning as the nature of work and training changes. Very few of the current generation of young students will have the same job throughout their working lives. They will need to have the skills to train and retrain for the new career opportunities that will emerge. 
Labor has tried to emphasise that at the moment in Australia we are not spending enough on the professional development of our teachers. We seem to think it is quite normal for motor mechanics working at the local car dealership to regularly undergo refresher training to ensure that their skills stay up to date. Why should we think that teachers do not need as much investment in their professional development as motor mechanics at car dealerships? There are real concerns. There is some evidence that in one state 25 per cent of teachers teaching maths and science are not qualified to teach maths and science. How can we hope to imbue in young students a love of maths and science if they are not being taught by teachers who have the basic foundations, through their own teacher education, to provide the standard of education those students need? It is not just unfair to the PE teacher who is asked to teach maths or science in a country school; it is more unfair to the students who are in that PE teacher's class. Because of those concerns, Labor has outlined its plan to provide greater federal government funding for professional development. We have proposed a series of professional development partnerships with teachers. Labor has proposed to offer to fund the cost of professional development for teachers, especially in areas of high need. We will also offer to provide a $2,000 completion bonus to teachers who will undertake training and professional development in their own time. We particularly want to target the teachers who are teaching outside their area of specialty. We want to ensure that more teachers have better understanding of how to incorporate IT in classroom teaching. We also want to encourage those teachers who can then communicate new ideas and better teaching practice to their colleagues at their own school and at neighbouring schools.
Another way to improve the quality of teaching in the classroom is Labor's plan to offer a new system of teacher scholarships. Labor's plan is all about encouraging more of our best high school graduates to consider a career in teaching. Because of the changes this government has made through the introduction of differential HECS, we are now asking students who undertake a specialty degree to repay more in HECS than people who undertake an undergraduate degree to education. The typical teacher graduate repays about $1,500  a year of HECS for the first 10 years after they graduate. Labor's plan is to forgive that $1,500 a year HECS debt for each year that they stay in teaching. If they teach for 10 years, it will mean that Labor's teacher scholarship will forgive all of their HECS debt—they will pay no HECS. If they teach for five years and then shoot through, it will mean that they will have their HECS debt forgiven for five years and then they will have to meet their HECS obligation. Our teacher scholarships are a plan to encourage more of our best students to consider a vocation in teaching.
Recently, at Labor's national conference in Hobart, our leader outlined a number of other issues—our proposals for education priority zones, our proposals to abolish the enrolment benchmark adjustment and a plan to introduce a site on the Internet called the `Learning Gateway'. If someone asks me what the educational priority zones are all about, it brings us back to that question which I said is at the heart of the debate about the need to invest more in education and training. It is that question which we put to young people: what do you want to be when you grow up? In many cases in many poor parts of our country, there is a gap between the two hidden questions. The first hidden question is: what do you have the ability to be? The second hidden question is: what do you expect to be? Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, in electorates like yours, I am sure you meet children every day who have the ability to do any of the careers that I outlined earlier—to be a researcher, to be a biologist, to be a doctor, to be a lawyer, to have a career in tourism, to have a secure and challenging job throughout life. In many cases, the expectations of teachers and parents are low. In many cases, that means that the expectations of the students are too low. What the education priority zones are all about is raising those expectations, making sure that they do have ambitious goals about what they can expect to be in their working life. 
There are some problems in our schools and there are problems with some of our teachers. Some students and their families have all sorts of problems. In a few states, and at the federal level, some governments themselves have been the cause of problems in schools, but there is enormous evidence that underperforming students and schools are often located in low socioeconomic areas. The causes are many and complex. Some would argue that the gap between these areas and our best schools is growing as the demands on schools and teachers increase, as social pressures on families increase and as the information revolution gives an advantage to those homes and schools which can afford the latest computers. The fact is that, when educational and social disadvantage overlap, the expectations—and the teachers—are often too low.
What is worse is that, for the students, the gap between what they can be and what they expect to be is enormous. We need to raise these expectations. We need to break the cycle of poverty and underperformance in education. Labor's plan is to create several dozen of these education priority zones across the country. The education priority zones are about breaking that cycle of poverty and underperformance in education. Under this plan, the federal government will no longer be just a remote funder of schools. It is not good enough for the federal government to sign a cheque, post it off and think that is all it has to do. We have greater obligations in this parliament. Under the education priority zones, the federal government will be an active partner with local communities, seeking to harness the talent and enthusiasm of people at the local level to help turn around the performance of their schools. We will seek to encourage the involvement of local businesses. We also want to harness the enthusiasm of local councils in regions involved with education priority zones because we believe they have something to offer.
The aim behind the education priority zones is to raise literacy levels in the schools in the zone. We want to lift the year 12 completion rates and encourage more of the local students to go to TAFE or to university. We also want to ensure that the locals feel that they have some ownership of the plan that will be developed to improve education in their local zone. We think that, if the locals develop the plan and if the locals monitor the operation of the plan, they are more likely to harness the involvement of local business houses, to have an active local council and to be a successful program.
In some zones, they may decide that the best way to spend the extra federal money that will be allocated for a guaranteed period of four years is to spend it on employing extra remedial literacy teachers in their schools. They might decide in other zones that the best way is to focus on funding refresher training for teachers—investing more in the professional development of the teachers. In some zones they might also wish to allocate some of their education priority zone money for a mentor program. A local government school in my electorate has had a very successful mentor program operating with the support of the Dusseldorp Skills Forum. It is through the introduction of targeted plans, designed by the locals to help the locals solve their own education problems, that I think we have the best chance of turning around the performance. That was the first initiative announced at the federal conference—the introduction of education priority zones.
Secondly, we are committed to abolishing the unfair and unjust enrolment benchmark adjustment—the EBA—which has already taken $60 million away from public schools across the country, despite the fact that there are 26,000 more students in government schools. It is an unfair one-way adjustment. In Tasmania, where a greater percentage of students are attending government schools, they get no increase in their funding—the EBA acts in only one direction. Under Dr Kemp's ideologically pure EBA, he has already taken $60 million away from government schools across the country. 
The third initiative that was announced at the national conference was our commitment to establish the learning gateway. The learning gateway is all about giving students better access to high quality Australian-made online content. It is all about ensuring that, if Australian students are doing a project on history, they are able to access an Australian developed, Australian-made history of Australia, not the Microsoft history of Australia. We believe the federal government has a role in helping to commission the best possible online content for Australian students. Whether it be in history, mathematics, the environment or biology, Australian students should have access to the best possible material. For parents, it means they will have access to sample tests or information on how their child is progressing through the learning gateway. It can give teachers and parents information on the curriculum and on course development aids. For students and parents, it will give them access to teachers online after normal school hours.
I will turn now to the government's plans for funding schools in the next four years, as outlined in this legislation. I really wish I could say that this legislation meets the needs of students of Australian schools and that, as a result, it had the full support of both sides of the Australian parliament. Nothing would make me happier than to say that this legislation proposes generous increases in funding for the schools, both government and private, that need it. I regret to inform the House that Labor have serious concerns about the inadequate funding contained in this bill for government schools. We remain opposed to the unfair enrolment benchmark adjustment of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, and we are concerned about the inadequate information that has been provided by the government on how funding will be distributed to non-government schools. From the information we have obtained to date, we have grave concerns about the unfair allocation of funding to private schools contained in this bill.
Let me make a few points about Labor's attitude to school funding. Firstly, Labor support increased funding for needy non-government schools. Secondly, with the government having significantly increased funding for private schools, Labor support a matching significant increase in funding for government schools. Thirdly, Labor recognise that this bill must be approved by the parliament before the end of the year. The reason we recognise that is that this bill contains funding for every school—public and private—throughout the country, commencing on 1 January 2001. I formally move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	notes that the preliminary data available suggest that the proposed distribution of funding among non-government schools is profoundly unfair;
(2)	is of the opinion that, before the bill is debated, the Government must provide detailed, final figures on the cost of the policy changes contained in the bill and the new funding figures for each non-government school; and
(3)	condemns the Government for:
	(a)	failing to provide a matching increase in funding for government schools; and
	(b)	continuing its unfair Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment policy”.
While it will not happen during my contribution to the debate, I also foreshadow that, at the earliest opportunity in this debate, the opposition will be seeking to adjourn the debate. My understanding is that this will take place after the member for Moreton has spoken and before the next opposition speaker gets to their feet. The reason we will be seeking to adjourn the debate is that the government to date has still not provided us with the information we need to determine whether this is a fair new system to fund non-government schools. 
The minister's office is quoted as saying that `the government wanted the bill passed even if the figures were not available'—that is, the figures that indicate how much extra funding is going to the various non-government schools. It is an insult to this parliament to ask us to pass any bill without any accurate figures on its effect. It is an insult to this parliament to expect us to debate a $22 billion school funding bill without first knowing what the consequences will be for schools across the country. It is also quite feasible for us to seek to adjourn the debate in this House and the Senate when the minister's office and the department have confirmed that all of the necessary data is expected to be available by the time the parliament resumes after the Olympics. We should also remember that this minister announced the new funding package in the 1999 budget in May and then proceeded to act with such urgency that he sat on his hands for 416 days before the legislation was introduced into the House. So, if there is any shortage of time, it is because the minister has been incompetent in the way he has managed the drafting and introduction of this legislation. So, as I say, we will move an adjournment at an appropriate time.
I wish to talk a little about Labor's position on funding for non-government schools. The whole state aid debate divided the Labor Party greatly in the 1960s, and some would argue that it cost the Labor Party government in at least one state. I should point out that it was Kim Beazley Sr, the father of the current Leader of the Opposition, who together with the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, lanced the boil of the state aid debate—and not just within our party but for the public policy debate at that time in Australia. It was Whitlam and Beazley Sr who brought in the policy that funding for non-government schools would be allocated on a needs basis. The Hawke and Keating governments and people like former education minister Susan Ryan ensured that there were reasonable increases, significant increases, in funding for indigenous education, in particular, in non-government schools. It has been publicly recognised that Tom Stephens, the Labor leader in the Western Australian parliament, also played an important role in ensuring that indigenous students at non-government schools in the Kimberley got a fair deal.
But the significant difference between those Labor governments and the Howard government is that those Labor governments also significantly increased funding for public education. Some people might say that there was not as great an increase as they would have liked, but no-one can deny that Labor tried to get the balance right in funding for government and non-government schools—something that is absent in this legislation we are debating today. When the new socioeconomic status funding system was proposed by Dr Kemp, Labor made it clear that we would support the new SES model if the government could prove it was fairer.
One of the problems we have with the legislation is that, when it was announced in the 1999 budget, we were told that there would be an additional cost of $561 million over the period of the forward estimates. We were told that it would include $50 million over four years in additional funding for the Catholic school system. In the last few weeks, my office has been given a document by the government claiming that the funding for the Catholic school system is now to increase to $100 million a year—a lot more than we were told was the case with the $561 million mentioned in the budget papers in 1999. Yet, a few days ago, the government was still giving the Senate a figure claiming that the additional funding for all non-government schools was still the $561 million. So we are expected to debate a bill without knowing how much extra money is flowing to non-government schools. That is just a ridiculous position to be in. 
The first question is: `How does this new funding system work?' The minister's second reading speeches gave us some indication as to how it will work. The question is whether this new system is fairer. It uses a combination of parental income, parental educational attainment and parental occupation based on the addresses of the students who attend a particular school. Under this new formula, if a school is better off under the new funding mechanism they get the extra funding. If a school is going to be worse off, they will have their funding maintained. The Catholic school system has its funding set at 96 under the new SES index, except for the ACT. These changes are to be phased in over four years and everyone is to have their funding indexed by the AGSRC school cost index.
We are entitled to ask who are the winners under this new funding system. Certainly the low fee Christian schools and low fee independent schools are winners. That is no surprise given that, certainly in my own electorate, many of the parents who send their children to the low fee Christian schools come from low and middle income families. It is appropriate that the parliament recognise that they should be entitled to a funding increase. They are needy schools and they are entitled to a funding increase, certainly under Labor's needs policy approach. But the biggest winners, according to the small titbits of information we have been able to extract from the government, are the category 1 schools. Of the 62 schools that are currently funded at category 1 under the old funding measure, 46 participated in the 1998 modelling exercise. Out of those 46 schools, 45 will receive an increase. I will not go through all the figures but this equates to an average increase for the category 1 schools of more than $820,000 a year by the year 2004, when this system will be fully phased in. That is an extra $50 million a year going to the 62 wealthiest category 1 schools. When we put this figure to the officials from Dr Kemp's own department they described it as `probably a good estimate'. The minister tries to muddy the water by redefining what a wealthy school is and he calls the opposition liars. But he cannot deny that his own department has confirmed these figures. He refuses to respond to the direct question of what is the average increase for the 62 category 1 schools. Some category 1 schools will get less than the $820,000 a year increase, but for every one below the average there will be one above it. We know who the liar is. Only Dr Kemp, only the minister for education would believe—
—I think you had better rethink your wording.
—Take a point of order if you want.
 (Hon. J.A. Crosio)—Through the chair, please.
—`We know who the liar is.' If anyone thinks that is unparliamentary, that is a new development.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to take a point of order on the unparliamentary language used by the member for Dobell.
—I have to rule on the point of order. The member for Moreton has expressed it. For the parliamentary secretary at the table, if you wish to express a point, you express it through the chair. The member for Moreton has asked the member for Dobell to withdraw, and I think the member for Dobell should withdraw.
—What do you want me to withdraw? That I know who the liar is?
—No, the fact that Dr Kemp was the liar, and I ask you to withdrew that.
—I never said that Dr Kemp was the liar. If that is your conclusion, I will withdraw the implication. 
—The implication has been withdrawn.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, on a further point of order, I think the member for Dobell is attempting to mislead the House—and certainly to misrepresent me—because the Hansard record will clearly show what he said. It is not my interpretation, it is the English language, which he obviously does not have a very good command of.
—The member for Moreton has raised a point of order, the member for Dobell has withdrawn the remark that was offensive to the member for Moreton, and now I will call the member for Dobell back into the debate. It has been withdrawn, and I acknowledge the point of order that was expressed by the member for Moreton.
—We know who the liar is. Only Dr Kemp would think that the best way to spend $50 million a year in education is to put it into the 62 wealthiest schools—the category 1 schools. We know that $50 million a year on education would go a long way to assisting government schools. They would have much greater needs than those category 1 schools. This is the way Dr Kemp is allocating funding in schools: an average increase of $820,000 a year for the 62 category 1 schools; an average $60,000 for the 1,600 Catholic schools across the country; and an average increase of only $4,000 a year, after cost indexation, for the 7,000 government schools across the country. Only Dr Kemp would think that the greatest need is in those category 1 schools.
The government have made a number of claims about the new funding system. They claim that it is simple, transparent and fair. It is so simple and so transparent that the government refuse to give us the figures before we have to vote on it. They claim that it is so fair that even Dr Kemp has been forced to admit that, if a millionaire lives in a low-income community, they are treated like a low-income earner. How can that be fair? The minister claims that the National Catholic Education Commission support his new funding system. They support it so strongly that in the Senate committee they argued not for a pure SES model but for a model that combined socioeconomic status and the resources available to a school. The National Catholic Education Commission support this so strongly, they want it to apply to everyone but themselves. That is how much they support the new funding system.
The government also claimed that the new funding system is equitable and fair. We make the point that only the minister for education would argue that a fair education system would allocate the biggest increases to the wealthiest schools. We know that this minister has been on a 10-year crusade to try to switch as many students as possible from public schools to private schools. We know, from the document we produced in the parliament last week, that this minister has been on a 10-year crusade to try to cut funding for government schools, and he does that through that unfair and unjust enrolment benchmark adjustment—an EBA which many of the people involved with the non-government sector have argued to the government should be repealed—and an EBA that has already taken $60 million from government schools across the country at the same time as Dr Kemp is trying to shovel a $50 million a year increase into the category 1 wealthy schools. For these reasons, Labor will press this second reading amendment. 
—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.
—We have just heard from the member for Dobell a speech written and authorised by the teachers' union, the Australian Education Union. In the short time I have before we go to our usual break in proceedings, I want to outline exactly what he is saying. I will cut right through the code.  
One of the things he talked about was a new bureaucracy—a new form of government control and intervention in the planning of education needs. Everybody knows that it is the state governments that plan education in its application in the public sector. In fact, the state governments are responsible for 85 per cent of the funding of government schools, and the Commonwealth contributes the remaining 15 per cent. But here we have the member for Dobell saying that the Commonwealth should have the lion's share of the say in the planning and execution of the funding that may go to the public sector from the Commonwealth. 
I am frightened to think about just how many people will be employed with this amount of money. Out of the current allocation of $22 billion going to the school sector, which is what the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 is all about—government and non-government—just how much of it will be soaked up with more bureaucracy: jobs for those who wrote the speech, jobs for those from the education unions in Australia. If that is the Labor Party's idea of fairness, I suspect they are keeping their record over 13 years of government intact. It is certainly a statement of fact that, after 13 years, the Australian Labor Party produced such equity for so many young people that 30 per cent of them could not read and write properly. This government have had to set about spending real money to get real results and cooperation with the states—and in some cases it was forced cooperation—and the results are now showing real improvements in the areas of literacy and numeracy.
We are the party that have delivered on fairness and social justice, through school funding, for both government and non-government school parents. We are also the party which have managed to ensure that those who want to exercise choice—those who want to, if you like, subsidise those who choose not to—in the cost of educating their children can do so, with government assistance. Every government school student is funded by at least 90 per cent, when you take into account state and federal contributions from the taxpayer; whereas in non-government schools parents provide about 45 per cent of the total cost of education. So parents in non-government schools—and I am not talking about socioeconomic groups, I am just talking about parents, regardless of their income—actually do help meet the cost of the total education bill in this country. And parents in those small, poor parish schools in my electorate, who have exercised their choice to provide their school-age children with the opportunities that they believe are important for them, should be rewarded, not retarded, in their efforts. 
Over the past 4½ years this government have certainly set about providing a responsible level of funding to address so many of the things that the Australian Labor Party failed to do over their 13 years in government. We have ensured that there is a range of services and not simply recurrent funding but also capital works funding to assist parents in their quest to ensure that there is fairness and equity, which evaded them over the 13 years that the Australian Labor Party were in government. 
The contribution from the member for Dobell, written and authorised by the Australian Education Union, was short on facts and long on rhetoric, and it relied on a rewriting of the truth of the matter. I suspect that there is nobody in the non-government school sector who is supporting the Australian Labor Party. They are alone and without friends on this issue.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—The coalition have had a strong and consistent position as far as choice and equity, as well as improved outcomes in the education sector, go. Over the past 4½ years we have really established a strong record in this regard. One matter that needs always to be talked about when we talk about grants to primary and secondary schools is the work that is being done on literacy and numeracy. Not one study was funded by the Australian Labor Party in their 13 years in government and yet they presided over a decline in the basic standards that Australian children need to learn. Not one study was financed in that time, and the Australian Labor Party should hang their heads in shame for their record with regard to literacy and numeracy standards—matters which have been addressed and will continue to be addressed by this government. During the time we have been in power, there have already been some remarkable improvements in this regard. 
Funding is not what it is all about, as all would agree; it is these outcomes which the government is aiming to get from the funding. But let us talk about the funding: over the next four years we will see a 32 per cent increase in the total school funding. This is real money where it works. It is not just funding one sector; it is funding the various sectors involved in education in this country. This year the Howard government is spending $402 million more on government schools than Labor did in its last year in office—an increase of 26 per cent. Public spending is $5,600 on average for a government school student, but for a non-government school student it is only $3,750 on average. At wealthier schools this figure can be as low as $1,500 per student. We have also increased funding by some $400 million over the past four years—an increase of 26 per cent at a time when the number of pupils in those schools had increased by 2.3 per cent. Our funding system has led to a massive increase in funding per pupil in government schools. 
But of course the Australian Labor Party would have people in my electorate believe it is quite the opposite of what is really happening. It is an absolute disgrace for the Australian Labor Party to try to create some sort of class warfare, although I often regard it as classless warfare because the style in which it is executed suggests that that is the case—that there should be some funding priority that is somehow or other aimed towards helping those in wealthier schools versus those who are in not so wealthy schools. They say state schools—and I am one of their products—are in fact underfunded by this government in comparison with private schools. It is this sort of divisionist nonsense that typifies the 13 years Labor were last in power but it is certainly not the approach of this government as we live and breath and practise the `for all of us' mantra of the past 4½ years. The Labor Party are running around saying we are going to cut $60 million out of government school funding when funding has increased by $400 million. That is the sort of credibility gap we saw in the deficit. Prior to the 1996 election we were told by the then finance minister, now the opposition leader, Mr Beazley, that it was in fact a surplus. There is a $460 million difference between what Labor says and what the government has actually done, and they are out there day in, day out attempting to mislead people.
Parents from the poor parish schools within the Catholic systemic system—they are not the only non-government schools of course but they do often typify those schools which are the most needy in our community—make a definite decision to fund the choice that they make for their children's education, which is a choice that we on this side support not only in a rhetorical way but also in the funding with which we have backed them up. People within the parish system within my own electorate of Moreton have said to me that they have never had it so good as they have had it under this government. This government has delivered upon those who have pioneered the Catholic systemic system over so many years and have made the efforts and many sacrifices in other spending possibilities within a family to ensure that their children are in fact able to get a good Catholic education.
I make that observation not as a member of that particular faith but as somebody who is a member of a government which believes strongly in the equity that it has provided. I am delighted by the observations of Father Tom Doyle of the Victorian Catholic Education Office and Deputy Chair of the National Catholic Education Commission. He said that the government's package: 
Is a very good and equitable package ... The new system is fair, open to scrutiny, yet doesn't drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise everyone's right to choice.
Isn't that an accurate and true description of what this government is all about: freedom to choose and the wherewithal to make sure that that choice does deliver outcomes. It certainly is the first time in a very long time that fair funding formula has been introduced into the non-government school funding sector. I am proud to be part of a government that has focused on backing up those parents and schools in my own electorate that have been doing the hard yards for many years. 
With regard to schools in my electorate, it is worth noting that the variation in funding that this government has presided over in a total general recurrent grants sense has risen from $10.34 million in the 1997 financial year to $13½ million in this current year. In round figures—I notice the member for Blair is here, and he is normally a walking calculator—that is somewhere in the vicinity of about 28 per cent or 30 per cent increase in the Commonwealth general recurrent funding to non-government schools in the federal electorate of Moreton. 
Over the past four years, the Commonwealth government have contributed to the various parish schools in the electorate of Moreton some $48.76 million. Christ the King School at Graceville has received over that time $1.46 million; Clairvaux-Mackillop College at Upper Mount Gravatt, a superb college that turns out many fine Australians, has received $11.74 million in recurrent funding; Mary Immaculate Primary School at Annerley, $1.49 million; Our Lady of Lourdes School at Sunnybank, $4.98 million; Our Lady's College at Annerley, $4.62 million; Southside Christian College at Salisbury, $2.22 million; St Agnes' School at Mount Gravatt, $2.7 million; St Bernard's School at Upper Mount Gravatt, $3.8 million; St Brendan's Primary School at Moorooka, the school that managed to get those ceiling fans, which Labor never delivered for them in 13 years, within the first 18 months of my election as the member for Moreton, $1.3 million; Saint Catherine's School at Wishart, $2.19 million; St Elizabeth's School at Ekibin, $2.14 million; St Joachim's School at Holland Park, $1 million; St Pius X School at Salisbury, $1.88 million; St Sebastian's Primary School at Yeronga, $1.57 million; and St Thomas More College at Sunnybank, a bit over $5 million.
They are important amounts of money to the parents in particular at those schools, because, if those opposite knew my electorate as well as they would pretend they might, they would know that the parents in those particular areas come from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds, and not one of those schools could be labelled a wealthy school. But we have an opposition in this place that pretends it would like to be the government of Australia and I guess will spend a lot of time running around telling people in the electorate of Moreton all sorts of exciting and colourful things about what they may or may not do if ever, heaven forbid, they were elected back onto the government benches in this place. I think it is important for them to realise that in the electorate of Moreton this government has delivered for parents across all socioeconomic backgrounds and that there is no such thing as a rich school, a wealthy school. But the Australian Labor Party opposition in this place do stand for one thing as far as education funding is concerned—the parents at those schools in my electorate face a real risk of losing so much of that support. This is the sort of support they did not have there when the Labor Party were in power. They had some support, but a lot of it was begrudgingly given, a lot of it was confused, a lot of it was under certain guidelines that never quite delivered the results that this government have delivered. I would say to the parents, particularly at those parish schools, the Catholic systemic schools in my electorate, `Look out. The Australian Labor Party want that recurrent funding to send somewhere else.' 
—Absolute rubbish.
—The member for Dobell, the shadow minister, the man who would be the education minister if, heaven forbid, a Beazley government were elected in this place, says, `Absolutely.'
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I do not like to take up the honourable member for Moreton's time, but he is misquoting me. I said, `Absolute rubbish.'
 (Mr Andrews)—There is no point of order. The member for Dobell will resume his seat.
—The other thing that I think the Australian Labor Party will attempt to do over the next 14 months until the next federal election is to spend a lot of time trying to tell people in government schools in my electorate that the government of Australia, the Commonwealth government, the Howard government, are not supporting them. As I said in my earlier contribution, some 85 per cent of the cost of funding state schools in this country is met, understandably, from the state governments, not from the Commonwealth government. With the results of the new tax system, the state governments of Australia will in fact have a lot more money to spend in this regard. Despite all this, the Commonwealth government have been able to pick up a lot of the shortfall that the Queensland government have failed to meet in my electorate. 
Just the other week I opened a $535,000 teaching block at Kuraby State School, a teaching block funded by the Commonwealth government to the tune of $514,000. That does not sound like 15 per cent of the total equation; that sounds more like about 90 per cent of the total equation. Runcorn State High School also received over half a million dollars in capital funding to government schools. Sunnybank State High School has received $1.1 million from the Commonwealth government in the last few years. Later this week I will be opening the new manual arts block there, which was $750,000 in cost of construction. Wellers Hill State School at Wellers Hill received just under $60,000 in Commonwealth capital funding and Wishart State School was delighted to receive $291,000 in Commonwealth funding to meet the cost of a new administration block. That is a well over $2½ million of Commonwealth funding directly into capital funding of projects that the Queensland government have not bothered or have not been able to afford because of their own poor economic standards. 
At the same time the Commonwealth government have funded directly to non-government schools in my electorate some capital funding to assist them in various building projects. I have been pleased to be at the opening of these various projects over the last couple of years. The Clairvaux-Mackillop College at Upper Mount Gravatt received $250,000, which went into an excellent facility there; St Brendan's Primary School at Moorooka received $50,000 for,  amongst other things, received $50,000 for, ceiling fans and a few other improvements; St Elizabeth School at Ekibin—the Presentation Sisters worked hard for so many years to build that school up—received $5,000 in capital funding; and St Thomas More College at Sunnybank received $75,000. A total of $380,000 in capital funding went to non-government schools in my electorate.
One of the groups in our community who were so badly neglected over the 13 years the Australian Labor Party ruined and ran this country were those who never quite made it to university. They were basically left on the scrap heap. Who will forget the words of the former member for Fremantle, former education minister and one-time Treasurer, John Dawkins, who said of that 70 per cent of young people who did not go on to university, `We didn't do much for them and they joined the unemployment queues.' 
This government have been pleased to work with schools in my electorate such as Clairvaux-Mackillop College, Sunnybank High, Our Lady's College at Annerley and a number of other schools on the Jobs Pathways concept and also the SCIPS project, the Southside Cluster Industry Placement in Schools, which brings industry together with teachers to show students exactly why what they are learning in the classroom is important for their employment prospects down the track. These are the sorts of practical things that underline the complete failure of the Australian Labor Party's own education policies in the past and the fact that they have shown no promise to repair that failure in the future. These sorts of approaches, these sorts of industry placements and examples of school cooperation with various industries, are showing students who may not have the application to go on and get that tertiary degree that there is a point in learning, there is a point in staying at school and sticking with study and applying the skills and the lessons learnt, the lessons taught and the lessons caught, during their time at school. 
 These are the sorts of approaches that people in the community in my electorate were demanding a few years ago. When we ran a youth jobs summit in 1997 they brought them out as ideas that needed to be acted upon. The happy news is that this government listened to the people in Moreton, they listened to the employers, they listened to the teaching professionals, they listened to the parents and they listened to the young people, the students. They provided the policies and the funding for the policies, and now we are getting the outcomes. We are building a better work force, a more clever nation, a more capable nation. We are building dignity back into the young people in this country. They have a role to play. They have opportunities that they never had under the 13 years of Labor. Labor's `spend big, tax big but get no results' policy—no check on their record, no check on their progress—is not what we are doing in government. We are all about pro-activity and delivering to the young people today and into the future.
Motion (by Ms Gillard) put:
That the debate be now adjourned.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, we have just seen the government in this place—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, the member just moved in this House to adjourn the debate. She now wants to participate in it. Is this any evidence that she had any commitment to her previous motion or was she just wasting the time of the House? 
 (Mr Andrews)—Order! The honourable the minister has raised a point of order. I refer the minister to standing order 89. The honourable member for Lalor is well entitled to participate in the debate and I call her.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is no wonder the government are a bit touchy on this bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000, when they have just voted to prevent scrutiny of $50 million of government money going to the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia. We know they made that vote. Why did they make that vote? They have all voted for the old school tie. We have seen those on the front bench come in and back the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia because they are the schools they attended. The Deputy Prime Minister, of course, went to Kings School, Parramatta; the Treasurer, Carey Baptist Grammar School—though I do not think he is a Baptist any morethe Minister for Foreign Affairs, Geelong Grammar. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs himself went to Scotch College, which he no doubt attended with his good friend the Minister for Health and Aged Care. 
—On a point of order on relevance, Mr Deputy Speaker: I feel that it is quite inappropriate for any member of this House to be questioning the religious beliefs of any other member.
—There is no point of order. 
—As a Welsh Baptist, I felt entitled to make that comment. Just moving on in relation to the last of the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, a Brighton Grammar boy, has come in and voted for his school as well. This vital piece of legislation deals with the distribution of $22 billion of funding for schools over the next quadrennium. For the minister at the table, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, that is a four-year funding period. That amount of expenditure in and of itself deserves very detailed consideration, and this piece of legislation deserves even more detailed consideration, given that it changes the nature of the funding model used for non-government schools in that it replaces the education resources index with the measure of the socioeconomic status of schools. If the government had lived up to its own rhetoric, we could have been having in this place a real and sophisticated debate—though it would have needed to change the minister at the table—about the nature of educational and locational disadvantage and the best funding mechanisms to ensure that both government and non-government schools are funded on the basis of need. 
And let us be clear about the government's rhetoric. The submission of the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs to the Senate committee that has been considering this legislation, the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, states:
The SES approach is a more transparent and objective measure, based on independent data that are consistent for all schools.
The submission goes on to describe the fact that the funding approach should be transparent and simple as one of the key principles that underlined the government's policy for Commonwealth funding of non-government schools. Indeed, the minister echoed these sentiments in his second reading speech by saying:
This historic reform will provide a more transparent, objective and equitable approach to funding non-government schools.
Despite all of this rhetoric about openness and transparency, this House is being required to debate this legislation in the dark. First, this House is being required to debate it prior to the Senate committee which is deliberating on it delivering its report. Secondly, and more importantly, this House is being required to debate this legislation even though there has been no public release of the 1998 simulation study that forms the empirical basis for this new SES funding system. The government simply will not release the figures. Those data are being withheld despite the Senate legally requiring the minister to produce them through a return to order.
In these circumstances, we are entitled to be sceptical about what this bill truly means for the schools in our electorates. If, as the government maintain, this bill is good for all schools then, put simply, why won't they release the figures? However, given the government's furtive approach to this bill—and we have just seen that displayed in the recent division—we have no option but to debate the merits of this bill at this stage.
As noted, the bill introduces a new model for funding non-government schools—the SES model. The SES model in this bill has at its core the average government school recurrent costs figure. The 1998 average government school recurrent costs figure is set at a dollar figure of $4,355 for primary students and $6,050 for secondary students. Schools are then allocated an SES score based on 1996 census data; that is, every student's address is geocoded—coded against the census collector district from which that student comes. While census collector districts vary across Australia, they are in the order of 200 to 250 households. The data of that census collector district, which deals with three dimensions—occupation, education and income—is then factored in; that is, the student's address is geocoded and the occupation, education and income data from the census collector district in which they live is factored in as part of the school's SES score. Out of this process emerges an SES calculation, the theory being that if students predominantly come from census collector districts which are disadvantaged in terms of occupation, education and income then a low SES score will emerge. Conversely, if students predominantly come from census collector districts which are advantaged in terms of occupation, education and income, a high SES score will result.
After calculation of a school's SES score, funding is derived through the use of a formula. The minimum entitlement for schools is set at 13.7 per cent of the average government school recurrent costs figure and will be payable to schools with SES scores of 130 and above. The maximum entitlement for schools funded on their SES score will be set at 70 per cent of the average government school recurrent costs figure and will be payable to schools with SES scores of 85 and below. Funding for schools with SES scores between 85 and 130 will be payable on a continuum, with a difference of about $55 for primary school students and $75 for secondary school students for each single point change in the score. An SES methodology which uses effective measures of the relative advantage and disadvantage in our community could be a truly powerful tool for locating educational disadvantage and targeting funding to need. It could be—but, on the poor data available, we have every reason to fear this SES model is not the powerful tool we need.  
There are the following five flaws in the SES model. Firstly, it could be argued that the model is flawed, proceeding as it does on the basis of the average government school recurrent costs figure. This figure makes no allowance for the cost variation for delivering education in different parts of Australia, though we are all well aware that such costs vary considerably across the nation. It may well be that a base figure which took account of the variation in costs for remoteness and to which an SES methodology was then applied would be a better and fairer model for exposing need without discriminating against people because of their relative remoteness.
Secondly, this model uses only some aspects of the census data. Of course, census data reveals more than simply occupation, education and income. It reveals home ownership statistics, the usage in the home of languages other than English, family structures and the like. It may be that some of these indicators should also be built into the SES methodology. Certainly a debate needs to be had on this, where we are provided with various simulations showing the difference that the additional subtraction of these various factors would make, so we can compare the various methodologies and select the one which is the fairest.
Thirdly, the model may lose veracity the more geographically dispersed the students of a particular school are. If students live close to their school and those areas are all disadvantaged according to the census data, it makes intuitive sense that those students come from disadvantaged homes and we are dealing with a school that is working in disadvantaged circumstances. Yet for many non-government schools the catchment area is geographically large. Indeed, in some cases it is right across the face of our capital cities. In some circumstances it is conceivable that only one student comes from a particular census collector district and that the data for that census collector district is in no way representative of that student's circumstances, because their family is either more advantaged than the census collector district generally or far more disadvantaged. Either way, there is a flaw in the methodology which will be particularly acute for those schools whose catchment areas are very large and where the number of students coming from any one census collector district could be as low as one or a very small number.
 Fourthly, the model may lose veracity in highly differentiated areas where wealth and poverty live cheek by jowl. This can often be true of inner city areas where housing commission residences and historic slums abut wealthy gentrified suburbs, and I am sure we are all aware of that phenomenon in our capital cities. It can also be true in electorates like mine where abundant land means it is possible for new prestige developments, like Sanctuary Lakes, to emerge in the midst of what has been a long-term area of disadvantage. In such circumstances, where census collector districts wander across these lines of wealth and poverty, it is possible for the census collector district averaged data not to be very representative of the individual households involved. Therefore, of the criticisms of the SES model, three of them are of a relatively technical nature. Just because they are of a technical nature, that does not mean that they are minor, and the best way to have this debate would be to have a series of simulations where those factors are run in the simulation and then left out of the simulation so we could all see the difference that they make.
The last objection to the SES model is more philosophical, that the model makes no allowance for the amassed resources of any particular school. As we are all aware, over the years many prestige schools have amassed wealth—wealth in terms of buildings and facilities, wealth in terms of the equipment available, wealth in terms of alumni funding raising, trust funds, endowment funds and the like. Obviously, just as the economic capacity of an individual is affected by his or her income and assets—a principle which is enshrined throughout our social security system and which is used for all benefit calculations for pensions and the like; there is the income test and the asset test, because we recognise throughout our social security system that both contribute to the economic capacity of an individual—it must follow as a matter of logic that the economic capacity of a school is affected by both its income generation potential—from the current class of parents whose kids are enrolled in the school—and the assets of the school. The SES funding system makes some attempt to measure the income generation potential of the parents of the kids in the school but absolutely no attempt to measure the latter, the assets of the school. This is a gaping flaw, one which the government would not allow to emerge in any other benefit distribution system. Can you imagine anybody in this parliament suggesting that social security benefits ought to be distributed with regard only to income and not assets? This government would be the first baying for that person's blood, yet that is the model that is being predicated here in terms of SES funding, where there is no regard for the question of amassed wealth by schools. That is a very big flaw, one that needs to be addressed. 
These five flaws in the SES model might well have been capable of being addressed if we had a less belligerent attitude by this government to this piece of legislation which is before the parliament. But, in view of the government's belligerence, we are stuck with the SES model that is in this piece of legislation and we do not even have access to the data to know how it is going to work in the real world. 
I now turn to the fact that, as important as the SES model is to this piece of legislation, the model is going to apply only to the minority portion of the non-government school system. In fact, the minister's much vaunted SES funding model is only one of three funding models dealt with in this bill. The three models are the SES funding model, about which I have been speaking, the fact that some schools have guarantees to have their funding kept at year 2000 levels with indexation, and the funding system used for schools in the Catholic system. This bill comprehends three models of funding which spawn 65 different levels of funding, 46 SES levels, 18 ERI levels which are kept as a result of the guarantee to make funding for some schools, and the Catholic system. So we see in this legislation 170 different payment rates for schools, yet we are told that this legislation is about simplicity and transparency, a clearly ridiculous claim.
When we track what we can of the effect of this legislation on schools in our community, we find some very clear and very concerning statistics in terms of fairness. We see, as I alluded to before, that category 1 schools—the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia—have secured an extra $50 million in funding, a figure that the department itself has confirmed as a pretty good estimate. Meanwhile, the Catholic system, a system which we all know includes within its ranks many schools that are poorer and in greater need and which represents 65 per cent of non-government schools, finds that each of the schools in its system gets only an extra $60,000 a year, some 12 times less than the category 1 schools that are dealt with. The average government school gets a real increase of around $4,000 a year, some 200 times less. Those statistics ought to concern anybody in this place who is worried about fairness and equity in our school funding models.
In my electorate we have the situation of no category 1 schools—of course not. My electorate is home to a number of government schools, many of which are still struggling as they fight back from the legacy of the Kennett years. It is home to a number of poor Catholic schools which enjoy a great deal of community support. Notwithstanding that community support, they struggle with income questions. It is also home to a growing number of Christian and Islamic schools, all of which struggle for resources. When one looks at that composition—no category 1 schools, state schools that need more resources and non-government schools in the Catholic system, also of a poor and struggling kind—we find that this bill provides us with no joy at all. 
The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, in his second reading speech, says that this bill is about choice, about the right of Australian parents to choose the most appropriate schooling for their children. If he were being frank—and we would not expect that from this minister—he would say this bill and his government's approach to education are about creating an education market in which the wealthiest have the most choice because they have the ability to buy any of the options presented, any of the options on the table. They can buy a Scotch College or a PLC education product from the category 1 schools because they have that choice available to them because of their income and assets position. But that is not a genuine choice and we in the Labor Party understand that, if you genuinely want choice, you must support a properly funded government system and a properly funded non-government system with all schools funded on the basis of need. If you support that outcome, you maximise choice, because every school has the resources to be a good school, a school in which you would be happy to enrol your kids.
It is only in those circumstances that people of modest or lower income or asset positions genuinely have choice. Then they have the choice of opting for the local Catholic school, the local Christian school, the local Islamic school or the local state school if that is what they want for their kids, knowing that all of those choices offer a good quality education. A funding methodology, including a socioeconomic status methodology, which leads to parents having that kind of choice—a real choice—would have the full support of the Labor Party. Unfortunately—and we should not be surprised, given the ideology and methodology of this minister and this government—this bill falls light years behind that benchmark.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—In preparing for this debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 tonight, my attention was drawn to a series of press releases, the first of which was prepared by Dr David Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. It referred to the other press releases, which were prepared and released by the opposition. I would like to go through these because I believe they reveal the fallacious nature of the argument we are hearing from members opposite tonight. We have heard the continuing vilification of the `62 wealthiest schools in Australia'. As the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs revealed in his press release, the opposition have done us the favour of revealing their list of the `62 richest schools in Australia'. When I look through the list of the 62 richest schools, I find 27 in New South Wales and 28 in Victoria—including the Burwood Presbyterian Ladies College, of which I understand the Labor candidate for Deakin is a member of staff—I find five of the richest schools in Australia in South Australia, I find in Western Australia just one of these 62 richest schools in Australia and in my own home state of Queensland I also find just one of the 62 richest schools in Australia, according to the ALP—schools which are being vilified by the ALP as being the elite.
—The member for Rankin might be interested to know which one it is. Before I went through the list, I was scratching my head too—which school would it be? Which school would be the richest school in Queensland, one of the most elite schools in the whole of Australia? I was thinking, `Could it be TSS? Could it be Churchie? Could it be Somerville House?' These are schools around Brisbane that are well respected and well known—schools that members of the teachers' unions that like to engage in class war might wave their cloth caps at and get very upset about. But the fact is that the only school in the whole of Queensland being vilified and attacked by the Australian Labor Party is the Warwick School of Total Education. 
Really! They are discussing the 62 wealthiest schools in Australia, and here they are picking on the poor old Warwick School of Total Education. Is that an elite school? No, it is not. Just a minute ago, we were listening to the argument of the member for Lalor. She said something like: `You can't have a situation where you talk about their income and not their assets.' According to an article that is in the Courier Mail, I understand that the very fortunate Warwick School of Total Education received a donation from some benefactor and so, as a result, they are fairly well off at the moment financially. This could happen to any private school, any struggling Catholic school—an old boy or a member of the school community might win the lotto! But under the opposition's policy, they are going to be attacked by the Labor Party as being the number ones, the elite schools, the ones that need to have their wings clipped according to the Labor Party. What did they invite people in Queensland to do? Have a look at their shell press release. The shell press release, put out by the opposition education spokesman, went something like this. He invited Labor members to put out this press release:
The Howard government plans to increase funding to Australia's 62 richest private schools by around $50 million a year—
blah, blah, blah—
while giving government schools a real increase of less than $4,000. The member for—
insert your name here, according to the member opposite. He goes on:
The legislation means schools like—
insert appropriate names from the attached list of the horrible 62. According to the Labor Party, we could insert the Warwick School of Total Education into that incredible formula. We could vilify them if we were the Labor Party; we could get stuck right into them. The 62 wealthiest schools according to the ALP—and what have we got? We have a total farrago. We have a mess. We have a list that would not in any way equate to any measure of which schools in Australia could, on any realistic basis, be considered the ones that are the most well off in the country.
The SES system assesses need according to the capacity of parents to pay, by a measure of the socioeconomic status of the school community rather than the school's own resource levels, as measured by the ERI. It is, in effect, a measure of the relative capacity of non-government school communities to financially support their schools. It is not about which schools have a parent that might have won the lotto and is prepared to contribute to buy computers for that school. The two eldest of my children are attending, or will attend, St Mary's School in Ipswich. The first one has moved on from year 4 there, and the second one will start at that school next year. There is quite a drive on in that school to buy computers. According to the ALP, if suddenly, heaven forbid, we were to get a windfall at Ipswich—say we wrote a letter to Bill Gates and we were lucky and he was to donate all our computers—the ALP would be out there making sure that, as a result, poor old St Mary's School was lifted onto the top of the list and vilified as being needlessly rich, because we had had that little bit of good luck or that bit of good management or because we had taken that extra step. They would not be prepared to realise the genuine case of our school community and to consider the socioeconomic ability of those parents to pay or not to pay to support their school, to buy those sorts of things, to provide the resources for education to go ahead.
I heard the members opposite yahooing, when they were talking about this list of the 62 richest schools, about how many members on the government benches had attended these 62 schools and how few they calculated on their side had attended the 62 schools. Very few people in Queensland have attended the Warwick School of Total Education. I understand that that is a very good school and I defend it, as I would St Mary's in Ipswich, as being an excellent school. It is not in a position to be meted out the kind of trash that has been dished out by the opposition spokesman on education. The opposition spokesman on education should apologise to that school. I am sure that there will be other ones on this list that he should apologise to. If I take the experience of the Warwick School of Total Education, there is no way that everyone else on this list deserves the kind of shellacking that they have had from the ALP in this crazy and contrived campaign that they have been running. 
One of the major points made by the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs is that every one of the 62 schools meted out this shameful punishment by the members opposite will in fact be funded by less than the average—they used the word `average' over there—of the funding increase that was calculated. I do not know how it was calculated. I think it was calculated by putting it into a washing machine and turning it onto the spin cycle. They calculated an average and they said that all of these schools were going to get this average increase. They are not. According to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, every one of those 62 schools will be funded by less than that average figure mentioned by the ALP. That does not make it much of an average, does it? It makes a total joke out of the statement.
—You have just misled the House.
—Aren't you going to correct it if you are saying that it is incorrect? The members opposite are not assisting the House with their continual—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I can tell the member that in fact one school has confirmed that they get several million dollars extra—you fool.
 (Mr Andrews)—There is no point of order.
—I am not the one who has singled out schools like the member opposite has for this kind of trashy treatment—this low grade, very poor standard of research. Who did your work? Was it the milkman? It is a pathetic level of performance that we are seeing from the opposition. It is lower than low. There is one school in Queensland out of 62, according to them, that should be tarred and feathered and that should be put up as being the home of all of those evil things that they like to misrepresent as being the old school tie, the buddy system. There are not that many people who are old boys of the Warwick School of Total Education, and everyone who is deserves an apology from those members over there. It is an appalling performance. That brings to mind the question as to what would be the fate of a school under Labor's system.
The Labor Party are endorsing heavily the idea of this ERI, although I understand from the information I have received that they intend, at the end of all this, to support this bill. I do not understand what is causing them to promote the ERI in this debate and yet to walk away from it at the end of it all. It is a sadly familiar tactic that we have seen lately. They promote one thing and then do the opposite. It is just like the GST: they opposed the GST and then supported the GST. It is a very poor state of debate and a lack of consistency. The people in my electorate of Blair should be entitled to expect better from these noisy members opposite. All they have done by putting together this farcical press release, this shell press release—it is a shell of honesty, according to them—is to prove the very arguments that the minister has been making to the House: the SES system is fairer and it enables the assessment of a school community according to their ability to contribute to the school by way of their socioeconomic status rather than endeavouring to work out the school's own resource levels under the old system of ERI. 
I would like to talk about some of the responses to the government's legislation. I would like to refer to the letter sent to members of parliament by the Australian Parents Council. That group has said:
The Bill recognises that every child is entitled to a base level of public funding for their school education. It provides a fairer way of giving parents at all income levels a chance of choosing the most appropriate schooling for their children.
The Bill gives more equitable Commonwealth funding to non-government school students and is based on a more transparent measure of educational need.
That was from Leo Dunne, the President of the Australian Parents Council. He had five points there, all of which support the government's position and make it very clear that that is the preferred position of the Australian Parents Council. The person who has been most abused by members opposite in this debate is Father Tom Doyle, who is the Deputy Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission. The fact is that Father Tom Doyle was quoted by the Prime Minister in this House as saying:
The Bill has the support of the NCEC and the State and Territory Catholic Education Commissions as it recognises that the allocation of funds is based upon need.
The new funding arrangements also provide surety of funding to Catholic schools over the next quadrennium. The Bill links grants to the average cost of schooling in the government sector and will therefore promote equity and accessibility for families who wish to exercise their right of schooling choice for their child. It also promotes fairness ... and enhances the Commonwealth Government's decision in 1998 to implement the recommendation of the Non-government Schools Funding Review Committee which said that there was an unacceptable resourcing gap between Catholic schools and other schools.
The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs also quoted Father Tom Doyle when speaking about the government's package. Tom Doyle said:
... it is a very good and equitable package. ... The new system is fair, open to scrutiny, yet doesn't drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise everyone's right to choice.
That seems fairly comprehensive to me. Father Tom Doyle has nailed his colours to the mast. He has said what his views are, and the continuing misrepresentation of his position by members opposite should not, I think, be allowed to continue. Nevertheless, the fact is that we should look across the board at the way education works in our country. As I remember the member for Moreton saying, 85 per cent of the funding for government schools comes from the states and the Commonwealth provides 15 per cent. Government schools are known as state schools for that reason. All people pay their taxes. They all contribute to the system. The difference is that parents of children in non-government schools agree to pay fees. They agree to pay a levy to the school to support the education of their children. So, even with all the government involvement in funding at all levels of education, it is still estimated that parents of children in non-government schools pay 45 per cent of the costs of their children's education.
As has been said many times in this debate, this government stands for choice and equity. We want to allow all parents to choose the education that they want for their children. We stand for diversity, that is, choice between private schools and government schools, between religious and non-denominational schools. Ethnic groups and various language groups all have their own right to establish schooling systems to suit their needs. We see different structures. We see primary to year 12 structures, in some cases, or year 5 to year 12. We see co-educational or non-co-educational. It is wrong for members opposite to seek to get rid of that diversity, to seek to grind everything down, as they do continually, and to distil it all into the Australian Education Union's view of this synthesised education system based on their own—that is, the Australian Education Union's—view of the way it all should be.  
This government has taken several steps that deserve recognition. Since 1985, there have been some changes and different policies put forward. For example, the members opposite were very supportive of what they called the Disadvantaged Schools Program, which cost something like $1 billion. It had nice words attached to it—`disadvantaged schools'. Everyone agrees with the idea. It certainly seems like a motherhood statement that you should give money to disadvantaged schools. We would all agree with that. But, while they were doing that, what was happening in those schools? Thirty per cent of students, for example, could not read or write. That was an appalling outcome. So, while we can give $1 billion to disadvantaged schools, what could we give for people to learn to read or write? Very little apparently, according to those members opposite. They could not come up with the readies to provide people with basic literacy and numeracy. When the then education minister and now Leader of the Opposition was presented with reports warning him about the dire state of literacy and numeracy, what did he do? He did not release them. He sat on those reports.
Teachers' unions have taken a certain role in this process. The ERI system, as it was, is being touted here tonight by the ALP. Even though they would never actually support the ERI themselves, they are using it here to try to make a point without physically supporting it. The ERI system, according to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, has been abandoned because over a period of 15 years the Labor Party continually adjusted, changed, altered and manipulated that system so that its transparency and fairness were destroyed. Schools at different levels of need were concentrated in the same funding category and schools with the same level of need were distributed across categories. In the end, no-one had any confidence whatever in that system. Some examples of that were the fact that the teacher unions ordered Labor to put a limit on the funding for the neediest schools at an ERI level of six. Why was that? To ensure that there would be no low fee schools being set up in opposition to the government schools preferred by the teacher unions.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I welcome the application of a needs based funding formula for non-government schools because funding to non-government schools should be on the basis of need. In fact, in my view, there is a lot of merit in the concept underlying the funding formula introduced in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 because that funding formula is based on an index of socioeconomic status. But the application in this legislation of the SES funding formula is flawed. There have been manipulation of and exemptions from the SES index and that has led to unfair results. Among those results, 62 of the wealthiest non-government schools in this country are getting an average of $820,000 per annum extra, yet the Catholic schools are getting $60,000 extra. Apart from indexation for cost increases in government schools that were legislated by the previous Labor government, the government schools are each getting just $4,000 extra. Let us cover that again: $820,000 for the wealthiest schools, $60,000 for the Catholic schools and $4,000 for government schools above indexation. By way of comparison, that is $800 per student for the category 1 schools—the wealthiest schools—compared with just $157 per student for the Catholic schools.
In relation to the Catholic schools, it seems to me very curious that the Catholic system has forgone $140 million that would have been available through the application of the SES funding model if they had chosen that option. Instead, in order to retain control over the allocation of funds, the Catholic system has said, `We'll forgo the $140 million in exchange for that control.' The schools that stand to lose out of that process are the disadvantaged schools—for example, disadvantaged schools in my electorate and schools in Woodridge and Kingston, where the unemployment rate is 25 per cent. I would be very keen to know from the Catholic system why they chose to forgo $140 million in order to retain full control of the allocation of funds. Perhaps they do allocate it fairly. I would like to be assured of that because it is very disturbing that the Catholic system could make a decision to forgo $140 million. 
The enrolment benchmark adjustment takes $60 million from government schools even though their enrolments have increased by 26,000 students across the country. This is regarded as fair—Liberal style. In a most Orwellian statement, the minister last week declared in this parliament that the enrolment benchmark adjustment is not a school funding policy. On this occasion, I am obliged to agree with him—the enrolment benchmark adjustment is not a school funding policy; it is a school defunding policy. The government's true agenda is outlined in its private policy statements. The coalition's budget cabinet committee minutes outline the government's commitment to driving students out of government schools. These minutes were released last week by the shadow education minister. The minutes record that Dr Kemp, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs:
... noted that the coalition sought to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools ...
and that it was agreed that Dr Kemp would report back to the budget committee on:
... non-government schools, whether additional expenditure could be offset by reductions in grants to government schools and in untied grants.
They are this government's private policy statements. Those private policy statements are being fulfilled through a $60 million cut from government schools through the enrolment benchmark adjustment. They are being fulfilled through untied grants to the states being abolished as from 1 July this year and replaced with the GST. They are being fulfilled by $820,000 of extra funding going to each of the 62 wealthiest non-government schools in this country. This is equity Liberal style. If this is all such good policy—if it is truly fair, as members of the government claim—why not announce it as policy? Instead, the $820,000 being allocated to each of the 62 wealthiest non-government schools was kept secret by this government. It did not want to disclose that before the legislation went through, but it was revealed by departmental officials under questioning in the Senate estimates process.
Perhaps the most striking example of equity Liberal style is the treatment of disabled students in government secondary schools. The only losers from this funding formula—the only students who actually go backwards in the funding formula contained in this legislation—are disabled students in government secondary schools. Those students are being confronted with a cut in per capita funding from $126 to $102 per year. That is equity Liberal style. It is equity Liberal style to take funding from disabled students in government secondary schools and give it to the 62 wealthiest schools in this country. The government promised to increase funding for special education. It promised that at the last election, yet it is cutting funding for special education for students in government secondary schools.
In another Orwellian statement, the government has been implementing all of these policies under the cover of giving families choice. The key word here is `choice'. I support the choice of parents to send their children to government or to non-government schools. I support public funding of government and non-government schools. I support funding based on need but not on entrenching privilege. I am happy for wealthy non-government schools to thrive. I am also happy for wealthy non-government schools to receive some public funding, because they do educate children, but I am not happy for wealthy non-government schools to receive preference in government funding policies over government schools and over disabled students in government secondary schools. I am not happy for a government to have a policy of using funding policies `to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools' all under the guise of choice. If this government happen to be re-elected, my fear is that government schools will come under further funding pressure in the coming years because, under the financial arrangements contained in the GST legislation, the states get all of the proceeds of the GST but inevitably there will be cuts in tied grants to the states. 
The Commonwealth's spending on government and non-government schools has been allocated through so-called specific purpose payments, or tied grants, since 1964, when enabling legislation was first enacted. That is when the Commonwealth really started to get into funding of schools. Specific purpose payments to schools have increased quite dramatically since 1964 to a point where, in the 1999-2000 year, a total of $4.8 billion was spent on specific purpose funding for schools. The point I am making is that the specific purpose payments for government schools are at risk under a re-elected coalition government because when the states seek increases in tied grants for government schools they will be greeted with the response from a coalition government that, since the states have a major new growth tax, the Commonwealth no longer has a responsibility to maintain the real per capita value of tied grants.
At the special Premiers Conference in November 1998, which discussed the future of federal-state relations under the GST, Commonwealth Treasury officials made it abundantly clear to their state counterparts that there were no guarantees about the level of tied grants to the states beyond the so-called transition period. The actual wording adopted at the Premiers Conference, as repeated in a subsequent intergovernmental agreement, is as follows:
The Commonwealth will continue to provide Specific Purpose Payments (SPPs) to the States and Territories and has no intention of cutting aggregate SPPs as part of this reform process, which would defeat the objective of the States and Territories being better off under the new arrangements.
In bureaucratic language the phrase `has no intention' falls well short of guarantees. The statement `has no intention' does not indicate how long the absence of intention will last. Moreover, an undertaking not to cut aggregate specific purpose payments leaves wide open the option of simply holding tied grants constant in nominal terms, allowing their real value to be eroded by inflation and their real value per person to be eroded by population growth. The agreement between the coalition government and the states therefore allows the Commonwealth to greatly reduce its funding effort to the states over time, including in the area of funding to government schools.
Already the coalition government has begun reducing tied grants to the states, as confirmed by the Prime Minister when he was asked whether the government was providing less funding. He said:
No. we're, well we're providing, we're providing less dollars, but because the costs of operating will fall, the real financial position will be the same.
He said that during an interview on radio 3AW on 11 February this year. These decisions that the Prime Minister was talking about were taken unilaterally by the federal government, not as part of the intergovernmental agreement with the states. Former coalition leader Professor John Hewson, who proposed a GST in the early 1990s, has raised the prospect of a coalition government clawing back payments to the states. He said:
The real question is just how long the intergovernmental agreement will last and how long before the Government breaks another `core promise'. I don't think it will be too long before the Commonwealth starts to try to claw back some of the GST revenue from the States or to seek other arrangements.
Professor Hewson said that in an article in the Australian Financial Review of 30 June this year. Tied grants to the states would be an easy target for an expenditure review committee, the same committee the minutes from which I quoted Dr Kemp a little while ago. They would be an easy target for the expenditure review committee of a coalition government in seeking to finance the other main item on its agenda, which is further reductions in income tax for high income earners. Treasurer Costello articulated the coalition's agenda when he declared himself to be `an income tax cut man' who would want to move the top marginal rate out to `multiples of average weekly earnings'. Further election promises of reductions in income tax could be financed by cuts to real per capita tied grants to the states. That is my fear: that this legislation would not last very long under a re-elected coalition government because they would say, `You, the states, have the big GST growth tax. We're in a bit of a tight fiscal position because we've just offered a new round of income tax cuts to the highest income earners in this country. Therefore, we need the revenue and we're going to take it off government schools.' They will take it off government schools in the guise of choice, in the guise of giving parents and families the choice to send their students to non-government schools. They will implement their agenda of pushing students out of government schools and into non-government schools, make no mistake about that. 
In the information age it is crucial that a national government invest in education. These are some of the problems that this country confronts: the proportion of the Australian work force with post-school qualifications has slipped back to about the same level as in the early 1990s. So the proportion of our students with post-school qualifications has not gone forward in the last few years; it has slipped backwards to about the same level as in the early 1990s. High school completion rates are lower now than in the early 1990s. In government schools, one-third of students fail to finish high school; 40 per cent of boys in government schools fail to finish high school. The total federal and state government spending on education as a share of gross domestic product has declined since the mid-1990s.
Under the coalition, our education system is actually going backwards while most other countries are surging forward. While countries like the United States and most countries in Europe know that we are now in the information age, where education is critical, the lifetime prospects of our children are not good. This government is taking Australia backwards, not forwards. We are not even holding ground; we are going backwards while these countries are surging forward. Most young people who drop out of high school in this information age will confront a lifetime of insecure jobs and unemployment. That is hardly a recipe for a strong, happy family and a safe, secure community. But that is the prospect this country faces. Boys are doing particularly badly, and many actually go backwards in the middle school years with the onset of adolescence.
A living standards education subcommittee task force, of which I am a member, visited Melbourne recently. Professor Peter Hill, a renowned expert in this area, showed us very disturbing graphs indicating that boys who are not doing well by the time they arrive in the middle school years actually fall backwards. Those children, after another year or two, are worse off than when they entered high school because of the onset of adolescence combined with initial poor literacy and numeracy skills. Professor Hill told us that $1 spent on early intervention in early literacy and numeracy is worth $2 spent in the middle years. The researchers and the schools are finding it very difficult to find the right teaching formulas and methods to make sure that these kids are re-engaged in the process.
In Victoria they are trying new approaches to middle schooling. One of the biggest problems is that it is typical for a high school student to have more than 40 teachers, so that student going through high school believes that his or her teachers do not know them. There is no close engagement, they do not feel part of the school system and they do not feel part of society. They do not feel that anyone really knows them. These are the sorts of problems that need to be addressed, but they are not being addressed in this legislation. 
Because the problems in the middle schooling years emanate from the very early years, what is desperately needed in this country is a set of early intervention programs—a set of programs that starts with home visiting while a mother is still in hospital, particularly in areas where children are typically at risk. Home visiting programs would start when mum is in hospital, before giving birth to the child, with immediate follow-ups after she has gone home. It is very important that we have positive parenting programs implemented to make sure that the parenting skills are there and that they get the encouragement and support from people they can rely on.
When the kids arrive at school, they need to be ready to learn, and therefore we need a decent, high quality preschool program. In the early years of schooling, there is a need for reading recovery programs for children who have been identified as having reading difficulties. These are the formulas for success. In disadvantaged areas, Labor has already announced that it will be implementing a set of education priority zones to make sure that these kids really do have every possible chance in life. Labor has also announced scholarships and professional development programs for teachers to make sure that they lift their horizons and lift their hopes and plans for the kids going through the schools. Labor has also announced its intention to abolish the divisive and iniquitous enrolment benchmark adjustment. 
To me, equality of opportunity means affordable access to an excellent education for all. That is what we should be aiming for. If Australia is to become the knowledge nation and the land of opportunity, we need a government that will invest in its people instead of offering more income tax cuts for the highest income earners and huge funding increases for the wealthiest schools. What a marvellous ideal—that every child has an equal chance in life, whether he or she comes from Vaucluse or Mount Druitt, Double Bay or Moree, Toorak or Sunshine, Norwood or Elizabeth, Ascot or Woodridge, Toowong or Doomadgee. This is achievable with a far-sighted government committed to true equality of opportunity, not to entrenching privilege and rewarding the wealthiest schools under the guise of choice. I support choice, but real choice and real equality of opportunity. This is an ideal that is as old as the Whitlam government, but it is further away today than it was 30 years ago. It is an ideal which is ever more elusive under the Howard government and its ideologue of a minister, Minister Kemp. With the election of a Beazley Labor government—with the member for Dobell as the education minister—and their commitment to making this nation truly a knowledge nation in the knowledge millennium, we can journey towards that ideal again.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—The member for Rankin periodically makes a useful contribution to discussions in the House, but I suspect that that particular contribution will not be regarded as being among them. It is regrettable that certain subjects present themselves to the opposition as an opportunity to sharpen the historical and, thankfully, increasingly anachronistic rhetoric of class division. I regret to say that that is what we have been listening to for the last 15 minutes or so. 
If I take just a couple of examples, I can demonstrate without any difficulty the inconsistency of the argument being advanced. For example, the member for Rankin referred to the Catholic systemic schools as evidence of the failure of the model being proposed—that the Catholic systemic schools were not going to be included in it. In fact, the Catholic systemic schools requested the treatment which they are currently receiving, in fulfilment of a specific election promise given by the government in 1998—with a fair bit of lobbying, I must admit, by the Catholic Education Office in the diocese of Parramatta, which provided quite a bit of the leadership in the Catholic systemic schools. They sought to have their schools across the nation recategorised, with the exception of those in Western Australia and the ACT, for specific historical reasons, under the old funding system. They were recategorised to a category 11, which was a lift in the funding levels they were to receive.  
The Catholic education leadership indicated to the government that certainty of funding was their principal criterion. They were taking a long-term view of the financing arrangements for this very vast school system, and they simply wanted certainty. They had been very pleased with the reception they had received from the government in 1998, and they requested that they be able to preserve those arrangements. That request was acceded to by the minister on the commonsense grounds that it would provide them with exactly what they requested, and so that was the track we went down. Most illuminating of all is the fact that, in spite of everything we have just heard from the member for Rankin, the explicit promise of the Australian Labor Party at the 1998 election was that they would do exactly as the government has just done in relation to the Catholic systemic school system. 
If we try to extract and distil out some of the class rhetoric and ask ourselves why the government is introducing this new legislation, I would suggest that it is analogous with the whole area of tax reform. We recognised that the system we had was imploding. It had lost credibility as a fair, simple, transparent system. It was failing the constituents whom we are elected to serve, so we took the decision to do something about them. Those factors were equally evident to preceding governments, but no action was taken. This government believes that when difficult problems present themselves, the response should be to tackle them and to do something about them. 
As the Prime Minister is fond of saying, there is no virtue in power for its own sake. The virtue is in doing something good with the power entrusted to us by our constituents. This is a classic example, with the minister for education recognising that the system was falling apart and that it was riddled with problems of complexity, inefficiency and, in particular, unfairness. It was producing capricious, unpredictable results for schools, and students were the people who were suffering in the long run. Because we are committed to providing access to a quality education for all Australians, wherever they are in the income spectrum, we resolved to do something and to provide a fairer, simpler, more transparent system. That is exactly what the so-called SES funding model is all about.
I apologise to our few listeners on the Parliamentary News Network for the constant use of bureaucratic language such as ERS, SES and so forth. In simple terms, the former model sought to measure a school's capacity to access funding resources from its own means. A school was ranked according to its ability to raise funds from its own sources, in particular from parents, and from government sources. In effect, the greater the access to own-source funding—that is, the greater the amount of money that a school raised itself—the higher it was pushed in the categorisation and the less money it was given by the Commonwealth. The difficulty with that system has been that it specifically discouraged schools from raising their own funds; it specifically discouraged schools from competing for that dollar of discretionary funding which might come from parents or other discretionary sources.
So what we saw was a system of funding that was denuding schools of income and reducing the opportunities available to students as a result—even so, there is $2 billion worth of funding which is attracted to public and private schools from non-government sources. We want to lift that amount. We want to see more and more. As the member for Rankin rightly said, we are now grappling with the knowledge century, with information as the key commodity and with learning as a central value of public policy in this country. The question is: how do we achieve the most appropriate incentive based, fair funding arrangements? We have moved away from the previous model as a consequence of a very long running review of the so-called ERI. That system was put in place in 1985 and has been largely unchanged since then. The reality is that it came to lack credibility as a fair measure of need, largely because it did not reflect the socioeconomic circumstances of the surrounding school communities.  
When we look at these assertions of class interest and class based rhetoric, I just want to refer to a very illuminating statistic that demonstrates that there are many parents in the non-government school system who are what we would call battlers, who are making enormous sacrifices on low incomes to give their kids access to the school of their choice. I note that 21 per cent of school students throughout Australia come from families with incomes of less than $26,000. So over one-fifth of all students are coming from families with really quite low incomes—less than $26,000. Of those 20 per cent, one out of every five is attending a non-government school. So what we see is parents making decisions to make very considerable sacrifices to give their kids access to the non-government school of their choice. I just want to dispel this myth that every kid in a non-government school comes from a family that can afford high fees. It is certainly not the case in practice.
The new instrument measures the socioeconomic status, in particular the occupations, the levels of education and the income most prevalent within a very small geographical area called the census collector district. Australia is divided up by the Australian Bureau of Statistics into 34,000 census collector districts, and each one of those 34,000 districts provides information on occupation, education, income and a range of other factors, including the land value of houses, to build up a profile of what is really a collection of streets. That collection of streets gives a pretty accurate picture. While it is imperfect, it is the most accurate statistical picture of objective evidence available to any government or public authority. It gives us a feel for what the income level or the level of disposable income is in that specific, small aggregation of streets.
This model elicits information from schools. It does not require the names of the students but simply provides the addresses of up to 95 per cent of students at a particular school. Those addresses are then matched against the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics with the income levels in the census collector districts from which they come. That gives us a picture of the income available to individual schools. It is a much more accurate gauge of the availability of non-government funding to schools. The truth is that many non-government schools are drawing students from far-flung areas. They are not all coming from the streets and suburbs immediately surrounding the school. So it gives the government, as a matter of fairness, access to a much more accurate picture of the actual circumstances of every school in this country. That is why the measure has been so widely welcomed. In fact, about the only group in the country which is consistently hostile to the new measure is the federal opposition. It particularly benefits those struggling, smaller new schools, and every one of us in this place would have them in our electorates. For example, in my electorate there is the inspiring educational effort, presided over by Sister Irene and the Sisters of the Holy Family, which takes place at Our Lady of Lebanon in Harris Park. When you walk into this school there is a buzz, an energy, an atmosphere about the place; there is fundamentally an ethic which is transmitted by these sisters which is contagious. You feel it. You see it in the faces of the students when you walk in the school gate.
A school like that, drawing many students from the toughest suburbs in my electorate, from Harris Park and Wentworthville, and from suburbs in the electorate of Reid, Granville and Clyde, has many parents who are relatively new migrants to Australia but who are insisting on a certain corpus of values being transmitted in the educational process, and so they are sending their kids to Our Lady of Lebanon, Harris Park. These are not wealthy families. In many cases these families are struggling. But they are making a choice. What this policy is upholding is their fundamental human right and freedom to make that choice. The socioeconomic status of the parent body, of the community from which the kids are drawn, is linked to another completely objective measure, and that is the average recurrent cost of educating a young Australian in a public school. So we get a sliding scale of funding which starts at around 14 per cent for the wealthiest non-government schools. They will receive 14 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost of funding a student. At the moment for a primary school student the average is $4,355, and it is $6,050 for a secondary school student. That is the average cost of educating a kid for a year in a government primary or secondary school. So we have locked that in as the objective test, and then we give Commonwealth funding to non-government schools from a scale starting with the wealthiest schools getting just under 14 per cent of the cost of educating a child at a government school as a subsidy from the Commonwealth up to a subsidy of 70 per cent of the cost of a primary or secondary school student for the poorest non-government schools.  
The member for Rankin suggested that this system was going to disadvantage students in the disability sector. The absolute opposite is the case. Every non-government school specialising in educating children with disabilities is automatically categorised at the top level of Commonwealth assistance, which is 70 per cent of the cost of a public school place.
There are a couple points in this class rhetoric which need to be pointed out. Firstly, some may say, and some have argued, that there should be no Commonwealth funding at all for private schools, for non-government schools. I note the fact that parents from non-government schools are paying taxes for public education services which they will never use. They are actually assisting to generate the tax revenue to fund the public education system in the full knowledge that their children will never have access to those services. 
Secondly, I note that we heard the same sort of language in relation to private health and the efforts of this government to build a strong private health insurance system. The rationale for it is exactly that we want to free up the resources in the public sector, that we want to free up the availability of public health services to those who need it most. The way we do that is by providing incentives for those who can afford it to look after to the greatest extent possible their own health. Exactly the same arguments operate in the education sectorthat we want to provide some encouragement. If parents are prepared to privately invest in their kids' education and by doing so are creating another place in the public education system, that reduces the stress and strain on public education and allows for greater access to quality education for a greater number of students. I note, for example, that on average parents of children in government schools provide six per cent of the cost of schooling, with state and federal governments providing roughly 93 per cent of the cost of that child's education. The parents of non-government school students are providing roughly 43 per cent of the cost of educating those kids, with the Commonwealth providing 38 per cent and state governments 19 per cent. So what you see is this reduction on the burden of public education. 
I make those points as someone who is an avowed supporter of public education in this country and a member of the school council of one of the public primary schools in my electorate. It is a function that I discharge with relish. I think all of us who spend time among young people, as every member of this House of Representatives does, get an infectious sort of buzz from spending time among young Australians. You feel instinctively the importance of providing them with a quality educational environment. The debate taking place today is not about those fundamental objectives but purely about the most equitable method of getting there. I happily endorse this legislation as a step towards that outcome of excellence in education.  
This measure will encourage private investment in education throughout the country. It will provide non-government schools with a financial incentive to attract students from low income families. It involves increased funding of $561 million over the next four years. I note that this measure is a four-year funding cycle and that the Commonwealth is again providing leadership in this area where so many of the state governments around the country are not prepared to give this kind of four-year commitment. We believe in certainty in funding. We believe in letting school principals and school parent bodies know what their funding position is so that they can plan adequately for the future.
I conclude by touching on this issue of funding for public education, because this has been raised repeatedly. I just note that this year this coalition government will spend $402 million more on non-government schools than the Labor government did in its last year, 1995-96. That is an increase of 26 per cent. On top of that current very significant increase in funding, the forward projection for the next four years involves Commonwealth funding to public schools rising by a further 21 per cent. This is a balanced, practical, commonsense measure. It is founded on the principle of equity. It will be much simpler for schools to administer. It will involve another step towards excellence in Australian education.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—This is an important debate on an important piece of national legislation, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000. It goes to a central element of economic policy—education—and the way we skill the next generation for the demands of the new economy of the new century. It is also a central element of social policy, of social justice, and that is our commitment as a nation—to skill our children on an equitable basis so that there are no excessively unfair starts in the competitive business of life. Core and central to both those objectives is how we go about funding the nation's future education requirements, the adequacy of that funding, the direction of that funding and the use of that funding. Arguably, there is no more important legislation before the nation's parliament than what we have before us this evening. 
The scope of the legislation covers government and non-government schools. In my area of Brisbane, I have a large number of both in my electorate, some 42 schools in all. In my time as member for Griffith I have visited each and every one of those schools. They do an excellent job, given the resource constraints under which each of them operate. Each of these school communities is actively interested in the outcome of the debate before the parliament at present. This is not just an important area of public policy; it is also an exceptionally sensitive area of public policy, one requiring even-handed treatment. Regrettably, we have had less than even-handed treatment of this most sensitive subject. What we have had instead, I fear, is the ideologue from central casting, the Dr Strangelove of education, the one for whom the Australian Education Union is some sort of cocktail of the beast, the Antichrist with `666' stamped on his forehead and the source of all evil. I refer to our very own Dr Kemp. 
It was up there in the minister's office, next to the test tubes, the beakers and the Bunsen burners, and just by all those sealed bottles which contain all the leftover exhibits from previous social experiments we found a dusty old manual entitled `Dr Kemp's secret recipe for schools'. That manual is subtitled `The ERC's submission for education' and dated 3-4 June 1991. As the shadow parliamentary secretary reminds me, it was probably the era of the feral abacus, but I cannot quite recall its particular point in history. What do we read in that document—Dr Kemp's submission to the ERC of 1991 entitled `Education, David Kemp'? It states as follows: 
Necessary changes to education included industrial relations reforms in schools and tertiary institutions.
It goes on: 
He noted that the coalition sought to encourage students to move from government to non-government schools and was committed to the funding of non-government schools. 
That is fairly clear. Dr Kemp's submission goes on: 
Issues for further consideration. 
It was agreed that Dr Kemp would report back to the committee—
the ERC—
on:
1. Non-government schools—whether additional expenditure could be offset by reductions in grants to government schools and reductions in untied grants; and 
2. Government schools—administrative savings in devolving responsibility for those schools to the states. 
That document represents the clearest articulation of a strategy for the future of the country's school system which has at its core the non-government school system and says that the future role of the Commonwealth is to remove itself from financial support for government schools—a clear, resounding statement of where this minister would take us in the years ahead. 
Of course, that was only volume 1 of the social engineering strategy of the century. Volume 2 up there on Dr Kemp's work bench next to the smoking, steaming test tubes and beakers was that other little document that we saw tabled mysteriously in this parliament last year, on his proposals for reform of the university sector. That one bit the dust rather badly after the shadow minister, Michael Lee, mysteriously produced that document here in the parliament. On the face of the minister, Dr Kemp, was what I can only describe as the stunned mullet of the year award expression as he saw his proposed reforms for higher education go up in flames before him. But that was only volume 2. 
We then move on to volume 3. Volume 3 is alive in a large slice of the legislation which we have before the parliament this evening. This bill deals with government and non-government school funding for the next quadrennium and introduces a new allocation methodology entitled the SES, or socioeconomic status funding model. The details of this methodology have been expounded by other speakers in the debate. It would be tedious and repetitious of me to repeat those formulations and their explanation in my presentation to the parliament this evening. 
The key issue alive in the debate is the special treatment which is afforded to the 62 category 1 schools around the country. Before this new system was introduced, 17 per cent of average government school recurrent costs, AGSRC, went to these category 1 schools. But after the new system is introduced, after the Dr Strangelove initiative finally becomes reality, what happens? Thirty per cent of AGSRC will go to those 62 category 1 schools across the country—what could be described in any person's language as a windfall. Our calculations, largely supported by evidence to the Senate estimates committee by DETYA, are that category 1 schools, as a consequence of Dr Kemp's initiative, will achieve on average an additional $800,000 a year—not a bad addition to the pocket for those schools. 
 This stands in somewhat stark contrast to the additional allocation which is proposed for Catholic systemic schools. Rather than the $800,000 offered to category 1 schools, how much do the Catholic systemic schools get? An average of, we estimate, $60,000 extra per year, some 12 times less than the amount offered to category 1 schools. 
And what of government schools? How much extra will they be getting? It is $800,000 extra each for the category 1 schools, $60,000 per school for the Catholic systemic schools. `But how much for the government schools' do I hear you ask? Our calculation is $4,000 that each government school will be better off per year—some 200 times less than what has been offered on average to category 1 schools.  
Have we heard in the parliament any words of denial from the minister when presented with these claims by the shadow minister, Michael Lee? No. Do we have any authoritative figures from the minister at all to either refute or substantiate our claims? No. In fact, he would rather we take this entire piece of legislation on trust. When you do not have any evidence and you do not have any refutation from the minister about these core claims about the allocation of funding between these categories of schools, something is truly rotten in the state of Denmark.
We on this side of the House welcome and support increased funding for those other schools which are part of this overall new funding scheme, especially for low fee Christian schools, low fee independent schools and our marvellous Catholic systemic schools. I have many of these schools in my own electorate: Christian Outreach College, Brisbane Adventist College, Cannon Hill Anglican College and the convent schools right across the electorate of Griffith. But we have grave problems with this misallocation, this windfall allocation, to category 1 schools, which are that category of school that does not need this money at the end of the day. That is why the proposal put forward by the shadow minister for education, Michael Lee, to instead dedicate this funding to special needs education is in fact a wise way to go. I think all members of this House, including those opposite, would agree that the special needs sector is a sector of education which is in particular need of additional government support. 
We do not just have an issue of general equity here in terms of category 1 schools and non-category 1 schools. There is also a question of geographical equity. When we put together the 62 category 1 schools, how many, for example, come from my own state of Queensland? One, in Warwick. And I gather that that particular school has achieved its category 1 status as a result of a particular funding anomaly over the last several years. So, in the entire state of Queensland, with the exception of that school in Warwick, we have zero, zilch, none—not a single school which falls into this category. The other 61 are all south of the Tweed. We talk about equity in terms of category 1 schools and non-category 1 schools. I would suggest there are some geographical equity issues alive in this proposal as well. 
Appropriate levels of funding for our schools are one thing. The uniformity and quality of our curriculum are another. That forms a core part of what our funding goes to support. The move in recent years towards a genuinely national curriculum is to be welcomed, not least because of the increasing mobility of our national work force. Parents are tiring—and rightly so—of the practical impact on their children's education if they have to move interstate because of employment. The reality that we all face as a result of the changing nature of work is that the average worker will change jobs many times during their working life, and an increasing number of these jobs will involve moving around the country. In many respects, this remains one of the last frontiers of microeconomic reform—to ensure that education does not become an impediment to a flexible work force and an efficient economy. 
One of the manifestations of the emerging national curriculum has been the decision to develop eight national key learning areas, or KLAs. One of these is the so-called SOSE KLA—the study of society and the environment. In recent weeks, this has been the subject of an important and, it seems, increasingly heated public debate in my own state of Queensland. I have had a longstanding interest in curriculum questions, not just as a parent with three children currently at school—one at our local state school, the other two at non-government schools—and not just as a periodic member of our local school P&C and school advisory council, but also as someone who in a previous life was instrumental in initiating a comprehensive review of the Queensland curriculum in the early to mid 1990s. In fact, so concerned was I about the current state of the proposed new SOSE curriculum for Queensland schools that I recently wrote to the state education minister about it; I hope soon to be able to have a discussion with him about it. 
Many people are critical of the new proposed curriculum because they argue that it is ideologically biased. I do not subscribe to this view and I do not believe this type of criticism is relevant to the key deficiencies of the document. Those deficiencies relate to what I describe as the triumph of process over content, particularly as it relates to the treatment of traditional disciplines such as history and geography. It strikes me—and to some it may seem a slightly reactionary view—that one of the principal deficiencies we have with a large number of secondary and tertiary graduates is the absence of even a rudimentary historical framework within which interpretative analysis can occur. I find the paucity of the most basic chronological frameworks for understanding the history of Australia—both pre and post European settlement—not to mention the histories of Britain, France, Germany, the United States, China, Japan, India and Indonesia, to be nothing short of lamentable. 
I am not in this sense talking about the need for every year 10 graduate in Queensland to be able to name every premier of Queensland since 1860. Nor is it necessary to go back to the rote learning of the English public school system of some time ago whereby students were required to be able to name every king and queen of England since William of Normandy. But I would argue that a broad chronological framework which has, as a testable element, that the Tudors preceded the Stuarts, who in turn preceded Cromwell, is a fairly useful piece of knowledge in terms of students subsequently being able to debate effectively, for example, the evolution of political power and the role of parliament in a cultural tradition which directly informs our own. On a similar score, it might not be such a bad idea if our year 10 graduates were able to know the rough sequence of the various prime ministers that this country has had since Federation and the principal political movements that they have represented.
My critique of the geographical component of the new SOSE syllabus is of a similar nature. Whereas the history syllabus is now entitled `Time, Continuity and Change'—otherwise known as `History'—geography has now been entitled `Space and Place'. Once again, we need to see the reassertion of content over process, of knowledge of where the principal countries of our particular region lie on the map, their principal river systems, their mountain systems, et cetera, as well as, within that framework, an ability to interpret and apply that knowledge in debate and argument.
As I have indicated to the state education minister, I have offered my observations on these questions of deficiency, in relation to history and geography in particular, not as a trained educator but as one with a longstanding professional and personal interest in curriculum quality. I believe I am not Robinson Crusoe in my articulation of these concerns, as all parents and all teachers that I know have a deep concern for the quality of the curriculum product that our schools are delivering. Of course, I may be wrong in the observations I have made. At the end of the day, that is why it is important to have a public discussion and debate about these issues. I was puzzled to pick up my Courier Mail last Saturday and read that, in the view of the Director of the Queensland School Curriculum Council, I am not properly qualified to participate in this debate at all because `he'—that is, Rudd—`is not an educator, and he's never even been a teacher.' Well, I regret to report that I am guilty as charged on both counts—I am neither an educator nor a teacher. However, I find it extraordinarily arrogant, not to say elitist, to claim that this debate should somehow be restricted to educators and teachers alone or, more specifically, I suspect, the professional curriculum industry alone. What about parents? Don't they have a legitimate point of view? What about employers? Don't they have a point of view? And what about people such as yours truly? We have a professional interest in the quality of our education system, both as an instrument of national economic policy as this country faces more and more international competition, not less, and as a fundamental instrument of social justice as the education system is the best means available to us to provide each child in this country with an equitable and competitive start in life as is possible. 
If the best the Curriculum Council can do is to try and shut the debate on SOSE down because in its view the rest of us are dolts, then I think the time has come to review the role of the council itself. I don't mind for a minute having my arguments debated and, after due consideration, rejected. That is an open process. But I do reject vehemently the view that the council is some `holy of holies' that is not open to the possibility of external criticism and change. Furthermore, if the quality of the current SOSE document released in Queensland is a reflection of the quality of the council itself, then the time has come for somebody to have a look at just how this council is put together, what its powers are and how it goes about its business. For example, shouldn't we consider having at least a couple of senior business persons on the council, with both national and international experience, given that they are the ones who are in part going to be the `consumers' of the education product at the end of the day? How about having a few more, in this case, non-Queensland or non-state educators who can appropriately internationally benchmark what is going on in Queensland with other parts of the country and other developed economies?
I know many teachers and principals in my part of Brisbane. And all of them that I know are not only dedicated and hardworking but also committed to delivering the absolute best for their students at the chalkface. I fear, however, that what is being provided for them in this particular curriculum exercise is something which does not serve them well. I fear in particular that they may be being let down by what could broadly be described as the `professional curriculum industry'. These are important issues for the nation. They cover and go to the heart of how we go about funding the school system, both government and non-government. They also go to the heart of how that system is used and the quality of the curriculum that is delivered through it.
Last weekend I ran into a constituent of mine, Mr Koch, down at the local shops. Mr Koch was upset because he saw that there had been a diminution in the fairness of the education system. He said he was preparing a bumper sticker entitled `Fairness in education'. I said, `Mr Koch, paste it on your bumper. Let the world know that in fact we do have a problem of equity and fairness in this country's education system and we do need to have something done about it.' That is why the proposals put to this House by the government do not in our view reflect a fair outcome for this nation's future funding of the school system and need to be redressed consistent with the remarks of the shadow minister.

"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,2000-09-04,"—This States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 expresses an educational vision of the Howard coalition government. It is a vision to provide a quality education not only for the wealthy few but for all Australian children. It is a vision to lift education standards for those at the bottom of the scale because it is a vision that welcomes the raising of standards from bottom to top. As such, it is a vision embedded in fundamental democratic values. I do not wish to dwell too much on the flawed system inherited from previous governments, but essentially their policies were based upon a myth. It was an education myth constructed upon a Marxist, class based ideology that has disenchanted traditional Labor voters since the 1990s. Under successive Labor governments fuelled by the education unions, government schooling was travelling on the road to nowhere. The winners were centralised bureaucracy and monolithic education. 
Over the past four years, there has been a major change of direction in education, and as a result all Australian children and their parents are the winners. It is nothing short of a mischief to suggest that this has been done at the expense of government schools. On the contrary, government schools are more competitive and more focused on lifting quality as a result of this changed direction. What encourages me is that under this government the interests of all Australian children have been put first and parents, who bear the major responsibility for the care and upbringing of their children, have been given a real choice in the kind of education that their child receives. This choice means that the very wealthy parents can choose to send their children to government schools, and a great number do, and low income parents can now afford to send their children to non-government schools if they so choose, and many do this also. This is a big achievement for any government and it is what separates the government that stands for choice between quality schools in all sectors and an opposition that stands for envy and division in education.
Because the issue of class and envy has been raised by the opposition in regard to this bill, I want to draw attention to the value and extent of diversity in primary and secondary education that all parents now enjoy in Australia. If the rainbow colours of multiculturalism, with its diversity of values and outlooks, enriches our community—and it does—so too does educational diversity with its range of values and outlooks. I cannot understand why, given that diversity is championed by the members on the opposite side of the House across a whole range of issues, when it comes to diversity in education, their diversity armbands disappear from are replaced by the divisive armbands of class and envy.
Australian freedom and democracy go hand in hand and have shown the world that while we are many we also stand together as one. Australians are citizens of many different backgrounds and outlooks and we face our shared future working together to educate our children so that they may secure their future financial independence and happiness. This is one important vision shared by all Australian parents, no matter what their heritage. Educational policies exist to serve visions such as these and our educational institutions are the means by which the development of children into educated adults is achieved.
In a democratic society the institutions should reflect what the people want. They should not force people into a uniform mould. Collective sameness was tried by the Soviet Union and by Chairman Mao. The rank stupidity of forced uniformity and centralised bureaucracy should be clear to all those who have eyes to learn the lessons of history. In our gold plated Australian democracy there are different values and different world views which are held dearly within the national psyche. If all Australians are to have the very best opportunities available to their children, they should rightly enjoy the widest possible choice in the way they live their lives, and this includes the widest possible choice of education models.
There are still many people who will ask, `But doesn't Christian schooling pass on Christian values?' Of course it does. But the question implies that government school education is somehow value neutral. The truth is that all educational programs, whether government or non-government, are developed within, and presented from, a particular philosophical view of life. A quick glance at textbooks and courses taught in government schools reveals that educational institutions are not value neutral but interpret life based on what can be described as the religion of relativistic humanism. The body of thought that comprises relativistic humanism is not value free. For example, one of the values it holds is to deny the relevance of God in today's world. One of the big problems this causes, in my view, is that it guides students to make choices based not upon the principle of right or wrong but upon feelings, which are all too ephemeral, and circumstances, which are all too transient. 
So I, as a parent, chose to send my children to Catholic schools—to the friendly little village school of St Catherine's at Gymea and to the excellent St Patrick's College at Sutherland—because I valued dearly the strong Christian ethics taught in those schools. In Australia the choice of school is the province of parents and our government wants to ensure that all Australian parents have the best possible choice when it comes to the education of their children. This bill is about non-government schools and we need to be clear that we are not talking about some monolithic or anachronistic entity. It is worth while to take a few minutes to remind ourselves of the growth in the diversity and history of the many non-government schools in Australia in recent years.
Christian schooling has its roots in the Jewish tradition which holds that parents are ultimately responsible before God for the education of their young. In biblical times, it contrasted with the Greek tradition where, in wealthy Greek families, household slaves acted as teachers of the children. After the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70AD and in the course of centuries in exile, Jewish schools increased in number. The focus of education was on the education of character and was seen to be not extraneous to life but, rather, synonymous with life. In the early centuries of the Christian era, ancient literature shows a tension between the Christian family and the Hellenistic pagan schools. As an example, Augustine had a very pious mother but his thinking as a young person was moulded by the secular Roman culture of his day. From such an example grew the realisation that Christian family education had to be complemented by Christian school education. Christians became involved in schooling when the Roman Empire declined and was replaced by the Christian state. Gradually the Hellenistic concept of human-centred education was replaced by the Christian concept of God-centred education. There followed a period of monastic education, but by the 11th century such education by monks had gradually lessened and town schools developed.
Around the 16th century the Renaissance and the Reformation brought further revolutionary changes to both streams of education. As the Renaissance was influenced by the Greek and Roman golden ages, so the Reformation searched for roots in the early Christian era. Both stressed the individual and personal element, in opposition to tradition and collective thinking. A major influence that can be traced to the first Australian school was in Geneva in the mid-1500s, when John Calvin invited the city council to open a college for the training of children. He recognised the importance of education for the future and saw education as necessary to secure public administration, to sustain the church unharmed and to maintain humanity among men. It influenced the development of schooling in many parts of Europe. In England and Scotland it led to the establishment of church parish grammar schools to educate all children, whether wealthy or poor. It was this model that came to Australia with the chaplain to the First Fleet and penal garrison, Reverend Richard Johnson.
A little later in Europe, the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution intensified pressure for a separation of church and state. It is interesting to note that today, after 40 years of Communist rule and suppression of Christian schooling in many of the non-Orthodox countries of the former Eastern Bloc, Christian schools are again reestablishing themselves. In fact, Christian schools can be found in many countries around the world. They are diverse in their cultural and national backgrounds, their historical backgrounds and in their relationships with church and state and they form a very varied and colourful world family.
Back in the colony of New South Wales, the Reverend Richard Johnson was the first to begin recruitment to establish schools for the illiterate convicts of New South Wales. It is significant that the building that contained the first school in Australia in 1793, located just a short distance up the hill from Circular Quay, was also the first church building in Australia, serving both as a place of learning and as a place of public worship. It is not widely known that by far the majority of schools established in the infant colony were started by clergymen and supported by small grants from religious bodies and missionary societies. My paternal grandmother was Elsie Anne Walker Ward, the eldest daughter of George Walker, a Methodist lay preacher of the Richmond-Windsor district in New South Wales. His father was a Methodist preacher, and he opened the earliest Methodist schools in this area during the early 1800s. 
The majority of early Australian education, like that of America and a number of other countries, was initiated not by government legislation but by the Christian church. There is no doubt that this vanguard of church schools contributed to the high level of literacy among the local born and to their general moral behaviour, which was said to have been held in higher regard by the colonial authorities than the moral behaviour of emancipists and even the free immigrants. Government education did not officially begin until 1880, and so for almost a century Bible based, church related education met the academic, spiritual and moral needs of the children of the colony—and did so with remarkable success. While the churches could cope with schooling in the cities and towns, they had difficulty in providing education for children in rural areas where the population was sparse. By 1891, with the passing of education acts in the six colonies, almost four students in five were attending government schools.
In 1960, the dual system of government and non-government schools was recognised by the Commonwealth government, when funding was provided for libraries and science laboratories in both systems. Since then, a dramatic change has taken place. In the period 1975 to 1983, whilst the established Anglican and Catholic schools grew in size rather than number, there was a 41 per cent explosion in the number of other non-government schools, most of which were Christian schools. These non-government schools are not just Anglican and Catholic schools; there is a myriad other denominational and non-denominational Christian schools, plus schools for Jewish children and schools for the children of Muslims, Hare Krishnas and supporters of Rudolf Steiner and Maria Montessori. The newest school in my electorate is the highly regarded St Marks Christian Coptic School in the delightful and desirable new suburb of Wattle Grove. This school offers education for children from kindergarten to year 12, and although it opened only two years ago it already has 800 students and is seeking an additional campus.
Much of the stereotyping of the non-government schools is that of a few long-established and well-appointed denominational schools or the little Catholic parish schools which appear in nearly every suburb. I was able to benefit from a varied education, attending infants at Sylvania Public School, primary at a Catholic parish school, the Star of the Sea at Miranda, and secondary at St Patrick's Convent School at Kogarah. There is a very broad spectrum of non-government schools, and one of the less understood segments in the spectrum is the Christian parent controlled schools, which have grown exponentially in the last few years. These schools encourage individual school autonomy and diversity. It is not well known that many of these schools have their origins in Dutch immigrants who came to Australia in the 1950s and found that Christian schools similar to those that they knew in the Netherlands did not exist here. Many of the new Dutch arrivals were unskilled or their qualifications were not recognised in Australia, and they could not afford to send their children to high-fee denominational schools. Consequently, they began to form schools similar to those in their home country, and from such grassroots beginnings a significant number of new Christian schools developed, and they continue to adapt and to redefine their educational aims and practice in the modern Australian context. 
As I said before, it is important not to stereotype non-government schools, particularly along the lines that existed in the 1960s. I keep coming back to this point because it is important to understand the diversity and educational richness of the non-government school sector. It is an important factor in making Australia a clever country. All up, this one segment of the non-government school spectrum that can be described as alternative Christian schools includes about 330 schools, 4,500 teachers and 60,000 students. Many of these are located in regional areas.
The ratio of non-government schools, teachers and students to the government sector is rising from about one in four to about one in three. We are talking about nearly one million students in non-government schools altogether, compared to just over two million students in government schools. From a government policy perspective, it makes sound economic sense to encourage non-government schools. It costs the government about $5,000 per year to educate a child in a government school but only about $3,000 per child in a non--government school. In most cases, the shortfall of $2,000 is met by parents from the family budget and in most cases represents a considerable personal sacrifice. My fellow Australians should be aware that, in gross terms, the significant contribution of these families saves the Australian taxpayer about $120 million each year.
The formula that establishes the basis of funding under this bill is known as the SES or the socioeconomic status. It replaces the discredited education resources index, otherwise known as the ERI, because the ERI was not transparent and it did not deliver equity. The SES will introduce a new level of fairness, equity and social justice into school funding. The vast proportion of the funding that will flow to schools under the SES over the next quadrennium will go to the neediest schools. The SES is based on need. For example, under this arrangement little Catholic parish schools will receive about 76 per cent of the total funding. The schools serving the wealthiest families in Australia will receive no funding increase. Those schools will be funded at about 13.7 per cent of the average government school recurrent cost, and that is essentially the funding level those schools get under the present system, the ERI. There is no increase in the level of funding for these schools. From the point of no increase for the wealthiest schools through to the funding for the neediest schools, there is a progression in funding according to need—according to need and based on equity, justice and fairness. That is what the SES will achieve. I support the introduction of the SES based funding mechanism to non-government schools, and I congratulate Minister Kemp on this important initiative, which will leverage the future wealth of our nation upon the high quality of education for our children. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Bill 2000 provides the bulk of Commonwealth school funding for the four years 2001-04 of $7.6 billion for government schools and $14 billion for non-government schools. To this bill, the opposition has moved:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	notes that the preliminary data available suggest that the proposed distribution of funding among non-government schools is profoundly unfair;
(2)	is of the opinion that, before the bill is debated, the Government must provide detailed, final figures on the cost of the policy changes contained in the bill and the new funding figures for each non-government school; and 
(3)	condemns the Government for:
	(a)	failing to provide a matching increase in funding for government schools; and
	(b)	continuing its unfair Enrolment Benchmark Adjustment policy”.
The bill introduces two additional models of funding for non-government schools—the SES model and one for the Catholic systemic schools—and a mechanism to ensure that the schools are placed on the model that is most beneficial to them. It locks all grants into an index based upon the average government school's recurrent costs. It introduces establishment grants for new non-government schools and increases emergency assistance grants. It provides for non-government schools to receive recurrent funding for distance education students. It makes some changes to target programs. It makes signing up to performance targets a condition of funding for all school sectors. The major initiative in this bill is the implementation of a new funding system for non-government schools, with the measure of a school's needs changing from the current education resources index, or ERI, which assesses a school's total resources level, to an index which measures the socioeconomic status, or SES—that is, occupation, education and income—of all parents who send their children to the school. Catholic systemic schools will not be funded through the new system but will be funded at a level the government claims is equivalent to the ERI category 11. The remainder of the non-government schools will either move to the new SES funding system or retain, in real terms, their year 2000 level of funding, whichever is the more beneficial.
There will, therefore, be three categories of school funding: schools with SES funding levels, schools with the year 2000 funding levels—that is, the old ERI model—and schools in the Catholic school system. There will be some 65 different levels of funding—46 SES and 18 ERI—with a separate rate in primary and secondary, plus special rates for special education and distance education. All up there will be 170 different payment rates. About 95 per cent of non-government schools will receive an increase in funding. Government schools will receive no increase, apart from indexation and enrolment adjustment. In fact, the 62 wealthier schools in Australia, the present category 1 schools, will receive some $50 million a year in extra funding under this bill—almost $1 million each. I make this point as an economic fact of life rather than to create any friction between the wealthier and the not so wealthy schools in this country. This drain on finances for state schools is showing up in a serious lack of resources. Julia Baird, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 August, stated:
Students in public schools lack equipment vital to the new HSC science syllabus six months after it was launched. Most private schools have bought thousands of data loggers, which are used in all of the new HSC science courses to measure and record data electronically. But public schools are still waiting for the government-recommended suppliers, Q Stores, to stock them.
The Australian Education Union has estimated that the increase per student in the non-government sector will range from $170 for Catholic students and will be about $335 per student for other students in the first year, reaching about $1,000 per student per year at the end of a four-year period.
I would like to examine in more detail the new SES funding model compared to the old ERI model. The new model is based on the socioeconomic status of the parents of the students who attend the school. The school supplies the residential addresses of all its students. These addresses are then matched to the census collection district, or CCD, from which they come. A census collection district is usually about 250 households in a metropolitan area. Each CCD will be given an index based on occupation, income and education levels. The school is then given an overall score for funding based on the CCD index of the students. The areas with a high SES level of 130 and above receive the base rate of funding, and those with a low SES level of 85 and below receive the maximum amount of funding, with a sliding scale in between of about $55 per primary student and $75 per secondary student per SES point. This model supposedly gives a more accurate assessment of the individual needs of each school. 
There is an anomaly, however, in the implementation of this scheme. The old ERI scheme was based on the school's total resource capacity. While this system was not perfect—no system really is—it took into account the school's resource base: how much money it had in the bank, in shares, in investments, et cetera. The minister claims that using this system was a disincentive for schools to raise private capital as their government funding was in jeopardy if they raised private moneys. What we see in the change to the SES, however, is that the richest schools in the country—schools like Kings, Knox and PLC—which all have large investments and a strong resource base, no longer have that taken into account. As a result, we see the anomaly in funding appear. Because the schools' resources are no longer examined, these wealthier schools which have large investments and a strong resource base are now in line for a massive increase in funding.
Wealthier parents living in low income rural areas will attract more funding if they are classified as living in the low socioeconomic areas, which will mean that wealthier schools will obtain more funding if they have large numbers of students from rural areas. The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs confirms the shadow minister's claim that the wealthiest 62 schools will receive of the order of $50 million extra each year. In the Australian on Monday, 28 August, an estimation was made that Knox Grammar and Sydney Grammar would each receive about $1.3 million in extra funding under this scheme. How can the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs possibly justify increases in funding to these schools of that magnitude when needier non-government schools in Blacktown, in my electorate, will not receive anything near that amount?
We do not know the extent of the funding windfall to wealthier schools because there are no figures available as yet. At this stage, all of the figures are based on supposition, although, as I have said, the department has said that the figures offered by the shadow minister are essentially correct. This piece of legislation is currently being examined by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee due to report at the end of next week. The figures of how each school will benefit will not be known for another month, yet we are supposed to pass this bill as soon as possible.

"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Tonight I want to address the issue of unfair breaches that are being imposed on the unemployed by this government under the Job Network. I was interested when Minister Abbott claimed in the House on 16 August that:
We do not breach anyone who has a reasonable excuse.
Obviously, a lot of unemployed people watch question time. My office received many phone calls and I have since had lots of letters and emails from people who do feel they have been very unfairly breached. I thought I might put some of these on the record over coming weeks. I am sure that many people listening will agree with me that they do seem to be unfair breaches.
The first instance is of a young man in a regional area who had been instructed to attend a Jobsearch training course at a Job Network site. This man attended for all the days of the course except one. On that particular day, flooding had caused his car to bog. This had trapped him at home. He did not have alternative transport and so was prevented from attending the course that one day. He attempted to explain, but despite his explanations he was still breached and suffered a reduction in income for six months. For somebody on unemployment benefits, budgets are very strict. To think that an 18 per cent reduction was imposed for six months means that things like food and other necessities are simply forgone. What was his crime? Being bogged and having no other transport. For that, he received a fine which is more than people often receive for drink driving. 
A second man who contacted my office had a reduction in income imposed through a breach under the government's new preparing for work agreements. Under his agreement, this man agreed to look on a touch screen every week. In an interview with his Job Network provider, he explained honestly, in response to questioning, that in fact he had looked on the touch screen for only three out of four weeks. He too received a six-month reduction in his income.
This approach is not genuinely about helping the unemployed move from welfare to work. It is still about punishment. In the estimates committee, in relation to the new preparing for work agreements, I note that Mr Abbott's department, the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, told senators that the budgeted $212 million in saving would come as a result of more people finding work. However, the Department of Family and Community Services let the cat out of the bag when they told Senate estimates that the savings were based largely on the expectation that 48,000 people would be fined under the agreements, with many losing their benefits altogether. This conflicting evidence from the two departments shows that the savings were not going to be made by people gaining work; in fact, they were going to be made by people being breached. Something is seriously wrong when a government sets out to save money very often by fining the unemployed for what were demonstrable, extenuating circumstances.
To add insult to injury, it was recently revealed that the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has an agreement with Centrelink whereby Centrelink's funding is dependent on its upholding a minimum quota of the breaches imposed under the Job Network. Labor does support the concept that there is an obligation on the unemployed to search for work and to undertake activities to further their chances of finding that work, but we agree with the McClure report when it says that financial penalties should be sanctions of the last resort.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Job Network: Breaches</title>,Adjournment,15,1
