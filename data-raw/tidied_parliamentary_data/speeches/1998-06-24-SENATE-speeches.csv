"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—(9.31 a.m.)—I seek leave to amend government business notice of motion No. 1 by omitting reference to the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1998-99
Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1998-99
Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1998-99

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-24,"—Can I clarify what has happened to the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 . Has it been taken off or deferred?
—It is to be taken off the list, Senator.
—I ask that the parliamentary secretary deal separately with the Data-matching Program (Assistance and 
 Tax) Amendment Bill 1998  and the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1998 .
—The question can be put separately on those bills if that is what you wish, Senator.
—Perhaps the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998  and the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1998  could be put together. The Greens (WA) will be opposing their exemption, so if they can be done separately from the Wheat Marketing Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 , that would be of great assistance.
—I am happy to have those questions put separately.
—I put the question that the motion moved by Senator Ian Campbell, as amended, excluding the bills referred to by Senator Margetts, be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—I put the question that the motion moved by Senator Ian Campbell with respect to the two bills referred to by Senator Margetts be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>ORDER OF BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-06-24,"—If I could briefly speak to this motion, it is not that the Greens (WA) find either the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Amendment Bill 1998  or the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 1998  particularly obnoxious; it is simply that the explanations for urgency—and considering the weight of work required for all other elements of legislation—does not seem to hold sway. It is consistent with the approach we have taken that the actual arguments for urgency should be real arguments, and not simply because at some stage the government may call an election—which, in fact, is due next May.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-06-24,"—I rise today to speak on the Company Law Review Bill 1998 and welcome the government's following through on this process. Senator Ian Campbell and others have worked on this bill. There are a number of key areas, though, that I believe were identified in the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities which I would like to speak to. They revolved around the issues of corporate governance—
—Oh no!
—I am afraid so, Senator McGauran—corporate governance. Your side would not know a lot about that. There may be a few familiar names, friends of yours, who get a mention, so I am hoping that you are going to stay with me for this one.
This government prides itself on wanting to introduce world best practice everywhere—world best practice in the Public Service, world best practice on the waterfront, world best practice in our tax system. Today we have an opportunity to debate world best practice for corporate governance. Where does the government stand on this issue? It is refusing to accept all of our amendments. There is an opportunity to put world best practice in corporate governance into this legislation today. This really shows how hollow and how selective this government is when it wants to talk about world best practice. It is world best practice for unions and world best practice for the Public Service, but when it comes to world best practice for the conduct of corporate behaviour in this country, the government is missing in action. There is no show from this government. It straight away caves in to its mates in business. It is not prepared to discuss some quite 
 trivial issues—and they are quite trivial issues, as I will demonstrate in this debate.
Unfortunately, the ASX has been complicit in trying to avoid facing up to some of these issues. It does not want to include or support corporate governance. In fact, one official told me they thought corporate governance was just a current fad—that transparency in corporate behaviour was just a current fad. It would be gone in a few years, we were told. Unfortunately, issues like the disclosure of directors' fees and executive salaries are regarded as a current fads. Maybe it is something to do with the demutualisation of the ASX and the sudden massive increases in the remuneration packages that senior people at the ASX are going to receive now that it has been demutualised. Maybe this has been guiding their views on this current fad.
The adoption of shortened company annual reports and the 21-day notice of shareholders meetings are the sorts of issues which we have an opportunity today to insert into this bill. I would like to quote from the report, which makes reference to the views of the ASX. It says:
It is not possible to identify meaningful corporate governance practices and disclosure that can usefully be applied across the diversity of different company circumstances, and views of world best practice and international standards change over time. Proscription would restrict Australian companies ability to follow world best practice as it continues to evolve. And, at a more basic level, many of the measures proposed are of questionable relevance and value in the Australian context, especially when the costs that they impose are considered.
Humbug. Here is the ASX leading the charge to oppose transparency in corporate behaviour in its own markets. It is very disappointing to find that view coming from the ASX, with its key role in monitoring a lot of the shonky behaviour that goes on in the corporate world. It is usually the first port of call to detect fraudulent white-collar behaviour. But when it comes to some simple issues, it is standing in the way of genuine transparency and reform.
The committee was presented with IFSA's view. It said:
IFSA, in common with its predecessor body, AIMA, is firmly of the view that monitoring practices alone are insufficient to promote improvements in Australia's corporate governance environment or to bring Australia into line with the growing international consensus on what constitutes best practice in this important area. Government has a critical role to play in promoting the principle of disclosure as the key mechanism for ensuring accountability by companies and in equipping shareholders with the practical tools they need to fulfil their monitoring and review functions. IFSA is of the view that the Company Law Review Bill 1997 does not adequately address these important corporate governance matters and asks that the PJC recommend that the bill be amended to include the above requirements.
The key here is not what is in the best interests of the directors of companies; it is what is in the best interests of shareholders, so that shareholders are adequately informed to make judgments about the performance of its directors. The directors are the employees; the shareholders are the owners. These amendments are about empowering shareholders. It may be that it is empowering them at the expense of directors, but is that such a bad thing? I say no. This is a chance to empower shareholders.
The first of the amendments to be moved by the Labor Party, and which are supported by the Democrats and, I believe, the Greens and, hopefully, Senator Harradine, are to do with a general management discussion and analysis. It is a one page document to be included in information which gives a general overview of how the directors see the future strategy of the company. One page in regular reports is not a really onerous requirement. We have seen opposition. This is a provision that simply requires narrative information on financial statements. That is all. It is not hard to prepare. If you were in America, it would be a requirement. You have to provide that sort of information. But, disappointingly, this government is choosing to oppose this. I understand, following pressure from the opposition, that the ASX is moving, hopefully, to implement this in its listing rules.
—It has moved.
—The ASX has only moved because of the pressure of these potential amendments. It has only moved 
 because there is pressure on in the parliament to gain this information for shareholders. It should be welcomed that the ASX is moving, but what should not be welcomed is its opposition to having this included in legislation. But it is a positive development by the ASX.
Let me refer to a quote that was given to the committee by the government:
While the government believes that proper reporting to members is an important responsibility for companies, it considers that the approach proposed by the committee is not appropriate at the present time. In particular, it considers that the provision of a management discussion analysis to members should be a matter for companies to decide.
Directors should be able to decide the information given to their shareholders, not the other way around. Yet the shareholders are the ones who should make these decisions. The shareholders should be given this information so they can judge the performance of the directors, not the other way around. Directors should not be able to not provide information or decide whether to give information or not; it should be given so that the shareholders are in a position to make the judgments. The Securities Institute had a say on this issue as well. They said it was `contrary to international trends set by major capital markets such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and leaves Australian users of annual company reporting at a disadvantage.' That is the Securities Institute—another bolshie organisation, another pack of `Trots' running loose on the corporate scene.
—Unequivocally backed the ASX doing it.
—We support the ASX moving in that direction, but we are not trying to pretend that this only happened all of a sudden because of the ASX, which has opposed corporate governance—you missed my earlier remarks, Senator Campbell. Corporate governance is a fad, according to the ASX. I have been told that personally. They oppose corporate governance as just a fad.
The ASX have been under pressure to move in this direction: pressure not generated by the government but pressure generated at the 
 grassroots by shareholders, by institutions and by this opposition. They have not caved in because they thought it was a good idea that you suggested it to them; they have been forced to move by the pressure in the business community from institutional investors and from this opposition and minor parties.
The second amendment which the government is opposing is to do with the notice of meetings. This is a small issue and we are only talking about the difference between 21 days and 28 days. What we have seen is the institutional investors in this country, who are managing the majority of the funds nowadays, saying, `We have a situation where we require a bit more information and a bit more time to make a judgment when we are notified about the issues that are up before us.' In particular, that applies to overseas investors. Despite technology, overseas investors and institutional investors are saying, `We would like 28 days.' That is the position. This government have been prepared to do the bidding on MIB of institutions in the big end of town, but when the institutional investors turn around and say, `We really would appreciate a bit more time to make our judgments about the issues that are going to be up,' and it is only 28 days—or seven days more than proposed—what do the government say? No. That is disappointing.
Probably the most important, in my view, of the amendments we are proposing is the question of disclosure of director and senior executive salaries. Again, the ASX get trotted out. Again, they oppose. Here is what Mr Crosby, who made a submission, said:
The question is: what is the benefit? Is it information that is actually of use to investors and creditors of companies, which is what annual reports are about? We really question at the margin from what we have now, which is banded disclosure, detailed disclosure of allotments of securities and other incentive arrangements to directors, whether there is value being added for investors in requiring detailed disclosure. We just do not think the case is made, so we do not support a requirement to have line by line disclosure of directors' remuneration.
What a travesty from the ASX. As I said earlier, maybe it is just because they are about to get an increase for senior officials at the 
 ASX in their own remuneration and their own packages. Maybe that is what is driving this. It is very disappointing to see the ASX taking this view. IFSA stated:
Disclosure of the quantum and components of the remuneration of each director of the company and each of its five highest paid executives, including the existence and length of any service contract for the CEO, is necessary.
The Institution of Investors are saying, `We want to know,' and this government are saying, `No, it is no-one's business.' ASX are saying, `We do not believe there is any need. There is no value in knowing that.' What have you got overseas? You have requirements along these lines overseas. The Australian markets are going to be less informed. Australian shareholders are going to be less informed than are their international counterparts. This government has a chance to say, `Let us make Australian shareholders equally as well informed as overseas shareholders.'
Mr Matheson, who is the Governor of the International Corporate Governance Network, said before the committee:
The last point is in relation to remuneration disclosure. I know that the committee recommended positively in this regard in its report on the bill and that the government did not accept that recommendation. Many members of the International Corporate Governance Network have expressed dismay both to me and to the government that this particular proposal was not picked up. I would like to remind the committee that, from an investor's point of view, the disclosure of remuneration details is not a voyeuristic sort of exercise. It is purely that in this country shareholders are required to vote on resolutions for the granting of options and also to approve the increases in the aggregate level of remuneration to non-executive directors.
Shareholders in this country are being asked to vote on these two remuneration related matters in the absence of complete information.
They are being asked to vote without knowing all the facts. And who is withholding these facts? The directors who are asking for the extra remuneration. Mr Matheson further says:
I would also say to the committee that, perhaps, what parliamentarians—dare I say it—company executives and directors are being paid in many forms these days, not just in salary but in other ways like options, bonuses, long-term incentive schemes, et cetera. The reality is that some of these 
 option schemes can add, for example, between five and 150 per cent onto the reported value of remuneration as reported in the bands in the annual report.
The current system does not give full information to shareholders. Mr Matheson goes on:
I believe that the remuneration disclosure and the failure of the bill to pick up on the committee's recommendation has led to much dismay in the investment community. I think it would relieve a lot of companies of a lot of agro that occurs at their annual general meetings particularly by small investors who take exception to the granting of hundreds of thousands of options, in some cases, where they are being asked to do so on the basis of incomplete information. If shareholders are being asked to make an informed determination about whether they should approve a scheme or not, then I would suggest that they are being asked to do so currently on the basis of very incomplete information.
This is damning of this government. This is damning because it is seeking to assist in withholding from shareholders information about their directors' remuneration packages. This is an embarrassment internationally. `Dismay' was the word used—not by the Labor Party, not by the wharfies, not by the Democrats but by the International Corporate Governance Network. These are institutional shareholders. These are people all around the world who believe that what is most important is transparency, accountability and disclosure within corporations, so that you do not get the shonky behaviours of the Bonds and the Skases and so that people would know how much Alan Bond was getting paid and how much Chris Skase was getting paid and whether or not they were fair returns for the values that were being added.
We have seen some enormous remuneration packages recently. The boss of AMP has picked up a motser in the float of AMP, yet shareholders in the new AMP are not going to be able to find out exactly how much he has made out of the float compared with themselves. They are not going to be able to find out about this.
In my remaining few minutes I would like to finish off by quoting another socialist organisation that has been calling for the sort of amendments that we have been talking about. It is a well known, clearly Labor 
 orientated organisation. I refer to a editorial in the Australian Financial Review under the heading `Corporate oligarchy'. The editorial states:
But in reality the corporate market-place will not work efficiently until the shareholder class becomes better organised to discipline the clubby world of Australian boardrooms. Unfortunately, the boards too often act to disempower shareholders.
This is the Australian Financial Review 's editorial. This is not a meeting of the International Socialists. This is not the Labor Party talking. This is the editorial of the Australian Financial Review  talking about the `clubby world of Australian boardrooms'—and it would know. It goes on:
For instance, evidence presented to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities shows that about half the companies approached recently to reveal their proxy voting results at annual meetings refused to supply the information.
This is another issue that I will speak about a little later in the committee stage. On the proxy voting situation, it says:
Proxy votes are merely those cast, in advance, by shareholders who do not attend the annual meeting. The disclosure sought was not an individual breakdown of which shareholders voted on which measures (although that information is available to the companies)—
so the directors know how individual shareholders vote, but that is not what the requirement is; we just want to know the total outcome of those votes—
simply the total proxy vote ""for"", ""against"", or ""open"" to the chairman's discretion.
The Australian Financial Review  goes on a little later in its editorial to say:
It is known that the secretaries of certain Melbourne companies, not necessarily including BHP, meet on a regular basis to discuss how they will deal with this type of issue.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Shareholders should know when some directors are re-elected by a whopping margin of support, and also if other bits of deadwood float in a tide of proxy votes, some of which have been sent in blank to be cast as the chairman decides. 

The Australian Financial Review  goes on to say:
If a trade union—say, the Maritime Union of Australia—tried to run an election like this, its officials could face—
gaol. That is exactly right. If a trade union tried to conduct itself—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-06-24,"—The Company Law Review Bill 1997  is a bill central to the way in which we run our society, and I think that has to be remembered. As the parliamentary secretary said during the debate on the last bill, the Managed Investments Bill 1997 , the issue of corporations and the way that we run the financial affairs of the nation is based on issues of philosophy, not simply matters of economy. No doubt, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, given your many years of experience in this area, you would agree with that.
The central factor about corporate life is this: you have a vast amount of money contributed by shareholders which is in the charge of a confined number of people, the directors and the managers, who may not own much of the company at all. In other words, you have vast resources in the charge of people who do not, in fact, own those resources. It is that concept that lies behind the laws that are made in this area because those who are managers of the company and those who are directors of the company—those people who have control of the company—are not people who own most of the company. That, of course, creates the need to arrange proper rules and regulations so that the people who own the assets have a fair deal from those who control them.
It has been said somewhere that corporate life is very much like a communist state in that an oligarchy, a small group of people, controls the assets of a vast number of other people. Corporation law is about trying to adjust that on a fair basis. You have had—as you no doubt could speak eloquently on, Mr Acting Deputy President—this struggle between the black letter law and the fuzzy law when disasters happen, as they did during the 1980s and 1890s in Australia. When you have terrible collapses and people stripped of 
 their wealth, you have a rush to black letter law. As time goes by and people feel the particular crisis has been met, you have the tendency to go off to the fuzzy law situation. That is what has happened in this particular situation and it is manifest in the bill we are discussing.
I would like to quote from the second reading speech and show some concern about the basis of the bill or, as the parliamentary secretary says, the different philosophies in the debate on this bill. I listened carefully to the debate on the last bill, and the parliamentary secretary was very conscious of this conflicting philosophy—properly so because that is what it is all about. In that part of the second reading speech dealing with the history of the bill, this is said:
While accurate and informative reporting to shareholders is essential to maintaining investor confidence, the detail of reporting requirements should usually be left to best practice in corporate governance, rather than through detailed black-letter law. The government considers that companies should be free to decide for themselves whether they should be preparing management discussion and analysis for shareholders, instead of being compelled to do so by law.
That shows confidence in the ability of market forces—the forces for efficiency and competition—to make managers and directors act as they should. History has shown that that confidence has often been betrayed.
We should look at this whole area in terms of the social and political effect that Corporation Law has. One of the great classic cases in the history of the development of company law is Foss v Harbottle. The corporation dealt with in that case was not a big company by today's standards but a private company where the actual shareholders were very much in charge of the management of the company. The court had this to say:
Corporations like this, of a private nature, are in truth little more than private partnerships; and in cases which may easily be suggested it would be too much to hold that a society of private persons associated together in undertakings, which though certainly beneficial to the public, are nevertheless matters of private property, are to be deprived of their civil rights, inter se , because, in order to make their common objects more attainable, the Crown 
 or the Legislature may have conferred upon them the benefit of a corporate character.
The phrase I want to take from that is `of their civil rights'. This is a case that was decided in March of 1843, so it has a long history. Even at that time the courts were talking in terms of the civil rights of the shareholders—those in the company. So that concept has always been there: companies and corporations are more than a vehicle for economic activity; they have at their base other consequences which we should look at.
In the Foss and Harbottle case the court also said:
But, on the other hand, it must not be without reasons of a very urgent character that established rules of law and practice are to be departed from, rules which, though in a sense technical, are founded on general principles of justice and convenience; and the question is whether a case is stated in this bill entitling the Plaintiffs to sue in their private characters.
Again this concept of justice and convenience comes through, and that has been carried through up to modern times. Indeed, the development of the law in Australia has, as elsewhere, been very much affected by whether or not there has been a crisis in company law and people have lost money and companies have collapsed, or whether things have gone reasonably well.
My own state of Victoria has had a very significant part to play in the history of company law. It was in Victoria that the no liability company was developed in 1871 to accommodate the mining industry. That was when things were going well, but Victoria was the place where, during the 1890s, provisions were brought in requiring annual general reporting and proper accounting to look after the shareholders and those who had an interest in the company. During the 1890s when that was brought in there was terrible crisis and a collapse in the corporate world.
The United States of America is the classic example of where corporate life is fundamental to the way society runs. Corporations in America have a very powerful impact. It was in that context that Berle and Means in 1932—well before anybody in this room was born; not by much, if you look at me—produced the classic work on corporations 
 called The modern corporation and private property. They had this to say, and it is interesting following on from my remarks about Foss and Harbottle:
The typical business unit of the 19th century was owned by individuals or small groups; was managed by them or their appointees; and was, in the main, limited in size by the personal wealth of the individuals in control.
So you had the ownership and the control of the companies in the one hand—the point I was making before. They go on to say later in the book:
Then, the modern corporation, equally revolutionary in its effect, placed the wealth of innumerable individuals under the same central control.
It was in that context where you had division between ownership and control that he wrote this great work. There are two other quotes I want to read from Berle and Means, then I want to come to something closer to the present day. They said:
The corporation has, in fact, become both a method of property tenure and a means of organizing economic life. Grown to tremendous proportions, there may be said to have evolved a ""corporate system""—as there was once a feudal system—which has attracted to itself a combination of attributes and powers, and has attained a degree of prominence entitling it to be dealt with as a major social institution.
They made some additions to the 1932 version and published them in 1967. In the updated thoughts in December 1967 they had this to say:
We are well underway toward recognition that property used in production must conform to conceptions of civilization worked out through democratic processes of American constitutional government. Few American enterprises, and no large corporations, can take the view that their plants, tools and organizations are their own, and that they can do what they please with their own. There is increasing recognition of the fact that collective operations, and those predominantly conducted by large corporations, are like operations carried on by the state itself. Corporations are essentially political constructs.
They go on to say later:
Philosophical preoccupation will become more important than economic. What is this personal life, this individuality, this search for personal development and fulfilment intended to achieve? Mere wallowing in consumption would leave great 
 numbers of people unsatisfied; their demand will be for participation. This means, in substance, a growing demand that significant jobs be available for everyone, at a time when automation may diminish the number of all commercially created jobs as we presently know them. It may well mean that the state would be expected to create jobs wherever a social need is recognized, irrespective of the classic requirement for a commercial base.
What is being said about this strand through the history of company law is that corporations like individual people have obligations to the state and cannot be seen simply as economic vehicles; they have a communal responsibility to everybody within society. The amendments that we are dealing with today recognise that in proposed chapter 2B, basic features of a company. We will come to this in the committee stage of the bill, but proposed subsection 124(1) says:
A company has the legal capacity and powers of an individual both in and outside this jurisdiction.
Then it goes on to talk about company powers. Proposed subsection 124(2) says:
A company's legal capacity to do something is not affected by the fact that the company's interests are not, or would not be, served by doing it.
I think that is a very important part of this bill. I think it is a bill that is in line with the sorts of things I have been talking about so far. It does realise that it is not just simply economic advancement that counts but that there are other obligations that companies have.
I would like to mention some of the people who need to be remembered in this context. No doubt senators would remember the former member for Hawker in South Australia Ralph Jacobi, who made some great speeches about company law before the history of the 1980s and 1990s had occurred. I recommend to people interested in this area that they read two of his speeches—one on 12 May 1981, which is in the House of Representatives Hansard at page 2271; and another one on 27 October 1982 at page 2632—where he anticipated the disasters of the 1980s—and I think he was a lonely voice in doing so.
I would also like to mention in this context that Mr Michael Duffy, the Attorney-General 
 as he then was, did a lot of work in this area. His was to a large extent the black-letter law approach. I think myself that that is probably the proper approach still. It was the work that he did, together with others, of course, that led to the Corporations Law as we now know it.
May I also mention another work, the directors' duties paper No. 395 of 1989, which goes into the issue of directors' duties. That was a product of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and, declaring an interest, I was then chair of that committee. I want to finish on this topic, but in the end it said that what you need in corporate life is to create a climate, a culture, where honesty and where dedication to others are the norm.
It would be a tragedy if the bill which is before us now was presented in such a way that it dealt only with the concept that corporations are an economic vehicle to increase wealth. Of course corporations are economic vehicles to create wealth. Of course we need a decent standard of living for everyone in Australia, and corporations are a central means of doing that. But they can do a lot more than that. They must be seen as groups, as bodies, as institutions that have an obligation at not only an economic level but also a social and, indeed, political level. They are citizens, like the rest of us are citizens. They have the rights of citizens, but they also have the obligations of citizens. There has to be a climate created so that corporations see that, understand that and act accordingly. If they do not, then we must have black-letter law, which is a shame. Nevertheless, people should understand where corporations should come from and we ought to make sure that they do.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—In summing up this second reading debate on the Company Law Review Bill 1997, I first want to thank those senators who took a close interest in the development of the bill and those senators who contributed to the debate in the chamber over the past couple of hours.
I particularly thank Senator Barney Cooney, who has had a very close interest in corpora 
 tions issues both before his time as Chairman of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and of course throughout that time. Senator Cooney will be very pleased to see the next Corporations Law economic reform bill, the Corporations Law Amendment (ASX) Bill 1997, which we expect will come into this place in the next couple of days, because it picks up one of the recommendations of that 1989 report in relation to the business judgment rule which he has been a champion of for many years.
Senator Cooney, we note your reference to that seminal work, judicial work, in Foss and Harbottle. The bill also picks up a policy idea which, for the first time in Australian law—if it passes the Senate and passes the parliament—places the entrenchment of a statutory right of action for shareholders, known in the trade as a statutory derivative right of action. In many respects, it supplants Foss and Harbottle.
I might say that the Attorney-General of Western Australia, who feels he has an umbilical relationship or at least a sibling relationship, in some respects, with Foss and Harbottle, is a little bit upset that Foss and Harbottle will become less important in Australian law once the statutory derivative right of action that this government seeks to give to shareholders to enforce their rights against directors who do not take action on behalf of companies is enacted for the first time in Australian history.
Senator Cooney, your contribution to debate on the Corporations Law over the decades has been a very positive and constructive one. Of course, your speech here today is just another chapter in that contribution. I want to respond to some of the key points that have been made during the debate but, prior to doing that, I suggest that Senator Cooney's speech was very similar to the other speeches in this debate in that they did not talk about the bill; they talked about one or two submissions to the first joint parliamentary inquiry—`first' because this one has been to the committee twice—to do with corporate governance issues.
As I said in opening my remarks, Senator Cooney, your comments on corporate govern 
 ance and directors' duties and your contribution to that debate through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee are well known. Out of the consultations that you did in 1989, out of the consultations that were done by the joint parliamentary committee in the early 1990s when I was the deputy chair of that committee, and out of the consultations I have done on corporate law economic law reform, the government has actually picked and put into the statute a business judgment rule. Senator Cooney knows better than anyone else in this place how hard it is to frame a business judgment rule that people are happy with. I have crossed my fingers and crossed my arms behind my back and think we have actually got a set of words and the construction of a business judgment rule in Australia that, for the first time, has support—dare I use the old Bob Hawkeism: a consensus.
That highlights the point that I have been making in private correspondence and in public comments about dealing with corporate governance issues in the way that the opposition and the Democrats—both very well-intentioned—supported, by tagging them on and making this an omnibus corporations bill. This bill was a piece of work created by the simplification task force under then Attorney-General Lavarch. It sought to look at the core company provisions. Its intention was to streamline the application process to establish a company. It does that by putting together into one form, a single form, the requirements for registering a company. There are massive savings in paperwork to companies across Australia. It massively reduces the cost of registering a company, for the approximately 80,000 new companies a year registered in Australia.
It also facilitates the use of electronic means of transmission for meetings and for communications with shareholders. It reduces the need for formal company meetings. It says that, where there is unanimity amongst directors and they have signed off on a bit of paper to say that they are unanimous, they do not need to go through the procedure of calling a meeting; something that those of us who have been company directors know will 
 save a lot of time and headache. When there is a matter that is unanimous, why is it necessary to get everyone to put down what they are doing, come together to pass a resolution and then go away again?
It abolishes the par value of shares. It reduces the need for shareholder approval in relation to financial assistance transactions. It reduces the costs in relation to annual reports. It extends from 14 days to 21 days the notice period for shareholder meetings. There is a range of other mechanical improvements to the way companies in Australia operate.
A number of people have tried to use this as an omnibus bill to put all these directors' duties and corporate governance matters into a bill that was not designed to do so. The government recognises the importance of the consideration of directors' duties and corporate governance. It picked up the work of Senator Cooney's committee on these issues in the late 1980s and the work of the joint parliamentary committee in the early 1990s on the same issues, and picked up a public demand for focusing on directors' duties and corporate governance. We have dealt with that as one of the largest and biggest chapters in the corporate law economic reform program which is recognised by people such as Bob Baxt and Bill Beerworth, and most commentators on corporate law reform, as the single most thorough reform of company law policy in the history of companies in Australia.
Within the six chapters of the corporate law economic reform program we have significant reforms encompassed in a specific piece of legislation designed to deal with directors' duties and corporate governance. That legislation has been referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities. All of the proposals that the government has in regard to directors' duties and corporate governance have been referred to that committee.
I have said to the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats that if they want organisations to make submissions in relation to the issues that are the bulk of the amendments we will be faced with shortly in the committee stage, then the appropriate legislative process is to allow industry, share 
 holder groups, consumer groups, directors, institutions, corporate lawyers, accountants and other advisers to make submissions on these proposals and have any of these amendments dealt with after that public consultation.
Within the proposals on corporate governance that have been tacked onto this bill there are a number of matters that have been given that consideration. The MD&A proposal has been given that consideration by the joint committee and has been discussed at length amongst experts in this field.
The issue of the notice periods for meetings has again had long discussion and it is really just a decision between 14, 21 or 28 days, and a couple of the other proposals. Many of them have not been given that sort of rigorous analysis, which all of the corporate law proposals that this government has dealt with have been put through. They have been brought in here and clearly have not been given the opportunity for detailed consideration.
That is not to say that no-one has the right to do that. They do, but I am suggesting that, when we have a bill that specifically deals with corporate governance issues, we should seek to amend that bill rather than tacking them on and making this into an omnibus bill. You would obviously have to wait a few weeks to do that.
Those calls have gone unheeded. We had a speech from Senator Conroy saying that the government does not care about corporate governance and management discussion analysis; that we are opposed to it and that we are opposed to directors' remuneration disclosure. That is patently absurd and patently incorrect and significantly misleading.
—Let's vote to mandate them.
—Senator Conroy interjects and says, `Let's vote to mandate them.' This draws the distinction of the approach of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. That is, if you want to prove that you are serious about something, you come to Canberra, pass a law and impose it on every single person in Australia. That proves you are serious about 
 it. Regardless of the fact that that has proved in jurisdictions around the world to be an ineffective way to create an improvement in corporate governance, that is the Labor Party way—Canberra knows best on corporate governance.
—And the Fin Review's view!
—Allow me to be partisan in these matters for a minute, Mr Acting Deputy President, because Senator Conroy wants to make this a politically partisan debate. This is the Australian Labor Party that produced Joan Kirner; this is the Australian Labor Party that produced Brian Burke; this is the Australian Labor Party that produced the Bank of South Australia; this is the Australian Labor Party that produced the famous gold tax lunch; and they are saying that the Australian Labor Party knows best on corporate governance!
This is the Australian Labor Party that sunk $12.2 billion worth of Australian taxpayers' money down the drain every year, year after year for 10 years; and this is the Australian Labor Party whose concept of corporate governance and financial management was to run interest rates up to 30 per cent. When the Australian Labor Party talks about corporate governance and says, `Canberra knows best,' I say to the shareholders of Australia, `Beware when the Australian Labor Party says Canberra knows best.' There are far better experts on matters of corporate governance than the Australian Labor Party, which is saying, `You govern companies well when you do it the way Canberra tells you to do it; when you do it the way the Australian Labor Party tells you to do it.'
There are experts, and I refer to an article by Paul Murnane in the Business Review Weekly of 27 April last. Mr Murnane is from Russell Reynolds in Australia and he has done a comparative analysis of corporate governance in Great Britain, the United States, Europe and France. I will quote from that article because it is instructive:
The Australian Labor Party says Australian corporate governance is in tatters and that Canberra has to come in and tell us how to govern our companies.  

He is saying it is a mess and we have to step in, even though all of the people who support MD&A, including the government, say the best way to do it is through a flexible, market oriented approach promoting best practice through the existing rules. The Labor Party says, `No, that is not good enough. We are going to tell you how to do it. We are going to put it in black letter law, write a few more pages of law and tell every reporting entity that they must do an MD&A because the Labor Party in Canberra knows best.' If you tick that box, it will be good corporate governance, according to the ALP.
Russell Reynolds in Australia put it slightly differently. They say that the standard of corporate governance in Australia compares well with other countries. Mr Murnane goes on to say it is a fact that:
. . . most companies have complied with high standards. All around the world you are seeing a strong push towards the Anglo-American style of governance.
Australia has a more aggressive stance on governance than other countries. Australia has had non-executive chairmen forever, whereas the US is only just discovering it. We have got a fairly smallish market so you don't get the chance to do the `Wall Street walk' . . . Institutional investors in Australia have set high standards for corporate governance.
He makes another point about corporate governance. He further states:
Corporate governance initiatives are distinct from legislation in that they are designed to assure investors that the necessary conditions of trust are in place.
In other words, the debate on corporate governance should be about promoting best practice, not imposing it from the cold hand of Canberra and central governments. Senator Conroy interjected by saying, `Let's do what the US does.' What does the US do in relation to remuneration, management discussion and analysis? Senator Conroy is a bit like the Leader of the Opposition in the other place; he knows everything. He is omni-intelligent. He is the font of almost all wisdom on every issue. So what happens with MD&A in America? He wants to impose it by a law through Canberra saying, `Everyone is going to have an MD&A, regardless of whether it 
 makes you a better corporate governor or not.' According to the Australian Labor Party, through the wise mouth of Senator Conroy opposite, that is going to make you a good corporate governor.
What happens in the United States is that it is done through the listing rules of the SEC. What do we want in Australia? We want to do it through the listing rules of the Australian Stock Exchange? Who wants to do it through the listing rules of the Australian Stock Exchange? Senator Conroy mentioned the Securities Institute of Australia, which he says is opposed to the coalition's stance on management discussion and analysis. This is indicative of the entire debate. Labor wants to put it in black-letter law, impose it from Canberra and not allow a dynamic corporate governance culture to develop in Australia. They want to do it from Canberra. In fact, you have to do it from Canberra, not because we, the industry, shareholders or consumers think it is a good idea but because a fund manager from Florida says that it is a good idea—corporate governance international. We are going to be told what to do not by Australians and Australian shareholders but by people in Europe and New York.
One of the amendments states that we have to force companies to do what the SEC or Brussels tells us to do, not what we decide in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or Perth or Adelaide or Hobart. We have to do what Brussels or New York tell us to do. Talk about throwing away sovereignty! Let us not go down to see the ASX or the SFE; let us go to New York and do what Arthur Leavitt tells us to do. I would like to keep control of what companies in Australia are required to report. The Securities Institute of Australia agree with this. Let me quote from a letter dated 29 May signed by John Jarrett, the National Policy Manager of the SIA:
The Securities Institute of Australia has long been in support of the requirement for listed companies to report to their shareholders, an MD&A requirement. We are satisfied that the introduction of this requirement into the listing rules with your agreement will be an advance on current reporting requirements. With this in mind, if the listing rules provide for MD&A, we do not believe it is neces 
 sary at this stage to include it in a legislative requirement.
Who else agrees with us? Who was the person who proposed MD&A going into the law? It was AIMA. The people responsible at AIMA have endorsed the approach of the ASX—that is, do what they are doing in the United States: make it part of the listing rules. The Investment and Financial Services Association, which represents the big fund managers whom Senator Conroy quotes, says that it would be better if it were in the listing rules than in the black-letter law.
Finally, who else says that it should be in the listing rules and not the black-letter law? The Australian Shareholders Association says that it would be wrong to put it in the black-letter law if it can be done through listing rules. So you have every single organisation saying that it is better to do it through the ASX listing rules, but the ALP and the Democrats know better. They say, no, if you want good corporate governance, you have to do all these things in the black-letter law. That is what this debate has come down to. The government believes that almost every single organisation is saying, `No, do not put it in the black-letter law,' and most organisations are saying, `Let's have a debate about corporate governance under the corporate governance bill. Let's not slow up the progress of sound reforms in CLRB by having the debate today, let's do it after proper consultation.' But the Australian Labor Party know better. They say we have to do all these things because we want to beat up about directors' remuneration.
There is nothing wrong with a legal requirement to report directors' remuneration. There is one in the law already. What we are talking about is increasing it. It may well be that that is a very good idea, but we want to allow the interested parties—the stakeholders—to have a say in how you do it. Labor and the Democrats will not allow it to go to the committee. They will not even allow Australian shareholders to have a say on it. They know best; Canberra knows best. Impose it on everyone else.
I turn to the final support. As mentioned by Senator Margetts yesterday in another debate, 
 the OECD did a report on corporate governance in Australia and absolutely, uncategorically endorsed the government's approach, saying that it is better to encourage a dynamic corporate governance culture than to impose prescription. I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-06-24,"—Today I want to outline how, 
 through a national network of second ministerial media officers and support staff, the Howard government has established a nationwide media monitoring network.
From the outset I wish to make it clear that we have always taken the view that the discretion for allocating personal staff and their responsibilities lies with the government of the day. Provided the agreed ratio of government to opposition staff is maintained, we accept that government staffers can be tasked for a wide variety of responsibilities. What we object to in relation to the government's second media offices is the dishonest, shady and secretive manner in which the government established and maintained them. What we object to is the cant and hypocrisy of coalition frontbenchers who had so much to say about the National Media Liaison Service and the Ministerial Media Group when we were in government but who now sit silently at the table during Senate estimates, refusing to admit what the rest of the country now knows: that the Howard government, from the moment it was elected to office, established a nationwide media monitoring unit; that this unit was established in secrecy, in many cases funded unknowingly by the home departments of junior ministers allocated second media officers; that this unit, although the government denies its existence, reports directly to the office of the Prime Minister and has recently been doubled in size, presumably in anticipation of an impending federal election; and that this unit monitors opposition spokespersons and state premiers around Australia and provides material directly to ministers and also directly to the Liberal Party in Menzies House—all at taxpayers' expense, without so much as an announcement or an appropriation that can be scrutinised by the parliament.
This government came to power promising leaner government. They boasted of reducing ministerial staff levels by 30 per cent. As an opposition, we copped the corresponding decrease in our own numbers sweet. As long as the ratio of government to opposition personal staff at 21 per cent was maintained, we would not have complained. However, what has really happened to government staffing levels 
 is that they have risen from 292 to 326.5—an increase of 34.5. Departmental liaison officers are now at a record level of 67. Consultants working directly for, chosen by and reporting to ministers have been charged to departments. The cases of Mr Mansfield, Dr Webster and Dr Davies are classic examples of this occurring.
Neither departmental liaison officers nor consultants are part of the government-opposition ratio, allowing the government to ratchet up their personal staffs without providing additional resources to the opposition. As well, the classification levels of many MOPS staff have been increased. The spirit of the agreement, which was supposed to maintain a nexus between government and opposition staff, has been broken by a government which promised loudly in opposition that things would be different. There is no better example of this sneaky, Nixonian sort of operation of the government than the establishment of their secret, nationwide media monitoring unit.
Labor abolished the government information unit when we came to office in 1983 because of concerns about the appropriateness of many of the roles that it attempted to simultaneously perform. Instead, we established the National Media Liaison Service and the Ministerial Media Group, with separate functions—aNiMaLS to disseminate information about government programs and policies, and the MMG to carry out more overtly political media tasks for ministers.
Whatever criticisms the then opposition may have had of our arrangements, they cannot deny that our media activities were established quite openly, with clear appropriations. They had published guidelines to govern their conduct. Indeed, senators Kemp and Abetz spent many hours in estimates questioning officials and ministers to satisfy themselves that these units functioned according to these guidelines. Nevertheless, this did not prevent the coalition promising that, when they came to power, things would be different. Total staff numbers would fall, government would be leaner and there would be no media monitoring or, as Senator Kemp labelled them `political hit squads financed by the taxpayer'. Indeed, Senator O'Chee stood in 
 this chamber, during a debate on the National Media Liaison Service, on 7 June 1995 and said:
. . . we would cut back on some of the government's taxpayer-funded self-promotion, because this money—and this is typical of Labor bureaucracies—which is detailed here, does not go to delivering a service; it goes to making the government look good.
Imagine our surprise when, upon the coalition coming to government, we chanced upon the appointment of the so-called `second media officers'. All coalition ministers—cabinet and outer ministry alike—were allocated one press secretary. And then six ministers, apparently randomly, were allocated a second—and most of them were junior ministers. In no instance could we establish what particular circumstances warranted a second media officer for Senator Vanstone, Mr Reith, Mr Williams, Mr Smith, Mr Ruddock and Mr Jull.
What about Mr Williams, for example? His duties were considered so light that he earns the dubious distinction of being one of the first attorneys since Federation not to sit in the cabinet. Yet the Prime Minister felt it necessary to approve a second media officer for him—and Mr Ruddock, Mr Smith and Mr Jull, all junior ministers at the time. Why? The opposition could well understand perhaps Senator Vanstone and Mr Reith requiring all of the extra media assistance that they could obtain, given their performance, but why, of all ministers, were these six allocated second media advisers?
It became obvious: one was in New South Wales, one in Victoria, one in Queensland, one in South Australia, one in Western Australia and one in Tasmania, each with a designated home base in the respective state capital city—no public announcement, no appropriation and no line item budget entry. Indeed, the only public announcement by any of the ministers of the appointment of any of these second media staff was a press release by Senator Vanstone. There was no suggestion that this staffer was to perform any role other than that ordinarily carried out by a minister's press officer acting at their direction as a member of the minister's personal staff.  
In fact, when the opposition first raised the issue, we were met with a wall of dishonesty. Senator Kemp, in fact, denied that these activities could in any way be equated with aNiMaLS. We know now that in the case of Senator Hill he actually misled the estimates committee on 22 October 1996 when he said quite specifically that the role of the second media officer in Mr Ruddock's office was `To work to, in that instance, Mr Ruddock, to carry on the usual functions of a media officer . . . ' Someone should have told Mark Elliot, Karim Barbara or Sarah Baxter of those facts about that position before Mr Ruddock employed them.
Gradually the truth began to dribble out. On the same day that Senator Hill gave his dishonest assurances that Mr Jull's second media adviser was `to enable Mr Jull to meet a broader requirement of communication within Queensland', Mr Jull was already beginning to fess up to the reality. He qualified Senator Hill's answer by stating:
. . . the entitlement of a second media officer is part of a strategy to provide additional media resources in each state to promote coordination of media relations.
Senator Parer went further during his memorable performance before the estimates committee. We were able to question him directly on 4 June on the circumstances surrounding the transfer of Mr Jull's second media officer to Senator Parer's office. Senator Parer's revelations clearly established that the role of the second media officers was related to the whole of government media monitoring on a state by state basis. But he insisted that the staffer involved—in this case a Mr Ryan—reported to and worked directly to him as a responsible minister.
We asked why. Senator Parer explained that Wik and Century Zinc were issues of particular concern to the people of Queensland and that they fell within his portfolio responsibilities. We know Senator Parer has always his partywide responsibilities extremely seriously. Not only was he able to provide a statewide media monitoring resource for the federal government financed by DAS and his home department, we have since learnt that he apparently provided the stationery resources 
 for the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party.
The opposition is not alone in its sense of paranoia about what this media monitoring unit might be up to. Apparently its activities extend to monitoring the statements of the troublesome and recalcitrant state premiers. In fact, we know that Mr Hanke, the second media adviser on Minister Reith's staff, got a cheerio from Mr Kennett on Neil Mitchell's radio program on 6 November 1997. But when raised in estimates on 12 November 1997, Senator Hill assured us:
We are not running a media monitoring operation of the type with which we are very familiar.
This brings us to Mr Mark Elliot and Miss Sarah Baxter. The memorandum prepared under the signature of Mark Elliot and obtained by the opposition contained absolute proof that the government is maintaining a taxpayer-funded, secret media monitoring unit in every state despite Senator Hill's denials.
The memorandum tells us that Senator Hill's explicit assurance that Mr Ruddock's second media officer works directly for his minister was not true, and that he misled the committee. The memorandum tells us that the baby aNiMaLS staff, in fact, report to the Prime Minister's office and the Liberal Party directly. The memorandum tells us that baby aNiMaLS staff are instructed to ignore requests to carry out work for their employing minister unless they have time. I have outlined in a media release some of the other aspects of this particular operation.
Where did the information go? To the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who employed these people? Of course not. The transcript went directly to the Prime Minister's office to Mr Tony O'Leary. A copy was sent to Mr Lynton Crosby at the Liberal Party federal secretariat.
Senator Kemp, when in opposition, called aNiMaLS a Labor Party rort and a political hit squad. Perhaps some of the people who made these statements will come into the chamber now and explain how Mr Elliot's role is consistent with the outrage that was expressed then. Perhaps Senator Abetz and Senator Hill will also explain their attitude to this situation now that they are in govern 
 ment—a very different attitude to the one they expressed in opposition.
We do not consider media monitoring outrageous but, like all taxpayer funded activity, it should be transparent and accountable. Baby aNiMaLS is not accountable; it has no guidelines; it is shrouded in secrecy and the costs are concealed dishonestly in home departments arbitrarily chosen for their geographical spread. This is something the coalition said it would not do in government. I intend at a later stage to speak at some length about the costs of the six media advisers, the six personal secretaries, that have now been engaged to double the unit resources of this secret media monitoring unit and about a range of other costs that are being borne by taxpayers in this.
We know now, of course, that the operations of the government members secretariat employ 11 full-time staffers. In the media monitoring unit there are an awful lot—24 full-time hacks in total—being employed to support the Liberal Party. These are taxpayer funded political operatives working on media monitoring and campaigning. They got a bagging in the Liberal Party party room yesterday and at the joint party meeting that Mr Howard had to front up to.
I seek leave to table some of the transcripts that give examples of the sort of material that is being provided by these units, one of which highlights John Laws's comment:
Incidentally, it's lucky one of John Howard's `S' words isn't sincerity. . .  cause we all remember and it is going to remain around to haunt him. . . in 1995 he said the GST would never, never be part of Liberal Policy.
These are good examples of what is being done by this sleazy, slimy, secret operation on behalf of the Liberal Party. I seek leave to table the material which I have shown to Senator Ian Campbell, for the government.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-24,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Will the minister confirm that the Japanese economy is officially in recession, with their economy having shrunk by 0.7 per cent at the end of March this year and with a forecast further contraction of 0.5 per cent in 1998? How does the minister reconcile the recession in Japan with the Howard government's forecasts for the Japanese economy—forecasts of 0.25 per cent growth this year and 1.25 per cent growth in 1999? Given that Japan accounts for 20 per cent of Australia's total exports, will the minister advise the Senate of the impact of the Japanese recession on Australian exports?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Japan: Economy </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-24,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Minister, for underlying the very serious situation in the Japanese economy, which goes to my point: in view of that very serious situation and the remarks being made by the Treasurer about it being `very serious,' do you now stand by the federal government's optimistic forecasts for a Japanese economic recovery? Those forecasts were: this year, 0.25 per cent growth; next year 1.25 per cent growth. Isn't it the case that the government has misunderstood in the budget the situation in Japan, casting serious doubt on the assumptions underlying the budget brought down by you last month?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Japan: Economy </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-06-24,"—Thank you, Senator Cook, for that important question. Many Australians are looking closely at the Japanese economy in the hope that the recovery program announced by the Japanese government will be effected and effective. Senator Cook, it is correct that economic activity in Japan remains weak. Domestic demand has been flat for the last 12 months. The contribu 
 tion to growth from net exports is weakening. Consumer and business confidence is low in Japan and this has been exacerbated by problems, which we have noted, in the financial sector. Growth through 1997 was largely supported by net exports but, in the face of the regional problems that we are all aware of, net exports weakened in the first quarter of 1998.
The overall outlook for the Japanese economy is for little or no growth in 1998, but activity is expected to pick up during the course of the year in response to substantial government investment spending. Let me make this clear: the Australian government supports the substantial policy measures announced on 24 April by the government of Japan, aimed at achieving a demand led growth. We also welcome the recent announcement by the Japanese government of its determination to restructure its troubled financial sector as a matter of the highest urgency. This was noted at the recent Manila  framework and the G7 deputies' meeting in Tokyo.
Structural reform, particularly of the financial sector, is essential to help establish, in our view, a sound basis for a recovery and a return to sustainable economic growth in Japan. It will be important for the Japanese government to find the proper balance between the short-term measures designed to stimulate domestic demand and employment measures that help advance structural reform.
In conclusion, Senator Cook may be aware of comments the Treasurer made recently about the economy in Japan. The Treasurer said that the situation in Japan today is very serious. He indicated that we had our officials in Tokyo on the weekend and we were one of the nations that put together a meeting between Asian nations, Australia, New Zealand and the G7 and they looked at the situation in Japan. As the Treasurer said, if the Japanese cannot fix their financial system there will be a serious threat to world growth. The Treasurer went on to say that the Japanese government has announced that it wants to deal with the problem and has set aside money to do so. What is required now, as the Treasurer said, 
 is the political will to come in and take the tough decisions. He concluded by saying:
But I must say it is very much in Australia's interests and the region's interests and the world's interests for decisive action in relation to the Japanese financial system.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Japan: Economy </title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

—Madam President, I raise a point of order. It is one thing to ask a question seeking factual information, but it is another thing altogether to colour it with a prejudgment which, on any view of the world, is not something that is accepted. It should not be part of the premise of a question. You should rule that part of it out of order.
—There is no point of order, Madam President. The senator is entitled to ask the question she  wants. It is up to the minister to say whether or not he is aware and whether or not he believes the government has been humiliated.
—On the point of order, Madam President: surely we have to listen to the question to determine whether or not the government is, or may possibly be, embarrassed. I ask that at least Senator Allison be allowed to ask the question before we turn to points of order.

Are you aware that UNESCO member countries are sending their top level world heritage team to investigate the cultural and environmental threats to Kakadu? Are you aware that the World Heritage Bureau has requested that all activities stop immediately until the inspection team has assessed the area?

I ask again: Minister, will you and Minister Hill then proclaim the surrounding Kakadu world heritage area to protect it for future generations of Australians? Also, you mentioned the conditions which apply to the Kakadu Jabiluka uranium mine, one of the most important of which was 
 the condition that there be a cultural management plan in place before construction of any mining operations. Why was this not done, and what other conditions have you conveniently overlooked?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Jabiluka Uranium Mine</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-06-24,"—My understanding is that the World Heritage Commission has spoken favourably about the way Australia handles its world heritage areas. I am a little surprised about the comment about humiliation because—
—You'd know all about that, Warwick!
—That is beneath you, Robert. What surprises me about the Democrats is that I thought their policy was to stop all uranium mining—the whole lot; Olympic Dam, Ranger and the development of Jabiluka.
—And to stop greenhouse at the same time.
—Yes. I think ex-senator Peter Walsh used to refer to the fairies at the bottom of the garden—and you have gone back to it.
What we have is a process in place whereby the ERA or the previous owner back in 1982 had agreements with the traditional owners to develop Jabiluka. This was transferred in about 1991, with the support of the Northern Land Council representing the traditional owners. When this government came into power, of course, it got rid of the ridiculous three-mine uranium policy—and I know that even Robert Ray agrees with me, because he told me one day when crossing the chamber when he was in government.
—What is the Labor Party's policy now?
—Good question, Senator Hill: what is the Labor Party's policy?
—You said you paid tax at the same time!
—When we removed the three-mine policy, this meant that companies were able to develop mines in accordance with strict environmental principles. The ERA company was designated by me as a proponent over two years ago, and it went through the environmental process. Agreed: there is a group up there, one of the traditional owner groups, that is opposed to the development of the mine. I might say that that was the group that supported it and agreed to it back in 1981 or 1982 and that was reinforced in 1991.
I would also point out that I know the opposition is coming from one particular group led by Ms Jackie Katona, who with Yvonne Margarula came to see me. I made the point very clearly that, if Jackie Katona was thinking of the Aborigines, I thought it was in their best interests to maximise the environmental, the economic and the social returns to the Aborigines.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Jabiluka Uranium Mine</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1998-06-24,"—Senator Allison, who belongs to a party that talked about keeping everyone honest, came into an estimates committee and made an outrageous claim about me in regard to mining the Barrier Reef. When I asked her, she said that she had it on good authority and was not going to dob anyone in.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my right will cease making so much noise.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order as to relevance. I did not ask a question about the Great Barrier Reef; it was about the Kakadu National Park and the Jabiluka uranium mine.
—I remind the senator of the supplementary question.
—Let me make the point again—and everyone knows this or should know it, although the Democrats would like to convince them otherwise: neither Jabiluka nor Ranger are within the Kakadu National Park. So let us make that very clear.
I saw the article in the paper in regard to the heritage management plan. It was based on the failure, I might say, of the journalist to find out the actual conditions imposed on ERA by me. The environmental requirements require the carrying out of an archaeological survey on each area to be affected by the construction before construction work commences in that area. The six-monthly report advised that ERA had appointed an environmental officer as required by ER3.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1998-06-24,"—On 28 May I gave an answer to Senator McKiernan in relation to Jobs Network in Western Australia. There is a slight amendment which I table and which I seek leave to incorporate.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I refer to Senator McKiernan's question without notice on 28 May 1998 which related to employment assistance with Jobs Network in Western Australia. During the course of my answer, I referred to an interjection by Senator Evans in relation to these services as they applied to Karratha. I stated that there had not been any tenders received from Karratha.
I have since been advised that there were no successful tenders for the provision of Flex 1, 2 and 3 services in Karratha. There was however a successful tender from the WA Chamber of Commerce for a New Apprenticeship Centre in Karratha.

(11)	 Schedule 1, item 4, page 84 (line 4), omit ""21"", substitute ""28"".
This amendment relates to whether the notice of meetings should be 21 days or 28 days. We commend the government's decision to increase it from 14 to 21; now the battle is whether it should be 28.
There has been a long battle between those with a managerial philosophy who want decision making facilitated and those with a shareholder perspective who want time to consider the impact of board and management recommendations. Quite frankly, there are arguments on both sides, as the parliamentary secretary knows well.
As a general rule, one would expect that, in any conflict between the two, it is investors and owners whose views should carry greater weight. The majority report summarised the arguments concerning section 249HL of the bill, which raised the required notice to be given for meetings from 14 to 21 days. The joint committee had previously recommended 28 days, which is an important point to note. Shareholder and investor groups continue to support the 28 days approach and the Australian Democrats see no reason to vary their support for 28 days.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—I think Senator Murray is quite right: there is a debate about this matter. When I first had to turn my mind to it, I had a number of conflicting views put to me. Some managers and directors are not overly opposed to 28 days because there are benefits in some respects. But a number of shareholders and shareholder groups are opposed to 28 days if they are trying to take 
 action against a company and against directors and are trying to get something resolved. For example, if control of a company has passed and a group of dissident directors are quickly trying to organise an extraordinary general meeting, they want to move quickly. I know that, even under the current law, some groups of directors who have approached me believe that it is very hard to take action against directors who they believe are acting against the interests of shareholders.
So if shareholders who believe that directors are acting against the interests of the company want to call an extraordinary general meeting, they have to go through the process of getting together enough minority shareholders to petition for an extraordinary general meeting and then have to wait 14 days. I think it is 14 days, but for the sake of the argument it does not really matter. The argument is that this is not a provision that is protecting directors from a meeting and that shorter periods are better for directors. Shorter periods are, for many minority shareholders, not a bad idea. They allow them to take action and get that action.
I know that Senator Murray and people like Shann Turnbull—who try to promote shareholder activism, as I and the government do—would see that having to wait 28 days to have an extraordinary general meeting because of this new notice provision would be an eternity. I would like to put to bed the argument that having long notice periods is pro-shareholders and directors are opposed to it because it hurts them. Long notice periods can be quite harmful to shareholders trying to take action.
The main source of support for 28 days is actually international funds. The push comes from people in Florida, and I am not saying this in a derogatory, xenophobic way. It comes from large international fund managers who would prefer to have 28 days because they are further away. I have put it to them—my friends from Florida, San Francisco and other places—that, with modern telecommunications and with the facilitation of electronic commerce that is in this bill and in the CLERP bills, the requirement for it is reducing as time goes by; it is not increasing.
As with a number of these other matters, this does deserve further focus. Again, this was one of the amendments that was supported by the joint parliamentary committee in its initial inquiry. As you say, Senator Murray, the existing requirement is for 14 days. The government has extended it to 21 days. We thought that for the domestic mums and dads—which is the cliche of the 1990s—the mum and dad investors, who are the great bulk of shareholders in Australia, and even for institutions in Australia, so Australian institutional investors, 21 days is a 33 per cent increase on what they have at the moment. It is a long time for an institution, with all of their expert advisers on these matters, to make up its mind about how it is going to vote at an EGM or an AGM.
But really the benefit you are trying to deliver is to foreign shareholders, and that is where I struck the balance. Twenty-one days is what we regard as a nice balance. Again, it is not something that I would seek to die in a ditch about or fight for the rest of my political life about. The government will oppose this. This is not one of the ones that we regard as a bit here or there. We do think that moving out to 28 days is quite a significant change: you are doubling the notice period. It is quite a significant change. The government at this stage remains opposed to 28 days.
What I am prepared to say, however, is that I would be very pleased to see a bigger debate amongst the general corporate law community about 21 days versus 28 days. I have really not seen a lot of argument that favours 28 days. As for shareholder groups like the ACA and the Australian Shareholders Association, you cannot strongly oppose something like 28 days versus 21, but I know that the push for this comes from overseas because they want a bit of extra time in which to consider these things. That is a legitimate concern.
When I try to balance these things, my general approach is to weight it in favour of the great bulk of shareholders in Australia and Australian institutions, who are not really worked up about whether it is 21 days or 28.
There is a downside, Senator Murray, as you have suggested. The downside is it takes longer to get things done. I will reassert for the third time that it is a detriment to small shareholders who are trying to take action against directors who they believe are not acting in the interests of the shareholders. A case I have had put before me at least half a dozen times in Western Australia while I have been in this portfolio has been where a hundred shareholders want to get together and call an EGM because they think the directors are selling off company assets.
Small shareholders come to me saying, `We are trying to get this EGM together; we want to stop these directors selling this mine'—or prospect or whatever—`but they are going to flog it off to someone else before we get to the EGM. Once we get to the EGM it is too late.' This is in a 14 day scenario. They have to get their petition together and organise the EGM and in the meantime these directors, they believe, are acting in this way. Longer notice periods can be to the significant detriment of small shareholders. I think we have found a balance. I am convinced about it, but it is something that could constructively be considered by the committee of which you are a member.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-24,"—Parliamentary Secretary, you do indeed put the case very well, because there genuinely is an alternative case. For the assistance of the committee I will quote from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities' November 1996 unanimous recommendation. This is what they said on notice of meetings:
The bill proposes to increase the general notice period from the current 14 days to 21 days. Arguments were put that the period ought to be further extended to 28 days to enable overseas investors to cast a more fully informed vote. A 28-day notice period would seem to involve little additional inconvenience for the management of listed companies while providing shareholders, particularly foreign investors who, it was suggested, now own or manage 60 per cent of Australian equities, with a more realistic period of time to arrange for the casting of their votes.
Senator Campbell properly puts the alternative argument. We heard this debate again at the 
 second committee hearing in March. I thought it appropriate therefore to put it before the Senate as an issue of concern in view of the substantial number of significant public companies which are foreign owned and which have such a material impact on our stock exchange and our society. I would be interested to hear the views of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-24,"—Let me accommodate Senator Murray and, hopefully, the chamber with the opposition's views. In my speech in the second reading debate I emphasised that I thought the 28 day period was the appropriate period and referred to the unanimous cross-party recommendation of the original joint parliamentary committee review, to which Senator Andrew Murray has now referred. I also drew attention to the fact that the decision of the government to limit the time to 21 days has been criticised. You are right. My advice is that international investors are the source of that criticism. Looking at the world's major capital markets, the United States has a 30 day period, Germany has a 32 day period and France has a 30 day period.
It is also my understanding that Dr Stephen Davis, the president of Davis Global Advisors of Newton, Massachusetts, wrote to you, Parliamentary Secretary, suggesting that, if the bill was passed in its present form, this measure would set Australia on a course that would place it behind the emerging international best practice of 28 to 30 days. That is where we are coming from.
That seems to be a fairly reasonable amount of references to the time period. I do bear in mind the things that you have said. They are important. The question of shareholder control of companies is fundamental to our philosophy on this, and activist shareholders is pretty much the desired state of affairs.

Division 9—Election of directors
250U  Application of this Division
	 (1)	 This Division applies to companies which become listed corporations after the commencement of this section.
	 (2)	 All other listed corporations must:
		 (a)	 at least 2 weeks but no more than 4 weeks before the next annual general meeting held after the commencement of this section, or at the second annual general meeting after commencement if there is insufficient time between commencement and the next annual general meeting, circulate a summary of the method of electing directors which is described in this Division, together with the opinion of its directors on matters relevant to the application of this method to the company; and
		 (b)	 propose a resolution, at the next or second annual general meeting held after the commencement of this section (as the case may be), that the company elects that this Division apply to it. 

	 (3)	 Any resolution of a listed corporation which would result in this Division no longer applying to the company is invalid.
	 (4)	 Nothing in this Division requires a company which was a listed corporation at the commencement of this section to propose a resolution at any annual general meeting, other than the next annual general meeting held after the commencement of this section, that this Division apply to the company, if the resolution under paragraph (2)(b) is defeated.
250V  Directors to be elected annually
	 (1)	 All directorships of a company become vacant at the annual general meeting of that company.
	 (2)	 The time at which directorships become vacant is immediately before the meeting proceeds to elect directors.
	 (3)	 Unless precluded by the company's constitution, a person who has previously held a directorship of the company may nominate for re-election.
250W  Process of election
	 (1)	 The election of directors must be conducted by a poll.
	 (2)	 Each member of the company is entitled to the number of votes calculated using the following formula:
		 V x S
		 where:
 V  is the number of directorship vacancies.
 S  is the number of shares held by the member.
	 (3)	 Members may cast their votes as they think fit in favour of any number of the nominees for directorships and members need not cast all of their votes.
Democrat amendment No. 25 refers to the election of directors. I will briefly put the case, if I may. The existing method of electing company directors on a limited re-election pattern has been severely criticised for being undemocratic and unrepresentative and for denying the appropriate representation of minority interests. The current system of electing directors facilitates the dominance of control groups and lessens the possibility of support being expressed for particular directors. The result of this is that, for minority interests to be held, minorities must often rely on expensive and problematic remedies such as recourse to the legal system, the ASX rules 
 and ASIC which reduces the attractiveness of investing, reduces genuine shareholder participation and facilitates fairly domineering managerial or board control.
In order to avoid this situation, Shann Turnbull, who has been referred to before in this debate, and others propose a system of preferential voting, also described as cumulative voting, in listed companies for the election of directors in which all directors would be elected annually with each share obtaining as many votes as there are vacancies. In the United States this procedure is mandated as best practice by federal law for banks and for corporations in some states.
To mandate this type of preferential voting for directors of listed companies the law would need to specify that the number of directors to be elected will be determined by the company's constitution, all directors would retire each year, each share will obtain as many votes as there were board vacancies and each shareholder could distribute as they thought fit all or some of the votes available to them from their shareholding to any number of those nominated as directors. The consequence of this optional preferential method is that shareholders can ascribe their votes to indicate their preference for a director or directors.
Although the Australian Democrats believe that this system is desirable for all listed companies, we appreciate it may not be appropriate to require existing companies to change their constitutions. Accordingly, this recommendation applies to only newly listed companies, which we suggest should adopt this system. We also suggest that existing listed companies should be required to allow their shareholders to assess the new system and to vote on whether they wish to convert to it.
This is another part of our governance proposals. This concerns a democratisation of companies. We believe this advances the corporate governance envelope. I anticipate the parliamentary secretary's response and I suggest to him, in view of his likely response, that, if this suggestion goes down, it could be referred to the committee as an appropriate matter to be considered and, what is more, 
 considered with your blessing, not necessarily your support, but certainly your view that it should be viewed with concern.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—I indicate that this is, undoubtedly as Senator Murray will admit, a very significant change in the voting method for directors, although it is well worthy of consideration. It would go forward to the joint parliamentary committee with my full blessing.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-24,"—That assuages one of my concerns. We are sympathetic to this amendment, although we will not vote for it tonight. If the government will refer it to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities for consideration within the CLERP review, which is what I understand the parliamentary secretary to have said—he has just nodded in the affirmative; he has said that—then we will be satisfied that the virtuous parts of this amendment can be considered in that proper context. We support the government and oppose the amendment.

	 (1)	 A company must record in the minutes of a meeting, in respect of each resolution in the notice of meeting, the total number of proxy votes exercisable by all proxies validly appointed and:
		 (a)	 if the resolution is decided by a show of hands—the total number of proxy votes in respect of which the appointments specified that:
			 (i)	 the proxy is to vote for the resolution; and
			 (ii)	 the proxy is to vote against the resolution; and
			 (iii)	 the proxy is to abstain on the resolution; and 

			 (iv)	 the proxy may vote at the proxy's discretion; and

			 (ii)	 against the resolution; and
			 (iii)	 abstaining on the resolution.
	 (2)	 A company that must notify the Exchange of a resolution passed by members at a meeting of the company must, at the same time, give the Exchange the information specified in subsection (1).
	 (3)	 This section applies only to a company that is:

			 (i)	 section 296 (compliance with accounting standards); and
			 (ii)	 section 297 (true and fair view).
Democrat amendment 34 is on page 6 of revised sheet 951. It refers to the issue of the declaration on the financial statement. I suspect that this is another one on which the parliamentary secretary may have some strong opinions. The amendment actually says:
whether, in the directors' opinion, the financial statement and notes are in accordance with this law, including:
			 (i)	 section 296 (compliance with accounting standards); and
			 (ii)	 section 297 (true and fair view).

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-24,"—by leave—I move:
(35)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 184 (after line 22), at the end of section 297 (but before the note), add:
	 (2)	 If a public company operates in a foreign jurisdiction, a true and fair view under this section includes disclosure of any information that the company is required to disclose in that jurisdiction.
(36)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 185 (after line 21), after paragraph (1)(c), insert:
		 (ca)	 if the entity is a public company that operates in a foreign jurisdiction—contain a summary of information that the company is required to disclose in that jurisdiction.
(37)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 185 (line 31), at the end of subsection (1), add:
	 ; and (f)	 if the entity's operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory—details of the entity's performance in relation to environmental regulation.
(38)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 185 (after line 31), after subsection (1), insert:
	 (1A)	 The directors' report must also include an analysis of information reasonably necessary to understand the overall financial position of the company, registered scheme or disclosing entity, including:
		 (a)	 results of operations (both overall and in key industry and geographical segments); and
		 (b)	 key strategic initiatives adopted; and
		 (c)	 major commitments entered into and sources of funding for those commitments; and
		 (d)	 unusual or infrequent events or transactions; and
		 (e)	 likely future developments in the business; and 

		 (f)	 trends or events (both internal and external) that have had a significant effect, or are likely to have a significant effect, on the business.
(39)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 186 (after line 17), before paragraph (a), insert:
		 (aa)	 the policies of the directors for determining the remuneration (including any incentives) of the directors and senior executives, and the relationship of these policies to the performance of the company;
(41)	 Schedule 1, item 5, page 187 (line 8), after paragraph (g), insert:
	 ; and (h)	 whether, during the reporting period, any proceedings were instituted against the company for any material breach by the company of the Corporations Law, or trade practices law, and, if so, a summary of the alleged breach and of the company's position in relation to it; and
			 (i)	 whether, during the reporting period, any proceedings of the kind mentioned in paragraph (h) were concluded or settled and, if so, the terms of the conclusion or settlement.
These amendments are also on page 6 of revised sheet 951. They refer to the question whereby a company operating in a foreign jurisdiction may in fact have information disclosed which is relevant to Australian shareholders or Australian authorities. Amendment 35 refers to a public company operating in a foreign jurisdiction, and says:
If a public company operates in a foreign jurisdiction, a true and fair view under this section includes disclosure of any information that the company is required to disclose in that jurisdiction.
Amendment 36 refers to a public company operating in a foreign jurisdiction, and says:
If the entity is a public company that operates in a foreign jurisdiction—contain a summary of information that the company is required to disclose in that jurisdiction.
I do want to draw amendment 37 to your attention, if I may. I was racing along a bit with the others even though they are very relevant, but amendment 37 says:
If the entity's operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory—details of the entity's performance in relation to environmental regulation. 

It says that details of the entity's performance in relation to environmental regulation should be included. The reason we do that is not just our well-known attachment to environmental matters, but the fact that many companies are materially affected financially in terms of environmental situations. I think we only have to recall some of BHP's financial consequences for environmental matters to be well aware of that.
I draw to the attention of the Senate two documents which are relevant. The first is Hugh Morgan's recent environmental progress report. Mr Morgan is Managing Director of WMC Ltd. It is a very commendable exercise by one of our major corporations to try to respond in a businesslike, practical and responsible manner to the very serious environmental issues which affect his company. He has produced this report voluntarily.
There is another publication which I want to refer the Senate to. It is published by the chartered accountants in Australia. This is not some radical group; this is a very careful body. The publication is called Leadership. It is a discussion paper which was issued in January 1998, so it is current. It talks about the impact of environmental matters on the accountancy profession. A number of statistics are quoted in there. It says that more than two-thirds of users seek disclosure of environmental information in the annual report. It says that less than 10 per cent of preparers see environmental reporting as a threat to their company—in other words, they are not concerned about it. It says that 50 per cent of preparers do not support mandatory disclosure. That probably helps the argument that you are about to put, Senator Ian Campbell. It said, however, that 64 per cent of users would support an approach to have environmental matters included in annual reports.
In summary, that is the intention of amendment 37. It is very particular. It says that if the entity's operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory, details of the entity's performance should be included in the report. Given the nature of our environment, we think that is an important one to include.
The other amendment I must refer to is amendment 41, which comes from a recommendation—you will recognise the recommendation, Parliamentary Secretary—in the report of the 1996 Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities on the draft bill. The amendment says:
(h)	 whether, during the reporting period, any proceedings were instituted against the company for any material breach—
not a minor breach; a material breach—
	 by the company of the Corporations Law, or trade practices law, and, if so, a summary of the alleged breach and of the company's 		  position in relation to it; and
(i)	 whether, during the reporting period, any proceedings of the kind mentioned in paragraph (h)—
which is the paragraph I just read—
	 were concluded or settled and, if so, the terms of the conclusion or settlement.
All those points I have laid out there will improve the nature of reporting which materially affects the value of shareholders' interests in companies and they have been carefully considered by a number of authorities and bodies. We therefore commend the amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—As I understand it, we are dealing with amendments Nos 35 to 39 and amendment No. 41. Amendments Nos 35 and 36 are to do with foreign disclosure. These are matters I referred to in my closing of the second reading debate. They do add significant compliance costs to companies, but, most importantly, as I said in that speech, they do throw away sovereignty from Australia. Basically, if the SEC says `Thou shalt do this,' to the handful of Australian companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange—roughly 2,000 or thereabouts—then they would be required to report to their shareholders in Australia, information which may be entirely irrelevant to their shareholders.
The reality is that the information that is required to be placed before shareholders on a foreign bourse is usually readily available thorough their databases. Certainly the information that is required to be disclosed to the 
 New York Stock Exchange and to the SEC in the United States is available to anyone who wants to access it via the New York Stock Exchange's database—which has got an interesting acronym: it is called EDGAR—which is regarded as one of the most elaborate, accessible, successful information databases on the globe, I am told by the Americans who designed it.
—Did they invent `EDGAR' and then fit the words to it?
—I do not know. I am sure means something like electronic data gathering and retrieval—how does that sound? Anyway, the Yanks say that it is a very good database. I am sure that the Australian Securities Commission would argue that theirs is even better, I am sure that the information technology industry thinks that they could come up with something better if you could pay them a few million dollars, and I am sure that, with the year 2000 approaching, EDGAR will have to be reinvented and improved for the new millennium.
That is the problem with foreign disclosure. I think that the broad concept is not such a bad one, except that it does create unnecessary paperwork. It is not as simple, as Senator Conroy said this morning, as basically folding an envelope and sticking a stamp on some letters to some Australian shareholders. If you have to report something, you are actually requiring that information to be put in the annual reports. Of course, the information that is available through EDGAR or through the foreign bourses' data information and retrieval systems, be it in Europe or in the Unites States—the two main places where Australian companies list—or in Canada, for example, that is available instantaneously if you need it.
The requirement of this amendment, as I understand it, is that it be put in the annual report. That would mean that the Australian shareholders would get that information up to eight months after the event occurred or after that disclosure was made, whereas, if they accessed it through the Internet or other electronic means, they could get it instantaneously. So we think that is the concern. The 
 government is strongly opposed to this amendment. On the environmental law, I simply say that we believe strongly that the requirements of compliance with environmental law should be in environmental laws and not in the Corporations Law.
In relation to the management discussion and analysis, again, I focused on that in the second reading debate, and I suggest that the approach that has been agreed by the Australian Stock Exchange be allowed to work. I do not know whether they have written to all people contributing to this debate, but I would be very happy, with the leave of the Senate, to incorporate in the Hansard letters that I have received, including one from the Managing Director of the Stock Exchange, Richard Humphry, who has outlined how they will be going about bringing in MD&A.
I might just quote from that letter. It says that a working group has already been established. In fact, prior to the government's discussions on this matter, a working group was established with members of the Group of 100—for the information of the Senate, that is a group made up of the financial controllers and directors of the top 100 companies in Australia. The Group of 100 has been the strongest advocate of MD&As. It is on this working group, as is the ASX, the Institute of Company Directors, the Business Council, both of the accounting bodies, and the Securities Institute. The working group is working on a best practice guide, to be completed by the end of September, which will be incorporated under ASX listing rule 4.10.3.
The letter goes on in some detail. They were going to do an annual review of that. I suggested to Mr Humphry and to others interested in this that it would be good to do a detailed and open public examination and report on the level of compliance with this best practice under listing rule 4.10.3 and to make a public report. I would be very happy if it were possible to get the agreement of the Senate to keep the MD&A out of federal law and allow it to operate through the self-regulatory organisational level of the Stock Exchange to ensure that that report was made at least to the Treasurer and that the Treasurer 
 would undertake to table that report—not that I can commit the Treasurer to do that, but I would be certain that the Treasurer would not be opposed to doing that.
I will therefore seek leave to incorporate that letter from Richard Humphry; a letter from IFSA, the Investment and Financial Services Association, again, strong proponents of MD&As who are pleased to see it going into the ASX rules rather than federal law; a letter from Bryce Denison, the National President of the Group of 100, saying that they are working constructively with the ASX to develop the best practice guide and that they see this as the appropriate way to proceed as opposed to seeking that it be put in the law; and, finally, the letter which has been quoted from extensively by Senator Sherry and others from the Securities Institute of Australia, which is making it quite clear that they would like to see it in the listing rules but would like to see it reviewed.
The government would like to see it reviewed. We want to see it reported on. We would like to see a report from the Stock Exchange on compliance. We would like to see it as a matter of national debate. The threat hangs over these organisations that, if they do not make MD&As work through a self-regulatory way, the threat of federal legislation hangs over them. I think very few people in industry, particularly shareholder groups, would regard that the way that it is being proceeded with through the Stock Exchange mechanism is far more desirable than that proposed by the Democrat amendment. I seek leave to incorporate those documents in Hansard.
Leave granted.

Dear Senator
Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) 

ASX is currently participating in an MD&A Working Group which is preparing a comprehensive Statement of Best Practice in relation to `Review of Operations and Financial Condition' (which is similar to what MD&A is referred to as in the United Kingdom). The Working Group consists of representatives from the Group of l 00, ASX, Institute of Company Directors, Business Council of Australia, Australian Society of CPAs, Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Securities Institute of Australia. The Working Group is expected to complete its work by the end of September.
As you are aware, ASX has a listing rule (4.10.3) which requires listed entities to include in their annual reports a statement of the main corporate governance practices that the entity had in place during the reporting period. This is supported by Appendix 4A to the Listing Rules which sets out an indicative list of corporate governance matters that an entity may take into account in making its disclosure. To assist listed entities meet their obligations under listing rule 4.10.3, ASX has recently published a Guidance Note which is subject to regular review. When the Working Group has finalised the MD&A statement of best practice, ASX is prepared to adopt it as part of Appendix 4A and a revised Guidance Note. The ASX conducts a formal review of responses under the listing rule for corporate governance and would take appropriate action if necessary.
This best practice approach to MD&A is consistent with the approach which ASX has taken on corporate governance in general and which has been the subject of submissions to various Parliamentary Committees. It is also consistent with the approach adopted in the United Kingdom whereby the `Operating and Financial Reviews' is a non-statutory statement of best practice issued by the Accounting Standards Board and recommended by London Stock Exchange, Financial Reporting Council and the Hundred Group.

I refer to our discussion regarding a possible Listing Rule being introduced by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to provide for listed companies to report to shareholders through management discussion and analysis (MD&A) under the corporate governance reporting requirements currently contained in those Listing Rules. We understand that the ASX proposes to introduce such an amendment at the earliest opportunity following finalisation of a Statement of Best Practice in September and that you will support this approach.
The Securities Institute of Australia has long been a supporter of the requirement for listed companies to report to their shareholders through an MD&A requirement. We are satisfied that the introduction of this requirement into the Listing Rules with your agreement will be an advance on current reporting requirements and should be supported. By having an express requirement, companies will be on notice that the market will be assessing the quality of their reporting in this area and factoring that in to their assessment of those companies.
With this in mind, if the Listing Rules provide for MD&A, we do not believe it is necessary at this stage to include a legislative requirement in the Corporations Law. However, we believe the record of compliance by listed companies with the requirement should be reviewed within two years of its introduction. Of course, if the review shows a poor record of compliance, the need for a legislative requirement would need to be revisited.
We are copying this letter to the Opposition and the Democrats.

Dear Senator Campbell
The Group of 100 is concerned about the delays in the passage of the Company Law Review Bill 1997, particularly as it applies to concise reports and equity accounting.
We believe that the delays, particularly in respect of concise reports, will seriously disadvantage companies because these proposals promise significant cost savings to companies and their shareholders while enhancing the communication process. The Group of l00 has lobbied the Australian Accounting Standards Board to give a high priority 
 to the preparation of an Accounting Standard to expedite implementation as soon as practicable after the proposals become law.
We have previously written to you and the Joint Parliamentary Committee regarding the directors' report—discussion and analysis to express support for its inclusion in the Bill. The Group of 100 initiated Working Party is presently finalising a Statement of Best Practice and expect that it will be endorsed by the participating organisations, including the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). We are also hopeful that the ASX will incorporate a reference to the Statement in the Corporate Governance section of its listing rules. We currently see this as a positive outcome of co-regulation.
We have noted the Senate debates on these aspects of the Bill and believe that it would be unfortunate for the benefits to companies and their shareholders of issuing concise reports and adopting equity accounting are further delayed as a result of further debate about the Director's report proposals.
We think that the issue of a Best Practice Statement supported by the ASX is a positive outcome in these circumstances and accordingly seek early passage of the Bill in its present form.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Campbell
Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)
As you are aware, IFSA has supported the mandatory inclusion in company annual reports of a general management discussion and analysis. We have, in fact, proposed that an amendment to this effect be incorporated in the Company Law Review Bill 1997.
I am pleased, therefore, to hear that the ASX has indicated its preparedness to adopt, upon its completion, the best practice standard for the MD&A Statement, now under consideration by the industry working group. I understand that the working group expects to finalise an MD&A Statement best practice standard by about September 1958, at which time the ASX will adopt it as part of Appendix 4A to the Listing Rules and also as part of a revised guidance note to assist companies with the relevant Listing Rule. 

This is a welcome development as far as IFSA is concerned. We are of the view that this is a matter which is more appropriately dealt with by amendment of the ASX Listing Rules than by amendment of the Corporations Law.
Yours sincerely
Lynn Ralph
Chief Executive Officer

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-24,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, it seems to me that amendment 39 should sit with amendment 40. Might I suggest that amendments 39 and 40 be dealt with together so that we look at 35 to 38.
—Senator Murray, you seek to postpone 39 to be dealt with 40 and you want to deal with 35 to 38 and 41 together. As I understand it, there is a request from Senator Harradine with regard to putting 41 as separately. I propose to put the question on that amendment separately.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-06-24,"—I ask whether the mover would consider dealing with 35 and 36 together, and 37 separately and perhaps 38 separately. As I understand it, amendment 38 seeks to insert a new subsection 299(1A), which adds a further requirement for the directors' annual report to include a full report of the financial affairs of the company. This is a question to both government and Senator Murray: is it not a fact that this sort of information is what one would normally expect to find in a company's audit report and/or the shareholder's prospectus in any event? There is some doubt as to whether the provision is really necessary.
I am wondering what the government is proposing to do on this particular matter. Does it feel that this is necessary, or is it going along with this amendment? I am just wondering under those circumstances, frankly, in the government's view and in Senator Murray's view, whether it is really necessary 
 since it would be the ordinary case that this information would be available in the audit report or the shareholder's prospectus.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—The concept of a management discussion and analysis is a narrative report on the prospects of the company, which many successful Australian companies already put in annual reports but many do not. A lot of corporate governance experts believe it is a very useful guide to shareholders about the future prospects of a company. The proposal here is to make it a mandatory requirement for all large Australian companies. By `large' I do not mean big listed companies; I mean virtually everyone who has more than 50 members. I think that is the small/large test. This would apply to basically every reporting entity. Everyone who has to write an annual report would be required to put this in. So it would affect a lot of small and medium sized businesses.
I think the Labor amendment, from memory, might restrict it to listed companies, which is obviously better. But the approach that we have pursued—firstly, in my rhetoric and, secondly, in the policy statements I have made on behalf of the government—is that the industry should be pushing these.
We should have groups, such as the Group of 100, company directors and the IFSA, preceded by AIMA, encouraging the use of MD&As. The Stock Exchange, in response to that encouragement some months ago, Senator Harradine—through you, Mr Chairman—pulled together a working group of those sorts of groups that I have mentioned, with a view to forming a set of best practice guidelines to be incorporated under one of the ASX listing rules; 4(10)(iii) is the specific listing rule.
Subsequent to forming that working group, the ASX has made a commitment to me in writing—which I have just incorporated in the Hansard—stating that it will incorporate this best practice guide and it will be reviewing it. I have asked the ASX, and it has agreed, to undertake an inquiry and make a report on the level of compliance with the requirement to do an MD&A and the effectiveness of it. In other words, is it actually improving corporate 
 governance, is it helping shareholders make decisions and is it helping with the governance of our corporations? The ASX has stated that it will make that report, and make it a public report after two years of operation.	 We think that is a very commendable approach.
There is no doubt that out there in the ether there is this strong threat of federal imposition of MD&A, and the reality of that is that we are sitting here in the Senate, talking about it right now—and they are cognisant of that. So there is a strong incentive for them to make it work, and there is a strong incentive for companies to have a serious look at making MD&As a part of their normal reporting process.
The value of having it done through listing rules and having groups like the G100, the accounting bodies and the Securities Institute—who, again, are very strong supporters of an MD&A—oversighting it is that they can adjust the requirement in the listing rules. If after the first year of annual reports it is proved that the way the listing rule is framed it is not producing the results or that people are confused about it, then the flexibility exists for this working group to alter the listing rule to make it more sensible, make it more understandable, make it more effective. That is the benefit of it—it could be changed every six months, it could be changed every three months. We think that is a much more effective way to travel on MD&As.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-24,"—I would respond to Senator Harradine. The management discussion and analysis section of annual reports has been around as an issue for quite some time. It was the second Corporate Law Simplification Bill 1996 report from the joint committee which recommended that there should be an MD&A, as it is called, of the matters that members need to be informed on if they are to understand the overall financial position of the company.
The parliamentary secretary is quite right in indicating that things have moved on, and the ASX is now in a position to present and to recommend a listing section. However, it is not true that there is universal acceptance of 
 ASX's proposal, even though that is strongly advocated by it and strongly supported by some bodies. We did, in the most recent hearing, have a number of organisations—including the Australian Accounting Research Foundation—which felt that the MD&A was necessary in the bill; in particular, they felt it was necessary because it is a characteristic of major capital markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
The point that the parliamentary secretary is making is that the professional bodies all do agree that there should be an MD&A, and so does the ASX, but they want it to be voluntary. As I understand it, the ASX has made it clear that it is not a requirement to include MD&A, but its listings guide would be a matter of guidance. That is what concerns me, because it is my belief that an MD&A should be obligatory. It is vital that shareholders receive a minimum checklist of information required. That laid out in my amendment item 38, Senator Harradine, comes out of the deliberations of the joint committee—it is not something I have invented—and has wide support.
If the bill had said, `Look, either you must have an MD&A of this kind, or you must do the ASX's listing,' I would have been more inclined to the parliamentary secretary's view. But it does not do that; it leaves it open, unless the ASX listing is abided with by the company. Where Senator Cook's amendment goes is to limit the MD&A only to publicly listed companies, whereas the MD&A requirement we have put is to a company of a certain size and up.
That is a legitimate debate, but I have never understood why corporate entities of 50 or more should not still have to provide fundamental material, such as results of operations, key strategic initiatives and major commitments to their shareholders—even if it is 50 people. So, if you like, I take a fairly maximalist view, the Labor Party takes a view in between and the government takes a fairly flexible and open market view.
Once again, it is a case of there being good arguments on a number of sides. But, at this juncture, I am not persuaded that the lack of 
 an MD&A would not result in some problems for shareholders in the nature of reporting.
—The question is that amendments 35 and 36 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—I now propose that we consider Democrats amendment No. 37.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-06-24,"—I have been sitting here listening to the ebb and flow of this discussion, but it is about time I came out of the closet and declared where I stand on some of these things. We did not support amendments 35 and 36 moved by the Democrats because we have got our own amendment No. 7 which we think covers that situation. We share with Senator Harradine, who raised the question about Democrat amendment 37 being dealt with separately, agreement that it should be dealt with separately. But on Democrat amendment No. 37 I would like to hear a little more argument, if I may.
Let me indicate our view. In principle we can accept that amendment, but I am not sure that I understand the practical application of it. It is on the point of how practically it would operate that I would appreciate a little more background. It might be that we would therefore want to more explicitly word the amendment. Let me tell you what my problem is. Firstly, the idea of companies reporting about significant environmental regulation in their reports is an appropriate thing, we think. It would seem to me that what is being required here relates to a significant or a particular environmental regulation. I am not quite sure how you define `significant', though I am pretty sure how you might define `particular'. Leaving that aside for the moment, the details of the company's performance in relation to that regulation would be set out. This is self-assessment, I assume, in that they would set out in their report what the regulation was and describe in the first person for themselves how they believe they have performed up against that regulation.
—What happens if they don't?
—Senator Campbell, you can ask your question when it is your turn.
—Let me take the interjection, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, because it does help the debate. What happens if they do not do that or if they do not do that adequately, given all the MD&A emphasis we have put on this debate thus far. My problem is that I do not disagree with the idea but I am still looking for how it will actually work effectively. That is what I would appreciate some more words on. Moving to amendment 38—",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-06-24,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, we have three minutes left. Is that correct?
—That is correct.
—Perhaps we should just deal with No. 37 and clear that out of the way. We can come to No. 38 tomorrow when we resume the debate, if that is satisfactory with you, Senator Cook.
—Yes.
—I was informed primarily in my approach to this matter by the document I outlined earlier to the Senate, which is a very good document by the chartered accountants in Australia on the impact of environmental matters on the accountancy profession. Simply put, modern environmental law, where it is significant and material—I do not mean specifications to do with a scrubber and a stack—can result in substantial consequences to corporations. We think it is appropriate, and so do the accountants, that it is reported on. You picked up the words `particular' and `significant'. I too had that debate with the draftsperson who put this together. There are some difficulties with it. Again I would suggest, with the support of the parliamentary secretary, that if this was to go down this element should be referred to the committee for examination. I do not believe it has been examined fully before.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-06-24,"—I indicate that I would be happy for the parliamentary committee to examine it. In principle, I would have thought that if there is an environmental regulator you would need to be responsible to that regulator.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-06-24,"—The decision by Labor and the Greens to block the proposed Wesley Vale pulp mill in my home state of Tasmania approximately a decade ago is now having horrendous social, environmental and economic consequences. The cheap political strategy of the time by Labor, in concert with the myopic Green movement, those 10 long years ago is unfortunately just a blur in the corporate memory of my fellow Tasmanians. But, as we consider the opportunities of the magnesite mine in Tasmania and other issues facing this nation, we need to reflect on and learn from the Wesley Vale experience.
As a direct result of the actions of Labor's environment minister, Senator Graham Richardson, and the Greens' Christine Milne, we have had in Canberra this week a delegation of workers struggling to keep their jobs—they and 200-plus of their fellow workers now face unemployment. What happened those 10 years ago? A proposal to build a world-class paper pulp mill at a cost of $1 billion was announced. Christine Milne, now the Leader of the Greens, made her public debut and launched her political career fighting the proposal. Aided and abetted by Labor, she won.
Senator Murphy interjecting—
—Senator Murphy seems to be proud of Labor's achievement in scuttling the Wesley Vale mill. I simply ask, at what price?
There are two devastating costs of this Labor-Greens victory. Firstly, environment 
 ally, the decision was a disaster. The mill would have processed timber from a  sustainable and environmentally friendly source. Further, the mill would have been a state-of-the-art plant, emitting minimal waste—less waste than all other comparable mills in the world. Remember the Greens' slogan? `Think globally, act locally'. They thought politically and acted selfishly, because by their actions they ensured the ongoing success of the mill elsewhere in the world, belching out its pollution. They preferred that to the clean mill which was proposed; they were hardly thinking globally. Further, the timber supply for other world pulp producers does not necessarily hail from a forest industry culture as meticulous and concerned about sustainable environmental practices as is Tasmania's.
The Burnie pulp mill has been struggling for a long time. It needed new plant and equipment. Amcor, unfortunately, have not seen their way clear to provide that necessary investment, and they have therefore decided to close the mill. I trust they will change their mind. If we had had Wesley Vale up and running we would at least be using Tasmanian product and manufactured pulp in Burnie for the production of paper. Instead, we now face the very real prospect that the Burnie paper mill will be using pulp made from the rainforests of Indonesia—where there is no forest practices code or regional forest agreement, where there is not 40 per cent of the land mass set aside for reserves, and where there are not comprehensive and adequate reserves as there are in Tasmania; not to mention reafforestation.
The Greens' actions will lead to extra market opportunities for Indonesia's rainforests and, ultimately, to their destruction. That is not a good environmental outcome, let alone a commonsense outcome. The Greens' lack of vision has allowed an old polluting mill to be favoured over a clean mill. Their lack of vision will now favour product from the unsustainable harvest of Indonesian rainforest over product from Tasmania's sustainable and well-regulated forests. Their actions are as environmentally destructive as they are socially and economically destructive. That is the second great cost of that 
 politically motivated and short-sighted decision of Labor and the Greens taken all those years ago.
For a small population of less than half a million people, a $1 billion investment would have been huge—in anyone's language. The benefits for jobs in construction, maintenance and supply would have had an ongoing, beneficial flow-through effect for our Tasmanian economy. The presence of such a mill would have been a great confidence boost to the people investing in the forest industry but, more importantly, it would have provided opportunities and security for the workers and their families and for local timber communities and towns. The potential benefits of all those jobs and of downstream processing were denied to our fellow Tasmanians. Their wellbeing was sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.
Instead of having a world-class pulp mill, we are watching the demise of Burnie's pulp mill and, more importantly, the loss of many jobs, which will undoubtedly have the devastating flow-on social consequences of bankruptcy, mortgagee sales and family breakdowns. What is tragic is that people like Christine Milne and Graham Richardson built their so-called political careers and notoriety on the back of a decision which they must have known would have this devastating social impact. The so-called victory was cheap; the cost was very expensive indeed. That type of irresponsible, short-term politicking has devastating long-term consequences.
I hope and pray that Tasmania will not be subjected to a similar campaign by Labor and the Greens on the proposed magnesite mine development in north-west Tasmania. The proposal is exciting and promises employment in a range of fields, together with real potential for downstream processing. Reject this magnesite mine proposal and you reject the aspirations of hundreds of Tasmanian workers and their families who desperately need employment opportunities. Reject this and you deny the state government desperately needed revenue for the provision of services to Tasmanians. Reject this and the prospect of another major development will be denied for 
 another decade—with all the devastating consequences that involves.
The effective and hardworking member for Braddon, Chris Miles, needs to be congratulated on his effective leadership on jobs. Under the previous Labor government, Amcor shed hundreds of jobs from its Burnie operations. Tioxide closed, with a loss of 200 jobs. What was Labor's response? Absolutely nothing. In stark contrast, after the recent announcement of job losses at Burnie's pulp mill, what did Chris Miles and the Liberal government do? Within 48 hours a cabinet subcommittee was in the city of Burnie, listening to the workers' and the community's concerns and aspirations. They are now preparing an assistance package—a response.
For the magnesite mine proposal, Chris Miles initiated a visit by Senator Parer, Minister for Resources and Energy, and organised a public meeting to form a support group for this exciting development. That sort of proactive, pro-jobs initiative of Chris Miles and this government is what government should be all about: helping workers, families and communities. In the Mersey-Lyell region, which covers the electorate of Braddon, the employment trend collapsed by 11 per cent under Labor between 1989 and 1996. It is now rebuilding at six per cent and that is a substantial rate, but Chris Miles, our Tasmanian colleagues and I realise it needs to be increased.
As the Tasmanian delegation which is here fights for jobs and a future—a fight which I fully support—it is important to cast a backward glance and remind ourselves what necessitated their visit. I trust the workers, their families and communities will understand that today's problems are the product of the Labor and Greens collusion those 10 years ago.
Could I invite the workers and their families to help Labor and the Greens to understand their rejection of those tactics by rejecting Labor and the Greens at the next election? Job opportunities are the top priority for me, as they are for Chris Miles and my Liberal colleagues. Yet the alternative government hardly raises the issue of employment in question time or in public debate. Their 
 record is appalling. After two years in opposition they find themselves without a jobs policy.
On the other hand, the Liberal government is unapologetically pro-jobs. Our regret is that we predicted the social and economic consequences of the scuttling of the Wesley Vale mill and, unfortunately, we were unable to save it. Nevertheless, we will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those who face the loss of jobs. Having said that, we are looking forward to, and will actively promote, the saving of jobs and the creation of new opportunities that the magnasite mine proposal provides.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Wesley Vale Pulp Mill</title>,Adjournment,36,1,speech
