"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-03-04,"—My question is addressed to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs and the Minister representing the Attorney-General. I refer to a statement by the Attorney-General last night that he had ordered Australia Post to destroy returned antiterrorism kits. Given that postal workers are reporting in many places that the kits are being destroyed without being counted, why did the Attorney-General decide to override Australia Post's commitment to the parliament to keep and count the kits and also the contract between Prime Minister and Cabinet and Australia Post to keep these kits in case of further demand? Given that Minister Alston yesterday labelled Labor's revelation that the kits were being destroyed as `nonsense' and bizarre, why didn't the Attorney-General bother telling Senator Alston of the instruction to destroy the kits?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Information Kits</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-03-04,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, how can the government claim that this is an occupational health and safety issue when postal workers are still collecting and sorting this mail without any official health warnings— that is, the Australia Post workers have not been told the information you have just given the Senate? If the Attorney-General's concern really is that the kits have been tampered with or contaminated, are the kits being tested for dangerous substances before they are being destroyed and how many of the kits have been found to be contaminated?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Information Kits</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-03-04,"—We can see we are on the big issues here, that is for sure! What we had with that information campaign was a very important campaign to inform the people of Australia in relation to the current security environment. Of course, it is interesting that the opposition were the first to say, when we upped the security alert back in November last year, that we should have an information campaign of this sort. They said, `You should inform the people of Australia as to the threat and how to deal with it.' And so it was that the Prime Minister's office, in conjunction with the Attorney-General, embarked on a comprehensive information campaign, and that has been very well received. In fact, in the press today, it says that it is one of the best remembered advertisements of those recently shown on television. That shows you just how important a campaign it has been. The fact is that the opposition do not want to acknowledge that we have an environment that we have to deal with and that we have to inform the Australian public about. They are more interested in how many kits were sent to Australia Post and whether they were destroyed.
—What about the facts?
—I am about to tell you, Senator Sherry. The advice that I have from the Attorney-General is that approval has been given for the destruction of some kits in the Canberra mail centre to address storage issues. Instructions will be issued shortly to Australia Post to destroy all other returned kits. The government will not allow Commonwealth workers to be put at risk by exposure to any possible contaminant. You have to realise that there has been an irresponsible campaign by some people who have said, `Return the kits and put some white powder in in order to send a message.' We know that the opposition do not care about workers. They are not interested in the safety of the workers or the Australian postal workers.
What we are concerned about is the possible anxiety that could be caused to workers if there were some kits returned with powder in them. Some irresponsible elements of the Australian community are saying, `You should show your opposition to war by putting a hoax—white powder—in a kit and returning it.' If you were an Australian postal worker and you got a kit like that and there was white powder in it, of course you would be quite anxious about it. What we are about here is safety and addressing that possible concern of Australian postal workers because of the thoroughly irresponsible actions of some people in the Australian community—a very small minority, too.
There has been a suggestion that the decision to destroy all returned kits will prevent Australia Post from counting the number of kits returned. That is not correct. I have outlined reasons for the destruction of the kits, and I am sure the opposition would agree with that. The arrangement has always been that Australia Post would estimate the number of kits returned. This will continue to be done prior to the destruction of kits, so there will be no hiding of the number of kits that have been returned. The estimating will be done by Australia Post. But first and foremost we have to address the threats of irresponsible people in the community to send a hoax through the mail by putting white powder in these kits. You can just imagine the concern that could cause to Australian postal workers.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-03-04,"—I have already answered the question by saying that the destruction of these kits has been done in the interests of the safety of workers concerned. There have been a small number of incidents where they have seen that the kits have been tampered with, I might add, and that has been the cause of investigation. One can only assume that Australian postal workers would be involved in that and in the detection of the tampering with these kits. I stress again that it is a very irresponsible small number of people in the community who have urged people to return these kits with white powder in them.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>National Security: Information Kits</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-04,"—My question is to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister confirm that yesterday the Prime Minister signalled the end of Australia's universal health system when he told parliament:
What we can do is to commit ourselves to the maintenance of a high availability of bulk-billing for the less fortunate and for concession cardholders in our community.
Minister, what will this mean for those millions of Australians who do not hold pensioner or concession cards and for whom the availability of bulk-billing can be the difference between choosing to see a doctor and staying sick?

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-04,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister agree with Treasurer Costello's comments this morning that Medicare was never intended to be a universal health care system?

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-03-04,"—I want to say that Mr Smith's plan to give different rebates to people in different areas would undermine the universality of Medicare. The Prime Minister has indicated a number of times— and I think twice today in the House of Representatives—that we are committed to Medicare and to the universality of Medicare, and we are going to address the strains on bulk-billing in rural and outer metropolitan areas. When we have completed that, we will advise the Australian public in due course. We are not undermining the universality of Medicare. I will tell you who is undermining the universality of Medicare—Mr Smith, with his kaleidoscope policy he dreamt up the weekend before last. He will go back next weekend and get his kaleidoscope out and twist it again and find another policy. Then that dark shadow will come across and it will be Mr Crean saying: `No! We didn't mean that policy. We didn't mean to increase the Medicare levy,' and Mr Smith will go back to Western Australia to look for his kaleidoscope to find yet another policy. I can tell you that his policy of getting rid of the 30 per cent rebate and his policy to increase rebates for people in different geographical areas will undermine the universality of Medicare. He is assisted by his state colleagues who are encouraging—and, I would even say, misleading—people to think that they have to use their private health insurance in public hospitals. That would undermine the universality of Medicare.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-03-04,"—I do not think Senator Hutchins heard my answer when I said that the Prime Minister has indicated twice today in the House of Representatives that we will maintain the universality of Medicare. I remind Senator Hutchins what Dr Blewett said in 1987, when he was introducing the rebate for visits to GPs. He said:

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-03-04,"—On 6 February in a supplementary question Senator Harris asked about entry thresholds in the value of imported goods intended for home consumption. There was some cross-portfolio interest and I made an undertaking to Senator Harris that I would consult with the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. I now have a response and I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Senator HARRIS (Supplementary Question)
Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, in resolving the issue I became aware of a discrepancy in the exemption level between GST using an international courier service, where the level is $250, and Australia Post, where the level is $1,000.
Minister, are all taxes required to be equal between states and people within the states? Why should one person in a state pay more GST than another person based on a method of delivery? Minister, will the government preferably remove the GST on Christmas gifts or at least raise the exemption to $1,000 regardless of how the gifts are received?
Senator Coonan (Response of 6 February 2003)
I thank Senator Harris for his question. The principle is that in relation to the question about the threshold levels, I will certainly look further into that matter for Senator Harris. But I point out that because the Customs Service acts in an agency capacity for the Australian tax office in the administration of the threshold issue, I do not actually have those facts ready at my disposal and there are, of course, cross-portfolio interests. I will consult with the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, to see if there is a problem in relation to the application of different thresholds depending upon the courier company selected—that seems to be the point—and get back to Senator Harris. 
Senator Coonan (Follow-up Response 3 March 2003)
I have consulted with the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, and can provide the following additional information to Senator Harris.
The liability for duty and GST on imported goods applies equally across Australia. There is a `screen-free' or revenue exemption threshold. This is the value of combined duty and GST below which an exemption applies. This is currently set at $50, if the value of the goods does not exceed the relevant entry threshold.
The entry threshold is the value of imported goods at which the owner or broker is obliged to provide detailed information to the Australian Customs Service in the form of an entry for home consumption. There are currently two levels: $1,000 for goods imported by post and $250 for goods imported other than by post.
In May 2001 the Minister for Justice and Customs indicated that he intended to harmonise the entry threshold for incoming postal and non-postal consignments at the time that the Customs Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 is implemented. This will bring the declaration requirements for postal and non-postal streams into alignment by mid-2004.
The gift concession is a different concession and applies equally to all bona-fide gifts regardless of mode of carriage. This concession is applied to the total value of the consignment. The first $A200 of the value of the gift is duty and GST free, but only if the gift is a genuinely unsolicited non-recurring present. There are some exceptions to this concession, including alcohol and tobacco in excess of specified limits.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Goods and Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-03-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today relating to Medicare and the decline in the rate of bulk-billing and to private health insurance.
Medicare is in crisis—there can be no other way to describe the situation that currently exists, particularly with respect to bulk-billing. This government and this particular minister have presided over the collapse of bulk-billing. It is interesting to go back and have a look at history, as the minister tried to do when she sought to avoid answering the questions that she was asked in question time. The Prime Minister himself is somewhat of a student of history, or he claims to be. The problem is that he and his government are seeking to repeat history. Therefore, it is instructive to go and have a look at just what is on the record from the Prime Minister back in the 1980s.
In 1986 the Prime Minister—then the Leader of the Opposition—Mr Howard, said, `Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.' In 1987 he said, `Radical surgery will be performed on Medicare.' Again in 1987 he said on radio: `The second thing we'll do is get rid of the bulk-billing system. It's an absolute rort.' In the same interview he said, speaking again about Medicare and bulk-billing, `We'll pull it right apart.' These are definite, clear statements by the Prime Minister about his and his party's attitude to Medicare—that is, to rip it up, to destroy it, because they have never liked it. They did not like it when it was first introduced as Medibank under the Whitlam government, and they did not like it when it was reintroduced by the Hawke Labor government in 1983.
They are the real views of the Prime Minister and they are the views that he still has today. Notwithstanding having his and his party's policies rejected by the people on a number of occasions throughout the period of Labor government and notwithstanding having given a commitment back in 1996 in the health policy launch prior to the 1996 election when he said, `Medicare will be retained in its entirety,' the Prime Minister has continued through inaction and other decisions of government to whittle away at Medicare and destroy it. He was never game, after his experience of rejection by the people, to come out openly again and say that they would destroy Medicare, but that is what they have been about. We now see them—and I am sure other senators will pick up on it—trying to reduce the role of Medicare to what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have indicated would be, essentially, focusing only on the needy. 
What have we seen under the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson? Since she was appointed health minister after the last election, we have seen a further decline in bulk-billing of some 5.6 per cent. Under the Howard government since it was elected in 1996, bulk-billing rates have declined by about 11 per cent. Indeed, in some parts of the country, in outer metropolitan and rural areas, it is down to as low as 65 per cent and it is heading south. I can give examples of towns in rural New South Wales that I am aware of where there are large populations of retirees and gold card holders and yet there is no doctor who bulk-bills. Those people have to travel many kilometres to find a doctor who will bulk-bill. This is a disgrace. It is not as if the government was not warned that this was happening. As I said in question time, the minister was advised back in December 2001, only one month after the re-election of this government—supposedly because, they say, they are committed to protecting Medicare—by her own department that the rate of bulk-billing was falling.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-03-04,"—Here we are yet again. It is the second day in a row that the Labor Party has made accusations against the government that simply are not true. Yesterday there were accusations against the Minister for Family and Community Services about the top-up and payments of family tax benefits. The allegations that were made yesterday were as wrong as the allegations that are being made about bulk-billing today. 
If one listened to just Senator Forshaw, one would think that when the Labor Party brought in Medicare it was designed to be a bulk-billing exercise for everybody, regardless of income. Senator Forshaw has not responded; he has not indicated one way or the other whether or not that was his belief. It is interesting to note that their allegation that Medicare bulk-billing should be available for everybody does not reflect what the government had in mind at the time of Medicare's introduction. As Senator Patterson mentioned during question time today, the then health minister, Dr Blewett, said in 1987—I will say it again because clearly Senator Forshaw did not hear or did not want to hear, and he certainly did not refer to it in his contribution—
—No, I didn't, because I was referring to the Prime Minister.
—Dr Blewett, on Senator Forshaw's side of politics, said this—
—I referred to the broken promises of the Prime Minister.
—Senator Knowles, ignore the interjections. Senator Forshaw, you were heard in relative silence; let Senator Knowles be heard.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I draw your attention to the fact that throughout most of her remarks Senator Knowles has been directly referring to me and directing questions to me.
—I did not.
—You did.
—Excuse me; I do not want either of you arguing across the chamber. Senator Forshaw, there is no point of order. Senator Knowles, will you continue, please?
—My comments have all been directed through you, Mr Deputy President, and I have been commenting on the contribution—the stupid, silly little contribution—of Senator Forshaw on this issue. I was about to quote his former health minister, Dr Blewett, who in 1987 said:
What we ... in this country is not doctors exploiting bulk billing but compassionate doctors using the bulk billing facility to treat pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services, which was always the intention. 
They are not my words; they are the words of a Labor minister for health. Senator Forshaw quite clearly decided to overlook in his contribution the intent of it, by saying that now, under this government, there is an emphasis on ensuring that bulk-billing is available to those to whom Dr Blewett referred; to treat `pensioners, the disadvantaged and others who are not well off or who are in great need of medical services' now somehow makes the government derelict in its duty, when seven out of 10 services are bulk-billed! Did we ever hear Senator Forshaw, or Senator Anyone over that side, talk about seven out of 10 of all facilities currently being bulk-billed? No, we did not. 
No wonder the opposition are trying to go on about this. Mr Smith has given a commitment to do away with the 30 per cent rebate; he has given a commitment on bulk-billing that he will not be able to keep. Mr Crean's leadership is in absolute turmoil. Therefore, we have them coming in here with an argument about bulk-billing that does not stack up with their own history, does not stack up with what is currently under way today and does not stack up with their own record on funding.
It is worth noting that under the coalition government the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation increased by 20 per cent. During the last six years of the Labor government, that rebate increased by less than nine per cent. Do we hear the Labor Party talking about that gap? No, we do not. Do we hear them talking about what happened during their last six years in government? The Medicare rebate for longer consultations increased by only five per cent under their government compared to 23 per cent under this government. No, we do not hear that, because that does not serve their purpose. That simply makes the whole issue a furphy to try and protect Mr Crean's abysmal, nonexistent leadership and Mr Smith's desire to abolish the rebate.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-04,"—It is always interesting to follow Senator Knowles, because you know that when the government has to defend a bad message, particularly in the areas of social security or health or community services, Senator Knowles will be wheeled out. You cannot argue that she is an effective debater; I wonder if anybody listening to the broadcast today would have been convinced by the words that Senator Knowles advanced here today.
I do not know if the coalition realises it, but Medicare is in crisis at the moment. As a New South Wales senator, whether I go into the outer metropolitan areas or into regional New South Wales, I realise that the availability of health care to our citizens is being denied. Like a number of my colleagues in the Senate, I look after a number of duty electorates. I had the opportunity to go to Orange last weekend. I was spoken to by a number of people in that mid-western region of New South Wales. In towns like Orange, Lithgow and Bathurst only 18 per cent of GPs intend to offer full bulk-billing services in six months time. In Bathurst itself, a town with a population of 32,000 people, only one surgery offers full bulk-billing services now. According to official government figures, the rate on the Central Coast of New South Wales—where the seats of Robertson and Dobell are held by the coalition—has fallen by 15 per cent over the last two years. But local medical professionals say that the crisis is worse than that: only 28 per cent of GPs on the Central Coast intend to offer full bulk-billing services by August this year.
If you heard the answers from Senator Patterson today or the valiant effort by Senator Knowles to defend her, you would think that there was no crisis in the system. The crisis is there because GPs are no longer going to bulk-bill. The number is declining. We have heard from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over the last two days that they are going to isolate access to bulk-billing to people who are card holders. I do not know where they get off thinking that people in this country are not disadvantaged financially when they isolate the opportunity for access to bulk-billing to pensioners and card holders. If that is the case, you will see a number of families who will make a decision about whether or not they themselves, either individuals or their families, will go to the doctor. Already there is a copayment of $12.78; the copayment will possibly increase if this system proposed by the Prime Minister is implemented. There is also a bill before the Senate, which we will be debating later, about whether or not we will increase the basic cost of prescriptions. 
If we do not comment on the fact that the government is trying in its own way to abandon the universal health scheme, if we do not make it clear to the Australian people that this is a deliberate policy of the government to isolate in communities the haves and the have-nots, then we are not doing our job. There is nothing that has been said over the last few days that gives me or the people that I represent in New South Wales any comfort that there will be an increase in the standard of health care or the availability of it. I have highlighted to you, Mr Deputy President, a number of regions in New South Wales that within six months will feel the full force of not having access to universal health care or the opportunity for free service or discounted fees. This is a crisis, and there is nothing that I have heard in the last 24 to 48 hours that leads me to believe that anything has been done about it. All I have heard is that the government is going to try to charge the working community more money to access health care.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Medicare: Bulk-Billing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-03-04,"—I would hate for people in Australia listening to this broadcast to get the impression from Senator Hutchins's remarks that the standards of Australian health are going to drop or that the universality of access to health services is going to cease because there has been in some way a small reduction in the number of bulk-billed services provided by GPs. Nothing could be further from the truth. The centre, the core or the essence of Medicare is the provision of free treatment to all Australians in public hospitals. That is really what Medicare is all about. There is no suggestion at all that that availability of free treatment in public hospitals will be changed by any slight reduction in the availability of bulk-billing GPs around this country.
—When was the last time you went to a hospital for medical services?
—I actually went to a hospital last week, Senator Hutchins.
—How long did you have to queue up for?
—Not too long, I must say, and that means that our hospital system is working very well. We as Australians should be very proud of our hospital system because it is a very good one. There has been, it is true, a small reduction in bulk-billing by GPs around this country; nevertheless, something like 70 per cent of all GP services are bulk-billed. That is a pretty high percentage. I find it very hard to take very seriously the claims by the opposition that the small reduction in the number of bulk-billed services or the small percentage drop in the level of bulk-billing of GP services means that the end of the world is nigh in the effectiveness of our health service, because that simply is not the case. It is the case that 80 per cent of services provided to pensioners are bulk-billed. That means that most doctors in this country are ensuring that the most needy and perhaps underprivileged in our community, the elderly who are on pensions, receive free treatment from their general practitioner. It may be that there are doctors in an area who have ceased bulk-billing, but a pensioner or anybody else who shops around I am sure will find other doctors in other clinics who are prepared to bulk-bill them for their general practitioner services.
Let us move on and look at bulk-billing in other medical specialities, such as pathology. There has certainly been no change that I have heard of in bulk-billing for pathology. Pathology is a very expensive kind of medicine, and almost all pathology services these days are bulk-billed. The Labor Party seems not to want to mention that. There has been no change that I have heard of in other areas, such as in radiology, or in the levels of bulk-billing by various specialists. Admittedly, some specialists bulk-bill more than others: surgeons tend not to bulk-bill many patients and people like psychiatrists and physicians bulk-bill more. In fact, we have not heard anything about any changes in the levels of bulk-billing for specialist services. So, if we take a broader view than the one the opposition seems to be peddling about bulk-billing, the reality is that there has been very little change and that there is no threat or danger to the effectiveness of the Australian health system. 
Since the coalition has been in office, we have seen Medicare rebates increase by something like 23 per cent for long consultations. In the era of the Labor government, they increased by only five per cent. The Howard government has spent some $640 million on special programs to encourage more doctors to practise in rural and outer metropolitan areas and generally has strengthened our health service. The ALP's only answer to the problems as they see them at the moment, as expressed by Simon Crean on 3 March in Canberra, is that they would increase the Medicare levy.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-03-04,"—I think what we saw in the Minister for Health and Ageing today, other than a fairly extraordinary obsession with Mr Stephen Smith, is a minister who is not prepared to confront the critical issues that the opposition is raising. The issues that we raised today were in relation to the future of Medicare, the decline in bulk-billing under this government and what is happening in relation to directors' fees in terms of private health insurance. Speaking on the last issue first, the minister completely ignored the fact that Medibank Private is owned by the government, owned by the people of Australia, and that the government is the shareholder. My understanding in respect of Medibank Private is that the minister is required to approve directors' fees. It is not good enough for the minister to come in here and say, `This is something that is beyond our purview or outside our bailiwick.' As I understand it, she has the delegation to approve or not approve increases in directors' fees for Medibank Private. She did not say anything about that, so we had a complete obfuscation.
The second issue is the future of Medicare under this government. The Prime Minister himself, as pointed out by Labor Party senators today, has said that, in his view, bulk-billing should be available only for pensioners and for people deemed to be disadvantaged. What does that mean? We all know that means that Medicare goes back to what this government likes to call the `needy poor'—a Dickensian concept—moving away from universality. That is what the Prime Minister is saying. I wish this government would get its lines straight about that. The Treasurer himself said this morning that Medicare was never intended to be a universal health system. Well, excuse me! The Labor Party introduced Medicare and, yes, it was intended to be a universal health system. So let us not allow the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to skate around and use weasel words about one of the major icons that the Australian Labor Party stands for, one that we will not tamper with, and that is the universality of Medicare.
Everybody knows we have a budget coming up. Was the Treasurer foreshadowing a change to Medicare? We know from statements made in the 1980s by the now Prime Minister that his intention right from the word go was to dismantle Medicare. He said that when the Liberal Party made it clear that was their view when Medicare was introduced, and in the 1980s, along with his other fairly outrageous conservative views, he indicated that it was his aspiration that Medicare be dismantled. Is the Treasurer foreshadowing an announcement about Medicare? You have to ask that question. We will put it together: first of all, we have the Prime Minister talking about Medicare never being intended to be universal and that it was always about helping people who are disadvantaged—the Dickensian notion of the needy poor—and, then, we have the Treasurer reaffirming that and indicating perhaps that in the budget they will be moving to an income based Medicare system rather than a universal Medicare system.
Bear in mind that Medicare is very popular, as previous Liberal Party oppositions have found out to their detriment when they have tried to make an issue of this. This time the government has not made an issue of it; it is trying to sneak it through and undermine by stealth the fundamental principle of the universality of Medicare. We will not be fooled. The people of Australia will not be fooled. We know what the government's intention is with respect to Medicare. We know the Prime Minister has not changed his views one iota since the 1980s when he said that Medicare should be scrapped and bulk-billing should go. That is the bottom line, that is what the minister has got to face up to, and it is about time she came in here with better briefs and more information with respect to our questions.

I went on the radio and made the point that the government is trying to do the responsible thing by providing information to the community about what they can reasonably do to be aware of increased threats to personal safety, and I said I thought that was the responsible thing to do. I also made the point during the interview on Paul Murray's 6PR talk show that I would be happy if in a few months time the government was lampooned for overreacting. I think it would be a great achievement if the world got through this current threat unscathed and the government was told that it had been overreacting. I certainly hope that the government is not accused of underreacting to the current threats.
The main objection that I have to the tabling of these documents is that it is, without any doubt in my mind, a stunt. The tabling of documents is done within the parliament to ensure that a document that is not available is made widely available. Tabling a document ensures that the tabled document may be circulated to any senator and, I think, made available to any member of the public. Clearly, this document has been made available to all members of the public. It is widely available. So to table the documents in the Senate is a waste of time and energy.
Senator Nettle also wants to ensure that messages for John Howard from the Australian people—which are in her writing in the document that I have in front of me and were quoted from the returned terrorism packages—get through. She lists a number of pages summarising those messages. It is entirely appropriate that the Prime Minister and the government be made aware of people's feelings about the international security situation. To show my bona fides, I am happy to have this document tabled, because it serves the purpose of informing the parliament of the views of all of those people who have taken the time to communicate them. That is what a parliament should be about. It should be about informing the parliament, informing the government, of the plurality of views within this great democracy. It should not be demeaned by the pulling of mindless and childlike stunts. I am happy to make an offer to the Greens if they would like to table this document which summarises the views of all of those good Australians. I will pass it to the Opposition Whip so she too may make a judgment. In fact, I think she is getting one from the Greens. I now make the offer to give leave to have this document tabled so that all senators and members and the Prime Minister may receive a copy of the views of these good citizens, but I will not give leave to table a document that has already been distributed, at taxpayers' expense, to every household in Australia.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-03-04,"—I only had a few minutes last night to make my contribution and I welcome this opportunity now to continue my remarks. As we have been advised, the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is one of the bills that the government is making a determined stand on—and so are we. Last night I said that it was revealed in the Senate estimates that the government planned to spend $49.6 million on an advertising campaign `to inform the community of the high-quality medicines system funded by taxpayers'. I would suggest that, in light of the supposed budgetary necessity of cutting the PBS, proposing to spend $49.6 million on advertising a system which has been destroyed by this government is verging on deception. As far as I am concerned, this is a slap in the face to hardworking Australians. It is entirely unacceptable that the government would cut $1.1 billion from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and then spend almost $50 million of taxpayers' money to make it seem rosy. It is an abuse of government and a failure to recognise the needs of Australians.
The proposed cuts to the PBS are just one element of the government's oversight of the destruction of the health care system. The coalition government has seen a slow erosion of the bulk-billing system. The most recent figures show that only 69.6 per cent of visits to GPs are bulk-billed, which is a drop from a high of 80.6 per cent just after the 1996 election. In fact, the percentage of doctors visits which are bulk-billed has decreased every year since the coalition was elected. Under Labor, it increased every year. That is because Labor has a commitment to accessible health care. Because of that commitment, we have rejected this bill before and we will do it again.
The New South Wales Department of Health recently conducted a statewide survey of GPs, asking them to indicate whether they would provide full bulk-billing services in six months time. In six months time, it is expected that only 28 per cent of GPs on the Central Coast will provide full bulk-billing services. The Central Coast is an area which has a high proportion of retirees and young families, yet the government, and in particular the members for Dobell and Robertson, has done nothing to ensure the healthy future of the people of the Central Coast. People on the Central Coast have not been adequately represented by their coalition members, Mr Ticehurst and Mr Lloyd. Central Coast residents have seen a drop of 15 per cent in the number of bulk-billed visits to general practitioners. Now the government is, for the second time, attempting to increase the copayment for essential medicines. The members for Dobell and Robertson have a duty to represent the best interests of their constituents, but have instead supported a government which has allowed bulk-billing to erode. Mr Ticehurst and Mr Lloyd had both supported increasing the cost of essential medicines, not once but twice. They will be reminded of it and so will the people of the Central Coast. 
All government members when they vote for this bill should bear in mind the serious impact it will have on Australian families. An additional cost of $190 per year on a family can mean the difference between getting by and doing it tough. For pensioners, an additional cost of $52 per year is a very serious increase. Many pensioners have trouble making ends meet as it is. An extra $52 could put them over the line.
Fortunately, the Australian Labor Party and the minor parties rejected this measure the last time it came before the Senate. If we had not, Australian families would have been slugged with an increase of 30 per cent for each prescription. Evidence provided in Senate estimates suggests that pensioners would go without five million prescriptions and families would go without half a million prescriptions if this bill were passed. It is entirely unacceptable that the Treasurer's cost-cutting exercise should stop Australians from accessing essential medicines.
The final budget outcome has shown that there is no budgetary justification for the proposed increase in the PBS copayment. The final budget outcome showed that the government's expenditure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was $224 million less than had been estimated in last year's budget, the figures of which were the basis for the current bill. The annual increase in expenditure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was lower than the average of the past decade rather than the 20 per cent increase the government expected. If this legislation is simply a reaction to expenditure rather than an ideological move against public subsidisation of medicines then the government should not have reintroduced the legislation once the final budget outcomes were known.
The moderate increase in the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the 2001-02 financial year should dictate the maintenance of the PBS subsidy at its current level. The government should not punish Australian families for its mistakes in the 2000-01 financial year and the resulting blow-out in expenditure for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
I wholeheartedly oppose this bill. The result of the bill being passed would be a less accessible and less fair PBS system. The Australian Labor Party supports the right of Australians to have access to affordable medicines. Health care is something which should not be determined by the ability of individuals to pay, because it is essential that all Australians live healthy and comfortable lives. The Labor Party has a strong and lasting commitment to the public provision of health care, most clearly manifested by Prime Minister Whitlam's introduction of Medibank and Prime Minister Hawke's introduction of Medicare. Continuing Labor's tradition of ensuring the accessibility of the health care system, the Labor caucus will again vote against this bill. I opposed this bill in the first instance and when it comes before us to vote on, whether today or later this week, I will vote against it again.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-03-04,"—I too rise today to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This is the second time the Senate has debated the measures in this bill, and it is the second time I have risen to speak on the issue. It is becoming a hallmark of this government to regurgitate the same bill over and over again. But interestingly the government only regurgitates and persists with those bills that affect those members of our community who will suffer and be hurt the most.
Like the previous bill, the purpose of this bill is to introduce into the Health and Ageing portfolio budget measures, outcome 2, a specified increase in the patient copayments for the purchase of drugs subsidised under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. When the government originally introduced this bill last year, it had the outcome of increasing patient copayments by 28 per cent from $22.40 to $28.60 per prescription and safety net threshold payments from $686.40 to $874.90. That was to be effective from January 2003. This translates to an extra $190-odd per year for the cost of essential medicines and an extra $6.20 per script for each of the 300,000 Australians who reach the general safety net. 
In the same manner, this bill seeks to increase concessional copayments by 28 per cent from $3.60 to $4.60 and safety net threshold payments from $187.20 to $239.20, also to be effective from January 2003. We need to ask ourselves how many pensioners and concessional card holders can afford to fork out an extra $1 for each prescription. I would suggest that very, very few could afford to pay. The government calculations attained through Senate estimates proved that the consequences of a proposed increase in the concessional copayment from $3.60 to $4.60 affecting Australian pensioners and concession card holders would result in almost five million prescriptions for essential medicines remaining unfilled. The same calculations showed that Australian families under financial pressure will go without almost half a million prescriptions as a result of the proposed increase in the general copayment from $22.40 to $28.60.
In total, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme calculated by the government will result in families, pensioners and concession card holders going without almost five and a half million prescriptions simply because they cannot afford the increase. And this is from a Prime Minister who fantasises that Australians are relaxed and comfortable. That might be the case for the top end of town, but it is not the case for the average Australian.
Labor rejected this bill the first time, and today we are rejecting it again. The only thing this bill will achieve is to once again leave all Australians, in particular the sickest and poorest Australians, under the peril of not being able to afford the essential medicines they need. Commonsense tells us that essential medicines will keep people healthier longer. The reality is, if prescriptions go unfilled because Australians are unable to afford them, their health will suffer. As a consequence this will lead to greater expenses for medical assistance down the track.
Labor agree that it is essential to deliberate on the value of growth in the PBS, but only through sensible policy. Last year in the budget there were a number of measures that Labor supported and felt were sensible policy. These included increasing the use of generic drugs where appropriate, stopping pharmaceutical fraud both on and by pharmacists and improving the listing procedures for new medicines. Other measures included providing better information to consumers and doctors and increasing the focus on evidence based medicine.
Instead, we are witnessing the consequences of bad decisions made by this government. It is now trying to recoup losses caused by its bad decisions, through false economy, by looking for consumers to pay a larger proportion of the cost of drugs they legitimately need. For the most part, it is looking to concessional patients. This government is banking on 2.8 per cent of pensioner and concession scripts and 1.4 per cent of general scripts going unfilled because people are not able to afford them. Fifty per cent of the $1.1 billion the government wants to save from this copayment increase over four years will come from pensioners.
The true foundation of this bill is to restore the budget bottom line without any consideration or fairness to those most in need. How does the Howard government justify this after making such detrimental mistakes with the PBS in the past, bad mistakes made contrary to wise counsel? I am referring to the blow-out costs created in June 2001 when former Minister Wooldridge listed Celebrex against the recommendations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and did nothing to control the huge costs. The committee recommended that Celebrex be priced at $1 a day. The government failed to follow through on a contract negotiated with pharmaceutical manufacturer Pfizer that would have resulted in the price being halved once a certain number of scripts had been issued. Instead, what resulted was a $140 million blow-out in the first nine months of listing, up from an estimated $40 million. That is $100 million more than was estimated. Celebrex was not the only bad decision made by the government. The antinicotine drug Zyban was also listed by the government against expert advice on cost control mechanisms. 
Another perspective the government has had on the PBS was highlighted in November last year when Labor asked Foreign Minister Downer whether he would rule out putting on the agenda for a free trade agreement with the United States the abolition of Australia's PBS. Mr Downer refused to rule out abolishing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as part of a free trade agreement.
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been in operation for 50 years. It is one of the cornerstones of Medicare and a guarantee for every Australian that essential medicines will be available and affordable. This government is clearly willing to place the health of Australians at risk because of pressure from the United States for Australia to abandon the PBS as a condition of entering into a free trade agreement. We can see that the pharmaceutical industry is again seeking to have the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme put on the table so far as free trade negotiations are concerned. The government should rule out changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as part of those free trade agreement negotiations. The scheme has served this country well.
In summary, on the seventh anniversary of John Howard's election, we have seen bulk-billing go from 80 per cent to 69.6 per cent over a seven-year period. That is an 11 per cent decline in bulk-billing, and over half of that has come in the last 12 months. Now the Minister for Health and Ageing, Senator Patterson, is saying that if this legislation is not passed then more money will be spent on the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme and there will be less money for other areas. Yet if we allow logic to prevail in this scenario what we are likely to see is a shifted burden of cost onto other areas of Commonwealth and state expenditure, most likely through greater hospitalisation for those people unable to afford their prescriptions. Inevitably, other repercussions will include people with untreated infections and sicknesses spreading those infections and sicknesses around schoolyards, offices and workplaces, adding more financial strain when an adult is at home sick and not out working or when a child is out of school and not getting the benefit of education.
What does the government have to say about the consequences for employers when workers are off work? The government is so adamantly pushing the point that the employer needs to be protected and not disadvantaged in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No.2]—which was again rejected yesterday—that I guess the government response would simply be: `Sack them. You're protected.' Labor ardently opposes this bill and sees the time, effort and expense of debating this issue once again in the Senate as the government's political swindle to get, yet again, an opportunity for a double dissolution trigger.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2003-03-04,"—As I am sure most senators in this chamber—if not the Australian public— will recall, the Australian people were on a promise. Of course we have come to understand that some promises are core and some are non-core, but at the time this promise was made in 1996 there was no such distinction. The current Prime Minister told the Australian people that he wanted them to be `relaxed and comfortable'. Here we are seven years on and we find this government taking steps to renege on that promise. How is it that an Australian can feel comfortable and relaxed about the state of health care in this country when costs just keep going up and up? New technologies and procedures mean that we should all feel more comfortable and relaxed about health care today than we did seven years ago. It is one of those things that Australians have come to prize over the years. New cures for diseases, new equipment to treat patients and new hospitals are an ingrained expectation for many of us. Over the course of the last century, we have seen diseases such as polio wiped out through new advancements. New equipment to screen for disease and early identification to increase survivability have been taken for granted.
Health care is one of the most important things to nearly every Australian. If you are sick or a member of your family is sick, you want the best services and facilities that are available. You want to know that Mr Howard's promise, his vision of relaxation and comfort, will be a reality in 2003, especially in the key area of health care. But what we have is one failure after another. Less relaxed but more anxious and less comfortable and greater discomfort is what we have. The coalition government would have us believe that we need to change the way the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme operates by increasing copayments or else the whole system will collapse. We are told constantly that the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] amends the scheme to increase the copayment for general and concessional patients to cover the higher cost of drugs. We are told over and over again that health costs are increasing all the time, and the only policy response from this government is to charge us all more. There is no response that looks at efficiencies within health care, at ways to reduce costs or even to increase funding.  
Over the last seven years, we have had to take out private health insurance before we turn 30 or run the risk of higher premiums later in life. At the time we were told that this approach would relieve pressure on the public hospital system and keep premiums down. Those opposite claim that more people in private health insurance means fewer people in the public hospital system. That was the logic behind the policy, we were told. To do this, we have had to fund the rebates on private health insurance to the sum of billions of dollars each year. This amount increases with each year, but do the premiums stay the same? Of course they do not. The fact that the government's policy forced many Australians to take out health insurance when they did not need or want it was irrelevant. Ideology wanted it and ideology got it. Of course, everyone is shocked and amazed that, when someone has to pay for something they do not really need or want, they demand some form of value for money—they want some kind of return. This meant that people put in claims—lots of claims; more claims than anyone expected or the health funds had budgeted for. This must mean that it worked. However, more claims meant more costs in processing them and more payouts—payouts for all sorts of wonderful things like relaxation music and golf clubs.
Instead of premiums becoming cheaper, the funds put their prices up and this government let them. In fact, the Prime Minister's private health insurance rebate costs Australian taxpayers over $2 billion a year and people are still not getting value for money. The Prime Minister has frightened people into taking out private health insurance by making cover two per cent more expensive for each and every year after a person turns 30, if they had not joined prior to turning 30. His policy increased the profit, though, of private health funds fivefold from $176 million in financial year 1998-99 to $852 million in financial year 2000-01, but people are still not getting value for their money.
In his efforts to frighten people into private health insurance Mr Howard has broken two promises, and people are still not getting value for money. In the lead-up to the last federal election, the Prime Minister said that his policies would make private health insurance more affordable. Mr Howard said that his policies would reduce premiums. Since the federal election, we have seen an 18 per cent increase in premiums for HBF and a 66 per cent increase for excess. Again, in the lead-up to the last election, the Prime Minister said, in what he called an `absolute guarantee' as opposed to a core and non-core promise, that any future increases in private health insurance premiums would require his personal approval. Since the federal election, Mr Howard has wiped his hands of his guarantee and broken his promise. On 11 September last year—perhaps when he thought no-one would notice—the Prime Minister announced that he would allow private health funds to increase their premiums each and every year without any explanation. This broken promise will cost the average Australian family with private health insurance an additional $50 to $100 each and every year. It would seem that must have been another non-core promise. I am sure that all Australians are feeling more comfortable and relaxed about these cost increases!
Medicare bulk-billing is collapsing. If it continues at the same rate, within 10 years it will not be available for any Australian. Medicare—an approach that most Australians felt very comfortable and relaxed about prior to 1996—is now something that they feel quite betrayed about. I am sure it is easy to be comfortable and relaxed when it costs you more and you then have to undertake additional effort to get some of the money back through being privately insured! Prior to 1996, you went to the doctor, they swiped your Medicare card, you signed a form and that was that. In retrospect, we now realise that that must have been more difficult, stressful and inconvenient than what we are forced to do today! That must be why presentations at hospital emergency rooms are increasing at an astronomical rate. 
At the Armadale Kelmscott Memorial Hospital in the eastern suburbs of Perth, the rate of presentations at the emergency rooms increased by 2,700 in the year 2001-02. This is in no way linked to the decline in bulk-billing. We know that because the minister tells us that, so it must be true. People must prefer going to emergency rooms to scheduling a visit to their local doctor. People must prefer sitting in waiting rooms for hours on end to see a doctor in a public hospital to making an appointment at the local practice. This novel approach must mean that people presenting at emergency rooms are more comfortable and relaxed about going there than to their local doctor. The time wasted and the inconvenience are obviously all part of some government relaxation plan that the rest of us are not yet privy to.
Now we have the attack on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Since the Howard government has come to power, over 60 medicines have been removed from the PBS, but the cost of medicines has increased. The Howard government spent all of last year, and now it has spent some of this year, trying to push through legislation to raise the cost of PBS medicines by 30 per cent. This was necessary, the Prime Minister claimed, because PBS costs were spiralling out of control. This was a lie. Government figures released on 30 September last year showed that the Howard government spent $224 million less on the PBS than its estimate for that item in last year's budget. Despite the government's underspend of that $224 million on the PBS, the Prime Minister is still trying to slug the sickest and poorest Australians with a 30 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines.
At the time that this legislation was first introduced, the Labor Party suggested a course of action to the government as a means of saving money without having to increase the copayment. But that suggestion was ignored. The government's option is the only one to be considered. Their approach is to increase the copayment, and that is that. Perhaps there are other approaches. Should we not be looking to see whether there are alternative sources of pharmaceuticals? Should we not be negotiating with drug companies to see what can be done to keep costs down? Why should we simply go along with the prevailing trend in health care, which is that we allow drug companies to set high prices for newer procedures and treatments?
The minister has told us in the past that medicines are expensive, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is extremely generous and there are some courses of drugs that cost thousands of dollars. My question to the drug companies is: why are they so expensive? Of course, I will be told that years and years of research, the cost of getting patents and copyrights, and market developments mean that the drug companies have to charge high prices to get a reasonable return. My concern is what independent analysis of these claims is ever undertaken. Are we being ripped off by drug companies? It is a question that caused no end of discussion in South Africa about certain medication for treating HIV-AIDS. South African authorities sourced cheaper generic medications and then were in legal dispute with the big drug companies. How many other examples of that problem exist? Do we know and, more importantly, do we care? Have we allowed a situation to develop where the health needs of our fellow Australians are being mortgaged to the financial needs of drug companies?
One area that needs to be investigated is how we can source pharmaceuticals on a more cost-effective basis rather than simply paying increasing amounts of money to drug companies. None of the alternative responses are seriously considered by the government as a means of overcoming the problems of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Instead, we get the simplistic approach of simply jacking up the price. Why should any of us be surprised that they take this approach? We see it as yet another example of their basic philosophical premise: they are all about comforting the comfortable and afflicting the afflicted. Whilst this government and this Minister for Health and Ageing are in power, there is no capacity for Australians to be comfortable and relaxed about the state of their health care. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-03-04,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is the second attempt by the coalition government within the past 12 months to undermine one of the most important components of Australia's public health system, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This bill would increase the copayment or the proportion of the cost of prescription medicines that a patient pays by 28 per cent. The government likes to remind us that this amount is as little as an additional $1 per script for concession card holders and $6.20 for everyone else. These proposed increases would take the cost of a script to $4.60 for concession card holders and $28.60 for general patients. We know that around 80 per cent of people who use the PBS are concession card holders. Those who are ineligible for a health care card but who are on low to middle incomes will pay the higher increase proposed in this bill. Modelling by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling a few years ago showed that a flat 25 per cent increase in the copayment—that is less than the percentage rise proposed in this bill—would place a burden on the lowest income earners among general patients, taking their expenditure on pharmaceuticals to an average 8.6 per cent of disposable income. To claim that increasing the copayment by 28 per cent is of little consequence to these people further demonstrates how out of touch this government is with the way many Australians struggle to make ends meet.
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or PBS, is a vital component of our public health system. Its goal is to make necessary medicines available to all Australians. The Treasurer announced the rise in the copayment in the 2002-03 budget. The government asserts that the rise is essential if the PBS is to be placed on a sustainable footing. Without the increase, the government claims, the very future of the PBS is at stake and the listings of new medicines threatened. This claim is ludicrous, as the government knows. What is driving this increase is an ideological obsession with a budget surplus. 
The Australian Consumers Association has calculated that by 2006 the copayment rise will pay 12.4 days of the government's share of PBS costs, or 3.5 per cent of the estimated total. The Australian Consumers Association further calculated that the copayment would need to rise between 10 and 20 per cent every year to maintain its relative share of the total cost of the PBS. This is unacceptable. The copayment has already almost doubled through CPI indexing since the Howard government came to office in 1996. Targeting those on low incomes, the sick and those with chronic conditions to pay substantially more through a direct payment is unsupportable. As the Australian Consumers Association has noted, increasing the copayment does not affect the total amount that the community spends on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; it merely shifts the financial burden and does nothing to improve value for money. Nor will it improve the health of Australians. 
Department of health figures show that a significant proportion of the $1.1 billion that the government anticipates saving over four years will come from a fall in demand for medicines, or five million scripts not being filled. The government either believes there is a dreadful amount of unnecessary prescribing going on—and that increasing the cost of drugs will not address this issue—or is prepared to sacrifice the long-term health of people to improve its budget outcome. Even then the department's figures show that reduced demand caused by the copayment increase will cease by the fourth year. This is not a formula for long-term sustainability. It ignores the benefits to the Commonwealth budget and to the health of the nation in ensuring that people can afford necessary medicines, and it ignores the cost of more serious illness and disability if people cannot afford to take essential medicines. This obsession with the short-term budget position does not even make good economic sense. It fails to appreciate the principle of value for money. Even if the PBS continues to take a growing share of the health budget, this does not automatically mean that it is money poorly spent. On the contrary, a well managed PBS has the potential to save the public money, not to mention the benefits to individual wellbeing. 
The Commonwealth spent $4.8 billion on the PBS in 2001-02, a rise of around 13.6 per cent on the previous year. This is in line with the average annual expenditure growth rate for the past decade. The proportion of funding that Australia allocates to pharmaceutical subsidies is lower than that of other OECD nations. However, the rate of growth in the proportion of funding that Australia allocates to the scheme is greater than that of other OECD nations. There are cost pressures on the PBS. These include expensive new medicines and a community expectation to have access to these drugs. They include drug manufacturers spending a large amount of money to promote their products in ways that are not necessarily beneficial to the Australian public. Drugs are not always prescribed for the conditions for which they were listed, thereby undermining the cost benefits of the particular drug in terms of health outcomes. There are also government-induced pressures, such as the decision to grant access to health care cards which provide the PBS listed drugs at the concessionary rate to as many as 50,000 self-funded retirees in 2001. Pharmaceutical companies have also refused to pass on to the government GST savings, through abolition of the wholesale sales tax, of around $250 million.
It is clear that many facets of the PBS need addressing to ensure it remains a viable scheme. The government has addressed some of these aspects, but spending millions of dollars to tell the public the full cost of PBS listed medicines is of little merit. The government's approach is piecemeal. Several changes were announced in the budget, others have been announced since then and, for all we know, still further measures are in the pipeline following the interdepartmental committee process that has been occurring beyond public scrutiny. The public has been told little about the committee process. The committee was tasked with examining the overall effectiveness of the PBS. The precise terms of reference are cabinet-in-confidence. We do not know why they are such a mystery. The Australian Greens consider it unacceptable to conduct this process in private. This secret review has the potential to lead to changes that affect every Australian. The government continues to insist that the Senate must pass the copayment increase, yet it refuses to tell the public what else it is considering. The fact that the review was conducted while this bill was before the parliament simply strengthens our suspicions that the copayment rise has nothing at all to do with ensuring the viability of the PBS and finding the best means of getting maximum value for money for the public. 
Amid the government's alarmist claims that the PBS is unsustainable, we have seen some troubling proposals emerge from the Australian pharmaceutical industry's lobby group, Medicines Australia. In its submission to the interdepartmental committee, Medicines Australia, among its key messages, stated:
Policy reform needs to transition from the current system to the long-term new world view where those who can afford will assume greater responsibility for their health care and medicine needs.
It suggested different copayment rates based on categories of medicine and excluding high-income earners from the scheme, but allowing them to buy private health insurance to cover their drug costs. This proposal comes from an industry that spends an estimated $750 million each year in Australia to market, promote or advertise to doctors the benefits of the newest and most expensive drugs. The sorts of changes that the industry suggests are at odds with the core qualities of the scheme—that is, being comprehensive, universal and affordable. It concerns us that not once during the debate on the future of the PBS and on this bill in particular has the minister committed the government to maintaining the PBS as a comprehensive and universal scheme. 
There are other ways to approach the matter of the cost of the PBS, such as reconfiguring the financial arrangements that deliver a good return for the Australian public and a fair return for manufacturers. One alternative has been developed by Ian McCauley, a lecturer in public sector finance at the University of Canberra. Under this model, the Australian government would pay a flat licence fee to the manufacturer if it decided to list an item on the PBS. This fee would be designed to cover the largest component of costs to the manufacturer—that is, research and development. A further small payment would be made for the drugs to more accurately reflect the cost of production. These are the sorts of innovative approaches that we need to be examining.
It should come as no surprise that this government considers it acceptable to shift $300 million more of the financial burden of essential medicines to the sick and those on low incomes. The government's record on health is a poor one. It shows little concern for the falling rates of bulk-billing for Medicare services, which cause hardship for millions of Australians and place an intolerable burden on our public hospitals.
After years of neglecting Medicare, the Prime Minister has finally revealed the government's real agenda. He told parliament yesterday that bulk-billing, a critical feature of Medicare, was never intended to be universal. He is trying to rewrite history to justify his plan to turn Medicare into a safety net for the less fortunate. He wants Australia to have a two-tiered health system: charity for the poor, and everyone else gets the health care that they can afford. This is poor social and economic policy. All Australians contribute to the cost of Medicare through the levy and general taxation. We all have a stake in keeping it strong and able to provide good quality health care to all on the basis of need and not income.
Promoting a system that will leave many people unable to afford primary health care will lead to complications, more serious illness and increased personal and public costs. The Prime Minister said Australia could not afford a universal health care scheme, but the government pours billions of dollars of public money each year into subsidising private health insurance. The Australia Institute has calculated that around half of the private health insurance rebate goes to the top 20 per cent of taxpayers and nearly three-quarters goes to the top 40 per cent. This money— some $2.3 billion a year, and rising—has not delivered a single additional hospital bed or theatre or paid for employing health professionals in the public system, the one on which most Australians rely. It pays for insurance, marketing, promotion and, as a report in the Australian Financial Review earlier this year revealed, for large fees for directors of health funds.
In a report released last month, one of the architects of the universal health care system, Professor John Deeble, concluded that, if the money had been spent instead on public hospitals, the same services that were purchased in private hospitals would have been purchased for far less cost. That is because 12 per cent of money paid to private hospital services goes to administration and only 40 per cent is spent directly on health and medical services.
The rebate has failed the government's own tests. It has done nothing to alleviate pressures on public hospitals; in-patient numbers have fallen a fraction of one per cent in 2000-01. It has not kept young people in private cover, even with the financial penalties imposed under the lifetime cover policy, nor has it kept down premiums. The cost of private insurance continues to rise and the proportion of the population with private hospital cover has fallen during the past two years. The government finally appears to have acknowledged the runaway cost of this rebate and it now plans to introduce legislation in this sitting to contain excessive premium rises. It would be better placed, and all Australians would benefit, if it redirected the money to the public system which provides services to all Australians.
We should never forget that the provision of health and medical services is a public good that benefits us all, collectively and individually. None of us will go through life without drawing on these services. Some of us will need them more than others. It is in the interests of all Australians that our public health system is not only on a strong financial footing but that it can deliver essential services to all who need them. 
Private profit has a place in aspects of health and medicine, but profit should not be made at the expense of need and fairness. We must withstand any attempt to undermine the PBS by stealth through, for example, trade negotiations. The long-term sustainability of the PBS lies in a thorough review of all aspects of the scheme, not in a budgetary context and with disregard for other constituent elements of our public health system.
The Australian Greens are proposing a Senate inquiry to undertake a comprehensive review of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to examine the government's assumptions of cost and sustainability, and to consider a range of possible changes to the scheme, including how we fund it. All parties and some Independents have expressed a desire to safeguard the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Our proposed inquiry will contribute to that end and I look forward to the Senate's support for the proposal when it is moved later this week.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-03-04,"—I recently saw a movie called John Q. I had to watch it on video as I was not able to see it when it was released in the cinema.
—Tell us about it!
—Obviously Senator McGauran has not seen it. I invite him to get the video or DVD out and watch it. I am not sure if he has a plasma TV but, in any event, it would be very instructive for Senator McGauran. The movie tells the story of a father in America, fighting for his son to have access to the American health system. The father, played by Denzel Washington, has just found out that his working hours have been cut back in the factory where he works. He is now essentially working casual hours. Obviously his income has been reduced and he has had his car and some possessions repossessed because of his increasingly difficult financial circumstances. Then his son is suddenly diagnosed with a severe heart condition and needs a heart transplant. When the father goes to the hospital to find out about getting this transplant done, he believes he is covered by the relevant health insurance policy that he has been paying into, through his workplace, for years. Then he finds out that the company, unbeknown to him, has downgraded his level of health cover and his son will no longer be able to access the treatment he requires unless the family can come up with a substantial amount of money.
I will not go further other than to say that, in desperation, the father takes dramatic action, which one would hope never to see, where he takes hostages in the hospital, demanding that his son be given the medical treatment he needs. I am pleased to say that the movie has a happy ending, but it is illustrative of a situation that we know exists in other parts of the world, and particularly in the United States health system: that is, if you find yourself in financial difficulties and in need of health care, and you do not have access either to insurance or to a universal health system—such as we have here with Medicare—then you are in serious trouble.
What is happening to health care in this country is that we are heading down the road to that sort of situation. I am going to come to the particular measures contained in the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] in a moment. First, let us place this bill in context. This bill seeks to amend the National Health Act to allow the government to increase prices for pensioners and concession card holders accessing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This is another of those bills that the government has brought in this week that have been rejected by this parliament previously. Only yesterday we dealt with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. That bill also targeted the most needy, or those least able to cope in this country. It attacked employees in small businesses by seeking to deny them the right to take action under the industrial relations legislation in the event that they were dismissed from employment. In a sector of the work force where you find people on the lowest rates of pay, on minimum award rates, who have difficulty getting permanent full-time employment and where there is a high incidence of casual and part-time work, this government is targeting those very workers by removing rights which are enjoyed by all other employees in the country. 
In this bill, people who need to access the health system more regularly than others and who need to obtain prescriptions through the PBS are being hit hardest—particularly pensioners and concession card holders. We are also aware, as we discussed only a couple of hours ago in question time and as was discussed yesterday, that what is happening with bulk-billing in this country is the destruction of Medicare through the continuing decline in the level of bulk-billing. The government is now trying to dig up some quotes from previous Labor ministers to say that Medicare and bulk-billing were only ever intended for the needy, for the less fortunate. Everybody knows that is absolute nonsense. Bulk-billing under Labor governments reached 85 per cent. Bulk-billing operated in virtually the entire field of general practice. Now you can visit country towns in New South Wales, as I pointed out, where you will not find a single doctor bulk-billing in areas where the population comprises retirees, veterans, people on welfare and so on. So even under the government's own changed criteria, bulk-billing is not available for those most in need.
We can see in another area that the changes this government has proposed in the so-called welfare reform agenda are taking away the rights of people with disabilities— and others—to access social welfare and are requiring them to do more in order to access the benefits that they so desperately need. That has been the agenda of this government since it came to office. I can recall, not long after the government got in in 1996, debating proposals by this government to change the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by removing a range of prescription drugs from that list. What did the government choose? It chose drugs that would be prescribed for treating blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes, and drugs that would be prescribed for people who needed to take antidepressants. They were areas where large numbers of prescriptions were written, as we know. People, particularly those with some form of mental illness or depression, were suddenly being told that there was a limit on the number of prescriptions that they could have per year and that there was going to be a reduction in the availability of drugs that they could be prescribed that were subsidised through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It was one of the most disgraceful proposals ever to come from a health minister—to target people suffering from depression. Fortunately, the government saw the error of its ways and, after a campaign, changed its proposal and exempted those particular drugs from being removed from the list.
There is a history of this government targeting those who are least able to afford it. When the government gets into economic difficulty, when it has to try to keep the budget in surplus or to pay for some of the other programs that have run over budget or for commitments that it has made, such as the potential war in Iraq, the government looks around and says, `Where can we raise the money quickly and with the least fight-back?'—to pick a word that has gone down in the lexicon of the Liberal Party. It picks on the weakest, those on the lowest incomes, those finding it hard to keep work or to obtain employment, those who are on welfare and those who may be age pensioners and so on. If you pick out the areas—unfair dismissal, disabilities, reform to social welfare and now the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the pattern is all the same. Why does the government do that? It does it because it knows no other way. It does it because it is the easy way out. It thinks: `We need a few more million to keep the budget bottom line up, so what will we do? We will go and hit people who are accessing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and those who are doing it tough—more so than the general community—such as pensioners and concession card holders.'
What does this bill do? It directly attacks Australian families and pensioners who need access to vital medicines. It is clear that it will make some medicines simply unaffordable. It will dramatically increase the financial pressure on Australian families. The proposal in this bill is to increase Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments by almost 30 per cent. 
—It is still the best system in the world.
—It still is the best system in the world, Senator McGauran! Senator McGauran is actually saying that no matter how hard the government tries to make it the worst system in the world, it still manages to be the best system in the world. Senator McGauran, I hope that you do not win the fight here. I hope that you do not actually succeed in making it the worst system in the world. I will accept that there are countries throughout the world that have far worse health systems than this country, even under your stewardship. But that should not be the benchmark. The benchmark should be what we have always had in this country and how we can make it better, not how we can reduce it to some lowest common denominator that you may have in mind, Senator McGauran. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, the way that your government is going about it, Senator McGauran, you may actually achieve your objective of making it the worst system in the world. But I hope you do not, and we are here to make sure you do not.
The Australian people will not let this government do that. This is a real issue out there in the community. People may have their minds focused at the moment, obviously, on the serious international issues that are occurring at the moment, but they have not forgotten about the problems here in Australia in health, education, employment, aged care and so on. They will hold this government accountable when the time comes. This bill will increase the copayments by 30 per cent. It will bring in an extra $1.2 billion over the next four-year period. That is $1.2 billion sucked out of the pockets of those least able to afford it. Almost five million prescriptions, it is estimated, for essential medicines will not be able to be funded under the proposed changes to the scheme. It is clear, if you read the evidence that came out in the Senate estimates hearings, that this increase in the concessional copayment will result in many Australian pensioners and concession card holders being much worse off. That is this government's prescription— if I can use a bad pun—for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. 
We understand that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the great hallmarks of the Australian health system. It is a pillar upon which our health system—which has been regarded internationally as the best in the world—stands. Along with Medicare and the public hospital system, working with the private hospital system, the PBS is an integral part of the fabric of the Australian health system. It is something that Labor governments and the Labor Party have always supported and will always fight to maintain. We introduced Medibank. The Liberal coalition government got rid of it. We introduced Medicare, and the current Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, promised to destroy it. On each occasion, the Australian public have given the coalition parties the message that they will not accept any downgrading of our health system— Medicare, the PBS or other components of it. And they will not accept it on this occasion. We will oppose this legislation. It will go down. If the government has any sense, it will put it in the dustbin along with its inequitable proposals on unfair dismissal laws and start focusing on the real issues—that is, how to assist Australian families to ensure that we maintain the health system that they deserve.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-03-04,"—At the outset, I must say that it is disappointing, but not unpredictable, to see the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] back in the Senate. In the context of its reintroduction, it is important to remember that this is not a bill about improving health outcomes; it is a bill designed to generate misinformation and fear about the sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is also a bill about a government shifting the pain for its own mismanagement of the PBS to its people, its health consumers. 
The PBS is largely a preventative health strategy. Medications provided through the scheme keep people healthy, keep them out of hospital and keep them engaged in the community. For over 50 years, we have had a PBS that is the envy of the world. It is a scheme that many countries would like to emulate. It is recognised internationally as an effective health measure that is affordable both to the individual patient and to the community through their government. And it is designed to encourage a viable pharmaceutical research and manufacturing industry here in Australia. 
For over 50 years, the PBS has delivered on those objectives successfully. But this government is intent on deconstructing our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the scheme that has received such international acclaim. By increasing costs to the patient, through increasing the copayment and the safety net threshold, which this legislation provides for, the bill undermines the PBS by undermining the principles that underpin it. The principles of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are, firstly, universal access— that is, it is only fair that every Australian should have access to essential medication. Secondly, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is designed to be comprehensive— that is, access to a wide range of medications should be provided to meet the variety of needs in the community. Thirdly, the PBS is designed to deliver responsible costs to the community—that is, a drug is not listed unless its benefits outweigh the cost to the community.
The government, through this legislation, is attacking the PBS on two fronts. Firstly, it has attacked the independence of the listing process in a range of ways. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, representing independent expertise, has traditionally assessed drugs prior to their listing and placing on the PBS to ensure that they meet the community benefit criteria. Under the former health minister Dr Wooldridge, as we all know, we saw the independence of the PBAC undermined by the appointment of a pharmaceutical lobbyist to the committee, which led to the subsequent resignation of a number of long-serving committee members. This was an inappropriate action by the former minister that I am sad to say has not been overturned.
The government has allowed interference in what should be a robust process, at arms length from the political process. The blow-out in the cost of some pharmaceuticals— notably, Celebrex and, to a lesser extent, Zyban—because of the manner in which they were listed resulted in increased costs to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Traditionally, price volume agreements have been used to manage costs, in which an increase in volume is offset by a reduction in price paid to the manufacturer. However, this sensible practice was not adopted by the government in the case of Celebrex, for one, with significant impacts on the PBS budget.
More recently, we have seen the Prime Minister responding to a campaign run by Mr Alan Jones on his radio program about Glivec, a drug for sufferers of chronic myeloid leukemia, and it being listed outside the policy framework soon after. Let us remember that the health minister said on ABC radio on 5 September 2002:
When a company wants to have a drug put on the PBS, it applies to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. They then advise the Government as to its cost effectiveness. If it's over $10 M I have to take the recommendation to cabinet ...
and she went on—
At the moment I don't have any recommendations before cabinet.
On 10 September, five days later, on the Alan Jones program, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said:
I am very pleased to tell you that later this morning Kay Patterson, the Health Minister, will be putting out a statement indicating that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council has recommended the listing of Glivec for the early stage of treatment, and the recommendation has been accepted by the Government.
The cost of Glivec in a full year is more than $10 million and under the government's policy it should have gone to cabinet for approval. But it did not. It is clear to me and to the pharmaceutical industry and to health professionals that due process in that case was not followed and that the Prime Minister intervened in the proper process as a direct result of Mr Jones's interest in Glivec. The process of the listing of most drugs takes many months from start to finish, but we were in the middle of an election, weren't we? 
All of us here in this place get correspondence both from constituents and from the pharmaceutical industry advocating the listing of certain drugs on the PBS. Our answer to those requests should be that due and proper process of analysis of the costs and benefits should be followed and that interference in that process is inappropriate. But it is increasingly harder to defend the process when it is evident to all that there has been from time to time political intervention in that process.
The government is attacking the affordability of the PBS, not to the government itself but to average Australians. This government, the highest taxing government in our history, says we cannot afford the PBS, a centrepiece of Australia's health care system. The government says that it can no longer afford the costs of the PBS and so its policy response is to make it unaffordable to the average Australian. We need to remember that the argument the government is proffering to support its position is the discredited Intergenerational Report delivered as part of the last budget. The Intergenerational Report is not based on sound Department of Health and Ageing planning advice but ostensibly on advice from Treasury. It is regarded widely as a political document, not a planning document. The assumptions underpinning the modelling on the PBS in the Intergenerational Report are widely understood as a joke. What is so sad is that the government is trying to make the public believe that Australia cannot afford the PBS because of the long predicted changes in the age of the population when it is in fact its own mismanagement of the listing processes that has caused much of the blowout.
A simulation by NATSEM, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, of PBS expenditure in the year 2020 found that price increases would have a much more significant impact on the PBS growth in expenditure than an ageing population. In fact, management of the spiralling costs of new technology is a far more significant issue in ensuring sustainability of the PBS than an ageing population. Sure, there is an increasing array of more expensive drugs to be considered for listing, but what you will not hear those in government talking about is the cost-benefit analysis of a drug's listing and the importance of mechanisms like price volume agreements to manage leakage. When a drug is listed a cost-benefit analysis is undertaken on new medications. This is because the PBS is a preventative health initiative as it keeps people out of more expensive care like hospitals and aged care facilities. So when a drug is being considered for listing an estimation of the cost of the drug and the likely benefits in terms of savings to the health care system in total are made. Drugs are not listed without a positive cost-benefit analysis.
The second stage is to ensure that the cost assumptions are met, that there will not be blow-outs in the cost of the medication to the PBS. When a drug is listed there is an argument with the manufacturer that a price will be paid for an initial quantity that is expected to produce maximum benefits to the broader population in Australia. When prescribing goes beyond the estimated usage of the medication then leakage starts to occur. In many cases the drug is being prescribed for those for whom it was not listed. 
It has been estimated that leakage—that is, the prescribing of new and expensive medicines to patients with conditions not subsidised under the PBS restrictions for those drugs—costs the government up to $1 billion every year. One mechanism to prevent this happening is what is called a price volume agreement. When a drug's use starts to blow out the manufacturer receives less money for those additional sales. This takes away the incentive to promote the drug to users outside the target population. The government's move away from price volume agreements, and its general failure to look at savings for the PBS at the manufacturing and prescribing end of the supply chain, are the main reasons we are here today having this debate. The problem with the PBS is not, as the Intergenerational Report would have us believe, that the population is ageing, but far more due to this government's mismanagement of the scheme. But what it wants to do to solve those problems is to hit up Australian families. The minister says she wants to save the PBS by making it too expensive for the average Australian. Where is the logic in that?  
Increasing copayments undermines the integrity of the PBS because it makes it increasingly difficult for Australian families to access affordable medications. Families are struggling already. Many cannot afford to see a doctor because of the bulk-billing rates. In the electorate of Herbert in North Queensland, the bulk-billing rates sit at 54.7 per cent for the September quarter. It is one of the worst rates in Queensland. It has plummeted 11 per cent in the last two years. For a visit to a general practitioner, the out-of-pocket expense of the copayment has increased 23.8 per cent in the last two years. The average out-of-pocket expense for a GP visit at the moment is $15.98. There is a similar situation in the electorate of Dawson, also in North Queensland, where the bulk-billing rates sit at 65.7 per cent and the out-of-pocket expense to see a GP is $15.13.
Those statistics paint a very sad and sorry picture for the people of North Queensland. It is becoming increasingly difficult to see a doctor and, when you get a consultation, it is becoming more and more expensive. And now the government wants to hit families further for their medication. This legislation will increase the PBS copayments by 28 per cent to $28.60 for general patients and to $4.60 for concessional patients. The safety nets will also increase to $874.90 for general patients and to $239.20 for concessional patients. If you add these increases together with the cost of this government's 1996 increases, you have a 70 per cent increase in the cost of essential medicines for families and pensioners. Under these PBS price increases, we risk people self-prescribing. Anyone with children knows that children often get sick at the same time. A working family with, say, three children with ordinary common illnesses, such as a cold or the flu, is now going to pay up to $85.80 to get the appropriate medication to assist those children. That is a lot of money in one hit from the ordinary family budget.
We need to understand that the PBS is designed as a preventative health measure. Commonsense tells us that those on low incomes will be the most disadvantaged by the government's copayment increases as they will add to these out-of-pocket expenses. But we do not simply have to rely on commonsense. Published research supports what commonsense tells us. The Monash University study that I discussed earlier found that, where high copayments must be incurred to access services, those on low incomes will tend to underutilise needed care, both reducing their health status and potentially creating more costly needs downstream. There are both efficiency and equity implications of the policy to increase copayments.
A 1998 study by NATSEM found that those on low incomes were the most disadvantaged when they modelled a 25 per cent increase in the PBS copayment and safety net. NATSEM found that general patients— that is, those who are not on health care cards—would spend 8.6 per cent of their disposable income on essential medicines. Given that the government is seeking a 30 per cent increase, we could expect prescribed drugs to be costing this group up to 10 per cent of their disposable income. These people, general patients, are the people who have been described as Howard's battlers. These are the working poor with children at home. No wonder they are battling when they are spending almost $30 a week on essential medicines.
This legislation clearly undermines the universality principle of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under this legislation, not everyone will have access to affordable medication. This policy is not cost effective and it is not healthy. A Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that is administered effectively and efficiently—operating under the guiding principles that I outlined earlier—is not a burden to the community. In fact, as we know, it produces benefits for the community and that is why we are increasingly living longer and healthier lives. The Australian government, with an ageing population and a declining birth rate, should be doing all it can to keep people healthy and actively making a productive contribution to society for as long as they can. 
Sustaining the PBS is essential to ensuring a secure future for all Australians. However, this legislation attacks the universality of the PBS by making medicines too expensive for many in the community, and it hits the consumer for the failure of the Howard government to effectively administer the cost-effectiveness of the PBS. This will effectively undermine the comprehensiveness of the system. We have a government attacking every principle that underpins the PBS. Australians value the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme just as they value Medicare. If the Howard government wants a double dissolution election on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, I say bring it on.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",IND,2003-03-04,"—In debating this legislation—the Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], which is designed to increase the cost of medications for Australians—I would like to make four points: firstly, to look at the history of the PBS and why it was originally put in place; secondly, to look at the pressures on it; thirdly, to look at what the government is already doing; and, finally, to look at some issues surrounding the government's attempts to increase copayments at this point in time.
Firstly, let us look at the history of the PBS. The PBS has been in operation in Australia now for over 50 years, and it is a scheme that is envied by many other countries around the world as they struggle with some of the pressures that we are facing due to the increasing cost of medications. It was originally set up to provide equitable access to necessary medication. Up until 1950, there had been some medications made available free of charge to pensioners and war veterans. From that, changes were made to provide a list of 139 `lifesaving and disease preventing drugs'. These were made available free of charge to the whole community. I do not think there are many of us here today that could think back to when drugs were actually free of charge.
The idea of a copayment was adopted 10 years later in 1960. It was five shillings for general patients and hardly supposed to be a major source of funding for the scheme. More likely, from what I have read, it was to flag to patients that there was a cost for the medications they were using and therefore they should be used wisely. Most importantly, back in those days there was no copayment for pensioners. This lasted until the Hawke-Keating government introduced one in 1990 at a cost of $2.50 a script. Between 1983 and 1996 the Labor government was responsible for lifting PBS contributions for general patients by 320 per cent. This certainly has created problems for those families who just miss out on health care cards or who have family members with episodic or continuing illnesses. The government's web site says:
The Commonwealth Government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) helps improve the health of all Australian residents by ensuring they have access to necessary and lifesaving medicines at an affordable price.
That is the issue at the heart of the debate that we are having today. I argue strongly that medications are moving out of that affordable range for many low-income families, particularly those families who just miss out on health care cards. Basically, the scheme was set up to make sure we could all get the medications we need and that not only the wealthy could get the latest medication.
When we debated this bill last time I noted some of the specific pressures that had led this government to try to put up charges in the last budget. I lamented the way Treasury seems to deal with the health budget, looking at the PBS as a silo, seeing a large amount of money being used and thinking, `Don't worry about that, we will just take a few million dollars here and another couple of hundred million dollars there.' But some of the pressures are long-term pressures, not just ones that are spotted during a budget process, and they go beyond specific ones relating to those two drugs that drove the very rapid and sharp blip on the screen at the time of the last budget. 
One of the key pressures is the new and more expensive drugs. Some drugs are meant only to target a very small and precise group within the population, so their cost is not a big issue; but for those drugs that are more generally and widely available, such as those for arthritis, that can mean tens of millions of dollars being added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I stress here that any drug has to be proven to be cost effective before it can be listed. It does not just have to do what the manufacturers claim by way of treating or curing the illness. It has to be cost effective. The government has already moved in and is specifically targeting the cost blow-out.
The next obvious reason for pressure is that the population is ageing. The population is a lot more fussy about quality of life issues as it ages. Modern medicine has taken us down the road of more very expensive but successful drugs that have replaced other procedures, particularly surgery. The final reason for pressure is that more people have access to health care cards. This was a specific issue that the government did not budget for when they made the decision to extend health care cards to self-funded retirees—a move that I do not question at all— but they should have budgeted for it and made allowances for the fact that these people, being elderly retirees, were going to be fairly heavy users of the PBS. Therefore, the government should not have been as fussed as they were about the part of the increase that was attributed to more people having access to the PBS.
Those are the only problems I will deal with today. I will move on and look at what the government is already doing. I congratulate this government—indeed, I congratulate the former government and the former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge—for starting and continuing with better prescribing campaigns and other measures. The swiping of Medicare cards was introduced to make sure that those accessing medication were Australians who were entitled to access medication. I know the government now gets a lot more information, and some of that information will enable them to more tightly target medications to those Australians who need it, to limit excessive use and to further restrict wastage.
The price-volume agreements have already been discussed in this chamber. Some would argue that the process is now getting a little too tight. Price-volume agreements are a process by which a government tries to limit the cost of medication by driving down the price it is prepared to pay the drug companies for their new drugs. This was the problem with those two specific drugs that were discussed today and the last time we dealt with this legislation. I can say, from looking through some of the recent rulings and measures that are now being taken, that it certainly now is a very tight process. The impact of all of that has yet to wash through the system.
The government has done a number of other things—a crackdown on pharmacy fraud, wider use and availability of generic medication, restrictions on doctor shopping and tighter restrictions on prescribing. These restrictions upset some doctors, and I can understand their frustration in constantly having to seek approval for the use of some medications, but this is aimed at targeting medication specifically at those who can most benefit from them. Then there has been the introduction of the lifestyle scripts, something I have been working on in this chamber for eight or nine years. The system is not fully under way, but it is well on the way. I look forward to being able to assess the results of the system of lifestyle scripts as doctors are able to use them to support what they tell patients by writing down on a script, similar to the script given for medication, some lifestyle suggestions relating to diet or exercise, giving up smoking or reducing alcohol consumption. It is up to the doctor to reinforce what they are telling their patients by putting it in writing. We note that, since the last budget and since the cries of the Treasurer that the PBS was out of control, expenditure has fallen in some months. For example, expenditure in March last year was about 7½ per cent down on March of the year before—and so it jumps around. We will not really know exactly what impact all these measures have until they are given the chance to work. 
I will finally look at some issues surrounding the government's proposal to increase copayments. Copayments already go up every year—they go up with inflation, something this chamber decided to do several years ago. We need to look at the impact of a large increase, which is certainly what the government is talking about. The government itself admits that people are going to think twice before they go to the doctor. Indeed, it is one of the reasons for putting up the prices. If they decide that they really have to go to the doctor, despite the fact that the doctor is not bulk-billing anymore, and they get perhaps two or three scripts, they then have to ask the question, especially if they do not have a health care card: `Can I actually pay for two or three scripts in one hit?' Pharmacists are being asked by people: `Which script is the one I have to have tonight? I can come back on Thursday when I get paid and fix you up for the other two.' In some cases I find pharmacists are running up debt because patients are not able to find the money immediately out of their pocket, particularly if they have already had to put $35, $40 or $45 on the table in order to see the GP and then get the paperwork to claim some of that back from Medicare.
Research by the Health Economics Unit at Monash University has shown that some pensioners are already paying up to 12 per cent of their income on medical copayments. This is a mixture of costs—some of it because of reduced bulk-billing and some of it because of the pharmacy bills they already have to pay—and there is a range of other health costs, such as pain killers, which are not on the PBS. So many elderly patients are already finding a large slice of their income is going on health costs. The federal Department of Health and Ageing estimates that pensioners and other concession card holders will avoid filling about five million scripts if these changes are introduced. I am sure some of that is fair enough. There are people who probably should not have even bothered to go to the doctor, who have spent a day or so in bed and taken some time to get over whatever the illness was. But I am sure just as many, if not more, would genuinely have needed that medication. What will happen, as sometimes does now, is that they end up in the queues in our public hospitals.
If fewer scripts are filled, obviously the PBS silo is going to show at least some stabilisation or a decrease, but this will not be saving any money from the health system as a whole. Many people will end up needing more urgent treatment and far more expensive treatment. The government claims to put so much emphasis on primary care, and we can see some very good examples, such as the immunisation programs, continued funding of antismoking campaigns et cetera. But I do not understand why a government that has done some positive work in the preventative area now wants to turn around and undermine a lot of that by planning these changes. Indeed, I would argue that, if this were to go ahead, it would largely be a cost shift over to the states because it would be in our public hospitals that the bulk of this would be picked up.
In closing, I say, with all the changes and positive measures the government has put in place to assist doctors with better prescribing practices, to target medications to those Australians who need them and will benefit from them and to reduce wastage and fraud, let us give them some time to work. If we then have a situation where the increase in the PBS is considerably more than inflation—I think we have to allow for inflation, but if it is still considerably more—then let us look at other ways of funding this. Let us look at a fairer way of funding this than targeting those most in need, who are the sickest and poorest members of our community.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-03-04,"—in reply—I almost feel that it is not really worth while standing up, because I am not going to convince anybody to change their mind, but I really need to put on the public record—
 (Senator Bolkus)—Sit down then, if you like.
—I do not need your advice from the chair, thank you. I will just reiterate, to remind people, that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has grown by around 14 per cent every year for the past 10 years, from just over $1 billion in 1990 to $4.5 billion or $4.6 billion in 2002, and it is still growing. I think it is actually the fastest growing part of the health budget, one of the things that drives up the cost of health care more than almost anything else because of its rate of growth, which has been well in advance of major health programs such as Medicare and public hospitals. In 2001-02 it grew by around 10 per cent. People have acknowledged here some of the things that have been brought in to try and rein that in— for example, swiping the Medicare card. However lacking in absolute integrity the card is, at least that began to get some measure of whether people actually had a card. By 1 May this year we will have a year's worth of data that we can investigate. I will be very interested if there are some people who have had sufficient Celebrex for five years in one year. I think most people would agree that that would be like being in receipt of an overpayment in social security. 
I think most Australians would agree that, if a drug is one that a person takes on a regular basis, we should subsidise enough for a 12-month period but not enough for five people to have taken in a year. So we will be looking at that data for ways to ensure that people get the medicine they require, but not more than they require because they are hoarding it or because they are just losing track of what medicine they have got, especially when they get it after the safety net and have got it for nothing. It may sometimes not have the same value then, and they pop it away and think: `I will just start again next year because it's too hard,' or `I think things have changed,' or `I don't know how to use it.' We have to educate people that hoarding medication is putting enormous pressure on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, that giving it to someone else who is not on a health care card is also unfair, and that sending it to a relative somewhere overseas is inappropriate. Those sorts of measures will actually help to maintain that growth.
The National Prescribing Service has been running a number of campaigns on the better use of medicines. One of them is `Common colds need commonsense'. That is being run to try and reduce the overuse or inappropriate use of antibiotics. About a third of upper respiratory episodes or infections are viral and do not respond to antibiotics; therefore, antibiotics are inappropriate. We have to educate the public not to expect that when they go to visit a doctor they will always get antibiotics. One GP, for example, has been using a technique of providing people with a script, especially if it is near a weekend, and advising them that it really is not necessary for them to take antibiotics. She gives them all the things they should do for a cold—rest, lots of fluid et cetera—and then says, `If these symptoms occur you might have this script filled.' The use of antibiotics amongst her patients has been reduced. That was an interesting little study I read last year.
So individual doctors are attempting to do things that will reduce the use of antibiotics. That not only saves on the PBS, which is a factor, but also reduces the likelihood that we are going to have more and more bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. That is very undesirable and also very concerning as our population ages and we find that we have antibiotics which are ineffective in dealing with resistant bacterial infection.
The PBS grew around 10 per cent, but it still remains very high. It is more than three times higher than inflation. While the government welcomes the moderation in the growth, which vindicates, as I have said, the measures we have put in place, it would be foolish to believe that it lessens the need to take further action to make the PBS sustainable. A short, blinkered view, such as the view that we have seen displayed here this afternoon and yesterday by the Labor Party, by the Democrats, by the Greens and by the Independents, ignores the reality that if spending continues to increase at the current rate the cost of the PBS will nearly double to about $9 billion by 2007. Currently the Commonwealth spends $31 billion on health. By 2007 we will be spending $9 billion on pharmaceutical benefits alone. We cannot let this continue if we are going to continue to provide every Australian with the latest medicines when they become available at affordable prices. 
In 2002 medicines worth around $100 million were added to the PBS, many for common, painful, debilitating and life-threatening conditions. I must add here that I found Senator McLucas's comments about Glivec totally unacceptable when she said it did not go through due process. It went absolutely right through the due process. The Prime Minister has every right, once it has been recommended by PBAC and I bring him the PBAC recommendation, to make a decision, not cabinet. Senator McLucas implied that there was something done that was inappropriate. I wanted to make sure that Glivec was on by October, the date when the new schedule comes out—I cannot remember the date exactly—so people in the early stages of chronic myeloid leukaemia could get access to Glivec before Christmas. That is why I did it. Senator McLucas said that we were in the middle of an election. I do not know what she was talking about. I thought it was a humane and caring thing to do to have the Prime Minister make the decision, which he has every right to do, in lieu of cabinet to ensure that we got it onto the schedule so that people who had failed to respond to first-line treatment could have access. It has been demonstrated that for people in the early stages of chronic myeloid leukaemia this medication is efficacious. I do not usually find Senator McLucas unfair and unreasonable, but I thought that those comments were totally inappropriate and ill-informed.
Glivec costs $6,600 a month per script. People on a health care card did get it for $3.60; it is now $3.70 because of the increase in the CPI. Non-concessional card holders get it for $23.10. It is almost the only country in the world where people get access to that sort of medication for that cost. If they are on a health care card, once they have had 50 scripts they receive that medication for free. There are many other medications lining up for approval on the PBS. It is going to put a greater and greater strain on the PBS. In the not too distant future it is quite possible that one single medicine for the treatment of a common condition, such as arthritis or diabetes, might cost taxpayers $1 billion in a single year. That is the sort of demand that is going to be placed on the PBS. I can assure senators that the Howard government is absolutely committed to sustaining the PBS, but it is ridiculous for anyone to argue that 10 per cent growth represents a sustainable situation when it is going to cost $9 billion in 2007.
When this measure was introduced in the budget, I did lots of talkback and I found people were not angry. Some of them said, `I think we should contribute more.' Last year when I first became Minister for Health and Ageing and I saw these figures I asked for some research to be done. We asked people how much they thought an expensive drug was and how much they thought they contributed. I cannot remember the exact questions, but that is the essence of them. People on a health care card thought an expensive medication was $20 and it was being subsidised. People not on a health care card thought that they were paying for the drug and cross-subsidising people on a health care card. They had no idea that the most commonly prescribed medication on the PBS costs $80 per person per month. The health care card holder now gets it for $3.70 until they have 50 scripts and then they and their family get it for free. The non-health care card holder, a general concession, pays $23.10, and once they have got to about 31 scripts they get it for free. I am talking about the most commonly prescribed medication— a statin—costing $80 per person per month. We have to somehow get a grip on reality: there are going to be more and more of those medications. 
Labor can sit over there piously giving us a lecture on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, but they went out in their last year in government and borrowed $10 billion. The year before that they borrowed billions, and the year before that they borrowed billions. They were borrowing money from overseas to pay for things like the PBS. To pay for us to have medication they were borrowing from the next generation. We cannot afford to do that. At some stage we have to all understand that we have to pay our own way and not leave the next generation with a debt. They borrowed $10 billion in the last year. We could have played merry hell paying that back. We have paid back $60 billion and I think: what could I have done with that $60 billion and with the interest on the loan? I ask Senator Lees, since we both have an interest, what could have been done in health prevention. But, no, the profligate Labor Party was spending the next generation's money. 
I came into this place to give kids the sort of opportunity I had when I grew up, when this country was not in debt and the world was my oyster. That is why I came in here. It was not to spend the next generation's money. That is what you people are doing right now, by the decision that you are making. It is even worse, because we introduced a measure that meant that the pension and benefits would go up in relation to average weekly earnings, which is greater than the CPI. The PBS goes up by the CPI. So every time the PBS and the pension go up, they go up at differential rates. I am sure there will be people out there listening; I do not know whether the people here will get the drift of what I am saying. At the beginning, the proportion of my pension that I pay on pharmaceuticals is a constant figure. Every time the pension goes up by MTAWE and the PBS goes up by the CPI, the next group of people, or the next cohort or even the same people, pay a smaller—
—I suggest that you listen to this because it is quite complex and I hope you get it.
—People pay a smaller proportion of their pension each time they get an increase—
—Senator Crossin, I know that you do not want to hear this, because it hurts.
 (Senator Bolkus)—Order, Senator Crossin! Please direct your comments through the chair, Minister.
—In four or five years time—and if we cannot get this through we will keep putting it up—people will pay a smaller part of their pension and a smaller part of their income on their pharmaceuticals. At some point in time, the chickens will come home to roost and light will dawn on the other side, and they will have to increase the PBS copayment. Those people will then be paying a much bigger contribution than they will need to as part of their pension. 
As I was trying to explain in question time the other day, if I have a family with small children the highest use of the PBS is in the first four or five years. So I am in the period where my income or my welfare benefit is going up by MTAWE and the PBS is going up by the CPI. When the chickens come home to roost, the copayment has to go up significantly and the next generation of people with children aged one to five—they are in the same real generation; it is an intragenerational unfairness—will pay a significantly higher proportion of their income, welfare payment or family benefit on pharmaceutical benefits. That, to me, is unfair.
What motivates me in this place is trying to make sure that people have the same sorts of opportunities that I had when I was growing up—which is fair—and the same relative cost in terms of their income, as best we can do that across and within generations. Tonight you are not doing justice to people who at some stage will have to pay that increased copayment. It is unsustainable that we do not have a moderate increase to allow us to put on the PBS medications that are coming up for arthritis, and the Glivec medication, which costs $6,600 per person per month. I want to be able to do that, but I also want to make it fair for people across generations and, as I said, within generations. But maybe that argument is too hard for some people. I have been through it with Senator Allison and I have been through it with Senator Lees. Senator Allison has the view that we should not do it, but it seems fair to me that we make a decision, for example, that a percentage of the pension—it might be one per cent or 0.98 per cent—is contributed. Now it fluctuates. It goes down and then it goes up again when there is an increase in the copayment, and it is not fair across and within small cohorts of a generation. 
We heard all this pious nonsense from the other side of the chamber. I need to get the facts on the table. Under Labor, from 1983 to 1996 the general PBS patient copayment increased by 420 per cent—from $4 to $16.80. In 1986, Labor imposed a one-off increase in the general copayment of $5; in 1990, they imposed another one-off increase of $4. The average annual increase was 17.75 per cent. Do you know what? The coalition supported that because we try to behave in a fiscally responsible way. We most probably got up and complained about it, said how terrible it was and said that the then government could not organise themselves out of a paper bag, but then we agreed to it because we were fiscally responsible. 
When there comes a time that we have a problem putting medications on the PBS because they blow it out, I will sit back and say, `Thank you, Labor Party; thank you, Senator Lees; thank you, Senator Allison and the Democrats; and thank you, Greens and Independents. Thank you for being so absolutely irresponsible.' We are asking for a modest increase of a dollar for concession card holders and a 50-script limit for a family safety net. We are asking people to pay an extra $50 over a year when they have a MTAWE increase in their allowances or pensions. We hope to have it in by July so that those people who are very sick will be in the safety net, will be getting their medications for free and would have had five to six months warning before the increase. I had thought that through.
I hope that Senator Allison is squirming and I hope that Senator Lees is squirming. I do not think the Labor Party have the conscience to squirm. They increased the PBS copayment, and they sit on the other side and go on with a whole lot of pious nonsense that would make you think that they had never introduced the copayment and they had never actually increased it. But no, they used to borrow to pay for their excesses. We believe that the Australian public and the government have to face the fact that we need to pay our own way in each generation.
The Intergenerational Report always comes up in these sorts of debates. We are accused of having introduced it just because of the PBS. That is not the case. It was introduced under the Charter of Budget Honesty, and every government will have to give an account of itself every five years about the levers. I tell you what: I will remind everyone, every time they look at an intergenerational report, that one of the reasons that we have a problem with the PBS is that people on the other side of the chamber failed to do something that was a little difficult but right and absolutely fair—and fair to those people who will come on and need to use the PBS in the future. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS— BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-03-04,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002 is a seemingly innocuous bill. However, it does have an interesting history. This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives last year and was amended by the government 24 hours prior to being debated. In spite of the late notice of the amendments, Labor did not oppose this bill in the other place. The bill relates to four distinct issues. It proposes changes to the operation of the transitional rules applying to compulsory third party, or CPT, insurance; it provides an exemption for interest withholding tax, IWT, in relation to certain international transactions; it exempts from capital gains tax compensation payments in relation to the German Forced Labour Compensation Program; and it enables products issued by friendly societies to have the same tax treatment as similar products issued by other bodies. Today I will focus on the IWT exemptions.
The bill makes a number of exemptions in relation to interest withholding tax. The bill, in its original form, proposed an exemption for the interest paid on nostro accounts held by authorised deposit-taking institutions. Nostro accounts are foreign currency accounts maintained by certain financial institutions with foreign banks for the purpose of settling foreign currency transactions. The government amendments extended the original exemption to nostro accounts held by financial institutions which are not ADIs but which conduct banking business with the public. The amendment to exempt nostro accounts from interest withholding tax aims to reduce the compliance burden on financial institutions and facilitate business conducted by financial institutions. The explanatory memorandum says:
The compliance costs imposed on financial institutions in meeting the IWT obligation are very high relative to the amount of tax collected. Exempting interest paid on nostro accounts from IWT will eliminate the compliance costs imposed in meeting the current IWT obligation associated with these accounts.
Labor support the principle of reducing the compliance burden on business. However, we support this principle for small business too. The Howard government are only interested in reducing the compliance burden on big business. They consistently ignore the burden on small business. Last week the Yellow Pages Business Index—Small and Medium Enterprises found that one of the most significant criticisms by small business of the federal government is that there is too much paperwork due to the GST. The same study also found that small business' most significant criticism of federal government policies was that the federal government were only concerned with big business. It is not just the Labor Party saying that the Howard government's main priority is big business: the Yellow Pages survey shows that it is everyday small business people who can see that the government's mates at the big end of town get the priority whenever they make a call. They can see that the government has a two-tiered approach to Australian business. Big business gets all the breaks and even gets legislative help to reduce the compliance burden, but no such luck for small business. The Howard government are saying to small businesses who are struggling under a mountain of paperwork, `You're on your own.' The Howard government's main priority is big business. It always has been and always will be.
According to the second reading speech, the changes to IWT are aimed at enhancing Australia's development as a centre for financial services in the Asia-Pacific region. To enhance Australia's role in the Asia-Pacific region we need to be doing much more than offering tax concessions to financial institutions. Australia's presence in the Asia-Pacific region has reached an all-time low. Australia has failed to secure a place at regional economic forums. We failed to attain a place at ASEAN plus 3. How can Australia position itself as a `financial services platform for ASIA' if we are not even part of the regional economic forums? If we cannot get the fundamentals right, why are we bothering to tinker around the edges with tax concessions?
The groundwork done by Paul Keating in the 1980s and early 1990s to promote Australia's role as an equal partner in the Asia-Pacific region has been squandered by the Howard government. The Howard government is short-sighted. For John Howard, Asia holds little appeal. There are no votes in engaging Asia—as Paul Keating found out— but it is about more than just winning votes. It is about engaging our Asian neighbours. It is about becoming a part of the region. It is about the future of the region and Australia's role in it. I see Australia's future as mortgaged to Asia. If we fail to engage the region, if we cannot work with our neighbours, if we are suspicious of them and if we unduly criticise them, our future is compromised. 
We should be working with our South-East Asian neighbours to assist the creation of sound financial infrastructure throughout the region, not as an imperialist act but as a way to create a vibrant economic region which attracts global capital flows and investment. We should also be working with China and Japan to foster economic growth in the region. Economic growth is not an end in itself. It provides the means by which to create jobs, prosperity and stability in the region. Economic growth, whilst providing these benefits, is not the only reason for strong regional cooperation. It is also important in these uncertain times, when the threat of terrorism is a daily event, to ensure that there is an open and friendly dialogue between Australian and our regional neighbours. We need to strengthen those ties now and in the future. Clearly, we have a lot of catching up to do. Labor will not oppose this bill and will assist its speedy passage.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 6) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-04,"—I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002. This bill would ordinarily be treated as noncontroversial by the Senate. However, I note that Labor was frustrated by some late changes to the bill in the House of Representatives and has decided that it should not be given noncontroversial status. That is not a decision with which I disagree since it gives all parties concerned the opportunity to express opinions which otherwise they might not have had the opportunity to express.
I will deal with the various aspects of the bill briefly. Firstly, the amendments to the interest withholding tax exemption for specific corporate debenture issues will reduce some of the technical anomalies that the current law has produced. The Democrats understand that Australian companies are competing for debt funding in a global environment and that the tax laws should not act as an undue restriction. Secondly, the bill deals with the capital gains tax exemption for compensation payments received by Australian residents under the German Forced Labour Compensation Program. When I read that I found it difficult to believe that Australia's tax laws would treat a compensation payment for an injustice that occurred 60 years ago as a capital gain. However, if there is even a remote possibility that our highly complex tax laws could or would operate in this way, we should attend to it. It seems that our tax laws have always had a capacity to be an ass at times. The Democrats fully support an amendment that clarifies that tax should not be paid in these circumstances.
Thirdly, the bill deals with the taxation treatment of friendly society products, such as income bonds, funeral bonds and scholarship plans. I understand that the treatment of these products is similar to that of life insurance products and that the amendments again clarify the technical position of the various transactions involved, ensuring that there is no double taxation. Finally, the bill amends the GST transition act with respect to compulsory third party insurance premiums. This minor amendment ensures that the 30 June 2003 transition date will not cause unreasonable compliance difficulties for the various state authorities and private insurers providing compulsory third party insurance, or a green slip as it is sometimes known. 
However, these amendments represent more bandaids for our complex tax system. These bandaids are required, but they are bandaids that should be put into context. They should be put into the context of the principles of good tax policy. The three principles of good tax policy are really easy to say—equity, simplicity and efficiency—but they are frighteningly difficult to achieve. Tax is about money—getting it and spending it for the good of society. The greatest problem facing the Australian government is that it is short of money to meet the needs of government and the needs of society. The government has made decisions that mean it does not have enough money—decisions on going to war, for instance. The need for additional revenue is strong. Fortunately, finding that additional revenue is possible if the government will address at least two of the principles of taxation—namely, equity and efficiency.
We know that the upcoming budget will not provide the resources that are needed to ensure the adequate health, education and social security of all Australians. We know that the government has committed Australian troops to a United States led war on Iraq, but that Mr Costello and Senator Hill have no idea of the anticipated cost of that policy and of that war. They expect it will be several hundred million dollars, but it seems that the defence department has effectively been given a blank cheque, so perhaps hundreds, based on precedent, could turn into billions.
Where will the money come from? Mr Costello has held down expenditure in health, education and other important areas of government. The pressure is building up and the government simply cannot put off spending more in these areas without risking the wrath of the Australian people. So where will the money come from? Despite the claims of some, Australia's tax take is amongst the lowest in the OECD, yet a major campaign for income tax cuts is again under way. Economic rationalists say reducing government expenditure on goods and services should pay for them. Can tax cuts be paid for by more major cuts in government expenditure? The answer is no. This is a democracy. The electorate calls the shots and the vast majority of voters are rightly demanding the government spend more, not less, on legitimate unsatisfied needs.
There is a great cry from most Australians for more government spending on creating jobs, on the environment, on defence and internal security, on industry programs, health and education services, and drought relief. More expenditure to be America's deputy sheriff or for health and education services means raising more revenue. Instead of simply increasing tax rates, an alternative is to reduce other income tax concessions and the hidden subsidies that the government has used in recent years to provide high-income earners with de facto tax cuts.
Let me provide some examples of how Mr Costello can increase his revenue flow without further destroying essential government services. Firstly, the government's private health insurance rebate should be means tested. The cost of the program will soon reach $3 billion per year. Based on tax statistics, nearly 75 per cent of the money goes to the top 40 per cent of income earners. Why is the government cutting back on health spending for ordinary Australians but providing a 30 per cent subsidy for very wealthy individuals to stay in five-star hospitals and to have access to state-of-the-art gymnasiums? A reasonable capping and means testing of this rebate, without getting rid of it, could deliver savings of at least $1 billion. There would be minimal, if any, impact on the health system as the Medicare levy surcharge and a stressed public system ensure that the rich and well off would never give up their private health insurance. So $1 billion or one-third of that private health insurance rebate could be saved by setting the appropriate means testing mechanism. 
Secondly, the government has announced that it will back down on the equitable taxation of family trusts. This will cost it at least $450 million a year. The Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommended that the taxation of companies and trusts be aligned. That is a matter of equity as well as greater efficiency and greater revenue generation. This would have improved the simplicity of the tax system and would have reduced the use of trusts as a tax avoidance vehicle. The government has decided that that is too hard. They do not want to take on the tax cheats who use family trusts to hide and inappropriately distribute their income.
Thirdly, the concessional treatment of company cars used for salary packaging could be reviewed. Fringe benefits tax treatment of company cars not only provides the incentive to salary package motor vehicles, it also provides an incentive to drive them as much as possible. The more you drive the car, the less tax you pay. The deadline each year is the end of March. Throughout this month we will hear of people who know they must drive their cars to reach the relevant minimum number of kilometres for the year, whether 25,000 or 15,000. These people will deliberately use their cars as much as possible to reach the minimum number of kilometres. Driving the cars as much as possible reduces their employer's tax bill and, therefore, in a salary sacrifice context, increases the employee's income. It is environmentally stupid, it costs the Australian taxpayer $900 million a year—which is the government's own figure—and it is not equitable. The Ralph Review of Business Taxation estimated that even modest reforms to the taxation treatment of company cars could save $200 million per year. Again the government has not accepted this challenge. 
Additionally, up to $600 million could be raised by reforming employee share schemes that benefit some employees and not others. Restoring the indexation of the petrol excise would also provide hundreds of millions of dollars and hopefully help encourage more environmentally sustainable fuels and methods of transport. The overall value of work related deductions is about $7 billion. Up to $500 million could be raised by rationalising and capping work related deductions. Reviewing negative gearing is a real possibility. The majority of overseas countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, either do not allow or severely restrict negative gearing. It costs Australia well over $2 billion a year, perhaps approaching $3 billion, and tax reform could save at least $700 million, or one third of that. Removing the mutuality provision tax exemption from the large big business clubs and others that operate on a commercial basis and rort the intention of that mutuality provision would save $200 million a year. We could reduce funding to wealthy private schools by $150 million. Other revenue creating possibilities include reviewing the $12 billion of concessions for superannuation and the capital gains discounts for individuals and institutional investors.
I could go on with the list but, for the Democrats, eliminating tax rorts and cutting wasteful tax expenditure will always be attractive options. Now is the time, when the government is short of money, to take the hard decisions and address these areas—then you will get our support. Corporate welfare and welfare for the well-off will always be good targets for us to improve the budget bottom line. So the government should not consider that they can cut back on essential services simply because they have spent too much on favourite programs or on a blank cheque war. Reducing unwarranted tax expenditures and concessions is a possibility. Tax expenditure, as the tax statistics show, is over $30 billion and, as I have shown, the Democrats believe a $7 billion to $10 billion reduction may be feasible. As a nation, we need to agree on how much we want to reform income taxation and how much more we need to spend on essential needs. We need to add the two together and work out how to pay for it and what the trade-offs are. That is the challenge in the upcoming budget. The tax expenditure policies, budgetary cost, distributional implications, efficiencies and imperfections have not been systematically studied, but they should be. If they were, reform would release many billions of dollars for the government's needs.
Another area that desperately needs reform is the interaction of the tax and welfare systems. Low income Australians moving between welfare and work can be hit with effective tax rates of up to 87c in the dollar. As they enter work they lose 70c in welfare benefits and have to pay 17c in tax. The consequence is that the gross income they achieve by either a salary increase or by going to work is massively eroded so that their disposable income increase is minor. The unemployed are in the unfortunate position of knowing that if they get a job they may be only 13c in the dollar better off for their efforts. After taking into account their transport costs, clothing, additional food expenditure and other on-costs, they may not be better off at all.  
I see that the Commonwealth Ombudsman noted last week that the family tax payment system is causing families unavoidable debt. Almost 50,000 families have racked up more than $400 million in debt at an average of $801 for each family. In question time yesterday, Senator Vanstone boasted that a single income family on $30,000 per annum with two kids would get $9,442 tax free. This is a significant amount and there is no wonder that these payments can create large family tax payment debts and high effective tax rates when there is an income movement. Analysis by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling shows that 22 per cent of the poorer half of the nation face effective marginal tax rates of more than 60 per cent. So the problem for us in equity terms is much more at the lower end than at the upper end. At the upper end, corporate welfare and the benefits that go to the wealthy mean that the effective tax rates are lower. At the lower end, the nature of the welfare system and the tax system means that effective tax rates are high.
Those statistics do not include the high number of people who are discouraged from entering the work force by these poverty traps. The most promising area of reform is the concept of the tax credit. Tax credits are designed to soften the impact of high effective tax rates. Such proposals may have a cost, but I outlined earlier the many areas in which the government can reduce the existing tax concessions for the wealthy, including means testing private health insurance to save $1 billion a year, taxing trusts properly to save $450 million per year, or removing tax concessions on salary packaged cars to save $200 million a year. It is not the right area to want to spend that money in, but it would also pay for a lot of war. If you want to wage war, you need money. There are plenty of savings that can be made. These could be redirected into a tax credit system to reduce the high effective tax rates faced by persons moving from welfare to employed work. We cannot attack the welfare system— it is bedded in the modern economy's view of how to deliver equity. What you have to ensure is that maximum equity is delivered with the least effect on the efficiency of the country. I think it was Bismarck who first began the modern welfare system over 150 years ago by introducing pension systems. 
The welfare system is not a slug or a brake on the community. It is actually a great aid to civil society and to the way in which our society works. The most disadvantaged in our society have a right to be given income support and to be treated with respect. Most of all, they have the right to the same opportunities that many in this chamber have had—that is, to emerge from a lower income situation and to aspire to a higher one where they can get better education and better pay. Shouldn't our tax and welfare systems interact in a way that encourages rather than penalises an individual's effort to escape that poverty trap? Surely any measure that can reduce unemployment, thereby increasing economic activity, should be carefully considered. The Democrats encourage the government to consider a tax credit system and to consult on a multiparty basis in that area.
So far, the government have focused in law on trying to restrict the living wage. The problem with the living wage is the increases. Living wage increases increase gross wages and add-on costs like superannuation, so they deliver a high cost to the employer and a low benefit to the employee because of the consequences of the high effective tax rates. The disposable income of the employee only results in a low net increase. It would be far better to look at how the tax and welfare systems interact than to try to artificially restrain the negotiating and the institutionalised process by which people seek to keep the low-wage members of our society at least in some competitive situation. In my view, it is more important for the government to pursue the issue of tax and welfare offsets than to pursue the living wage legislation which they are looking at currently. I find it interesting that Minister Abbott is running both agendas. He is running the industrial relations agenda of trying to restrain the abilities of people to put the living wage case, but, on the other hand, he is also running hard up against the Treasurer and the Prime Minister by saying, `Let's look at the tax and wage intersection.' I find it hard to believe that the Prime Minister appears to have ruled out the sensible idea of examining the tax credit system thoroughly and in concert with others. 
There is an urgent and great need for a system that delivers significant real disposable income increases for the lower paid, to encourage a move from welfare to work, to deliver social equity and to give working people a chance to get off the floor and to aspire to upward mobility for their families. I note that the Commonwealth Ombudsman said that under the family tax system large numbers of people are experiencing very high debts. That plainly is an unattractive situation as well and needs to be urgently corrected by the government. I should indicate in closing that the Democrats will support this bill without amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 6) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-03-04,"—I am grateful to my colleagues Senator Murray and Senator Conroy for their support for the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 2002. Their comments have ranged very widely across the taxation landscape. The bill contains a number of very important measures which I will return to in a moment. I should say that it is not my intention to canvass in detail each point that has been made by Senators Conroy and Murray. However, there are a couple of issues that I want to make a few comments on. 
Firstly, I welcome the fact that Senator Conroy supports interest withholding tax. I certainly hope that his commitment to developing Australia as a regional centre for financial services will also be as forthcoming when the foreign expatriates tax reforms are before this place. That is an equally important issue. Senator Conroy also mentioned— at least, I think this is what he was saying— that if we do not get into Asian economic forums, there is no point in providing tax concessions. But in the real world we all know that these concessions can make a real difference—indeed, the difference—to business decisions that will enhance the role of Australian business in the Asian region. The concessions are a very positive move that will make a great difference to business and will no doubt be enhanced by the review of international tax.
Senator Conroy also spoke briefly about what is becoming a very familiar topic—at least advanced by the Labor Party—and that is the government's support for the big end of town, supposedly at the expense of the small end of town, in particular in relation to the compliance burden that all businesses have in managing in the tax system. I want to refute that because there is no doubt that this government has not only addressed but is concerned on an ongoing basis—and I can say this because it concerns me greatly— about business concerns about compliance, particularly with the change to the new tax system. The government recognised business concerns about the compliance burden of the GST and following extensive consultations—which are now the hallmark of this government, particularly in relation to tax laws—made significant changes to streamline the GST payment and reporting arrangements for small business. It has borne fruit, because the December 2001 Dun and Bradstreet National Business Expectations Survey revealed that 76 per cent of respondents found it easier to complete the new, simplified BAS form.
There are a range of views on the issue. Notwithstanding perhaps some recent claims, most professional bodies have reported within the last couple of months that complaints about BAS lodgment have dropped off significantly. Other evidence also suggests that compliance costs have eased as businesses have become more familiar with the new tax system, as indeed the government expected. This was reflected in the survey results of the Yellow Pages Business Index—Small and Medium Enterprises. In the May survey of last year, only six per cent of respondents cited the GST as a concern. Over the financial year, the Australian Taxation Office has also noticed a continuing downward trend in the time taken to prepare and complete business activity statements. 
So the compliance cost implications of the GST must be viewed in the light of the entire tax reform package. Incorporated businesses are benefiting from cuts in company tax from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. Businesses are also benefiting from the removal of the old wholesale sales tax and other embedded taxes. In September last year, in fulfilment of its election commitment to Australian taxpayers, the government introduced legislation into the parliament to establish a statutory office of the Inspector-General of Taxation. It is a great pity that the Labor Party and the Democrats have, thus far, not seen fit to pass the bill to set up the office of the inspector-general, which, as a taxpayers' advocate, would provide significant assistance to small business in the whole area of compliance. The Senate will soon be asked to reconsider the bill, and it is important that the legislation be passed as a matter of urgency so that the inspector-general can start on the important task of improving tax administration for the benefit of all Australians and that, of course, includes ordinary taxpayers and small business. It is a much-needed office to bridge the gap in the current administration of the tax office and it should be passed forthwith.
Senator Murray, in his usual exhaustive and careful way, has outlined what one might regard as a wish list or certainly a list of areas to which he would like to see some attention given in relation to rearranging the tax landscape. In particular, while not replying in detail to every point raised by Senator Murray, I would like to point out that tax cheats are suffering under this government, and will continue to suffer further. I am sure that is something that most Australians— those who pay their fair share of tax—would welcome because we do want a fair system where everyone pays their fair share of tax. In this year's budget, in which we were able to increase the tax office's resources, an initiative taken by the tax office to do with tracking down tax cheats is expected to yield additional tax revenue of about $1,500 million over the forward estimates. 
Recently, the tax commissioner released an outline of the tax office compliance program for 2002-03. I commend it to Senators Conroy and Murray, if they have not had a chance to have a look at it already, because the compliance program identifies possible risks to the revenue and strategies that the tax office has under way to manage these across the range of taxpayer segments. The tax office continues to provide a high level of help and education to assist the vast majority of people who do do the right thing. However, its focus has shifted to more active compliance, including verification activities, field visits and other audits. A key priority, contrary to what Senator Conroy might say, remains targeting big business and high-wealth individuals. In the past five years, the tax office's extensive audit program at the so-called `big end of town' has netted an extra $2.64 billion for the community. This year, one in 10 businesses will be subject to some form of audit, and more than 135,000 people will be required to confirm their tax deductions. The tax office will boost its GST compliance staff by around 350 and its serious noncompliance investigations group to 300. Some other high-profile risks which are receiving close scrutiny from the tax office in 2002-03 are aggressive tax planning, the cash economy, work related and rental property expenses, the correct reporting of capital gains and losses, and illegal tobacco and fuel substitution.
I want to spend another moment or two on the taxation of discretionary trusts. The government has said that it will legislate, with effect from the handing down of the Board of Taxation's report on discretionary trusts, to introduce new provisions in place of section 109UB of the Income Tax Assessment Act dealing with distributions from trusts. The board has recommended these measures, and the government has accepted that they are required to improve the effectiveness of the deemed dividend rules so as to more actively prevent beneficiaries accessing trust income that has borne tax only at the company tax rate, and to remove the unfairness in the operation of section 109UB that is currently inducing some small and medium sized business operators to establish arrangements that enable them to avoid the operation of the section completely. In addition, the board has recommended that the ATO clarify and publish its views on interest deductibility for borrowings used to finance non-assessable distributions to beneficiaries of discretionary trusts. The government has requested clarification and will, if the rulings are unable to deal with the matter, also consider a legislative solution. 
The report notes the success of previous government measures in the following areas: use of non-resident trusts to transfer funds offshore, inappropriate utilisation of losses, circulating distributions and tracing distributions through to the ultimate beneficiaries, personal service income rules and revised social security means test treatment of private trusts and private companies. The report recommends that the government should retain the current flowthrough treatment of distributions of non-assessable amounts by discretionary trusts rather than a company type taxation model. So tax cheats have been suffering under this government, and they will suffer more. This is clearly identified in the compliance schedule.
Having made those remarks, I do not want to take up too much time on the bill which, as I have said, is supported and contains some very important measures. The bill demonstrates the government's clear commitment to a better tax system. It contains four measures, all of which will be of value to taxpayers. Firstly, it will enhance Australia's development as a centre for financial services in the Asia-Pacific region. Secondly, the bill exempts payments made to Australian residents, and their heirs, who suffered injustices and loss during the Nationalist Socialist period. Thirdly, the bill reduces compliance cost for compulsory third party insurers at the time when the transitional rules are ending and they are implementing a new compliance system. Lastly, friendly societies will be allowed a deduction for investment income paid to recipients of income from special purpose investment products, thereby preventing double taxation that may have arisen in some circumstances. Finally, I repeat that I am pleased that my colleagues support this bill and the very sensible measures, the necessary measures, contained in it to ensure the ongoing program of having a fair tax system. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-03-04,"—We are dealing with two bills cognately. In addressing the Migration Legislation Amendment (Contributory Parents Migration Scheme) Bill 2002 and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2002, I think it is important to start with an acknowledgment of what migrants have contributed to Australia. Migrants have built this nation. The Australian story is in many ways a migrant story. Apart from our Indigenous peoples, we are a nation of migrants. People have come from all around the world, some under the great post-war immigration program, which was aimed at strengthening and populating the nation. Others have come to Australia as the result of war and conflict in their home countries. People have come to Australia under the skilled program and as members of families. Many have come as refugees, having fled their homelands seeking safety and peace for themselves and their families. I am pleased to say that many refugees have found that safety and peace in this country and have been able to rebuild lives and make major contributions to our nation. 
No matter how people have come, it is an understandable desire for migrants to seek to have their family join them. For many people the family is the foundation stone for their lives. I know that the family is the centre of many people's lives particularly their parents' lives. In fact this government would have us believe that they are the only ones in this place concerned about families. But this concern for family life does not seem to extend to migrant families and their overseas parents. It is also important for children to have access to their grandparents. This is particularly important for migrant families. Grandparents are an important source of their language, culture and history. 
Necessarily, parents tend to be older migrants, and research on the economics of migration has consistently shown that age plays a critical role. Younger migrants prove to be a net economic positive, with skilled younger migrants making the greatest economic contribution. Older migrants tend to be a net economic negative, with a cost of support in terms of health and welfare payments outweighing their economic contribution to the nation. Some interesting research recently published in the United States attempted to put a dollar figure on the differences. A highly educated migrant arriving at age 21 was calculated at having a net present value to the economy of $332,000 over their lifetime. For a poorly educated migrant age 21, the net present value was $9,000. For a highly educated 70-year-old migrant, the net present value drops to minus $148,000. For a poorly educated 70-year-old migrant, the net present value drops to minus $166,000. 
Australian research by Dr Birrell and Dr James Jupp shows that welfare dependence by immigrants increases with the age of arrival. Understanding this, but also understanding the importance to families of having their parents with them particularly as parents age, the Labor government sought to strike an equitable balance between the costs of the migration of parents that should be borne by the Australian community and the costs that should be borne privately by sponsoring individuals.
A little bit of history: obviously there have to be some limits on parent migration and in 1998 the then Labor government sought to reduce parent migration by introducing the balance of family test. This means that the number of adult children, Australian citizens or permanent residents living in Australia is equal to, or greater than, the number of children living outside Australia. This helped to ensure that the migration program was focused on those parents who needed to be united with their families in order to achieve adequate personal, social and economic support.
Further changes were made in 1991 when the then Labor government introduced the assurance of support bond at $3,500 for each principal applicant and $1,500 for each additional applicant. Under the scheme the sponsor of the parent migrant paid the bond to the Commonwealth government. The bond was used to fund any welfare payments claimed by the migrant. At the end of two years unused funds were repaid with interest. Welfare payments that exceeded the value of the bond were recoverable from the assurer as a debt to the Commonwealth government. In addition, the then Labor government introduced a migrant health service charge. Under this scheme a non-refundable levy of $822 had to be paid by the sponsor of each parent migrant. 
The aim of these changes was to strike an equitable balance between the health and welfare costs of parent migration that the taxpayer, the Australian community, should bear and the health and welfare costs of parent migration that the sponsoring family should bear. It is important to note that Labor structured these changes so that those seeking to sponsor did not face hardship and those seeking to have their parents migrate faced the same barriers not different barriers. Under these proposed changes the situation will be very different. The bottom line of these changes, introduced by the Liberal government and supported by the Australian Democrats—much to our surprise—is that if you have money your parents can come; if not, you wait in a queue. That queue is now so long, with waiting times well over 10 years, that many parents will die in the queue. 
Labor's understanding of the need for parent migration meant that in the last intake of 1995-96, under a Labor government, the number of parent visas issued was 8,900. On coming to office, the Howard Liberal government immediately took an aggressive approach to limiting parent migration. In addition to announcing a review of the whole system, the Howard Liberal government did the following. Firstly, it introduced measures to tighten the balance of family test. This tightening would have required more than 50 per cent of a parent's children to reside in Australia. In the case of parents with two children, a fairly standard case, this measure would have required both to be living in Australia. The Senate disallowed this change. Secondly, almost as soon as coming to office, the Howard Liberal government successfully introduced a two-year waiting period for social security benefits. Thirdly, the Howard Liberal government introduced a cap on parent visas of $7,600 in 1996-97, which was then slashed to $1,000 in 1997-98.
As a result of this review, the Howard Liberal government amended the relevant regulation in 1998 to introduce new parent visa classes with an assurance of support of $4,000 for principal applicants, $2,000 for additional applicants and a migrant health service charge of $5,000. Under this regulatory regime, 2,800 places would have been made available for parent visas under transitional arrangements for applicants under the old visa classes—that is, the queue with the usual assurance of support and the migrant health service charge. An uncapped number of visas would have been available for those seeking parent visas in the newly created and more expensive queue. With the support of the Democrats, Labor disallowed these regulations in the Senate on the basis they would have imposed hardship on families seeking to have their parents migrate. In response, Minister Ruddock reduced the number of places available for parent visas to a cap of 500, and the cap still remains in place—that is, 500 visas annually around the globe.
In 2000, the Howard Liberal government introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000. Part of this bill provided for a new parent visa class with an assurance of support of $10,000 for principal applicants, $4,000 for additional applicants and a migrant health services charge of $25,000 or proof of satisfactory private health insurance cover. The Liberal government was proposing that 4,000 places be allocated to the new and more expensive visa classes. Labor and the Democrats defeated that part of the bill dealing with parent visas. Once again, Labor took the view that the proposal would have created hardship and inequity in creating two queues: one for those with financial resources and one for those without. At that time, the Democrats, particularly Senator Bartlett, agreed with the Labor Party. Senator Bartlett said:
... regulation, particularly on the grounds that it provided a mechanism which meant that basically people who have significant amounts of wealth would get an advantage over those who do not.
He went on to say:
... the Democrats certainly believe that wealth or otherwise of parents should not be a determining factor in whether or not people can get into the country ...
It seems that, in supporting these new measures, the Democrats have now decided that wealth should be a determining factor for parents migration. In 2002-03, the parent visa class remains capped at 500 places. The conditions applying to the visas are the need for an assurance of support of $3,500 for principal applicants and a migrant health services charge of $1,050. Save for the indexing of the migrant health services charge, these visas have the same conditions as imposed by Labor in 1991. Obviously, 500 places per year are nowhere near sufficient to meet demand. If we contrast that cap of 500 places with the 8,900 places available in the last year of Labor government or even the 7,600 places available in the first year of the Howard government, 500 places stand out starkly as a very draconian cap. In implementing and maintaining this cap, the Howard Liberal government has deliberately created a crisis in parent migration. 
There are currently 22,400 applications in the pipeline with 14,800 fully processed and with queue dates. Given the age of many of the persons seeking entry, they will die before they ever reach the front of the queue. This means that families with parents in the queue are desperate. The situation is now so hopeless for them that they will pay any price and do anything that is necessary to get their parents here.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-03-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
It is appropriate to draw the amendments to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to the attention of the Senate and of the general public. It is one of the major global mechanisms for trying to protect and preserve endangered wildlife that is subject to international trade. These amendments, made at the last convention of the parties in November 2002, highlight the extreme environmental impact that can occur from trading in wildlife of all sorts. It is one of the reasons the Democrats believe all trade agreements should be cognisant of potential environmental impacts, rather than having separate treaties completely disconnected from trade agreements—for example, the free trade agreement with Singapore—and to have trade agreements implicitly recognise the need to ensure that there are not significant environmental impacts as a direct consequence of the trade.
These amendments and the reasons for the proposed treaty action detailed in here quite clearly indicate that trade in wildlife can have a direct negative consequence on the very survival of particular species. There are 12 species, different taxa, that were either listed or moved into appendix 1 of the convention—and appendix 1 is basically those species where international commercial trade is prohibited. All are significantly endangered as a direct consequence of trade in those species, and that is why they are listed here. For example, a chameleon from Madagascar that is significantly endangered is listed as a direct consequence of a high demand in trade for pets. We have many people here in Australia who advocate that we should be trying to build an international pet trade in Australian wildlife. Indeed, there is expanding trade in the United States in some Australian wildlife. I think that is a dangerous practice to promote willy-nilly without a clear examination of the potential environmental impacts on each particular species as well as there being significant animal welfare issues that can apply when Australian native animals are exported into foreign environments and kept as pets. It is no coincidence that many of these species that have been transferred onto appendix 1 are the subject of interested trade from collectors, pet traders and the like. In addition to the chameleon, many different species of birds— six different subspecies of parrot and macaw—as well as different types of turtles have been put into the convention for the first time. 
Plants are also an important part of the convention. In recent times we have seen a little bit of publicity about Australian business people who have been involved in illegal trade in exotic plants. That is a dangerous approach from an environmental point of view, not just because it may make plants extinct but also because it can, and has, led to plants escaping into the wild in foreign environments and becoming exotic weeds and pests. A number of different plant species—orchids, cactus and various types of palm trees—have been listed because they have become endangered due to trade.
It is worth noting a couple of sharks as well: the whale shark and the basking shark are species that are under threat. They are common in Australian waters, but obviously not common enough or they would not be listed in this trade in endangered species convention. It is an important convention, and this is one area where the Australian government have a fairly good record. I support them and encourage the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to keep up those efforts because it is important. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-03-04,"—There can be no doubt that the Queensland Liberal Party is performing extremely well when it comes to women's representation in the traditionally male dominated world of politics. I could speak at great length about the great contribution that Queensland women political representatives have made to the political life and fabric of Brisbane, Queensland and Australia—and I could list many names and many achievements to illustrate the point—but I will leave this exercise for another time, for tonight I wish to recognise some of the unsung heroines that are part of all political organisations (Labor Party, National Party, Democrats and Liberal Party) and in particular tonight those who are in the Queensland Liberal Party. 
As an introduction to my substantive remarks I will mention the names of my very distinguished Queensland women colleagues in this parliament, including Kay Elson, the member for Forde; Teresa Gambaro, the member for Petrie; and Margaret May, the member for McPherson. They are outstanding representatives for their electorates who bring into this parliament a unique and often inspired perspective and they represent their constituents and their party with great distinction.
At a state level, how could I go beyond Joan Sheldon, former parliamentary leader of the Queensland Liberal Party, former Deputy Premier and former Treasurer—in fact, the first woman leader of a major party in Queensland, the first woman Deputy Premier and the first woman Treasurer. I had the honour and the privilege of serving with Mrs Sheldon as her deputy for three years and subsequently as a minister of the Crown in the Borbidge-Sheldon government. I cannot speak more highly than I am doing tonight of her performance and of the way that as a parliamentary leader she conducted the affairs of the Liberal Party. And, of course, there is Sallyanne Atkinson, the first female Lord Mayor of Brisbane, who almost single-handedly transformed Brisbane into a modern 21st century forward-looking city—a mature city that today has the confidence to take on any other major city in Australia and indeed in the world. It has done so on many occasions. It has hosted many a significant national and international event, and again that is the result of the efforts of former Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson.
Clearly, the Queensland Liberal Party has facilitated the advancement of women to senior political ranks in a most exemplary and successful manner. Often, these women have started their distinguished political careers within the Women's Council section of the Liberal Party of Australia in Queensland. It is interesting to note at this point that the objectives of the Queensland Women's Council clearly state: to provide equal opportunity for women to make their own decisions, develop their own skills, interests and personalities, always having regard for equal rights of others; to play an active role in researching the specific needs of women in developing policies; to encourage women to realise their full potential; to assist women who wish to seek preselection in any one of the three tiers of government and to provide support and information to them as candidates. These objectives have been pursued by many fine Queensland Liberal women— women who have not only established a loyal and dedicated commitment to the Liberal Party but also gone out and put down roots in the broader community and therefore speak within the Liberal Party, on behalf of the Liberal Party and about the Liberal Party in Queensland with great credibility.
There are three distinguished women within the Queensland Liberal Party who have presided in more recent times as chairmen of the Women's State Council, namely Mrs Cassie Solomon, Mrs Elaine Bowers and current president, Mrs Rae Watkins. These women have sought, identified and provided encouragement and support for many fine women to run for positions within our state and federal parliaments, the Brisbane City Council and the Liberal Party organisation. In many instances, they have played a mentoring role for Liberal women. Through their roles as chairmen and now as President of the Women's State Council these women have also provided a valuable women's perspective to areas of campaigning and policy. Tonight, I pay tribute to them.
In particular, I pay a special tribute to Mrs Cassie Solomon, who for so many years played such a central and vital role in the affairs of the Queensland Liberal Party's Women's Council. In the end, Cassie personified the Women's Council and represented it with grace and distinction in many Queensland and national forums where significant issues were discussed and debated. Cassie's health is currently failing her and we wish for her the very best for the future. I say a very hearty and sincere thank you for the great contribution that she has made to the welfare of not just the Women's Council in Queensland but the Queensland Liberal Party and, indeed, the national Liberal Party as a whole. 
It would also be improper of me not to pay tribute to good Liberal women who have contributed enormously to advancing the cause of women, families and the community as a whole. For example, Mrs Ailsa Scurr has served as a delegate to the National Council of Women for many years and has been involved in that great drug organisation Drug Arm. Mrs Audrey Dickie has made a valuable contribution through her involvement in the Australian Family Association, as has Mrs Faye Shadlow in the area of family planning.
As honourable senators would appreciate, Queensland is a big state and much good work is done by Liberal women in rural and isolated communities. For example, Mrs Rhonda Hermann has worked with and supported women and their families in more difficult and remote areas within the federal electorate of Blair. A few years ago, Mrs Hermann and her Blair Women's Council group ran a successful forum dealing with many issues affecting local communities, particularly isolated communities.
And, of course, Mr President, we cannot forget the wives in what are still male-inhabited state and federal parliaments. These unsung heroines contribute enormously to the ability of their husbands to do their jobs in places such as this—by looking after our children and our homes, often supplementing the family income, and on many occasions representing their husbands at many an event both within the party and in the broader community.
I mention these fine women as excellent examples of women committed to advancing the interests of the Liberal Party and worthwhile community causes. Undoubtedly, when one mentions a lot of individuals in a speech like this, one may forget some. If I have forgotten people who feel that they should have been mentioned because of their great contribution, I will make up for it at another time. But there have been and there still are many thousands in the Queensland Liberal Party, and indeed throughout the Australian Liberal Party, who work happily, quickly and efficiently for causes they genuinely believe in—in this particular case, from a Liberal perspective. Women like Heather Eveans, Trish Sargeant, Sue Boyce, Erna Lee, Lesley Goodwin, Shirley Bertoldo, Kylie Denman, Gladys Potter, Jeannie Fairlie, Joan Spelling, Lila Cameron—that stalwart, Lila Cameron—Shirley Lehmann, Greer Tucker, Sharon Thompson, Elaine O'Keefe, Astra Ciobo, Kerry Freeburn, Julie Wallerstein and Ella King are just some of the office-bearers of the Queensland Women's Council who I know and who work tirelessly for the causes of women in the Queensland Liberal Party and within the community.
It is important at this stage to go back to our roots. With what better quote could I conclude a speech like this than one from the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Menzies? At the closure of the Albury conference on 16 December 1944, when speaking about the role of the women's organisation in the Liberal Party, he said:
Women are unquestionably destined to exercise more and more influence upon practical politics in Australia. There was a time when they thought to stand aside, exercising only passive influence. That has gone.
In the educating of the electorate in liberal areas they have for many years been an effective force. Now we have an organisation in which all distinctions have gone, and with men and women working equally for the one body the resultant education value of our movement is going to be extremely increased ...
That is what our founder, Sir Robert Menzies, said about the role of the women's organisation within the Liberal Party—on that distant day, 16 December 1944. The sentiments that he expressed were very valid at that point in time. They are even more valid today. Again, I pay tribute tonight to the role, the influence and the effectiveness of the women's contribution to the Liberal Party of Australia and, in particular, to the contribution of the Women's Council of the Liberal Party of Queensland.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-03-04,"— Tonight I wish to speak of a delegation of Labor frontbenchers led by the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Jenny Macklin, that spent last week in China at the invitation of the Communist Party of China. The delegation included Dr Craig Emerson, Mr Martin Ferguson, Mr Mark Latham, Senator Peter Cook and me. Also included were Mr Geoff Walsh, the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party; Professor Peter Drysdale from the Australian National University; and Ms Carolyn Turnour from the office of the opposition deputy leader. This was the first in what will be a program of biennial exchanges between senior Australian Labor politicians and senior Chinese political leaders. The program provides opportunities to establish direct personal contact with senior members of the Chinese government and ruling party, as well as providing a valuable foundation for future relations between a Labor governed Australia and the People's Republic of China, one of our most important regional neighbours. 
It is a disappointment to me to find that the Labor Party was not the first Australian political party to embark upon such a program. The fact is that the Liberal Party has that honour. Senator Cook, who I have no doubt will be on his way to the chamber shortly, will be able to go into the full detail of these exchanges. Senator Cook, being the Labor Party's international secretary, will also be able to explain how it is that the Chinese Communist Party were guests at the Liberal Party National Convention last year. He will also no doubt be able to explain how it is that the Liberal Party sent its warmest fraternal greetings to the Communist Party's most recent conference in Beijing. However, meaningful and productive relations must go beyond these mere formalities, and our brief visit helped to highlight the enormous, yet unfulfilled, potential of the bilateral relations between Australia and China.
Visits such as our delegation undertook provide an opportunity to broaden mutual understanding, to engage in a dialogue, to question, to probe and to exchange information about each other's countries, our political and economic systems and our aspirations. We had the opportunity to establish personal contacts which I sincerely hope will be maintained and be of lasting benefit. Our delegation had access to the most senior levels of the Chinese government and the party. We met with Mr Huang Ju, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo—the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China—and Minister Dia Bing Guo and Vice Minister Zhang Zhiajin of the international department of the Communist Party, both of whom impressed me, and the whole delegation, with their detailed knowledge of social democracy and of Australian politics. We met with other ministers, senior academics, government advisers and government officials in the fields of foreign affairs, trade, education, science, transport, infrastructure and urban planning. All of the people we met demonstrated a keen interest in the issues that were raised by us and they, in turn, put questions to us which were often penetrating and thoughtful.
I suppose it is the common practice that stereotypes abound when it comes to discussions about China. Personal contacts and observation provide an opportunity to challenge preconceived ideas. The sheer scale of the social experiment being attempted in China is little understood in this country and its importance for Australians has equally been neglected. Knowledge and understanding of recent developments within the People's Republic is of profound importance for the prosperity of this country. It is arguable that the momentous reform processes under way in the People's Republic are as significant as any of the changes in Chinese society that have been undertaken since the creation of the People's Republic in 1949.
The reform program is driven by decisions taken by the recent Communist Party conferences and reinforced by the new leadership that has been in the process of taking up office over the last six months. They will culminate in this week's appointment of new ministers and the restructuring of government departments through the formal meetings of the Chinese legislature. Reform measures are driven by a determination to lift the living standards for ordinary Chinese citizens by a greater level than at any time since the destruction of feudalism in the 20th century. The modernisation of Chinese society and its economy involves massive changes in all sectors. Under way is a remodelling of education, health and the legal, transport, agricultural and manufacturing systems within China. This remodelling signals a break from the past but also continuity with it. Those who are managing this program seek to learn from the experiences of the Soviet Union yet not repeat the mistakes of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 
It would be a mistake, however, to see this as an abandonment of many of the traditional aspirations of the social reformers that established the People's Republic in 1949. This remodelling program is being conducted within the framework of what the Chinese call a socialist market economy. It is a reflection of the priorities set by the Chinese leadership over the last 20 years, highlighted by the changed conditions within China itself. While China has abandoned the command economy, it has not abandoned economic planning, which provides the framework within which the Chinese market mechanisms operate.
The leaders of the People's Republic of China are determined to engage the world as an equal, not in a matter dictated by other countries. The Chinese leaders we met have a very strong sense of history. There is a determination that I experienced amongst the Chinese groups that I met for China to be seen as a country that will never again be taken advantage of by great and powerful nations or by great and powerful corporations. They believe this occurs when the Chinese are weak, backward and poor. The main purpose of the reform is to ensure that China will be none of those things ever again. Those who wish to invest in China or participate in the Chinese economy should understand clearly that China is not there to be plundered. Investment is welcome, but only investment made on a long-term basis and for mutual benefit, not for the purpose of making a quick one-sided gain.
The Chinese are equally determined to learn from the world. Numerous delegations, researchers and missions have been despatched across the globe to gather information about the way problems are dealt with in other countries. Through this means, the Chinese are seeking to pick the eyes from international experience. For instance, foreign investment is actively sought by the Chinese government but not just in any field nor under any circumstances. Take the case of transfer pricing, which is an important issue when dealing with multinational corporations: the Chinese have sent delegations to Australia, Canada and Europe and, as a result of these trips, the Chinese have adopted what they see as the best of all worlds and they have adjusted their taxation systems accordingly.
In any analysis of the future prospects of the People's Republic, two broad groups seem to have formed. There are the pessimistic and the optimistic schools of thought. I am a member of the optimistic school. China's economic prosperity is, and in the future will be, heavily dependent upon China's political and social stability. This stability in turn is heavily dependent upon the Chinese economy continuing to grow strongly. If growth rates fall below the levels required to keep unemployment below acceptable rates and to meet the growing aspirations of the Chinese people, the political and social effects could be profound. The legitimacy of the reform process now depends heavily upon delivering an improved standard of living to the people of China. The expert economic advice that I have been able to tap is that the annual rate of growth for the Chinese economy is likely to be about seven per cent over the next five years. Last year, the growth rate was around eight per cent. I note that the growth rate last year in the United States was about 1.4 per cent. Even in Australia, growth rates are less than half the Chinese growth rate.
While in China the domestic sector remains the strongest driver for growth, consumer spending and investment in housing look set to continue for some time. Urbanisation and technological change as well as the growth in international trade are also contributing to economic growth. (Extension of time granted) The huge investment by the Chinese government in infrastructure underwrites this growth. An examination of the development of the Pudong New Area within the Shanghai district highlights the resources that the Chinese government is prepared to place behind these projects. The determination to build the largest sea port in the world at Shanghai highlights the scale of the projects that are currently being undertaken in eastern China. 
Governing 1.4 billion people is inherently a complex task. Nonetheless, the Chinese leadership face a number of serious and quite specific challenges. These include, firstly, a fragile financial system, which will need to maintain its commitment to simultaneously supporting the struggling state owned enterprises while financially restructuring those enterprises. This will be important, particularly for social policy reasons, for some time to come. While the reform process will continue at great speed, the Chinese government will need to balance the conflicting pressures of maintaining economic efficiency while protecting social equity. Secondly, there are serious disparities in income levels between the eastern and western regions of the country which the government will have to address. It is already attempting to do so by way of a very large program to encourage new economic development in the western provinces. In my judgment, it will take time for these incentive programs to work.
Thirdly, there are high levels of underemployment in both the city and rural areas which may involve the movement of up to 200 million workers and their families over the next 20 years. These mobile workers will place pressure on social infrastructure, especially the education and health systems. It is likely that policy changes will have to be made to adjust to these pressures. Fourthly, there are inevitable structural changes to enterprises and to agriculture as a result of accession to the World Trade Organisation. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that the policy will be reversed. Fifthly, there is the problem of containing corruption, which the government regards as a serious problem. The Chinese will have to rely upon the establishment of the rule of law as well as judicial reform as a means of containing arbitrary misuses of power. This problem represents, to my mind, one of the most serious issues that the Chinese government is facing. Corruption has the potential to corrode the integrity of decision-making processes and the authority and legitimacy of the Chinese state.
As far as I am concerned—and, as I say, I am an optimist—these are all risks that are manageable and, while the economy is principally driven by domestic growth, China is essentially insulated from international world economic trends. The very high savings ratio of some 40 per cent of GDP and the strong current account surplus are tremendous assets for the reform program. The domestic and the international political situation therefore will remain major areas of attention for the Chinese government.
Turning to my specific areas of portfolio interest, in our discussions I was interested to pursue Australia's involvement and partnership with Chinese counterparts in education, science and research. In these areas, China is of enormous significance for Australia. It would be wrong to think of China as just a market for Australian resources, for our goods or our services. In my judgment, this is a mistake that has characterised our relationships with other countries in the region. We can offer a great deal more for long-term relations than just being a reliable supplier of agricultural or mineral products and technology. Our advanced education and science systems are of interest to the People's Republic of China. This is because we have a solid track record of solving problems for our society which, in many instances, are the same problems faced by the Chinese.
Cooperation between our nations has improved dramatically in recent years. We now have some 50,000 Chinese students studying in Australia, an increase of about 15,000 every year. However, while we cooperate in terms of university levels and support for university administration and research management, more needs to be done. The Chinese Education Vice Minister, Zhang Zhiajin, explained that the growth has to be looked at on a sustainable basis, not in terms of immediate gains. He said more has to be done to improve the quality of the programs offered and greater attention has to be paid to government-to-government relations. The vice minister suggested that a joint working party needs to be established to improve our quality assurance regime, similar to that established between the Chinese and New Zealand governments. It is quite clear that the Chinese government considers the exchange of cultural contacts to be just as important as the economic ones. Information and ideas can be as valuable to both nations as goods and services. 
Like Australia, China is a large country in area and subject to the forces of nature at its extremes. We both suffer droughts, floods, earthquakes, cyclones, soil erosion and salinity. Both countries face environmental degradation as a result of industrial and agricultural development. Like Australia, China is attempting to join the new economy. We share common interests in biotechnology, nanotechnology, information technology and communications, and in many areas China shares Australia's scientific and technological ambitions.
While the list of formal agreements between our nations is quite a lengthy one, the level of direct cooperation between our scientific agencies and our researchers remains underdeveloped and underfunded. For instance, in polar research, China intends to spend $US100 million in the period 2001-05—that is, within the current Chinese five-year plan. Our scientists in the Antarctic currently cooperate on a number of projects; however, much more could be done in areas such as astrophysical research and oceanography. This could have important consequences for climate research in both countries. Australia and China ought to be cooperating more fully to ensure the Madrid protocols are extended and the Antarctic remains an area of pristine environment preserved for scientific research. While we currently cooperate on areas such as salinity, only small amounts of money are involved in the programs with the CSIRO, as is the case of earthquake research.
The first major agreement between the CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Science was signed in April 1985—so it is not that long ago. That agreement paved the way for delegations of scientists from Australia and China to visit each other's countries. The pace of collaboration expanded following the signing of memoranda of understanding between the Australian Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the Chinese State Science and Technology Commission. A number of joint projects were established during the administration of Senator Peter Cook—who I note has now joined us in the chamber—when he was the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, in 1994-95. These areas included earth sciences, the environment, technology and the management of basic research.
Under the Hawke and Keating governments, APEC was seen to be an important forum for cooperation within the region. Part of that process was the establishment of meetings of ministers for science and technology. While an important meeting was held in 1995 of 17 APEC ministers of science and technology in Beijing, which established the four major areas of collaboration, very little has been done to follow up that program under the life of the current Howard government. The most recent ministerial meeting was held as long ago as October 1998.
The developments in China have a profound importance for Australia's prosperity and security. Australia has to come to terms with the fact that our prosperity will increasingly be associated with that of the Chinese. We as a nation will need to balance our policy pursuits with those of others that live in our region. Our future is as much tied to North Asia as it is to South-East Asia, and that needs to be balanced with our historical ties to North America and Europe. We will need to clearly identify our own interests and understand the interests of others and reorient our policies so that we maximise our advantages as an independent, advanced industrial nation capable of acting as an honest broker within our region.
Asia is our neighbourhood. We have tremendous opportunities here if we embrace our place in the world rather than running in fear of it. We need to seek security in Asia, not security from Asia. The Howard government is obsessed with playing the role of the deputy sheriff to the United States. We cannot realise our full potential in our new strategic situation unless we understand our role within the region. 
In summary, the Australian government is falling down on the job. China represents a country of enormous significance to the future prosperity of our nation. Australia and China have a great deal in common and there are many areas in which fruitful cooperation could exist to strengthen our relationships and improve the living standards of the people of both countries.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-03-04," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 18 July 2002:
With reference to the Air Transport Safety Bureau Report 200103696 which cites two instances of cabin air contamination of the same aircraft, VH-NJA, on consecutive days and in both instances, the crew donned oxygen masks after being affected by contaminated air, and the cabin crew and passengers were affected by contaminated air:
(1)	Why was the plane not immediately turned around when fumes were first detected.
(2)	How are crew members who are wearing oxygen masks capable of identifying the source of the contamination.
(3)	Is it not considered an emergency situation in which the aircraft should be landed as soon as possible; if not, what would happen if all crew members were seriously affected at the same time and unable to continue their duties.
(4)	(a) How many flights were there between the two reported incidents; (b) why are the two incidents on the same report form; and (c) are they not two separate incidents.
(5)	Given the documented illness of crew and passengers on the first flight: (a) why was there found to be no sign of oil contamination when initially inspected by the ground engineers; and (b) what was different between the engineering check after the first flight found `no signs of oil contamination or oil leaks,' and the next inspection, which `revealed oil contamination in the number 3 engine'.
(6)	Given that, on 6 September 1999, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau issued recommendation R19990052 to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) that stated in part, `These deficiencies should be examined by the regulatory authority as part of its responsibilities for initial certification and continued airworthiness of the BAe 146 aircraft': Why then has CASA responded (more than 6 months later) that `CASA is satisfied that the BAe 146 aircraft in service in Australia are safe for public transport'.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Aviation: BAe 146 Aircraft</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,22,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-03-04,"—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	A response in any particular aircraft incident is a matter for the pilot-in-command and the aircraft operator. In this particular incident, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB)'s investigation found that the crew troubleshot the problem in accordance with BAe Service Information Leaflet 21-45 as noted in CASA Airworthiness Directive BAe 146/86 and were able to eliminate the fumes by switching off the number-2 air conditioning pack. The flight was able to continue safely using only the number-1 air conditioning pack, with no fumes evident. 
(2)	BAe 146 Operational Notice OP 16 provides the procedures to be followed by the flight crew in the event of fumes in the cabin. Visible fumes can be identified while oxygen masks are worn and if they cease to be produced when one airconditioning pack is switched off, the source is identified. If fumes are not visible, masks should be worn by crew until the aircraft lands.
(3)	Flight crew are required to don oxygen masks if there is any indication that there are fumes from the air conditioning system, as required per BAe 146 Operational Notice OP16. If the source of the fumes can be eliminated operational procedures may permit the flight to be continued to the planned destination. Not all fumes incidents are similarly serious and only a very serious emergency would lead to the need for landing as soon as possible, particularly if not at an airport normally open to the aircraft type. In this particular incident, the pilot-in-command was responsible for determining the seriousness of the situation.
(4)	(a)	There were a total of 11 flights between the two reported incidents, four flights on 6 August 2001 and seven flights on 7 August 2001.
(b)	& (c) The two incidents were reported on two separate report forms by two different pilots and therefore logged at the ATSB as two separate incidents. Initial ATSB analysis indicated that both of the fumes events were the result of a bearing seal fault in the number 3 engine. An in-depth category 4 investigation was carried out in response to the second event that occurred on 7 August 2001 but with reference to both events. The first event, on 6 August 2001, was therefore logged as a category 5 investigation, for statistical purposes. The cabin crews and flight crews of both flights were interviewed during the information gathering process.  
(5)	(a)	The inspection undertaken on 6 August 2001 was undertaken in accordance with CASA and British Aerospace Systems requirements. The reason the source of the fumes was not found during the first maintenance inspection could not be determined from the ATSB's investigation.
(b)	The initial maintenance inspection of the airconditioning system, engines and APU that revealed no signs of oil contamination or oil leaks, highlighted the difficulty faced by maintenance staff in trying to trace the cause of reported fumes events. The identification of the failed oil seal and the subsequent engine change resulted from the CASA airworthiness directive requiring the operator to follow up the event with corrective maintenance action.
(6)	The Government acknowledges that the issue of air safety and cabin air quality in the BAe 146 aircraft has received considerable attention, particularly following an incident in July 1997. In response to a recommendation made by the then Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) following its investigation into the incident in 1999, CASA undertook an extensive review of the certification of the BAe 146 aircraft and concluded that the aircraft continues to meet the design standards applicable to the aircraft. 
It should be noted that an aircraft is certificated against standards which apply at that time of certification. For example, the BAe 146 was certificated in 1983 by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority against Joint Aviation Requirement 25 as existing at that time. Similarly the United States Federal Aviation Administration certificated the aircraft in 1983 against Federal Aviation Regulation 25.831 that existed at that date.
As a signatory to the Chicago Convention, CASA performs its functions in a manner consistent with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The ICAO Manual of Procedures for an Airworthiness Organisation Doc 9389-AN/919, Para 5.2.1 states: The airworthiness standards which were complied with are identified clearly in the Type Certificate/Approval and become the regulatory basis for the Certificate/Approval. These standards normally continue to be applicable to individual aircraft/components built in accordance with the design. The intention of ICAO is that the basis of certification continues unchanged through the life of the aircraft, not-with-standing subsequent changes in the certification standards.
When the certification standard for aircraft is enhanced, the new standard is seldom applied to existing aircraft. Only in exceptional cases is an enhanced standard applied retrospectively to existing aircraft.
CASA has also issued Airworthiness Directive/BAe 146/86, effective 3 April 2001, to mandate enhanced techniques for isolating sources of contamination and to implement improved maintenance procedures. The introduction of these requirements, in conjunction with improvements made by the aircraft's manufacturer, has led to a decrease in the incidence of fume events.
