"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in August 1999:
Whether the Native Title Act 1993 , as amended, is consistent with:
(a)	 Australia's international legal obligations, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and
(b)	 the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 , and the principles underlying it.
Madam President, this is an important issue and one that should be of concern to the Senate. What we are talking about here goes not just to legislation passed by this place—legislation of domestic impact—but also to this country's international reputation. Also its ramifications go to the fabric of our society. It goes to the issue of the Prime Minister's much heralded 10-point plan of legislation which was debated in the Senate less than a 
 year ago, and it goes to what the rest of the world sees as the impact of that legislation.
The 10-point plan was legislation that was widely condemned at the time of its introduction because it was basically legislation that overrode the views, wishes and interests of indigenous Australians. It was widely condemned at home because it was unfair and, we believe, discriminatory.
Those who argued very strongly against that legislation—indigenous Australians—felt that they had found no justice at home, so what they did was to seek justice abroad. This is not the first time it has happened, but it has to be of concern to all of us that this is part of an increasing trend. It is an increasing trend because many Australians now do not find a degree of fairness, fair go or justice from their national government. As a consequence, they are pursuing their rights and interests in the international forum.
Those who think that this debate is over, that the issue will be put to bed this morning if it does not get up, and that it will go away, should realise that they have something else coming to them. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has already indicated that Australia is on notice that it will maintain a watching brief in respect to our response to their decision and our response to the needs of indigenous Australians.
The government may have told them not to come to Australia; the government may have told them that our doors are closed to international concern; and the government may have told them that it would not welcome a visit. But I think it is fair to say that they will maintain an interest and keep on maintaining that interest as part of a growing body of international organisations that have concerns in respect of how Australia is performing, not just on indigenous matters, but also—as we know from debates in recent weeks—in respect of broader matters of cultural and environmental concern.
Once again we have hit the international headlines in a matter that is no good for our international reputation and in fact tarnishes that international reputation. This time it was the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
 Discrimination in its 54th session between 1 and 19 March that considered Australia's Native Title Act. Acting under its early warning procedures, the committee adopted a decision in respect to Australia, requesting information from Australia regarding three areas of concern: the proposed changes to the 1993 Native Title Act; changes of policy in respect to Aboriginal land rights; and changes in the position or functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. They were the matters that the committee embarked upon overviewing on 11 August 1998.
The committee in its deliberations welcomed the full and thorough reply of the Australian government. The Attorney-General himself in press statement after press statement indicated that he thought Australia was getting fair treatment and had an opportunity to put its case comprehensively to the committee.
It is also important to place on record that the committee received similarly detailed and useful comments from the Acting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. They got advice from ATSIC and there was advice from members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee undertook a broad assessment of Australia's practices in this area. They indicated their concern that:
. . . the effects of Australia's racially discriminatory land practices have endured as an acute impairment of the rights of Australia's indigenous communities.
That is the historical fact that they recognise in their decision. They also went on to recognise the importance of the Mabo decision. Mabo was a decision that ensured, for the first time, a rejection of the concept of terra nullius and an acceptance of the survival of indigenous title to land where such title had previously not been recognised. The committee also welcomed that the Native Title Act 1993 provided a framework for the continued recognition of indigenous land rights following the precedent established in the Mabo case. 
The committee then went on to look at the 1993 act and compare it, most importantly, to the 1998 act. Having considered the amendments moved by the government to the 1993 act, they expressed concern over the compatibility of the government's amendments with the state party's—Australia's—international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. They said:
While the original Native Title Act recognizes and seeks to protect indigenous title, provisions that extinguish or impair the exercise of indigenous title rights and interests pervade the amended Act.
The committee went on to say:
While the original 1993 Native Title Act was delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders, the amended Act appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title.
It comes as no surprise to those who took part in the debate in this place and those who followed it that there were four areas of major concern that the committee had in respect of the government's 10-point plan. There were four areas where the committee felt that the government's legislation acted in a racially discriminatory manner against indigenous Australians, and the committee listed them:
These include: the Act's ""validation"" provisions; the ""confirmation of extinguishment"" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions; and restrictions concerning the right of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.
These were the four areas that attracted most attention in this place during the course of that long debate. The committee, as did the previous government in 1993, recognised that there can be wind-back, but there is a capacity for the use of a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act and under the international convention which can accommodate a degree of negativeness if the overall package passed by the parliament can be seen to be positive. The committee said, of the four measures that they were concerned about:
. . . appears to wind back the protections of indigenous title offered in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia and the 1993 Native Title Act. As such, the amended Act cannot be considered to be a special measure within the meaning 
 of Articles 1(4) and 2(2) of the Convention and raises concerns about—
Australia's compliance with articles 2 and 5 of the convention.
The committee was concerned about another aspect that we were also concerned about during the course of the debate. The committee found that there was a lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments. They were concerned with respect to the Howard government's compliance with its obligations under article 5(c) of the convention. That article and the committee's general recommendations have stressed the importance of ensuring `that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life'—not just cursory or token participation, but effective participation in public life. An important principle that they hold, which is reflected in the convention, is that no decisions directly relating to indigenous people's rights and interests should be taken without their informed consent.
Concern after concern is expressed by this international eminent committee on the elimination of race discrimination—concerns that in many respects reflect the concerns that indigenous Australians had during the passage of the Howard Wik 10-point plan.
The committee had further concerns about the broader agenda in respect of indigenous Australians which Australia has embarked upon under the Howard government. They were concerned that Australia had proposed to change the overall structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, abolishing the position of ATSI Social Justice Commissioner and assigning those functions to a generalist deputy president. They felt there was a need for a qualified specialist to address matters affecting indigenous Australians given the continuing political, economic and social marginalisation of the indigenous community in Australia.
Having made all these findings, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on Australia to take certain action. They also indicated—and this is 
 probably the most telling of their recommendations:
In light of the urgency and fundamental importance of these matters, and taking into account the willingness expressed by—
Australia—
to continue the dialogue with the Committee over these provisions, the Committee decides to keep this matter on its agenda under its early warning and urgent action procedures to be reviewed again at its fifty-fifth session.
So there you have it—fundamentally important findings of discrimination against Australia which this committee says they will keep on their early warning system and keep a watching brief over. So the government has been put on notice, but the government, we know, will not react. The government's basic attitude to these sorts of matters is to take the view of the Prime Minister that the rest of the world is only there to play cricket against and `we won't take them into account when it comes to their views of how we perform'. But this is a short-sighted policy, a policy that basically limits Australia's role, and capacity to play a role, in international affairs.
—Indonesia doesn't even have a cricket team, you dope.
—Senator Campbell, you talk about Indonesia not having a cricket team. Unfortunately, even in respect of Indonesia, the Australian government had to be dragged into implementing an action plan which was recommended by the shadow foreign minister just a few months ago.
—Are you talking about Gough Whitlam?
—You could see what was going to happen in Indonesia. You had advice as to what was going to happen. Indonesian lives were endangered; Australian lives were endangered. That was part of the advice given to your cabinet, but it took a long time for Alexander to get out of bed on that one, and it took longer for the Prime Minister to trail behind him.
Unfortunately for the interests of Australia worldwide at the moment, under this Prime Minister, we do not recognise that we have a role to play which, in a sense, is above our size in the world. That is affecting us here. 
 Time after time, whether it is by the ILO, this committee or the World Heritage Committee, we are getting a reflection not just against the Howard government but against this nation. If we have got any respect for the role and the status of this nation in world affairs, and if John Howard, the Prime Minister, and Daryl Williams, the Attorney-General, are not going to take action, are not going to respond, are not going to treat people with civility, it is important for this parliament to stand up for the reputation of Australia. Senator Campbell, you may not care about it, but I tell you what: if you are doing business, if you are interacting with the rest of the world, then you are concerned about Australia's status and the respect which the rest of the world may or may not show us from time to time.
What did the government do? They got this broad, condemnatory decision from the committee. It was a decision which should not have been of surprise to them, either. It was a decision which was in accordance with advice given to the government during the debate. Robert Orr, of the Wik task force, on 17 November 1997 produced an advice to government. In that private advice to government—and it is worth putting all of this on the record—he said, by way of a question time brief:
On 3 February 1997, the Commonwealth received advice from Mr D F Jackson QC that legislative wholesale extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases by either the states/territories or the Commonwealth, even with `just terms' compensation, would be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act (consistent with previous advice by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General's Department).
So the government's own external advice was basically being confirmed by the committee. But let us go on. Contact officer Robert Orr continued his brief by saying:
Advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor on whether the 10-point plan was consistent with the RDA—
let us keep in mind that the Racial Discrimination Act incorporates the international covenant into Australian law—
and if not, would any of its proposals cause the RDA to be invalid as no longer supported by the constitutional external affairs power. In summary, 
 Chief General Counsel Henry Burmester advised on 25 July 1997—
that is almost two years ago—
that he is of the view that in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the RDA or with CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime (especially the provision for `permanent extinguishment' if this is found not to be the common law provision), and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of co-existing native title rights.
So this international committee, charged with oversighting compliance with the international covenant on the elimination of racial discrimination, is saying what the government's own Chief General Counsel has said to this government, and also saying what the external advice said to the government. These are just two avenues of internal advice to the government. The broader advice presented to the Senate committee inquiring into this matter also confirmed that.
Although the Attorney-General, on 11 March this year, said that the government took its international obligations seriously and was keen to assist the UN committee, on 16 March he said that Australia welcomed the chance to present a detailed case to the committee and had informed the committee of an extensive process of consultation. The Attorney-General began the big lie in that press statement. On the second page he said:
The Australian Government's view, as advised to the Committee, is that the Government has not breached the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
He told the Australian public that the view of the government was that there was no breach of the convention, when the advice to the government from its most eminent legal sources was that the government had breached the convention. What did he do after the decision from CERD? What was the government's response then? That is reflected once again in a press statement from the Attorney-General. He said:
The Committee's comments are an insult to Australia and all Australians as they are unbalanced and do not refer to the submission made by Australia on the native title issue. 

He is shooting the international messenger who has told him internationally what he knows and has known domestically for quite some time—that we have been, and we are, in breach of the international covenant.
So the government says the committee's comments are unbalanced; it shoots the messenger and tries to reflect on the reputation and capacity of the international forum which takes a very dark view of what we have done on this matter. The Attorney-General went on to say:
The Government's view, as advised to the Committee, is that Australia has not breached the Convention . . . 
The advice to the government from its most senior legal advisers was that we had breached the convention. That is the second lie. He went on by giving the normal, gratuitous flicks around the ears that we are used to from this government to committees like this and to the World Heritage Committee. He said:
The comments by the committee are unbalanced and fail to understand Australia's system of democracy.
Is he saying that Chief General Counsel Burmester failed to understand Australia's system of democracy? Is he saying that Mr Jackson QC failed to understand it? Is he saying that they are unbalanced? If that is the case, they ought to be removed from their offices of privilege in advising the government. He does not say that of those people who have given the government the same advice, but he does say that in regard to the international committee. Basically, that means that the government is not taking serious action here. The rest of the world has a continuing interest. The Guardian Weekly , just a few weeks ago, said `Washed away in a tide of white history'—one expression of international concern about how we are handling this matter at home.
In closing the debate, let us put on record that the government is not taking this seriously and we should. Let us also put on record that there is a degree of resonance between the response which Mr Howard has given and the response, for instance, taken by Mr Smith in Africa quite a few years ago. The Prime 
 Minister says, `Our official view is that Australian laws are made by Australian parliaments elected by the Australian people, not by a UN committee.' Haven't we heard that before? Haven't we heard that from an international regime that rejects international scrutiny of its domestic practices, especially when those practices are so offensive to the basic law of humanity that has been not just accepted by Australia but sponsored by Australia? The UN convention was one of those conventions that we were in the forefront of implementing internationally, but our position now basically is, `We can do at home whatever we want and the rest of the world can go jump.' In the long-term interests of Australia, we cannot afford that to be the view emanating from this parliament. It may be the view which the Prime Minister is happy with, but we should not be.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-04-29,"—I support the motion of Senator Bolkus and indicate the support of the Australian Democrats for it. In doing so, I will not repeat all of the issues raised by Senator Bolkus—he covered the issue very well—but there are a couple of things I want to add to the debate. The first thing I want to say is that we should congratulate those indigenous leaders who presented the case before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for their persistence, for their obvious intelligence and for the very comprehensive way in which they detailed the case. This country owes a lot to indigenous leaders who no longer—as I think was once inferred in the minds of many people in this country—need the help of white Australians in presenting these kinds of cases.
Certainly in this case and in many others they are more than capable of presenting a case on their own behalf and, in this instance, not only did so on the issue which they were supporting but also did so against the very best bureaucratic advice that this government could mount on the other side. It sent its most senior bureaucrat, the person who in fact designed the native title amendment laws. He was unable, over and against the arguments put by the indigenous leaders, to convince the 
 CERD committee of the government's position. That is very significant and those indigenous leaders who presented the case need our congratulations and our support. Obviously they were able to convince an international forum in the face of the very best bureaucratic ability that the government could mount.
I would also like to indicate that individually Senator Reynolds, Mr Melham and I invited by letter—not necessarily representing our parties, but as individuals—the CERD committee to visit Australia. We are not yet sure of the status of that visit, whether or not it will happen, because once again the government does not want scrutiny of its actions or of its legislative program. I do hope that the committee will visit Australia because, even if the government believes that it is right in this particular issue, this would present the government with an opportunity to argue its case, to show how the CERD committee has got it wrong, as the government asserts. The best way to resolve that would be to have the CERD committee visit Australia and to hear both sides of the debate on the ground, face to face. I would be very surprised if the government opposes this visit because it would give the government an opportunity to present its case and would give an opportunity not only to the international forum to observe but also to all Australians to make a judgment about the arguments on both sides.
I am in a way ashamed that the CERD committee found that Australia was guilty of discrimination, but not surprised. I have firmly believed all along, right from the beginning of the publishing of the 10-point plan by the Prime Minister, that that 10-point plan would work to the significant disadvantage of indigenous people. I believe that to be absolutely right, and this has now been confirmed by this international forum. The Native Title Amendment Bill, as amended and then passed by the Senate and by the House of Representatives, is undoubtedly discriminatory. I am convinced of that. I believe that, eventually, if it comes before the High Court of Australia, it will be found to be discriminatory, as has been found in this international forum. 
I am bemused by the way in which this government argues that some international forums should not be listened to when at the same time other international forums are not only listened to but slavishly followed to the detriment of many Australians. Of course I refer to the World Trade Organisation, before whom we grovel to the great detriment of many of the primary industries of this country. We are prepared to grovel before that international forum when it is to do with trade issues, but when it comes to human rights issues we take no notice of international forums or of their criticisms of this country.
We support the motion to refer this matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I trust that it will pass, because this is another opportunity for the whole issue to be considered. It is very important that we, in the Senate and in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, look carefully at what has been said by the CERD committee and that we revisit this issue. If we do not, it will continue to attract international criticism for as long as we allow it to be a blot on this country's previous good reputation in the area of human rights.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-29,"—I too rise in support of the motion moved by Senator Bolkus to refer the Native Title Act 1993, as amended in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry. I do that because, having taken considerable interest in the bill when it was debated and in the process leading up to that, I realised that a great many questions were left unanswered. One of the most instructive elements of the committee process leading up to us dealing with the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 was the fora to which some of the best silks in the country came and discussed the constitutionality. That was very stimulating. It was probably almost unprecedented to have that kind of fora dealing with a particular issue of a bill. Here we have brought up another element of the same bill—that is, whether the bill abides by Australia's international commitments.
Senator Woodley is quite right when he says that the current Australian government 
 picks and chooses which international fora it abides by. When the World Trade Organisation, or perhaps even the World Bank, says, `Jump', the Australian government says, `How high?' I guess that jumping high has come from the previous government as well, in that we not only did what we were required to do under the Uruguay Round of GATT but we went beyond that, many believe naively, on the assumption that we would benefit. That has meant considerable change in and interference with Australia's domestic laws.
We have seen the introduction of national competition policy before many other countries have gone that way. We are now only just beginning to look at that. We have never in this country looked at the impact of Australia signing the Uruguay Round of GATT. We have never done that as a Senate inquiry, much to my sadness. Here we have a situation where an international body, having looked at Australia's laws in relation to the Native Title Act, have said, `In our opinion, this does not abide by Australia's international commitments.'
Unfortunately, what I saw many times during the debate was throwaway lines and debating points in relation to human rights. I recall a number of comments about racial discrimination and whether the process of not allowing consultation or the right to negotiate on land was racially discriminatory. In the debate the government frequently used an argument which assumed terra nullius—that is, that the country was empty—and that Aboriginal people had to abide by the rules of leaseholders or other people who did not own the land. So we had a situation where the throwaway debating points in relation to whether the bill itself was racially discriminatory had an in-built assumption of terra nullius—the very assumption that the High Court had thrown away in saying that the country was not empty when white settlers came. This is pretty basic; it is not about throwaway lines or debating points or things that you say on a broadcast day. It is about whether in legal terms, under Australia's laws and Australia's Constitution, we are doing something in a bill which is against Australia's international obligations.
The government has almost run out of international fora to abuse in recent times. We have seen issues relating to immigration, refugees, the treatment of Australia's indigenous population, the environment and uranium mining—they are almost running out of international fora to abuse. We are getting comments from other legislatures, including in Europe, Japan and the United States. Quite frankly, I think people going overseas these days would have to wear a paper bag over their head in many different fora.
I am also hearing things from business people. I shared a plane with a business person—a conservative business person—who was operating a great deal in London, who said that it is getting very difficult to do business in Europe and even in Britain because of Australia's international reputation. This government seems to be mostly interested in business so they should at least be interested in the fact that we are dirtying our reputation to such an extent that people do not even want to do business with us.
We should make sure that as a parliament we look into the elements of this bill and that the committee has a chance to report. We should once again invite some of the best legal minds in the country—they are usually willing to come to these interesting and historic debates to find out what the issues really are. We do not just want debating points or throwaway lines. We want to find out what the weight of opinion says so that we can best deal with this issue in the future. Quite clearly, the Greens (WA) support this motion. I would like to think the government is prepared to look at it as well. Either way, I hope this motion gets majority support in the parliament.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I rise today to support my colleague's motion in relation to the Native Title Act and the decision of the United Nations committee. I think we have to be mindful when we sit in chambers such as this that laws that we pass are not always perfect and do not always encompass the intent or the purpose. They are there for scrutiny and, if we ever believe for one minute that we pass laws that are to stay there in concrete, then 
 we are doing a disservice to the people we serve. Those laws are there to be tested and to be tried in courts. In a way I believe that the United Nations is another form of this process of checks and balances in which our laws can be put up and examined.
All Australians should be particularly concerned about this decision. We are in an era of reconciliation. We are in an era when we are trying to teach our children and when we encourage the idea, even amongst our own peers, that discrimination is not a good thing, that it is something you do not do, that it is something you should be embarrassed to do. We now have, on a broader scale, an international body which is closely watching and monitoring laws of other countries but more so Australia in the last three years. It has come up with a decision that we now should take note of. We should be forging the way here and setting an example for the rest of the world to follow. It seems that we have gone mightily backwards in the last three years when a United Nations committee has made a decision that the Native Title Act is in breach of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
This convention was actually signed in 1966 under a Holt Liberal government. It was ratified in 1975. So this convention has actually been looked at by governments of Australia twice. We have signed up and then ratified the convention—over a long period of years now. I am going back 23 years, so it is something that we have been committed to for quite a while. The committee has decided on and issued an unambiguous statement, I think, that this government is committing racial discrimination. They say that we are in breach of articles 2 and 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
Aboriginal people in this country have welcomed a decision and statement by an international body, the United Nations committee. They have been pressing this government for many years to try to make some positive moves towards consulting with them, to listening to them, to sitting down and trying to understand where they want to go. 
 But they have to look to an international forum to get the recognition they want. On the very day that the United Nations committee handed down this decision, ATSIC put out a press release saying that indigenous people of Australia welcome the CERD findings. In my own electorate of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal people are talking about this—such as occurred two weeks ago in Broome and Kununurra. They are not excited about it, they are not happy that they have had to go outside this country to try to find the kind of recognition and realisation that what is happening to them is not right. But they are pleased that somebody is taking notice.
This government is not pleased that somebody is taking notice. In fact, this government is embarrassed. This government does not want to know about the United Nations decisions. Last year we saw this government push through the laws for the Native Title Act. As Senator Margetts said, we had discussions about whether this act would be discriminatory. We had comments about it. The comments were either fobbed off or we were reassured that the act was not discriminatory.
A couple of weeks ago, the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA, in their submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, said that they had reservations about the processes that this parliament undertakes. They were specifically talking about the operation of this joint parliamentary committee. In their submission they made a reference to the United Nations CERD decision. In particular, they wanted to emphasise recommendation XIII which stressed the importance of ensuring `that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent'.
They raised that in the context of the joint parliamentary committee, because they are saying that the committee is only being seen to happen; it takes submissions from Aboriginal people, from pastoralists and companies but it really does not change the substance of the act or the position of this 
 government. So it is almost like a token consultation. So they looked to the United Nations for confirmation of this and they got it. They got the United Nations saying, `That is right. We believe that the actions of this government do not take notice of your effective participation and do not bother to get your consent when forming their laws.'
So let us have a look at why people—and particularly Aboriginal people—believe that the legislation is in breach of the international convention. It does not protect the land ownership of Aboriginal people. It is clearly the instrument which increases the legal ownership rights over land held by non-Aboriginal parties such as pastoralists. It increases the other land ownership rights, to the corresponding detriment of the Aboriginal peoples. And in all instances where invalid titles occur through duplication of ownership, it prefers the interests in land of non-Aboriginal people over the interests of Aboriginal people. It manifestly interferes with Aboriginal landowners' rights to negotiate their interests over their land and it does not have the informed consent of Aboriginal peoples.
I am calling on this government to take urgent action to redress this situation and to give close scrutiny to whether or not this legislation is racially discriminatory. I do not see that there is a problem with that. As I said earlier, we do make laws, and laws are not always perfect. Perhaps it is time to actually sit back and say, `Well, let's have a look at this. We have had Aboriginal people who are not happy with it. We now have a decision of the United Nations.' I think the government are paying a high price for this folly; a very high price for their blindness and their unwillingness to say, `Perhaps there is a problem here.' The price is, of course, their international reputation. As I said, they signed up and ratified this convention twice, and they have now broken their word.
Since the decision of the United Nations committee has come down, this government has sought to question the legitimacy of the United Nations committee's decision. Coming from the Northern Territory, I would have to say it is shades of Kakadu and Jabiluka here. 
 If the decision does not actually fall over the line for us, we turn around and say, `You people really aren't experts after all and perhaps you don't really know what you are talking about.' Unlike Jabiluka, where the excuse was that they are not really scientists and they do not know what they are doing, in this case the excuse is, `You don't understand how Australian law operates.' This committee does understand what racial discrimination is, it does understand about the needs of indigenous people and it certainly understands what it means to actually talk to, listen to and consult with these people and have their consent.
As Senator Bolkus mentioned earlier, the government's own Chief General Counsel, Henry Burmester, advised this government on 25 July 1997. He said:
. . . in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act or CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime . . . and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of coexisting native title rights.
In supporting this recommendation Australians, and particularly indigenous Australians, are now entitled to know whether this government has enacted a law which has subsequently been found to be discriminatory or whether they blatantly knew all along that it was discriminatory and they did so knowing this. I think we all have a right to know the answer to that. The fundamental moral obligation of all Australian governments is not to discriminate on the basis of race. This Native Title Act has been found to be racially discriminatory by the United Nations, and it may well be confirmed to be so by this Senate inquiry. I call on the government to change its law and to make sure that it complies with both our international and our moral obligations.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Reynolds, Sen Margaret",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I want to support this motion by Senator Bolkus. I believe it is appropriate for the Legal and Constitutional References Committee of the Senate to look very closely at the UN decision and to report back to the Senate. I was disappointed last week when what I considered to be a relatively mild 
 motion was defeated in this place. In that motion I asked that the Senate express its grave concern about the CERD report. The Senate did not agree with that. Yet, as other speakers have said, how can the Senate not be concerned that the international law making body, the United Nations, has found that there are questions to answer about whether or not we are upholding the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination? We should be concerned, and that is all the first part of my original motion was saying.
Secondly, if we are concerned, we should have been prepared to deal with this issue. This issue has not come before the Senate on the initiative of the government. It has not come before the House of Representatives on the initiative of the government. It has been brought up only by opposition members in this place. I think the government should demonstrate that it has some concern and some plan as to how it is going to respond. Thirdly, I ask the government to reopen discussions with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. That is not a very radical proposition, I would have thought. Sooner or later someone is going to have to talk and someone is going to have to resolve this concern. The government cannot hide from it.
Finally, the Senate could have invited the United Nations committee to visit Australia and look at the issues first-hand. The government apparently is not going to invite the committee. The committee no doubt will not come in a formal sense if the government has not invited it, but there is no doubt that the committee members will visit in their own right and will talk with Aboriginal people, will talk with all those many hundreds of people who contacted them in the months leading to their deliberations. The chair of the committee said in his comments after the hearing that the expressions of concern and the numbers of submissions received from Australia and from ordinary Australians were unprecedented, and still the government refuses to take this matter seriously.
What will happen in the processes if we do not make a response between now and 
 August? That will be reported to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in a session later this year, some time in November or December. Is that what we want? Is that what our diplomats want? Is that what the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister want? Do we really want the issue aired in the General Assembly that we have been found wanting in upholding the racial discrimination convention? Are we not prepared to even talk about it?
It is a head in the sand attitude by the government because sooner or later they will have to address this. Sooner or later they will have to talk with Aboriginal people. Sooner or later they will have to confront this issue, if necessary, in the courts because the finding of the CERD committee gives enormous weight to the legal arguments that have been put on behalf of indigenous people. For the government to just try to hide and say, `Aboriginal people shouldn't go overseas airing dirty linen in public,' is nonsense. Indigenous people and spokespeople for indigenous people have been going overseas to complain about Australia's treatment of indigenous people for over a hundred years. There are any number of examples of people taking their concern about the treatment of indigenous people outside Australia simply because they could not get action in this country. Back in colonial society days, the Anti-Slavery Society was expressing concern about the way indigenous people were being treated in this country, so there is nothing new about indigenous people and/or their supporters and advocates expressing concern in the international community.
What else do you do? If you cannot get action at home, you have to appeal outside. Look at what has happened in other countries. We take it for granted, when human rights abuses are not being addressed within countries, that activists and spokespeople will make appeals outside to make them international issues. If we do not want the rights of indigenous people to be an international issue, we have to deal with this issue at home. We 
 could deal with it at home simply if government learned to talk with indigenous people and learned to compromise instead of just bulldozing through and assuming that a piece of legislation can wipe off the planet the rights of indigenous people. If these were your property rights, Mr Acting Deputy President, or mine we would find that there would be absolute uproar if they were just—at the stroke of a pen through a piece of legislation—taken from us.
Gay McDougall, the committee expert who served as country rapporteur for the situation in Australia, said that indigenous land rights were unique and `encompassed a traditional and cultural connection to the land that had been recognised in international law'. That is a fact. Governments might not like it but it is a fact. Governments have to deal with it unless they want to cut themselves off completely from the international community. She said the international community now understood that doctrines of dispossession were `illegitimate and racist'.
We do not like the word `racist' and I agree that it can be bandied around as a term of abuse indiscriminately, if you will forgive the poor attempt at a pun, and I do not believe in calling people or governments `racist'. But the reality is that international law has shown that doctrines of dispossession are illegitimate and racist whether we like that term or not. It is like the term `genocide'. People get very upset about it and say, `No, we weren't ever involved in genocide.' We were—literally—and the fact that we do not like the word is irrelevant. The government policy in the past to systematically remove Aboriginal children from their families and culture was a form of genocide and that is a fact, just as the doctrines of dispossession are racist.
One of these days this government—and indeed future governments—will have to come to terms with it; they will have to deal with it. People in this country will demand it; the international community will demand it. Ms McDougall noted that the delegation had said several times that `the Australian government believed that it could not go back and cure the injustices of the past'. She said she could see some merit in that view—she is a 
 reasonable person—but what concerned her was that the validation and confirmation of extinguishment provisions in the amended act, that is, the Wik legislation, did not apply to the distant past; they appeared to apply to actions that in some cases had taken place as recently as 1994 and 1996. She said she would welcome a discussion within the committee about how experts might continue their urgent deliberations on Australia's situation beyond the conclusion of the current session.
I want to go back to the fact that at the moment there is on the books of the CERD committee a decision that is adverse to Australia and its international reputation and that, as far as I am aware, no-one within the government are doing anything about it. Senator Bolkus has raised a practical proposition of referring the decision to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That would be a good start, but he is a member of the opposition. Other senators, including Senator Margetts and Senator Woodley, have expressed concern about this issue, as have members of the other place. But all that the government representatives—Senator Herron, Mr Ruddock and the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams—have done is to deny that this is an issue and say, `They're biased. They don't understand Australia.' Well, they would like to understand Australia better by visiting some time in late June or early July.
But can they get an official invitation? They certainly could not get an official invitation from this Senate because the government would not support it. That is fair enough—the government should be doing the inviting. But the government is not inviting the committee. I challenge the ministerial representative in the chamber at the moment to report back to the Senate and let us know whether it is the government's intention to officially invite the committee. If the government are so sure that their legislation is non-discriminatory, if they are so proud of their relationship with indigenous people, what have they got to be scared of? Why are they avoiding scrutiny? But, if they do have something of a conscience and they want to avoid this scrutiny, do they really think it is going to help in the 
 long run when the committee has to report to the United Nations General Assembly in November or December that there has been a failure to respond and no dialogue on this subject?
I say to the government in as bipartisan way as I can muster, which is obviously fairly difficult for me on this side of the house, that this issue is not going to go away. Government members may say, `There goes the opposition bad mouthing the government,' but I am not particularly criticising the government. I am simply saying that government has to deal with it. That is why we elect governments. It is not in the interests of Australia, as Senator Margetts and Senator Crossin said, to ignore this and hope that somehow it will go away. It will not go away.
For instance, already there is a European Network for Indigenous Australian Rights in London. On 22 March 1999 there was an Aboriginal call for British responsibility at Westminster. So this issue was being raised in London. I have here the US Department of State Australia Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998. It is quite a lengthy report on Australia's human rights practices. It contains a couple of pages of comment that is scarcely complimentary about the problems Australia has with indigenous rights. Of course, government can say, and I would say, that the US Department of State might look at its own practice in terms of human rights—the United States has the death penalty and Australia does not. Every country has reason to explain their policies in regard to human rights.
Australia in 1992 was praised, was held up as a fine example, by the very same committee that is now critical. When I say that we were praised, I do not mean that everything the former government—the then Keating government—did in regard to indigenous rights was absolutely perfect. I was critical of my own government at that time on a number of issues. But the last time we appeared before the CERD committee it was generally recognised that Australia was moving in a very positive direction. There had been the landmark High Court case, the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 Commission and the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and it seemed that, with the independent reporting of both the minister and ATSIC, there was progression in the recognition of indigenous rights generally in Australia. That is why I believe the committee has been shocked by the changes that have occurred in recent years.
In conclusion, I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard the decision on Australia of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at its 54th session, 1-19 March 1999. This has been reported in the media, but the full text of it has not been tabled in the lower house. It has not been tabled by the government in this house and, therefore, I seek not to table it but to incorporate it because I believe it should be there for all Australians who are interested to read.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
54TH SESSION 1-19 March 1999
CERD/C/54/Misc.40/Rev.2
18 March 1999
Unedited version
AUSTRALIA
Decision
1.	 Acting under its early warning procedures, the Committee adopted Decision 1(53) on Australia on 11 August 1998 (A/53/18, para. 22), requesting information from the State Party regarding three areas of concern: proposed changes to the 1993 Native Title Act; changes of policy as to Aboriginal land rights; and changes in the position or function of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. The Committee welcomes the full and thorough reply of the Commonwealth Government of Australia to this request for information (CERD/C/347). The Committee also appreciates the dialogue with the delegation from the State party at the Committee's 1323rd and 1324th meetings to respond to additional questions posed by the Committee in regard to the State Party's submission.
2.	 The Committee received similarly detailed and useful comments from the Acting Aboriginal and Torres and Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; members of the Parliament and Senate of Australia. 

3.	 The Committee recognizes that within the broad range of discriminatory practices that have long been directed against Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the effects of Australia's racially discriminatory land practices have endured as an acute impairment of the rights of Australia's indigenous communities.
4.	 The Committee recognizes further that the land rights of indigenous peoples are unique and encompass a traditional and cultural identification of the indigenous peoples with their land that has been generally recognized.
5.	 In its last Concluding Observations on the previous report of Australia, the Committee welcomed the attention paid by the Australian judiciary to the implementation of the Convention. (A/49/18, para. 540) The Committee also welcomed the decision of the High Court of Australia in the case of Mabo v. Queensland, noting that in recognizing the survival of indigenous title to land where such title had not otherwise been validly extinguished, the High Court case constituted a significant development in the recognition of Indigenous rights under the Convention. The Committee welcomed, further, the Native Title Act of 1993, which provided a framework for the continued recognition of indigenous land rights following the precedent established in the Mabo case.
6.	 The Committee having considered a series of new amendments to the Native Title Act, as adopted in 1998, expresses concern over the compatibility of the Native Title Act, as currently amended, with the State Party's international obligations under the Convention. While the original Native Title Act recognizes and seeks to protect indigenous title, provisions that extinguish or impair the exercise of indigenous title rights and interests pervade the amended Act. While the original 1993 Native Title Act was delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders, the amended Act appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title.
7.	 The Committee notes, in particular, four specific provisions that discriminate against indigenous title-holders under the newly amended Act. These include the Acts's ""validation"" provisions; the ""confirmation of extinguishment"" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions; and restrictions concerning the right of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.
8.	 These provisions raise concerns that the amended Act appears to wind back the protections of indigenous title offered in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia and the 1993 Native Title Act. As such, the amended Act cannot be considered to be a special measure within the meaning of Articles 1(4) and 2(2) of the Convention and raises concerns about the State Party's 
 compliance with Articles 2 and 5 of the Convention.
9.	 The lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments also raises concerns with respect to the State Party's compliance with its obligations under Article 5(c) of the Convention. Calling upon States Parties to ""recognise and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their common lands, territories and resources,"" the Committee, in its General Recommendation XXIII, stressed the importance of ensuring ""that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent.""
10.	 While welcoming the State Party's recognition of the important role that has been played by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Committee also notes with concern the State Party's proposed changes to the overall structure of the Commission; abolishing the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and assigning those functions to a generalist Deputy President. The Committee strongly encourages the State Party to consider all possible effects of such a restructuring, including whether the new Deputy President would have sufficient opportunity to address in an adequate manner the full range of issues regarding indigenous peoples warranting attention. Consideration should be given to the additional benefits of an appropriately qualified specialist position to address these matters, given the continuing political, economic and social marginalization of the indigenous community of Australia.
11.	 The Committee calls on the State Party to address these concerns as a matter of utmost urgency. Most importantly, in conformity with the Committee's General Recommendation XXIII concerning Indigenous Peoples, the Committee urges the State Party to suspend implementation of the 1998 amendments and re-open discussions with the representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with a view to finding solutions acceptable to the indigenous peoples and which would comply with Australia's obligations under the Convention.
12.	 In light of the urgency and fundamental importance of these matters, and taking into account the willingness expressed by the State Party to continue the dialogue with the Committee over these provisions, the Committee decides to keep this matter on its agenda under its early warning and urgent action procedures to be reviewed again at its fifty-fifth session. 

I thank the Senate. In my concluding remarks I again make a plea to the government to recognise that no problem or embarrassment that they feel they are facing in regard to this issue will disappear by being ignored. There is always a view within government—and my government was no different—that, when something is in the too hard basket and people do not quite know what to do with it, if you leave it in the too hard basket long enough it will somehow dissipate and disappear. Indigenous issues and the rights of indigenous Australians will always be with us and will always be the subject of international focus until we learn to work in a realistic cooperative way with indigenous peoples. They will be there at the Olympic Games, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, at the United Nations and when individual members and senators travel overseas. I challenge anyone in this chamber to say they have never been asked about the policies of governments, regardless of the political complexion of governments.
It is an issue that has been raised with me not just by people on formal delegations. A taxi driver asked me, `Are you still locking up your Aboriginal people?' because he had some knowledge of the Aboriginal deaths in custody report. I have spoken to other people who in no way are well informed but who nevertheless know that Australia has this reputation. We have to deal with the rights of indigenous peoples. Whatever the government may feel about Senator Bolkus's motion, I urge them to be open-minded. It can only assist in the process of assessing the concerns of the CERD committee and what action the Senate can recommend that the government put in process to change the way people throughout the world are looking at Australia at the moment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-04-29,"—The speakers before me have gone into many matters that show how crucial this issue is. I do not want to repeat the arguments and propositions that have been put before the Senate, but I do want to talk about the issue of process. Process is often thought of as a very dull topic, and it is—people want to  get to the issues where the imagination, the soul 
 and the heart can soar. Process is simply a means of getting there, but it is important. We are a member of the United Nations organisation, and we are entitled to make criticisms of the way it goes about its tasks and of the conventions it produces, but, as a member, we should take seriously the processes by which it carries out its work.
Take the World Trade Organisation, for example. We have international commitments in trade and commerce. We disagree with a lot of the things that the bodies associated with the World Trade Organisation and world commerce do. We get upset when they say we should allow the importation of products from overseas which we think would harm us here. Nevertheless, we go ahead with it because unless we are prepared to say, `We are in on this arrangement, and we are going to stick by it even though it harms us,' what is the point of going into the arrangement? You might as well withdraw.
In the present instance, a unit of the United Nations has made a criticism of Australia and our conduct in a particular area. Do we then say, `Look, that criticism has been made but we will take no notice of it. When we go into an organisation like the United Nations organisation, we'll only take notice of what is in our favour'? If we did, the whole system would not work. If the only time we turned up at court was when we were going to win, the whole system would collapse. In the same way, if we are only going to take notice of world bodies when they say something that suits us, but when it does not we walk away, then the whole thing is devalued, there is not much point in belonging to it and we might as well get out.
An organisation of the United Nations has made a criticism of Australia, and Senator Bolkus has proposed that we refer the matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee—of which I am a member—where the statement made by this body of the United Nations can be looked at calmly. Submissions can be received from those who say that there is merit in the resolution and from those who say there is not. It seems to me that if the Senate is not prepared to at least have a look at what the United Nations body has said, 
 then it is skating around this important issue of process. It is skating around the obligation to look at what is said and to see what it makes of it.
Taking into account and giving due weight to everything that has been said, one of the central points is how we as a nation, having joined a body voluntarily, treat the sorts of things they say. If we treat them as being not worth much—if we treat them on a discounted basis—then why belong to the world body? As I said before, if we belong to bodies that try to get world trade into a state where it benefits everyone, and we say, `We don't want to listen to you on certain issues,' then we ought to get out of the world body because otherwise we will corrupt the whole process. If you are in an organisation and you do not live by its processes, you corrupt the processes and, ultimately, the body, and the honourable thing to do would be to get out of it. But if you are in them you should treat seriously the sorts of things those bodies say.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-29,"—I agree, as I very often do, with the honourable senator, Senator Cooney, who has just resumed his seat. Process is a very important matter indeed. We should under that circumstance certainly treat as being of worth what CERD say, but they should also treat as being of worth what Australia says. In this instance they did not; in fact they ignored what Australia said. That is something which I believe all Australians, indigenous as well as non-indigenous, should be concerned about.
The detailed legal submissions provided by Australia, both orally and in writing, were largely ignored. They were not referred to in the CERD decision. The portions of the committee's decisions, paragraphs 6 to 8, dealing with the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 could have been written in their entirety prior to the receipt of Australia's submissions. Is that process?
The discriminatory character of the act is asserted without any effort to explain or substantiate the conclusion in terms of the law and of the convention. There is no reflection of the countervailing benefits provided to indigenous communities under the legislation, 
 although this constituted a substantial part of Australia's submissions. Surely it should have been reasonable to expect that Australia's claims in this regard might at least have been noted. But there is no reference to them.
The conclusions in paragraph 10 of the CERD committee report to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner omit any reference to the assurances provided to the committee concerning the ongoing functions of the position. I can go on with list after list where Australia's views were not even acknowledged in the report. I do believe it is very important not to use this issue, either locally or internationally, as a political football. That is why I agree with Senator Cooney about process.
Let us now cast our minds back, if you will, to last year. All honourable senators will remember that the debate on the native title legislation was the longest debate in this chamber since Federation. Let us also understand what happened: there was a breakdown; there was a deadlock prior to Easter. Easter seems to visit me with difficulties.
—It is a great season, though.
—Yes. It is the last week of Lent so we had all to suffer it. I am sorry you had to suffer me, too; nevertheless, the matter unfortunately came down to my vote. The sticking points following the collapse of the Senate debate prior to Easter were the threshold test, the Racial Discrimination Act, the sunset clause and the right to negotiate. After 10 days of negotiations with the government the result, on any fair assessment, was a win for the indigenous people.
Let me explain the position as a result of that. The government's registration test was substantially softened to enable the children of the stolen generation and the victims of the locked gate practices to have their native title claims registered. This allows them access to the benefits of the act. The government backed down on the Racial Discrimination Act. As you will recall, they had put a sunset clause in the legislation, but now the Native Title Act is able to be read and construed by reference to the Racial Discrimination Act. Going to the six-year sunset clause, after 
 which time the government believed that no indigenous group could lodge a claim under the act—a much easier mechanism than a common law action, which they would have been forced to—on my insistence the government scrapped that sunset clause.
On the fourth sticking point, the right to negotiate, registration gave native title claimants access to the provisions of the act, including the right to negotiate with other titleholders. The government was opposed to any right to negotiate for native title claimants on pastoral leases granted by states and territories. I wanted to have the so-called equality of procedure rights for pastoralists and native title claimants, and I maintain that there cannot be such equality unless the nature of native title rights is recognised as unique and their interests different.
On this basis, I was able to secure what is in effect the right to negotiate under a state scheme. This requires notification of a proposed act—for example, mining—to native title holders and claimants; consultation, with a view to minimising any effect; mediation; and, in the event of disagreement, arbitration by an independent person or body. If favourable, that decision can be overturned only by the relevant minister after consultation with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and only in the public interest.
All of this is subject to judicial review to ensure procedures are properly and fairly carried out. Any compensation must be on just terms, decided by an independent tribunal. The state scheme requires the approval of the federal minister and that approval must gain the support of the Senate. If it does not, the federal right to negotiate will apply. Is Queensland—a Labor state—opposed to that? The Northern Territory scheme was tabled two days ago. I am having a very careful look at that. No doubt other senators are examining it as well. As far as I am concerned, it may well not meet with approval, but that must ultimately be a matter for our decision.
There were many other significant improvements to the legislation. I state quite unequivocally that I have continued to uphold both inside this place and out the protection of the 
 common law native title rights of indigenous Australians and have done so in a manner that will provide certainty and fairness to all concerned. I defy anybody to get up in here and say that I have not done that. This is one of the very few motions in this chamber relating to indigenous matters that I have not supported.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—For example, yesterday there was the reference of the Jabiluka matter to a committee. If you cast your mind back, you will recall that there were great outcries from farmers and miners, but thankfully they have agreed—they have no choice I suppose—to work with the new system. Comments were made immediately after by the Chairman of ATSIC, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura. He indicated at that stage that he was comfortable with the outcome and he said:
I must acknowledge the progress that has been made and the contribution that Senator Harradine has made in achieving that progress.
. . .              . . .             . . .
We suspect that Senator Harradine has taken the Prime Minister as far as he could to avoid a race based election. I think he has demonstrated courage and integrity throughout this debate.
Cast your mind back—there was a threat of a double dissolution at that particular time. I knew that that was no idle threat. The country would have been plunged into a blindly intolerant, hate filled and bitter race based election. I must say that that was not uppermost in my mind—I think you have to deal with all of these matters on their merits. At the time, the Chairman of ATSIC expressed his disappointment at the validation of extinguishment acts carried out from 1 July 1994 until the Wik decision in December 1996. Those acts were carried out by the Labor and National Queensland governments contrary to the Native Title Act. Labor voted in the Senate for the validation of those provisions.
Senator Bolkus has asked that these matters be referred to a committee. I say that is absurd, because due process was not undertaken by the CERD committee. But let us hear from Senator Bolkus in his response. Let the Senate hear what changes the Labor Party 
 will make to that legislation if and when they are returned to government. Detail—in huge detail—what changes you are proposing to make to the legislation.
I have received representations from indigenous people who believe this attempt will only exacerbate concerns in rural Australia and be visited upon them. A person whose opinion I very much respect, and who is a very vigorous supporter of the rights of indigenous people in Australia, including native title rights, has expressed the view strongly to me that this sort of action, which is triggered by a decision by a committee of the United Nations without having regard to what Australia has said—ignoring what Australia has said—is only exacerbating the differences and prejudices that we all know currently exist in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I want to add a few quick remarks to this debate. I listened with great interest to what Senator Harradine has just had to say, particularly his comments about due process before the United Nations CERD looking at this matter. I take it as not only an implied criticism, but also a direct criticism of those persons from the Attorney-General's Department led by Mr Orr who appeared before the committee and defended the government and Australia's position.
Obviously Senator Harradine has taken a greater interest in the deliberations of the committee than I perhaps did at the time. He noted that an inadequate job was done before the committee by Mr Orr and the other persons who attended on behalf of Australia. If that is true, it is yet another matter that has to be addressed in the Attorney-General's office, an office that is not holding itself in very high regard for delivering the responsibilities previously delivered by that portfolio to the people of Australia.
I will not delay the chamber, but I wish to make one further comment. I have just returned from overseas. I am not one who travels overseas at taxpayers' expense and takes the opportunity to bucket Australia or the deliberations of the parliaments of Australia. I feel that one should bite one's tongue when one is overseas representing one's 
 nation. It was very difficult to do so in Norway last week when, on two separate occasions, representatives of the Sami nation met and made representations to a parliamentary delegation from this parliament on Australia's indigenous people. We did bite our tongues. We did not take sides, bucket Australia or in any way denigrate Australia, and the whole delegation did that, not just me. We behaved impeccably, but it is difficult when one is overseas and these comments are thrown at one.
Part of the reason why these comments can be thrown at us is that we appear to have closed ranks on this issue. We are not open to deliberation or scrutiny. This was brought further to the fore last week when this chamber rejected a proposition that the CERD ought to be invited to come to Australia to see for itself just what the situation is here.
I was not here to take part in that vote, but what have we got to hide? After listening to Senator Harradine's impassioned speech, it would appear that we have got nothing to hide. If we have got nothing to hide, why are we hiding? Why are we going to reject this reference to a Senate committee for further scrutiny? I think that is probably what is going to happen in a very short time. Why are we doing that? I am baffled that the Senate of Australia should seek to do so, if indeed we are going to follow that course of action shortly.
If we do have something to hide, let's hide it, but if we have nothing to hide, let's open it up and refer this matter to a Senate committee. Let's invite all participants to put their views forward. Let's even go to the extent of inviting CERD to appear before the committee and see what views can be gleaned from them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-04-29,"—I want to place on record the government's position on this. Senator Bolkus does not refer to CERD in his motion. He is referring to issues that have been dealt with at length by committees of this parliament.
These matters, as Senator Harradine has said, have been dealt with at incredible 
 length. In fact, one of the debates was the longest debate on a single piece of legislation in Australian history. The debate on the two 1997 native title bills totalled 105 hours and 56 minutes. These matters were considered in detail and, as Senator Margetts said in her contribution, at length by the committees that looked into these bills just over a year ago. They were before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title for 53 days and 39 days in two different references. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looked at these issues for a period of 39 days in 1997 and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title spent 53 days considering the legislation and these legal and constitutional issues. So, during the first term of the Howard government there were in excess of 90 days in committee.
I noted in some of the press over the last weekend that the government copped some flak for referring the so-called online bill. There was some disquiet because that bill, which is a relatively minor bill compared to a native title bill, was going to be referred to a committee for nine effective working days. I read a story in the West Australian at the weekend to that effect.
It makes me laugh when I saw what happened in 1993 under the previous government on a piece of legislation as large, as complex, as overarching and as far-reaching as the Native Title Bill to now hear the Australian Labor Party saying that we need to refer just about everything off to a committee. In fact, more bills have been referred to more committees for longer in the last three years than in the history of Australia. For how long did Senator Bolkus and his mob want their Native Title Bill referred to a committee in 1993? How many days was that off at a committee? Seven working days. This is incredible, breathtaking hypocrisy from the mob opposite when it comes to committee references. These matters have spent in excess of 90 days in committee in the recent sittings of the parliament. That is the Labor Party's solution to native title. Senator Harradine has said to them, `Put your cards on the table. Come up with a policy.'
Probably very few people in Kalgoorlie, for example, read the Guardian Weekly. Most of them read the Kalgoorlie Miner. It might do Senator Bolkus good to read a paper like the Kalgoorlie Miner and see what the Australian Labor Party's equivocation on the native title issue is doing to the economy of a place like Kalgoorlie. I suggest to Senator Bolkus that he gets a subscription to the Kalgoorlie Miner and reads that, and puts his love and passion for a journal such as the Guardian Weekly to one side for a time.
Senator Harradine has challenged the Labor Party to put their amendments on the table, to say what they will do when they get back into power. That is what the people of Western Australia and, as Senator Harradine has said, Aboriginal people and other Australians would like. All we have got out of the Labor Party so far is, `We'll have a little powwow.' Mr Beazley's election policy was, `We'll have a meeting after the election and try to solve it.' That is not good enough for an opposition that purport to want to be a government at some stage in the next millennium. They should put their policies on the table. We are sick of their reliance on United Nations committees to run Australia. We think the Australian government, with the consent of the Australia parliament, should do that. This parliament has considered these matters at great length and, much to the ALP's chagrin, passed these laws. There has been a due process, a proper parliamentary process, and the law has passed through, as Senator Harradine has said, a gruelling process. The government will be opposing this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-29,"—Pursuant to standing order 191, I claim to have been misunderstood by Senator McKiernan.
—You may make an explanation under that standing order, Senator Harradine.
—Senator McKiernan suggested I was reflecting in some way on a very fine public servant, Mr Robert Orr, who represented Australia in CERD. If Senator McKiernan had seen the material that was prepared and presented to CERD by Mr 
 Orr, he would not have suggested that that indicated any sign of incompetence; quite the reverse. I have the utmost respect for Mr Orr's competence and his ability to represent Australia. What I was saying was simply that, in the CERD committee's report, there is not even a reference to some of the major points made by Australia at that meeting.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—In response, can I put a few things on the record but also say a few things to Senator Harradine. Senator Campbell's response was predictable. There was no attempt to justify the government's position. It was basically an attack on anyone but the government, and once again an attack on the international mechanisms. We are becoming used to that from the government, but it is an issue that should be of concern to all of us and I know would be an issue of concern to Senator Harradine.
To Senator Harradine I say that I found his contribution enormously disappointing. I know we do not have a lunchbreak between this debate and the vote, but I would like him to listen to a few things I want to say because I do think his contribution was based on a number of inaccuracies. I am concerned that, by taking the position that Senator Harradine has taken, we are essentially taking a closed door approach to external scrutiny. If you are concerned about how the committee assessed Australia, then let us not be unfair to that UN committee. They want to come to Australia, but the government will not let them. If we set up a mechanism like the one I am proposing, then there is an opportunity for some of the questions and concerns that you have raised to be addressed. It does not do us any service to be cutting off this debate when the rest of the world is having it. To have an opportunity here to visit some of these issues is important.
We are talking of a UN instrument that has been one of the benchmarks in Senator Harradine's attitude to public life and his votes in the Senate—the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. We do not do any service to that convention by saying, `The committee charged with implementing and overseeing it 
 has made a decision, but we in Australia will close our doors, the doors of the Senate and the government, to the views of that committee, and we hope the issue will go away.' As I said before, Senator Harradine, this issue will not go away. I think we are being unfair and not doing a service to either the convention or the committee by not at least allowing some degree of scrutiny.
Senator Harradine made a great point of saying that the committee had ignored what Australia said. The committee may have rejected what Australia said, but I do not think the transcript shows that the committee ignored what Australia said. The committee may not have noted what Australia said in its final decision, but if you look at the transcript of the committee's deliberations—the meeting of the committee where they heard the report from Ms McDougall, the country rapporteur—you will find 8½ pages of questions formulated by the rapporteur and put to Australia. They were questions which were part of the debate in this place before the election; questions which have been raised this morning.
As I said, there were 8½ pages of questions with respect to Australia's position on the bill, on the ATSIC Social Justice Commissioner and also on the issue of special measure. I will turn to the special measure issue later. There was even acknowledgment by the Attorney-General on a number of occasions that the committee had engaged Australia in a meaningful way. On 16 March he said that the committee welcomed Australia's detailed reply to its request for information. He said:
The Government has informed the Committee of the extensive process of consultation and public debate . . . 
He reflected a similar engagement with the committee in a previous press statement in the first week in March.
—Nothing was said by CERD about the consultation—nothing.
—Let me get to that. There was constructive engagement—and that was recognised by the Attorney—to the effect that Robert Orr travelled all the way from Canberra to discuss the government's response. That was recognised by the rapporteur 
 in the minutes of the meeting of the committee, which are available to all of us. Appreciation was expressed by the rapporteur `for the assistance and cooperation that I received from the Australian Attorney-General', before formulating 8½ pages of questions to be put to Australia—questions which were answered. There is recognition of engagement by Australia through the Attorney-General and recognition of engagement by the rapporteur.
—Not in the report.
—The problem which the government had, Senator Harradine, when you say `not in the report', was that they went there and tried to mislead. I note you are shaking your head. The evidence of that is the finding of the committee that Australia breached the convention in respect of four grounds. Paragraph No. 7 reads:
The Committee notes, in particular, four specific provisions that discriminate against indigenous title-holders under the newly amended Act. These include: the Act's ""validation"" provisions; the ""confirmation of extinguishment"" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions—
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—I will get to that. Paragraph No. 7 continues:
. . . and restrictions concerning the rights of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.
Do you know what problem the government has got in that regard? It has got one fundamental problem.
—You voted for the validation.
—Do you know what problem you have, Senator Harradine, in this regard? Unfortunately for the officer involved—
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—Order!
—He is getting worked up this morning.
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—Are you quite finished?
—Yes.
—Order!
—The problem that you have, Senator Harradine, and the problem that Mr Orr had was that document which reflected the advice which the Australian government had been getting on this bill in the lead-up to the debate, during the debate and after the debate—not just from within government circles, not just from the Australian Government Solicitor, but also from external advice that it sought.
When you go to the question time brief prepared by contact officer Robert Orr of the Wik task force on 17 November 1997, you find that three out of the four issues of concern to CERD are reflected in that advice. I will read what Mr Orr said:
Advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor on whether the 10-point plan was consistent with the RDA and if not, would any of its proposals cause the RDA to be invalid as no longer supported by the constitutional external affairs power.
The RDA is important here because it incorporates the international covenant into Australian law. Mr Orr continued:
In summary, Chief General Counsel Henry Burmester advised on 25 July 1997 that he is of the view that in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the RDA or with CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime (especially the provision for `permanent extinguishment' if this is found not to be the common law position), and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of co-existing native title rights.
It does not mention the right to negotiate, which we must recognise was your mechanism in the bill. That is not recognised as a problem with CERD, although CERD found that it might have been. With regard to the three primary points that CERD was concerned about, the Australian government had its own legal advisers telling them that they would breach the RDA and CERD. Mr D.F. Jackson QC also gave the government advice, on 3 February 1997, that—and I quote:
. . . legislative wholesale extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases by either the states/territories or the Commonwealth, even with 
 `just terms' compensation, would be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act (consistent with previous advice by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General's Department).
This government were quite aware, from the most eminent advice available to them, that they were breaching that convention. They went to CERD and said, as the Attorney-General said, that the government's view was that they had not breached the convention.
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—They tried to mislead. That is where they got caught out. That is what you cannot overcome in this debate, Senator Harradine.
—But it must be read according to the RDA. Don't you understand that?
—That is the next point I was going to make. The committee then went on to discuss special measures, read in accordance with the RDA. It said that the mechanisms for reading it in accordance with the RDA were the mechanisms adopted by the Labor government in the 1993 legislation, and that was to use the mechanism of special measures. The committee said, in respect of the 1993 act, that the act was consistent with the RDA; that it was consistent with CERD. It said:
It delicately balanced the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title-holders. The amended act, however, appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title-holders.
They recognised that the first act was consistent with the special measure mechanism in the convention, but they also made it very clear that the amended act was not; it very clearly was not. That is another instance where they took into account the evidence presented to them by the Australian delegation—evidence which, as I say, the Attorney-General was quite keen to reflect as constructive engagement with this committee.
You then say to me, `What about Labor's position?' Labor's position in 1993 was consistent with the RDA. Labor's position in 1997-98 was also a total wholesale alternative to what the government put up, and you know that full well. You know that, in putting up 
 that alternative, we were quite conscious of trying once again to get the balance right in order to avail ourselves of the mechanisms of CERD and the special measure mechanism. Although some elements of that alternative policy were obviously negative in terms of the impact on indigenous Australians, it was recognised by indigenous Australians as a special measure which could comply with the act. We know that as well. So it is chalk and cheese in terms of what this government has put up and our alternative at the time.
You ask what we will do in the future. There are already court cases on this legislation, but our attempt in the future will be to make a workable prescription. If you want workable prescriptions, you do not go to Kalgoorlie now because, despite what Senator Ian Campbell says, there are real concerns on the ground there with this government's legislation. The government rejected our alternative to fix up the Kalgoorlie problem. Our approach would be both workable and consistent with the RDA in a manner which we have shown can be done.
—Give us the details, please.
—Senator Harradine, we always wait for details from you—we have to wait to the death to get them. In this particular instance, you would say to us that we should wait for the court deliberations and decisions, and that is what we will do. But we gave you the prescription on what to do and how to do it during the last debate. I think you fully understood at the time what we were trying to do and how we were also driven by a need not just for workability but also for consistency with our international obligations. They will be the benchmarks for the future as well.
I am also concerned about the way you have treated this particular UN committee. I am not so sure that you wanted to sound disparaging about them, and I did say that maybe some inaccuracies have driven you in this.
—You stand up for them; you protect them.
—Well, you will not; the Attorney-General will not. I remind you, Senator Campbell, and Senator Harradine, that it was a committee of the United Nations that actually put together the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and we were at the forefront of that. They were the days when Australia used to engage constructively with the United Nations. They were the days when benchmark international mechanisms like this were developed. I would hazard a bet that, if we were now in the process of trying to develop a convention on the elimination of race discrimination, there would be one vacant spot at the table and that would be Australia's spot. This Prime Minister would not be party to such international human rights agenda setting. He would basically see it as political correctness. Senator Harradine, UN committees have jobs to do and they have done them extremely well. I put to you that you may have been a bit unfair with respect to this committee.
I will end on this particular point. Senator Harradine has raised concerns about Labor's position and about the committee's operation. I would like to be in a position to ask representatives of the Attorney-General: what did the Attorney-General mean in his press statements when he reflected the fact that Australia had a constructive engagement with the UN committee? We would like to get to that. We would then like to work out why, after the decision came out, he decided to shoot the messenger. We would like to find out what led to a change of legal position between that legal advice, the question time brief prepared by Mr Robert Orr on 17 November 1997 and the position put to CERD. There are directly fundamental inconsistencies and it is important for us to find out why the government had a change of view and why Mr Orr had a change of view. Did the Australian Government Solicitor have a change of view? Did they receive more advice through external briefings of QCs to see whether there was another point of view?
If you ain't got nothing to hide on this, then you set up a committee. Not only that, but there is an obligation on us, Senator 
 Harradine, to ensure that whatever dirty linen might be hanging out concerning this issue is revealed. You say you have advice from someone close to Aboriginal communities that reopening this may cause problems in outlying areas. Those problems will always be there unless we in this place are prepared to take an honest approach.
You will always have problems in this society given the diversity of it, not just problems with indigenous Australians but, from the migration intake that we have had, you will always have problems if one part of this community feels it has been discriminated against on the basis of race. You know that, Senator Harradine, because for all of your public life in this place one of your fundamental benchmarks has been the UN convention. We have respected you for that. As immigration minister I had to cop the heat of it, but at all times I respected what was driving you. In this particular instance, you would be letting down that convention, the international mechanism to enforce it and also what well-meaning people in this society want to do if you reject the opportunity for us to scrutinise the government's actions.
	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Senator Bolkus's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I move:
That the following matters be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in August 1999:
Whether the Native Title Act 1993 , as amended, is consistent with:
(a)	 Australia's international legal obligations, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and
(b)	 the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 , and the principles underlying it.
Madam President, this is an important issue and one that should be of concern to the Senate. What we are talking about here goes not just to legislation passed by this place—legislation of domestic impact—but also to this country's international reputation. Also its ramifications go to the fabric of our society. It goes to the issue of the Prime Minister's much heralded 10-point plan of legislation which was debated in the Senate less than a 
 year ago, and it goes to what the rest of the world sees as the impact of that legislation.
The 10-point plan was legislation that was widely condemned at the time of its introduction because it was basically legislation that overrode the views, wishes and interests of indigenous Australians. It was widely condemned at home because it was unfair and, we believe, discriminatory.
Those who argued very strongly against that legislation—indigenous Australians—felt that they had found no justice at home, so what they did was to seek justice abroad. This is not the first time it has happened, but it has to be of concern to all of us that this is part of an increasing trend. It is an increasing trend because many Australians now do not find a degree of fairness, fair go or justice from their national government. As a consequence, they are pursuing their rights and interests in the international forum.
Those who think that this debate is over, that the issue will be put to bed this morning if it does not get up, and that it will go away, should realise that they have something else coming to them. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has already indicated that Australia is on notice that it will maintain a watching brief in respect to our response to their decision and our response to the needs of indigenous Australians.
The government may have told them not to come to Australia; the government may have told them that our doors are closed to international concern; and the government may have told them that it would not welcome a visit. But I think it is fair to say that they will maintain an interest and keep on maintaining that interest as part of a growing body of international organisations that have concerns in respect of how Australia is performing, not just on indigenous matters, but also—as we know from debates in recent weeks—in respect of broader matters of cultural and environmental concern.
Once again we have hit the international headlines in a matter that is no good for our international reputation and in fact tarnishes that international reputation. This time it was the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
 Discrimination in its 54th session between 1 and 19 March that considered Australia's Native Title Act. Acting under its early warning procedures, the committee adopted a decision in respect to Australia, requesting information from Australia regarding three areas of concern: the proposed changes to the 1993 Native Title Act; changes of policy in respect to Aboriginal land rights; and changes in the position or functions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. They were the matters that the committee embarked upon overviewing on 11 August 1998.
The committee in its deliberations welcomed the full and thorough reply of the Australian government. The Attorney-General himself in press statement after press statement indicated that he thought Australia was getting fair treatment and had an opportunity to put its case comprehensively to the committee.
It is also important to place on record that the committee received similarly detailed and useful comments from the Acting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. They got advice from ATSIC and there was advice from members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The committee undertook a broad assessment of Australia's practices in this area. They indicated their concern that:
. . . the effects of Australia's racially discriminatory land practices have endured as an acute impairment of the rights of Australia's indigenous communities.
That is the historical fact that they recognise in their decision. They also went on to recognise the importance of the Mabo decision. Mabo was a decision that ensured, for the first time, a rejection of the concept of terra nullius and an acceptance of the survival of indigenous title to land where such title had previously not been recognised. The committee also welcomed that the Native Title Act 1993 provided a framework for the continued recognition of indigenous land rights following the precedent established in the Mabo case. 
The committee then went on to look at the 1993 act and compare it, most importantly, to the 1998 act. Having considered the amendments moved by the government to the 1993 act, they expressed concern over the compatibility of the government's amendments with the state party's—Australia's—international obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. They said:
While the original Native Title Act recognizes and seeks to protect indigenous title, provisions that extinguish or impair the exercise of indigenous title rights and interests pervade the amended Act.
The committee went on to say:
While the original 1993 Native Title Act was delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders, the amended Act appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title.
It comes as no surprise to those who took part in the debate in this place and those who followed it that there were four areas of major concern that the committee had in respect of the government's 10-point plan. There were four areas where the committee felt that the government's legislation acted in a racially discriminatory manner against indigenous Australians, and the committee listed them:
These include: the Act's ""validation"" provisions; the ""confirmation of extinguishment"" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions; and restrictions concerning the right of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.
These were the four areas that attracted most attention in this place during the course of that long debate. The committee, as did the previous government in 1993, recognised that there can be wind-back, but there is a capacity for the use of a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act and under the international convention which can accommodate a degree of negativeness if the overall package passed by the parliament can be seen to be positive. The committee said, of the four measures that they were concerned about:
. . . appears to wind back the protections of indigenous title offered in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia and the 1993 Native Title Act. As such, the amended Act cannot be considered to be a special measure within the meaning 
 of Articles 1(4) and 2(2) of the Convention and raises concerns about—
Australia's compliance with articles 2 and 5 of the convention.
The committee was concerned about another aspect that we were also concerned about during the course of the debate. The committee found that there was a lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments. They were concerned with respect to the Howard government's compliance with its obligations under article 5(c) of the convention. That article and the committee's general recommendations have stressed the importance of ensuring `that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life'—not just cursory or token participation, but effective participation in public life. An important principle that they hold, which is reflected in the convention, is that no decisions directly relating to indigenous people's rights and interests should be taken without their informed consent.
Concern after concern is expressed by this international eminent committee on the elimination of race discrimination—concerns that in many respects reflect the concerns that indigenous Australians had during the passage of the Howard Wik 10-point plan.
The committee had further concerns about the broader agenda in respect of indigenous Australians which Australia has embarked upon under the Howard government. They were concerned that Australia had proposed to change the overall structure of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, abolishing the position of ATSI Social Justice Commissioner and assigning those functions to a generalist deputy president. They felt there was a need for a qualified specialist to address matters affecting indigenous Australians given the continuing political, economic and social marginalisation of the indigenous community in Australia.
Having made all these findings, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on Australia to take certain action. They also indicated—and this is 
 probably the most telling of their recommendations:
In light of the urgency and fundamental importance of these matters, and taking into account the willingness expressed by—
Australia—
to continue the dialogue with the Committee over these provisions, the Committee decides to keep this matter on its agenda under its early warning and urgent action procedures to be reviewed again at its fifty-fifth session.
So there you have it—fundamentally important findings of discrimination against Australia which this committee says they will keep on their early warning system and keep a watching brief over. So the government has been put on notice, but the government, we know, will not react. The government's basic attitude to these sorts of matters is to take the view of the Prime Minister that the rest of the world is only there to play cricket against and `we won't take them into account when it comes to their views of how we perform'. But this is a short-sighted policy, a policy that basically limits Australia's role, and capacity to play a role, in international affairs.
—Indonesia doesn't even have a cricket team, you dope.
—Senator Campbell, you talk about Indonesia not having a cricket team. Unfortunately, even in respect of Indonesia, the Australian government had to be dragged into implementing an action plan which was recommended by the shadow foreign minister just a few months ago.
—Are you talking about Gough Whitlam?
—You could see what was going to happen in Indonesia. You had advice as to what was going to happen. Indonesian lives were endangered; Australian lives were endangered. That was part of the advice given to your cabinet, but it took a long time for Alexander to get out of bed on that one, and it took longer for the Prime Minister to trail behind him.
Unfortunately for the interests of Australia worldwide at the moment, under this Prime Minister, we do not recognise that we have a role to play which, in a sense, is above our size in the world. That is affecting us here. 
 Time after time, whether it is by the ILO, this committee or the World Heritage Committee, we are getting a reflection not just against the Howard government but against this nation. If we have got any respect for the role and the status of this nation in world affairs, and if John Howard, the Prime Minister, and Daryl Williams, the Attorney-General, are not going to take action, are not going to respond, are not going to treat people with civility, it is important for this parliament to stand up for the reputation of Australia. Senator Campbell, you may not care about it, but I tell you what: if you are doing business, if you are interacting with the rest of the world, then you are concerned about Australia's status and the respect which the rest of the world may or may not show us from time to time.
What did the government do? They got this broad, condemnatory decision from the committee. It was a decision which should not have been of surprise to them, either. It was a decision which was in accordance with advice given to the government during the debate. Robert Orr, of the Wik task force, on 17 November 1997 produced an advice to government. In that private advice to government—and it is worth putting all of this on the record—he said, by way of a question time brief:
On 3 February 1997, the Commonwealth received advice from Mr D F Jackson QC that legislative wholesale extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases by either the states/territories or the Commonwealth, even with `just terms' compensation, would be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act (consistent with previous advice by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General's Department).
So the government's own external advice was basically being confirmed by the committee. But let us go on. Contact officer Robert Orr continued his brief by saying:
Advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor on whether the 10-point plan was consistent with the RDA—
let us keep in mind that the Racial Discrimination Act incorporates the international covenant into Australian law—
and if not, would any of its proposals cause the RDA to be invalid as no longer supported by the constitutional external affairs power. In summary, 
 Chief General Counsel Henry Burmester advised on 25 July 1997—
that is almost two years ago—
that he is of the view that in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the RDA or with CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime (especially the provision for `permanent extinguishment' if this is found not to be the common law provision), and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of co-existing native title rights.
So this international committee, charged with oversighting compliance with the international covenant on the elimination of racial discrimination, is saying what the government's own Chief General Counsel has said to this government, and also saying what the external advice said to the government. These are just two avenues of internal advice to the government. The broader advice presented to the Senate committee inquiring into this matter also confirmed that.
Although the Attorney-General, on 11 March this year, said that the government took its international obligations seriously and was keen to assist the UN committee, on 16 March he said that Australia welcomed the chance to present a detailed case to the committee and had informed the committee of an extensive process of consultation. The Attorney-General began the big lie in that press statement. On the second page he said:
The Australian Government's view, as advised to the Committee, is that the Government has not breached the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
He told the Australian public that the view of the government was that there was no breach of the convention, when the advice to the government from its most eminent legal sources was that the government had breached the convention. What did he do after the decision from CERD? What was the government's response then? That is reflected once again in a press statement from the Attorney-General. He said:
The Committee's comments are an insult to Australia and all Australians as they are unbalanced and do not refer to the submission made by Australia on the native title issue. 

He is shooting the international messenger who has told him internationally what he knows and has known domestically for quite some time—that we have been, and we are, in breach of the international covenant.
So the government says the committee's comments are unbalanced; it shoots the messenger and tries to reflect on the reputation and capacity of the international forum which takes a very dark view of what we have done on this matter. The Attorney-General went on to say:
The Government's view, as advised to the Committee, is that Australia has not breached the Convention . . . 
The advice to the government from its most senior legal advisers was that we had breached the convention. That is the second lie. He went on by giving the normal, gratuitous flicks around the ears that we are used to from this government to committees like this and to the World Heritage Committee. He said:
The comments by the committee are unbalanced and fail to understand Australia's system of democracy.
Is he saying that Chief General Counsel Burmester failed to understand Australia's system of democracy? Is he saying that Mr Jackson QC failed to understand it? Is he saying that they are unbalanced? If that is the case, they ought to be removed from their offices of privilege in advising the government. He does not say that of those people who have given the government the same advice, but he does say that in regard to the international committee. Basically, that means that the government is not taking serious action here. The rest of the world has a continuing interest. The Guardian Weekly , just a few weeks ago, said `Washed away in a tide of white history'—one expression of international concern about how we are handling this matter at home.
In closing the debate, let us put on record that the government is not taking this seriously and we should. Let us also put on record that there is a degree of resonance between the response which Mr Howard has given and the response, for instance, taken by Mr Smith in Africa quite a few years ago. The Prime 
 Minister says, `Our official view is that Australian laws are made by Australian parliaments elected by the Australian people, not by a UN committee.' Haven't we heard that before? Haven't we heard that from an international regime that rejects international scrutiny of its domestic practices, especially when those practices are so offensive to the basic law of humanity that has been not just accepted by Australia but sponsored by Australia? The UN convention was one of those conventions that we were in the forefront of implementing internationally, but our position now basically is, `We can do at home whatever we want and the rest of the world can go jump.' In the long-term interests of Australia, we cannot afford that to be the view emanating from this parliament. It may be the view which the Prime Minister is happy with, but we should not be.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-04-29,"—I support the motion of Senator Bolkus and indicate the support of the Australian Democrats for it. In doing so, I will not repeat all of the issues raised by Senator Bolkus—he covered the issue very well—but there are a couple of things I want to add to the debate. The first thing I want to say is that we should congratulate those indigenous leaders who presented the case before the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for their persistence, for their obvious intelligence and for the very comprehensive way in which they detailed the case. This country owes a lot to indigenous leaders who no longer—as I think was once inferred in the minds of many people in this country—need the help of white Australians in presenting these kinds of cases.
Certainly in this case and in many others they are more than capable of presenting a case on their own behalf and, in this instance, not only did so on the issue which they were supporting but also did so against the very best bureaucratic advice that this government could mount on the other side. It sent its most senior bureaucrat, the person who in fact designed the native title amendment laws. He was unable, over and against the arguments put by the indigenous leaders, to convince the 
 CERD committee of the government's position. That is very significant and those indigenous leaders who presented the case need our congratulations and our support. Obviously they were able to convince an international forum in the face of the very best bureaucratic ability that the government could mount.
I would also like to indicate that individually Senator Reynolds, Mr Melham and I invited by letter—not necessarily representing our parties, but as individuals—the CERD committee to visit Australia. We are not yet sure of the status of that visit, whether or not it will happen, because once again the government does not want scrutiny of its actions or of its legislative program. I do hope that the committee will visit Australia because, even if the government believes that it is right in this particular issue, this would present the government with an opportunity to argue its case, to show how the CERD committee has got it wrong, as the government asserts. The best way to resolve that would be to have the CERD committee visit Australia and to hear both sides of the debate on the ground, face to face. I would be very surprised if the government opposes this visit because it would give the government an opportunity to present its case and would give an opportunity not only to the international forum to observe but also to all Australians to make a judgment about the arguments on both sides.
I am in a way ashamed that the CERD committee found that Australia was guilty of discrimination, but not surprised. I have firmly believed all along, right from the beginning of the publishing of the 10-point plan by the Prime Minister, that that 10-point plan would work to the significant disadvantage of indigenous people. I believe that to be absolutely right, and this has now been confirmed by this international forum. The Native Title Amendment Bill, as amended and then passed by the Senate and by the House of Representatives, is undoubtedly discriminatory. I am convinced of that. I believe that, eventually, if it comes before the High Court of Australia, it will be found to be discriminatory, as has been found in this international forum. 
I am bemused by the way in which this government argues that some international forums should not be listened to when at the same time other international forums are not only listened to but slavishly followed to the detriment of many Australians. Of course I refer to the World Trade Organisation, before whom we grovel to the great detriment of many of the primary industries of this country. We are prepared to grovel before that international forum when it is to do with trade issues, but when it comes to human rights issues we take no notice of international forums or of their criticisms of this country.
We support the motion to refer this matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I trust that it will pass, because this is another opportunity for the whole issue to be considered. It is very important that we, in the Senate and in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, look carefully at what has been said by the CERD committee and that we revisit this issue. If we do not, it will continue to attract international criticism for as long as we allow it to be a blot on this country's previous good reputation in the area of human rights.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-29,"—I too rise in support of the motion moved by Senator Bolkus to refer the Native Title Act 1993, as amended in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry. I do that because, having taken considerable interest in the bill when it was debated and in the process leading up to that, I realised that a great many questions were left unanswered. One of the most instructive elements of the committee process leading up to us dealing with the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 was the fora to which some of the best silks in the country came and discussed the constitutionality. That was very stimulating. It was probably almost unprecedented to have that kind of fora dealing with a particular issue of a bill. Here we have brought up another element of the same bill—that is, whether the bill abides by Australia's international commitments.
Senator Woodley is quite right when he says that the current Australian government 
 picks and chooses which international fora it abides by. When the World Trade Organisation, or perhaps even the World Bank, says, `Jump', the Australian government says, `How high?' I guess that jumping high has come from the previous government as well, in that we not only did what we were required to do under the Uruguay Round of GATT but we went beyond that, many believe naively, on the assumption that we would benefit. That has meant considerable change in and interference with Australia's domestic laws.
We have seen the introduction of national competition policy before many other countries have gone that way. We are now only just beginning to look at that. We have never in this country looked at the impact of Australia signing the Uruguay Round of GATT. We have never done that as a Senate inquiry, much to my sadness. Here we have a situation where an international body, having looked at Australia's laws in relation to the Native Title Act, have said, `In our opinion, this does not abide by Australia's international commitments.'
Unfortunately, what I saw many times during the debate was throwaway lines and debating points in relation to human rights. I recall a number of comments about racial discrimination and whether the process of not allowing consultation or the right to negotiate on land was racially discriminatory. In the debate the government frequently used an argument which assumed terra nullius—that is, that the country was empty—and that Aboriginal people had to abide by the rules of leaseholders or other people who did not own the land. So we had a situation where the throwaway debating points in relation to whether the bill itself was racially discriminatory had an in-built assumption of terra nullius—the very assumption that the High Court had thrown away in saying that the country was not empty when white settlers came. This is pretty basic; it is not about throwaway lines or debating points or things that you say on a broadcast day. It is about whether in legal terms, under Australia's laws and Australia's Constitution, we are doing something in a bill which is against Australia's international obligations.
The government has almost run out of international fora to abuse in recent times. We have seen issues relating to immigration, refugees, the treatment of Australia's indigenous population, the environment and uranium mining—they are almost running out of international fora to abuse. We are getting comments from other legislatures, including in Europe, Japan and the United States. Quite frankly, I think people going overseas these days would have to wear a paper bag over their head in many different fora.
I am also hearing things from business people. I shared a plane with a business person—a conservative business person—who was operating a great deal in London, who said that it is getting very difficult to do business in Europe and even in Britain because of Australia's international reputation. This government seems to be mostly interested in business so they should at least be interested in the fact that we are dirtying our reputation to such an extent that people do not even want to do business with us.
We should make sure that as a parliament we look into the elements of this bill and that the committee has a chance to report. We should once again invite some of the best legal minds in the country—they are usually willing to come to these interesting and historic debates to find out what the issues really are. We do not just want debating points or throwaway lines. We want to find out what the weight of opinion says so that we can best deal with this issue in the future. Quite clearly, the Greens (WA) support this motion. I would like to think the government is prepared to look at it as well. Either way, I hope this motion gets majority support in the parliament.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I rise today to support my colleague's motion in relation to the Native Title Act and the decision of the United Nations committee. I think we have to be mindful when we sit in chambers such as this that laws that we pass are not always perfect and do not always encompass the intent or the purpose. They are there for scrutiny and, if we ever believe for one minute that we pass laws that are to stay there in concrete, then 
 we are doing a disservice to the people we serve. Those laws are there to be tested and to be tried in courts. In a way I believe that the United Nations is another form of this process of checks and balances in which our laws can be put up and examined.
All Australians should be particularly concerned about this decision. We are in an era of reconciliation. We are in an era when we are trying to teach our children and when we encourage the idea, even amongst our own peers, that discrimination is not a good thing, that it is something you do not do, that it is something you should be embarrassed to do. We now have, on a broader scale, an international body which is closely watching and monitoring laws of other countries but more so Australia in the last three years. It has come up with a decision that we now should take note of. We should be forging the way here and setting an example for the rest of the world to follow. It seems that we have gone mightily backwards in the last three years when a United Nations committee has made a decision that the Native Title Act is in breach of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
This convention was actually signed in 1966 under a Holt Liberal government. It was ratified in 1975. So this convention has actually been looked at by governments of Australia twice. We have signed up and then ratified the convention—over a long period of years now. I am going back 23 years, so it is something that we have been committed to for quite a while. The committee has decided on and issued an unambiguous statement, I think, that this government is committing racial discrimination. They say that we are in breach of articles 2 and 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
Aboriginal people in this country have welcomed a decision and statement by an international body, the United Nations committee. They have been pressing this government for many years to try to make some positive moves towards consulting with them, to listening to them, to sitting down and trying to understand where they want to go. 
 But they have to look to an international forum to get the recognition they want. On the very day that the United Nations committee handed down this decision, ATSIC put out a press release saying that indigenous people of Australia welcome the CERD findings. In my own electorate of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal people are talking about this—such as occurred two weeks ago in Broome and Kununurra. They are not excited about it, they are not happy that they have had to go outside this country to try to find the kind of recognition and realisation that what is happening to them is not right. But they are pleased that somebody is taking notice.
This government is not pleased that somebody is taking notice. In fact, this government is embarrassed. This government does not want to know about the United Nations decisions. Last year we saw this government push through the laws for the Native Title Act. As Senator Margetts said, we had discussions about whether this act would be discriminatory. We had comments about it. The comments were either fobbed off or we were reassured that the act was not discriminatory.
A couple of weeks ago, the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA, in their submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund, said that they had reservations about the processes that this parliament undertakes. They were specifically talking about the operation of this joint parliamentary committee. In their submission they made a reference to the United Nations CERD decision. In particular, they wanted to emphasise recommendation XIII which stressed the importance of ensuring `that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent'.
They raised that in the context of the joint parliamentary committee, because they are saying that the committee is only being seen to happen; it takes submissions from Aboriginal people, from pastoralists and companies but it really does not change the substance of the act or the position of this 
 government. So it is almost like a token consultation. So they looked to the United Nations for confirmation of this and they got it. They got the United Nations saying, `That is right. We believe that the actions of this government do not take notice of your effective participation and do not bother to get your consent when forming their laws.'
So let us have a look at why people—and particularly Aboriginal people—believe that the legislation is in breach of the international convention. It does not protect the land ownership of Aboriginal people. It is clearly the instrument which increases the legal ownership rights over land held by non-Aboriginal parties such as pastoralists. It increases the other land ownership rights, to the corresponding detriment of the Aboriginal peoples. And in all instances where invalid titles occur through duplication of ownership, it prefers the interests in land of non-Aboriginal people over the interests of Aboriginal people. It manifestly interferes with Aboriginal landowners' rights to negotiate their interests over their land and it does not have the informed consent of Aboriginal peoples.
I am calling on this government to take urgent action to redress this situation and to give close scrutiny to whether or not this legislation is racially discriminatory. I do not see that there is a problem with that. As I said earlier, we do make laws, and laws are not always perfect. Perhaps it is time to actually sit back and say, `Well, let's have a look at this. We have had Aboriginal people who are not happy with it. We now have a decision of the United Nations.' I think the government are paying a high price for this folly; a very high price for their blindness and their unwillingness to say, `Perhaps there is a problem here.' The price is, of course, their international reputation. As I said, they signed up and ratified this convention twice, and they have now broken their word.
Since the decision of the United Nations committee has come down, this government has sought to question the legitimacy of the United Nations committee's decision. Coming from the Northern Territory, I would have to say it is shades of Kakadu and Jabiluka here. 
 If the decision does not actually fall over the line for us, we turn around and say, `You people really aren't experts after all and perhaps you don't really know what you are talking about.' Unlike Jabiluka, where the excuse was that they are not really scientists and they do not know what they are doing, in this case the excuse is, `You don't understand how Australian law operates.' This committee does understand what racial discrimination is, it does understand about the needs of indigenous people and it certainly understands what it means to actually talk to, listen to and consult with these people and have their consent.
As Senator Bolkus mentioned earlier, the government's own Chief General Counsel, Henry Burmester, advised this government on 25 July 1997. He said:
. . . in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the Racial Discrimination Act or CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime . . . and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of coexisting native title rights.
In supporting this recommendation Australians, and particularly indigenous Australians, are now entitled to know whether this government has enacted a law which has subsequently been found to be discriminatory or whether they blatantly knew all along that it was discriminatory and they did so knowing this. I think we all have a right to know the answer to that. The fundamental moral obligation of all Australian governments is not to discriminate on the basis of race. This Native Title Act has been found to be racially discriminatory by the United Nations, and it may well be confirmed to be so by this Senate inquiry. I call on the government to change its law and to make sure that it complies with both our international and our moral obligations.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Reynolds, Sen Margaret",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I want to support this motion by Senator Bolkus. I believe it is appropriate for the Legal and Constitutional References Committee of the Senate to look very closely at the UN decision and to report back to the Senate. I was disappointed last week when what I considered to be a relatively mild 
 motion was defeated in this place. In that motion I asked that the Senate express its grave concern about the CERD report. The Senate did not agree with that. Yet, as other speakers have said, how can the Senate not be concerned that the international law making body, the United Nations, has found that there are questions to answer about whether or not we are upholding the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination? We should be concerned, and that is all the first part of my original motion was saying.
Secondly, if we are concerned, we should have been prepared to deal with this issue. This issue has not come before the Senate on the initiative of the government. It has not come before the House of Representatives on the initiative of the government. It has been brought up only by opposition members in this place. I think the government should demonstrate that it has some concern and some plan as to how it is going to respond. Thirdly, I ask the government to reopen discussions with representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. That is not a very radical proposition, I would have thought. Sooner or later someone is going to have to talk and someone is going to have to resolve this concern. The government cannot hide from it.
Finally, the Senate could have invited the United Nations committee to visit Australia and look at the issues first-hand. The government apparently is not going to invite the committee. The committee no doubt will not come in a formal sense if the government has not invited it, but there is no doubt that the committee members will visit in their own right and will talk with Aboriginal people, will talk with all those many hundreds of people who contacted them in the months leading to their deliberations. The chair of the committee said in his comments after the hearing that the expressions of concern and the numbers of submissions received from Australia and from ordinary Australians were unprecedented, and still the government refuses to take this matter seriously.
What will happen in the processes if we do not make a response between now and 
 August? That will be reported to the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in a session later this year, some time in November or December. Is that what we want? Is that what our diplomats want? Is that what the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Reconciliation, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister want? Do we really want the issue aired in the General Assembly that we have been found wanting in upholding the racial discrimination convention? Are we not prepared to even talk about it?
It is a head in the sand attitude by the government because sooner or later they will have to address this. Sooner or later they will have to talk with Aboriginal people. Sooner or later they will have to confront this issue, if necessary, in the courts because the finding of the CERD committee gives enormous weight to the legal arguments that have been put on behalf of indigenous people. For the government to just try to hide and say, `Aboriginal people shouldn't go overseas airing dirty linen in public,' is nonsense. Indigenous people and spokespeople for indigenous people have been going overseas to complain about Australia's treatment of indigenous people for over a hundred years. There are any number of examples of people taking their concern about the treatment of indigenous people outside Australia simply because they could not get action in this country. Back in colonial society days, the Anti-Slavery Society was expressing concern about the way indigenous people were being treated in this country, so there is nothing new about indigenous people and/or their supporters and advocates expressing concern in the international community.
What else do you do? If you cannot get action at home, you have to appeal outside. Look at what has happened in other countries. We take it for granted, when human rights abuses are not being addressed within countries, that activists and spokespeople will make appeals outside to make them international issues. If we do not want the rights of indigenous people to be an international issue, we have to deal with this issue at home. We 
 could deal with it at home simply if government learned to talk with indigenous people and learned to compromise instead of just bulldozing through and assuming that a piece of legislation can wipe off the planet the rights of indigenous people. If these were your property rights, Mr Acting Deputy President, or mine we would find that there would be absolute uproar if they were just—at the stroke of a pen through a piece of legislation—taken from us.
Gay McDougall, the committee expert who served as country rapporteur for the situation in Australia, said that indigenous land rights were unique and `encompassed a traditional and cultural connection to the land that had been recognised in international law'. That is a fact. Governments might not like it but it is a fact. Governments have to deal with it unless they want to cut themselves off completely from the international community. She said the international community now understood that doctrines of dispossession were `illegitimate and racist'.
We do not like the word `racist' and I agree that it can be bandied around as a term of abuse indiscriminately, if you will forgive the poor attempt at a pun, and I do not believe in calling people or governments `racist'. But the reality is that international law has shown that doctrines of dispossession are illegitimate and racist whether we like that term or not. It is like the term `genocide'. People get very upset about it and say, `No, we weren't ever involved in genocide.' We were—literally—and the fact that we do not like the word is irrelevant. The government policy in the past to systematically remove Aboriginal children from their families and culture was a form of genocide and that is a fact, just as the doctrines of dispossession are racist.
One of these days this government—and indeed future governments—will have to come to terms with it; they will have to deal with it. People in this country will demand it; the international community will demand it. Ms McDougall noted that the delegation had said several times that `the Australian government believed that it could not go back and cure the injustices of the past'. She said she could see some merit in that view—she is a 
 reasonable person—but what concerned her was that the validation and confirmation of extinguishment provisions in the amended act, that is, the Wik legislation, did not apply to the distant past; they appeared to apply to actions that in some cases had taken place as recently as 1994 and 1996. She said she would welcome a discussion within the committee about how experts might continue their urgent deliberations on Australia's situation beyond the conclusion of the current session.
I want to go back to the fact that at the moment there is on the books of the CERD committee a decision that is adverse to Australia and its international reputation and that, as far as I am aware, no-one within the government are doing anything about it. Senator Bolkus has raised a practical proposition of referring the decision to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. That would be a good start, but he is a member of the opposition. Other senators, including Senator Margetts and Senator Woodley, have expressed concern about this issue, as have members of the other place. But all that the government representatives—Senator Herron, Mr Ruddock and the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams—have done is to deny that this is an issue and say, `They're biased. They don't understand Australia.' Well, they would like to understand Australia better by visiting some time in late June or early July.
But can they get an official invitation? They certainly could not get an official invitation from this Senate because the government would not support it. That is fair enough—the government should be doing the inviting. But the government is not inviting the committee. I challenge the ministerial representative in the chamber at the moment to report back to the Senate and let us know whether it is the government's intention to officially invite the committee. If the government are so sure that their legislation is non-discriminatory, if they are so proud of their relationship with indigenous people, what have they got to be scared of? Why are they avoiding scrutiny? But, if they do have something of a conscience and they want to avoid this scrutiny, do they really think it is going to help in the 
 long run when the committee has to report to the United Nations General Assembly in November or December that there has been a failure to respond and no dialogue on this subject?
I say to the government in as bipartisan way as I can muster, which is obviously fairly difficult for me on this side of the house, that this issue is not going to go away. Government members may say, `There goes the opposition bad mouthing the government,' but I am not particularly criticising the government. I am simply saying that government has to deal with it. That is why we elect governments. It is not in the interests of Australia, as Senator Margetts and Senator Crossin said, to ignore this and hope that somehow it will go away. It will not go away.
For instance, already there is a European Network for Indigenous Australian Rights in London. On 22 March 1999 there was an Aboriginal call for British responsibility at Westminster. So this issue was being raised in London. I have here the US Department of State Australia Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998. It is quite a lengthy report on Australia's human rights practices. It contains a couple of pages of comment that is scarcely complimentary about the problems Australia has with indigenous rights. Of course, government can say, and I would say, that the US Department of State might look at its own practice in terms of human rights—the United States has the death penalty and Australia does not. Every country has reason to explain their policies in regard to human rights.
Australia in 1992 was praised, was held up as a fine example, by the very same committee that is now critical. When I say that we were praised, I do not mean that everything the former government—the then Keating government—did in regard to indigenous rights was absolutely perfect. I was critical of my own government at that time on a number of issues. But the last time we appeared before the CERD committee it was generally recognised that Australia was moving in a very positive direction. There had been the landmark High Court case, the establishment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
 Commission and the inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and it seemed that, with the independent reporting of both the minister and ATSIC, there was progression in the recognition of indigenous rights generally in Australia. That is why I believe the committee has been shocked by the changes that have occurred in recent years.
In conclusion, I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard the decision on Australia of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination at its 54th session, 1-19 March 1999. This has been reported in the media, but the full text of it has not been tabled in the lower house. It has not been tabled by the government in this house and, therefore, I seek not to table it but to incorporate it because I believe it should be there for all Australians who are interested to read.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
54TH SESSION 1-19 March 1999
CERD/C/54/Misc.40/Rev.2
18 March 1999
Unedited version
AUSTRALIA
Decision
1.	 Acting under its early warning procedures, the Committee adopted Decision 1(53) on Australia on 11 August 1998 (A/53/18, para. 22), requesting information from the State Party regarding three areas of concern: proposed changes to the 1993 Native Title Act; changes of policy as to Aboriginal land rights; and changes in the position or function of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. The Committee welcomes the full and thorough reply of the Commonwealth Government of Australia to this request for information (CERD/C/347). The Committee also appreciates the dialogue with the delegation from the State party at the Committee's 1323rd and 1324th meetings to respond to additional questions posed by the Committee in regard to the State Party's submission.
2.	 The Committee received similarly detailed and useful comments from the Acting Aboriginal and Torres and Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission; members of the Parliament and Senate of Australia. 

3.	 The Committee recognizes that within the broad range of discriminatory practices that have long been directed against Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the effects of Australia's racially discriminatory land practices have endured as an acute impairment of the rights of Australia's indigenous communities.
4.	 The Committee recognizes further that the land rights of indigenous peoples are unique and encompass a traditional and cultural identification of the indigenous peoples with their land that has been generally recognized.
5.	 In its last Concluding Observations on the previous report of Australia, the Committee welcomed the attention paid by the Australian judiciary to the implementation of the Convention. (A/49/18, para. 540) The Committee also welcomed the decision of the High Court of Australia in the case of Mabo v. Queensland, noting that in recognizing the survival of indigenous title to land where such title had not otherwise been validly extinguished, the High Court case constituted a significant development in the recognition of Indigenous rights under the Convention. The Committee welcomed, further, the Native Title Act of 1993, which provided a framework for the continued recognition of indigenous land rights following the precedent established in the Mabo case.
6.	 The Committee having considered a series of new amendments to the Native Title Act, as adopted in 1998, expresses concern over the compatibility of the Native Title Act, as currently amended, with the State Party's international obligations under the Convention. While the original Native Title Act recognizes and seeks to protect indigenous title, provisions that extinguish or impair the exercise of indigenous title rights and interests pervade the amended Act. While the original 1993 Native Title Act was delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders, the amended Act appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title.
7.	 The Committee notes, in particular, four specific provisions that discriminate against indigenous title-holders under the newly amended Act. These include the Acts's ""validation"" provisions; the ""confirmation of extinguishment"" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions; and restrictions concerning the right of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.
8.	 These provisions raise concerns that the amended Act appears to wind back the protections of indigenous title offered in the Mabo decision of the High Court of Australia and the 1993 Native Title Act. As such, the amended Act cannot be considered to be a special measure within the meaning of Articles 1(4) and 2(2) of the Convention and raises concerns about the State Party's 
 compliance with Articles 2 and 5 of the Convention.
9.	 The lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments also raises concerns with respect to the State Party's compliance with its obligations under Article 5(c) of the Convention. Calling upon States Parties to ""recognise and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their common lands, territories and resources,"" the Committee, in its General Recommendation XXIII, stressed the importance of ensuring ""that members of indigenous peoples have equal rights in respect of effective participation in public life, and that no decisions directly relating to their rights and interests are taken without their informed consent.""
10.	 While welcoming the State Party's recognition of the important role that has been played by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Committee also notes with concern the State Party's proposed changes to the overall structure of the Commission; abolishing the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and assigning those functions to a generalist Deputy President. The Committee strongly encourages the State Party to consider all possible effects of such a restructuring, including whether the new Deputy President would have sufficient opportunity to address in an adequate manner the full range of issues regarding indigenous peoples warranting attention. Consideration should be given to the additional benefits of an appropriately qualified specialist position to address these matters, given the continuing political, economic and social marginalization of the indigenous community of Australia.
11.	 The Committee calls on the State Party to address these concerns as a matter of utmost urgency. Most importantly, in conformity with the Committee's General Recommendation XXIII concerning Indigenous Peoples, the Committee urges the State Party to suspend implementation of the 1998 amendments and re-open discussions with the representatives of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with a view to finding solutions acceptable to the indigenous peoples and which would comply with Australia's obligations under the Convention.
12.	 In light of the urgency and fundamental importance of these matters, and taking into account the willingness expressed by the State Party to continue the dialogue with the Committee over these provisions, the Committee decides to keep this matter on its agenda under its early warning and urgent action procedures to be reviewed again at its fifty-fifth session. 

I thank the Senate. In my concluding remarks I again make a plea to the government to recognise that no problem or embarrassment that they feel they are facing in regard to this issue will disappear by being ignored. There is always a view within government—and my government was no different—that, when something is in the too hard basket and people do not quite know what to do with it, if you leave it in the too hard basket long enough it will somehow dissipate and disappear. Indigenous issues and the rights of indigenous Australians will always be with us and will always be the subject of international focus until we learn to work in a realistic cooperative way with indigenous peoples. They will be there at the Olympic Games, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, at the United Nations and when individual members and senators travel overseas. I challenge anyone in this chamber to say they have never been asked about the policies of governments, regardless of the political complexion of governments.
It is an issue that has been raised with me not just by people on formal delegations. A taxi driver asked me, `Are you still locking up your Aboriginal people?' because he had some knowledge of the Aboriginal deaths in custody report. I have spoken to other people who in no way are well informed but who nevertheless know that Australia has this reputation. We have to deal with the rights of indigenous peoples. Whatever the government may feel about Senator Bolkus's motion, I urge them to be open-minded. It can only assist in the process of assessing the concerns of the CERD committee and what action the Senate can recommend that the government put in process to change the way people throughout the world are looking at Australia at the moment.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-04-29,"—The speakers before me have gone into many matters that show how crucial this issue is. I do not want to repeat the arguments and propositions that have been put before the Senate, but I do want to talk about the issue of process. Process is often thought of as a very dull topic, and it is—people want to  get to the issues where the imagination, the soul 
 and the heart can soar. Process is simply a means of getting there, but it is important. We are a member of the United Nations organisation, and we are entitled to make criticisms of the way it goes about its tasks and of the conventions it produces, but, as a member, we should take seriously the processes by which it carries out its work.
Take the World Trade Organisation, for example. We have international commitments in trade and commerce. We disagree with a lot of the things that the bodies associated with the World Trade Organisation and world commerce do. We get upset when they say we should allow the importation of products from overseas which we think would harm us here. Nevertheless, we go ahead with it because unless we are prepared to say, `We are in on this arrangement, and we are going to stick by it even though it harms us,' what is the point of going into the arrangement? You might as well withdraw.
In the present instance, a unit of the United Nations has made a criticism of Australia and our conduct in a particular area. Do we then say, `Look, that criticism has been made but we will take no notice of it. When we go into an organisation like the United Nations organisation, we'll only take notice of what is in our favour'? If we did, the whole system would not work. If the only time we turned up at court was when we were going to win, the whole system would collapse. In the same way, if we are only going to take notice of world bodies when they say something that suits us, but when it does not we walk away, then the whole thing is devalued, there is not much point in belonging to it and we might as well get out.
An organisation of the United Nations has made a criticism of Australia, and Senator Bolkus has proposed that we refer the matter to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee—of which I am a member—where the statement made by this body of the United Nations can be looked at calmly. Submissions can be received from those who say that there is merit in the resolution and from those who say there is not. It seems to me that if the Senate is not prepared to at least have a look at what the United Nations body has said, 
 then it is skating around this important issue of process. It is skating around the obligation to look at what is said and to see what it makes of it.
Taking into account and giving due weight to everything that has been said, one of the central points is how we as a nation, having joined a body voluntarily, treat the sorts of things they say. If we treat them as being not worth much—if we treat them on a discounted basis—then why belong to the world body? As I said before, if we belong to bodies that try to get world trade into a state where it benefits everyone, and we say, `We don't want to listen to you on certain issues,' then we ought to get out of the world body because otherwise we will corrupt the whole process. If you are in an organisation and you do not live by its processes, you corrupt the processes and, ultimately, the body, and the honourable thing to do would be to get out of it. But if you are in them you should treat seriously the sorts of things those bodies say.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-29,"—I agree, as I very often do, with the honourable senator, Senator Cooney, who has just resumed his seat. Process is a very important matter indeed. We should under that circumstance certainly treat as being of worth what CERD say, but they should also treat as being of worth what Australia says. In this instance they did not; in fact they ignored what Australia said. That is something which I believe all Australians, indigenous as well as non-indigenous, should be concerned about.
The detailed legal submissions provided by Australia, both orally and in writing, were largely ignored. They were not referred to in the CERD decision. The portions of the committee's decisions, paragraphs 6 to 8, dealing with the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 could have been written in their entirety prior to the receipt of Australia's submissions. Is that process?
The discriminatory character of the act is asserted without any effort to explain or substantiate the conclusion in terms of the law and of the convention. There is no reflection of the countervailing benefits provided to indigenous communities under the legislation, 
 although this constituted a substantial part of Australia's submissions. Surely it should have been reasonable to expect that Australia's claims in this regard might at least have been noted. But there is no reference to them.
The conclusions in paragraph 10 of the CERD committee report to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner omit any reference to the assurances provided to the committee concerning the ongoing functions of the position. I can go on with list after list where Australia's views were not even acknowledged in the report. I do believe it is very important not to use this issue, either locally or internationally, as a political football. That is why I agree with Senator Cooney about process.
Let us now cast our minds back, if you will, to last year. All honourable senators will remember that the debate on the native title legislation was the longest debate in this chamber since Federation. Let us also understand what happened: there was a breakdown; there was a deadlock prior to Easter. Easter seems to visit me with difficulties.
—It is a great season, though.
—Yes. It is the last week of Lent so we had all to suffer it. I am sorry you had to suffer me, too; nevertheless, the matter unfortunately came down to my vote. The sticking points following the collapse of the Senate debate prior to Easter were the threshold test, the Racial Discrimination Act, the sunset clause and the right to negotiate. After 10 days of negotiations with the government the result, on any fair assessment, was a win for the indigenous people.
Let me explain the position as a result of that. The government's registration test was substantially softened to enable the children of the stolen generation and the victims of the locked gate practices to have their native title claims registered. This allows them access to the benefits of the act. The government backed down on the Racial Discrimination Act. As you will recall, they had put a sunset clause in the legislation, but now the Native Title Act is able to be read and construed by reference to the Racial Discrimination Act. Going to the six-year sunset clause, after 
 which time the government believed that no indigenous group could lodge a claim under the act—a much easier mechanism than a common law action, which they would have been forced to—on my insistence the government scrapped that sunset clause.
On the fourth sticking point, the right to negotiate, registration gave native title claimants access to the provisions of the act, including the right to negotiate with other titleholders. The government was opposed to any right to negotiate for native title claimants on pastoral leases granted by states and territories. I wanted to have the so-called equality of procedure rights for pastoralists and native title claimants, and I maintain that there cannot be such equality unless the nature of native title rights is recognised as unique and their interests different.
On this basis, I was able to secure what is in effect the right to negotiate under a state scheme. This requires notification of a proposed act—for example, mining—to native title holders and claimants; consultation, with a view to minimising any effect; mediation; and, in the event of disagreement, arbitration by an independent person or body. If favourable, that decision can be overturned only by the relevant minister after consultation with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and only in the public interest.
All of this is subject to judicial review to ensure procedures are properly and fairly carried out. Any compensation must be on just terms, decided by an independent tribunal. The state scheme requires the approval of the federal minister and that approval must gain the support of the Senate. If it does not, the federal right to negotiate will apply. Is Queensland—a Labor state—opposed to that? The Northern Territory scheme was tabled two days ago. I am having a very careful look at that. No doubt other senators are examining it as well. As far as I am concerned, it may well not meet with approval, but that must ultimately be a matter for our decision.
There were many other significant improvements to the legislation. I state quite unequivocally that I have continued to uphold both inside this place and out the protection of the 
 common law native title rights of indigenous Australians and have done so in a manner that will provide certainty and fairness to all concerned. I defy anybody to get up in here and say that I have not done that. This is one of the very few motions in this chamber relating to indigenous matters that I have not supported.
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—For example, yesterday there was the reference of the Jabiluka matter to a committee. If you cast your mind back, you will recall that there were great outcries from farmers and miners, but thankfully they have agreed—they have no choice I suppose—to work with the new system. Comments were made immediately after by the Chairman of ATSIC, Mr Gatjil Djerrkura. He indicated at that stage that he was comfortable with the outcome and he said:
I must acknowledge the progress that has been made and the contribution that Senator Harradine has made in achieving that progress.
. . .              . . .             . . .
We suspect that Senator Harradine has taken the Prime Minister as far as he could to avoid a race based election. I think he has demonstrated courage and integrity throughout this debate.
Cast your mind back—there was a threat of a double dissolution at that particular time. I knew that that was no idle threat. The country would have been plunged into a blindly intolerant, hate filled and bitter race based election. I must say that that was not uppermost in my mind—I think you have to deal with all of these matters on their merits. At the time, the Chairman of ATSIC expressed his disappointment at the validation of extinguishment acts carried out from 1 July 1994 until the Wik decision in December 1996. Those acts were carried out by the Labor and National Queensland governments contrary to the Native Title Act. Labor voted in the Senate for the validation of those provisions.
Senator Bolkus has asked that these matters be referred to a committee. I say that is absurd, because due process was not undertaken by the CERD committee. But let us hear from Senator Bolkus in his response. Let the Senate hear what changes the Labor Party 
 will make to that legislation if and when they are returned to government. Detail—in huge detail—what changes you are proposing to make to the legislation.
I have received representations from indigenous people who believe this attempt will only exacerbate concerns in rural Australia and be visited upon them. A person whose opinion I very much respect, and who is a very vigorous supporter of the rights of indigenous people in Australia, including native title rights, has expressed the view strongly to me that this sort of action, which is triggered by a decision by a committee of the United Nations without having regard to what Australia has said—ignoring what Australia has said—is only exacerbating the differences and prejudices that we all know currently exist in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I want to add a few quick remarks to this debate. I listened with great interest to what Senator Harradine has just had to say, particularly his comments about due process before the United Nations CERD looking at this matter. I take it as not only an implied criticism, but also a direct criticism of those persons from the Attorney-General's Department led by Mr Orr who appeared before the committee and defended the government and Australia's position.
Obviously Senator Harradine has taken a greater interest in the deliberations of the committee than I perhaps did at the time. He noted that an inadequate job was done before the committee by Mr Orr and the other persons who attended on behalf of Australia. If that is true, it is yet another matter that has to be addressed in the Attorney-General's office, an office that is not holding itself in very high regard for delivering the responsibilities previously delivered by that portfolio to the people of Australia.
I will not delay the chamber, but I wish to make one further comment. I have just returned from overseas. I am not one who travels overseas at taxpayers' expense and takes the opportunity to bucket Australia or the deliberations of the parliaments of Australia. I feel that one should bite one's tongue when one is overseas representing one's 
 nation. It was very difficult to do so in Norway last week when, on two separate occasions, representatives of the Sami nation met and made representations to a parliamentary delegation from this parliament on Australia's indigenous people. We did bite our tongues. We did not take sides, bucket Australia or in any way denigrate Australia, and the whole delegation did that, not just me. We behaved impeccably, but it is difficult when one is overseas and these comments are thrown at one.
Part of the reason why these comments can be thrown at us is that we appear to have closed ranks on this issue. We are not open to deliberation or scrutiny. This was brought further to the fore last week when this chamber rejected a proposition that the CERD ought to be invited to come to Australia to see for itself just what the situation is here.
I was not here to take part in that vote, but what have we got to hide? After listening to Senator Harradine's impassioned speech, it would appear that we have got nothing to hide. If we have got nothing to hide, why are we hiding? Why are we going to reject this reference to a Senate committee for further scrutiny? I think that is probably what is going to happen in a very short time. Why are we doing that? I am baffled that the Senate of Australia should seek to do so, if indeed we are going to follow that course of action shortly.
If we do have something to hide, let's hide it, but if we have nothing to hide, let's open it up and refer this matter to a Senate committee. Let's invite all participants to put their views forward. Let's even go to the extent of inviting CERD to appear before the committee and see what views can be gleaned from them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-04-29,"—I want to place on record the government's position on this. Senator Bolkus does not refer to CERD in his motion. He is referring to issues that have been dealt with at length by committees of this parliament.
These matters, as Senator Harradine has said, have been dealt with at incredible 
 length. In fact, one of the debates was the longest debate on a single piece of legislation in Australian history. The debate on the two 1997 native title bills totalled 105 hours and 56 minutes. These matters were considered in detail and, as Senator Margetts said in her contribution, at length by the committees that looked into these bills just over a year ago. They were before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title for 53 days and 39 days in two different references. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looked at these issues for a period of 39 days in 1997 and the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title spent 53 days considering the legislation and these legal and constitutional issues. So, during the first term of the Howard government there were in excess of 90 days in committee.
I noted in some of the press over the last weekend that the government copped some flak for referring the so-called online bill. There was some disquiet because that bill, which is a relatively minor bill compared to a native title bill, was going to be referred to a committee for nine effective working days. I read a story in the West Australian at the weekend to that effect.
It makes me laugh when I saw what happened in 1993 under the previous government on a piece of legislation as large, as complex, as overarching and as far-reaching as the Native Title Bill to now hear the Australian Labor Party saying that we need to refer just about everything off to a committee. In fact, more bills have been referred to more committees for longer in the last three years than in the history of Australia. For how long did Senator Bolkus and his mob want their Native Title Bill referred to a committee in 1993? How many days was that off at a committee? Seven working days. This is incredible, breathtaking hypocrisy from the mob opposite when it comes to committee references. These matters have spent in excess of 90 days in committee in the recent sittings of the parliament. That is the Labor Party's solution to native title. Senator Harradine has said to them, `Put your cards on the table. Come up with a policy.'
Probably very few people in Kalgoorlie, for example, read the Guardian Weekly. Most of them read the Kalgoorlie Miner. It might do Senator Bolkus good to read a paper like the Kalgoorlie Miner and see what the Australian Labor Party's equivocation on the native title issue is doing to the economy of a place like Kalgoorlie. I suggest to Senator Bolkus that he gets a subscription to the Kalgoorlie Miner and reads that, and puts his love and passion for a journal such as the Guardian Weekly to one side for a time.
Senator Harradine has challenged the Labor Party to put their amendments on the table, to say what they will do when they get back into power. That is what the people of Western Australia and, as Senator Harradine has said, Aboriginal people and other Australians would like. All we have got out of the Labor Party so far is, `We'll have a little powwow.' Mr Beazley's election policy was, `We'll have a meeting after the election and try to solve it.' That is not good enough for an opposition that purport to want to be a government at some stage in the next millennium. They should put their policies on the table. We are sick of their reliance on United Nations committees to run Australia. We think the Australian government, with the consent of the Australia parliament, should do that. This parliament has considered these matters at great length and, much to the ALP's chagrin, passed these laws. There has been a due process, a proper parliamentary process, and the law has passed through, as Senator Harradine has said, a gruelling process. The government will be opposing this motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-29,"—Pursuant to standing order 191, I claim to have been misunderstood by Senator McKiernan.
—You may make an explanation under that standing order, Senator Harradine.
—Senator McKiernan suggested I was reflecting in some way on a very fine public servant, Mr Robert Orr, who represented Australia in CERD. If Senator McKiernan had seen the material that was prepared and presented to CERD by Mr 
 Orr, he would not have suggested that that indicated any sign of incompetence; quite the reverse. I have the utmost respect for Mr Orr's competence and his ability to represent Australia. What I was saying was simply that, in the CERD committee's report, there is not even a reference to some of the major points made by Australia at that meeting.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—In response, can I put a few things on the record but also say a few things to Senator Harradine. Senator Campbell's response was predictable. There was no attempt to justify the government's position. It was basically an attack on anyone but the government, and once again an attack on the international mechanisms. We are becoming used to that from the government, but it is an issue that should be of concern to all of us and I know would be an issue of concern to Senator Harradine.
To Senator Harradine I say that I found his contribution enormously disappointing. I know we do not have a lunchbreak between this debate and the vote, but I would like him to listen to a few things I want to say because I do think his contribution was based on a number of inaccuracies. I am concerned that, by taking the position that Senator Harradine has taken, we are essentially taking a closed door approach to external scrutiny. If you are concerned about how the committee assessed Australia, then let us not be unfair to that UN committee. They want to come to Australia, but the government will not let them. If we set up a mechanism like the one I am proposing, then there is an opportunity for some of the questions and concerns that you have raised to be addressed. It does not do us any service to be cutting off this debate when the rest of the world is having it. To have an opportunity here to visit some of these issues is important.
We are talking of a UN instrument that has been one of the benchmarks in Senator Harradine's attitude to public life and his votes in the Senate—the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. We do not do any service to that convention by saying, `The committee charged with implementing and overseeing it 
 has made a decision, but we in Australia will close our doors, the doors of the Senate and the government, to the views of that committee, and we hope the issue will go away.' As I said before, Senator Harradine, this issue will not go away. I think we are being unfair and not doing a service to either the convention or the committee by not at least allowing some degree of scrutiny.
Senator Harradine made a great point of saying that the committee had ignored what Australia said. The committee may have rejected what Australia said, but I do not think the transcript shows that the committee ignored what Australia said. The committee may not have noted what Australia said in its final decision, but if you look at the transcript of the committee's deliberations—the meeting of the committee where they heard the report from Ms McDougall, the country rapporteur—you will find 8½ pages of questions formulated by the rapporteur and put to Australia. They were questions which were part of the debate in this place before the election; questions which have been raised this morning.
As I said, there were 8½ pages of questions with respect to Australia's position on the bill, on the ATSIC Social Justice Commissioner and also on the issue of special measure. I will turn to the special measure issue later. There was even acknowledgment by the Attorney-General on a number of occasions that the committee had engaged Australia in a meaningful way. On 16 March he said that the committee welcomed Australia's detailed reply to its request for information. He said:
The Government has informed the Committee of the extensive process of consultation and public debate . . . 
He reflected a similar engagement with the committee in a previous press statement in the first week in March.
—Nothing was said by CERD about the consultation—nothing.
—Let me get to that. There was constructive engagement—and that was recognised by the Attorney—to the effect that Robert Orr travelled all the way from Canberra to discuss the government's response. That was recognised by the rapporteur 
 in the minutes of the meeting of the committee, which are available to all of us. Appreciation was expressed by the rapporteur `for the assistance and cooperation that I received from the Australian Attorney-General', before formulating 8½ pages of questions to be put to Australia—questions which were answered. There is recognition of engagement by Australia through the Attorney-General and recognition of engagement by the rapporteur.
—Not in the report.
—The problem which the government had, Senator Harradine, when you say `not in the report', was that they went there and tried to mislead. I note you are shaking your head. The evidence of that is the finding of the committee that Australia breached the convention in respect of four grounds. Paragraph No. 7 reads:
The Committee notes, in particular, four specific provisions that discriminate against indigenous title-holders under the newly amended Act. These include: the Act's ""validation"" provisions; the ""confirmation of extinguishment"" provisions; the primary production upgrade provisions—
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—I will get to that. Paragraph No. 7 continues:
. . . and restrictions concerning the rights of indigenous title holders to negotiate non-indigenous land uses.
Do you know what problem the government has got in that regard? It has got one fundamental problem.
—You voted for the validation.
—Do you know what problem you have, Senator Harradine, in this regard? Unfortunately for the officer involved—
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—Order!
—He is getting worked up this morning.
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—Are you quite finished?
—Yes.
—Order!
—The problem that you have, Senator Harradine, and the problem that Mr Orr had was that document which reflected the advice which the Australian government had been getting on this bill in the lead-up to the debate, during the debate and after the debate—not just from within government circles, not just from the Australian Government Solicitor, but also from external advice that it sought.
When you go to the question time brief prepared by contact officer Robert Orr of the Wik task force on 17 November 1997, you find that three out of the four issues of concern to CERD are reflected in that advice. I will read what Mr Orr said:
Advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor on whether the 10-point plan was consistent with the RDA and if not, would any of its proposals cause the RDA to be invalid as no longer supported by the constitutional external affairs power.
The RDA is important here because it incorporates the international covenant into Australian law. Mr Orr continued:
In summary, Chief General Counsel Henry Burmester advised on 25 July 1997 that he is of the view that in some circumstances the proposals in the 10-point plan may involve an inconsistency with the RDA or with CERD. This inconsistency arises particularly in relation to the validation regime, the confirmation regime (especially the provision for `permanent extinguishment' if this is found not to be the common law position), and the provisions which enable rights of pastoral lessees to be enhanced at the expense of co-existing native title rights.
It does not mention the right to negotiate, which we must recognise was your mechanism in the bill. That is not recognised as a problem with CERD, although CERD found that it might have been. With regard to the three primary points that CERD was concerned about, the Australian government had its own legal advisers telling them that they would breach the RDA and CERD. Mr D.F. Jackson QC also gave the government advice, on 3 February 1997, that—and I quote:
. . . legislative wholesale extinguishment of native title on all pastoral leases by either the states/territories or the Commonwealth, even with 
 `just terms' compensation, would be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act (consistent with previous advice by the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General's Department).
This government were quite aware, from the most eminent advice available to them, that they were breaching that convention. They went to CERD and said, as the Attorney-General said, that the government's view was that they had not breached the convention.
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—They tried to mislead. That is where they got caught out. That is what you cannot overcome in this debate, Senator Harradine.
—But it must be read according to the RDA. Don't you understand that?
—That is the next point I was going to make. The committee then went on to discuss special measures, read in accordance with the RDA. It said that the mechanisms for reading it in accordance with the RDA were the mechanisms adopted by the Labor government in the 1993 legislation, and that was to use the mechanism of special measures. The committee said, in respect of the 1993 act, that the act was consistent with the RDA; that it was consistent with CERD. It said:
It delicately balanced the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title-holders. The amended act, however, appears to create legal certainty for governments and third parties at the expense of indigenous title-holders.
They recognised that the first act was consistent with the special measure mechanism in the convention, but they also made it very clear that the amended act was not; it very clearly was not. That is another instance where they took into account the evidence presented to them by the Australian delegation—evidence which, as I say, the Attorney-General was quite keen to reflect as constructive engagement with this committee.
You then say to me, `What about Labor's position?' Labor's position in 1993 was consistent with the RDA. Labor's position in 1997-98 was also a total wholesale alternative to what the government put up, and you know that full well. You know that, in putting up 
 that alternative, we were quite conscious of trying once again to get the balance right in order to avail ourselves of the mechanisms of CERD and the special measure mechanism. Although some elements of that alternative policy were obviously negative in terms of the impact on indigenous Australians, it was recognised by indigenous Australians as a special measure which could comply with the act. We know that as well. So it is chalk and cheese in terms of what this government has put up and our alternative at the time.
You ask what we will do in the future. There are already court cases on this legislation, but our attempt in the future will be to make a workable prescription. If you want workable prescriptions, you do not go to Kalgoorlie now because, despite what Senator Ian Campbell says, there are real concerns on the ground there with this government's legislation. The government rejected our alternative to fix up the Kalgoorlie problem. Our approach would be both workable and consistent with the RDA in a manner which we have shown can be done.
—Give us the details, please.
—Senator Harradine, we always wait for details from you—we have to wait to the death to get them. In this particular instance, you would say to us that we should wait for the court deliberations and decisions, and that is what we will do. But we gave you the prescription on what to do and how to do it during the last debate. I think you fully understood at the time what we were trying to do and how we were also driven by a need not just for workability but also for consistency with our international obligations. They will be the benchmarks for the future as well.
I am also concerned about the way you have treated this particular UN committee. I am not so sure that you wanted to sound disparaging about them, and I did say that maybe some inaccuracies have driven you in this.
—You stand up for them; you protect them.
—Well, you will not; the Attorney-General will not. I remind you, Senator Campbell, and Senator Harradine, that it was a committee of the United Nations that actually put together the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and we were at the forefront of that. They were the days when Australia used to engage constructively with the United Nations. They were the days when benchmark international mechanisms like this were developed. I would hazard a bet that, if we were now in the process of trying to develop a convention on the elimination of race discrimination, there would be one vacant spot at the table and that would be Australia's spot. This Prime Minister would not be party to such international human rights agenda setting. He would basically see it as political correctness. Senator Harradine, UN committees have jobs to do and they have done them extremely well. I put to you that you may have been a bit unfair with respect to this committee.
I will end on this particular point. Senator Harradine has raised concerns about Labor's position and about the committee's operation. I would like to be in a position to ask representatives of the Attorney-General: what did the Attorney-General mean in his press statements when he reflected the fact that Australia had a constructive engagement with the UN committee? We would like to get to that. We would then like to work out why, after the decision came out, he decided to shoot the messenger. We would like to find out what led to a change of legal position between that legal advice, the question time brief prepared by Mr Robert Orr on 17 November 1997 and the position put to CERD. There are directly fundamental inconsistencies and it is important for us to find out why the government had a change of view and why Mr Orr had a change of view. Did the Australian Government Solicitor have a change of view? Did they receive more advice through external briefings of QCs to see whether there was another point of view?
If you ain't got nothing to hide on this, then you set up a committee. Not only that, but there is an obligation on us, Senator 
 Harradine, to ensure that whatever dirty linen might be hanging out concerning this issue is revealed. You say you have advice from someone close to Aboriginal communities that reopening this may cause problems in outlying areas. Those problems will always be there unless we in this place are prepared to take an honest approach.
You will always have problems in this society given the diversity of it, not just problems with indigenous Australians but, from the migration intake that we have had, you will always have problems if one part of this community feels it has been discriminated against on the basis of race. You know that, Senator Harradine, because for all of your public life in this place one of your fundamental benchmarks has been the UN convention. We have respected you for that. As immigration minister I had to cop the heat of it, but at all times I respected what was driving you. In this particular instance, you would be letting down that convention, the international mechanism to enforce it and also what well-meaning people in this society want to do if you reject the opportunity for us to scrutinise the government's actions.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-29,"—I am not rising to indicate that I will be voting against the motion that Senator Kemp has just moved. I am rising to say that here we have another package of bills that has just been introduced and then referred to a committee, which is fine, except that they are part of the package. We are being told we have to consider the ANTS package as a whole and yet there are still parts of the package which have only just been introduced and are only now being put to the committee for consideration.
We know that part of the issue is that the government have said they did not want to change any part of the ANTS package. We know, as I have said on a number of occasions, that the business package is being dealt with separately—and here we have another part of the package that has not even gone to a committee stage yet. All of this feeds into the total picture and we should have had the total picture before we were asked to consider and vote on any of these bills. So it is very disappointing that the government made certain statements about the whole thing having to be considered as a package, and then put in bits and pieces while leaving out bits that we will not have to be able to see the total package.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—At this stage of the debate I would like to get some clarification from Senator Kemp about some matters I have raised on two previous occasions. Last Friday just prior to the Senate adjourning and again on Tuesday of this week I raised the matter of the 128 amendments that Senator Kemp has tabled in the Senate. I requested on the Tuesday a breakdown of the 128 amendments into two categories: those amendments that Minister Kemp alleges restore the government's original intentions and the amendments that were as a consequence of consultations that he said had been held with the wider community. I also then asked what the costs of those amendments were and what the savings were to the particular industries that were fortunate enough to be beneficiaries of those amendments. Minister, when will that information be forthcoming?",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-29,—The advice I have received from my officers who are preparing the information you have requested is that we should be able to have the advice for you tomorrow.,SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—Thank you for that. I will not be pursuing the issue any further at the moment, but I just would make the point to Senator Kemp and to the chamber that you certainly gave the impression that all of the 128 amendments that you presented to the Senate were minor technical amendments. You then did explain that some of them were amendments that reflected the wider consultations that had occurred with the general community.
It is important to know what the financial implications of the 128 amendments are. As I said on Tuesday, they went to an extensive range of issues. I did illustrate my request with some reference to the saving to the sugar 
 industry of approximately $2.3 million per annum. I acknowledge they are not your figures, Minister Kemp; they are figures that the sugar industry provided in evidence before the select committee. But the amendments went way beyond the sugar industry. There were a range of issues relating to financial institutions, insurance, bad debts, nursing homes, farm land and other significant matters. So I look forward to the details in response to my request, Senator Kemp.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-29,"—Senator Sherry, we will certainly, as I said, provide you with the request. One of the amendments relates to the issue of gambling, and perhaps it is useful for me to make some comments on this in the light of some of the press articles this morning. The government's policy in relation to gambling was set out in the taxation package which was released in August last year. What was said there was that the GST will apply to the operator's margin, not the prizes paid out. That is, the tax will apply to the difference between the total ticket sales and bets taken and the value of prizes or winnings paid out. As states already tax gambling highly, there may need to be corresponding reductions in state gambling taxes. The taxation package allowed for the entire proceeds of the goods and services tax from gambling to be paid over to the states, and the recently signed Commonwealth-state agreement provides compensation for the states for GST on gambling so the states' gambling taxes will be reduced in the same amount.
The GST bill introduced on 2 December last year sought to give effect to this policy by adopting a global accounting system for gambling supplies in which tax was payable on total amounts wagered less total monetary prizes, that is, the player's loss. However, the current definition did not fully take into account all payments that the casino operator must pay and therefore incorrectly states the player loss and the casino profit. A common practice in the industry is to provide a rebate to some gamblers on their total losses. The rebate has the effect of reducing the casino margin. The amendment ensures that such rebates are included in the calculation of 
 player loss and casino margin. This is not a concession, as was reported, but merely gives effect to the original policy so that the operator's true margin is subject to tax. The approach is entirely consistent with the states' approach to the taxation of gambling, where a reduced rate is applied to the commission based play.
Another example of an amendment that the government is making to ensure that the net revenue from gambling does not change is the government's proposals to make GST free certain raffles and bingo activities. These are not currently subject to state taxes, and the only practical way to give effect to the government's policy of no net gambling tax change is to exclude them from the GST.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-04-29,"—That is an extraordinary intervention by the minister. The minister began by saying that he would like to take the opportunity to express a government view about news reports that appeared today. That is not the issue that is before the chair, but I note that the minister has used the forum of the committee stage of this bill to reply to what has been said in the media and has used the forum of the committee stage of this bill to explain a government policy position. If this is what it is about, we might as well go to some of the issues raised by the minister in his statement.
An extraordinary situation has now emerged. The government has put down what I think will be colloquially known as the high roller amendments to aid casinos, to give them an exemption for their $500,000-plus patrons and to consider their so-called needs, but it is an exemption that does not apply elsewhere. In the inquiry that we have had into the GST, we have had welfare organisation after welfare organisation come and ask for some consideration on their costs of administration and functioning, and this government has declined to accept their views. What we now have is the minister saying, `Well, charities' lamington drives and bingo can be looked after in some way by the government in order to offset a major concession to casinos for their high roller interna 
 tional patrons who gamble in half-million dollar plus packets.'
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. I am very interested in this particular issue and I think it is one that does need to be debated at length, but I do note that later on in the running sheets, both early on and I think at page 9 of the running sheets, the gambling issues will be dealt with. I just wonder whether we should not hold off, as it were, until we get there and then go hard at it when those appear.
—The issues before the chair are the Democrats' amendment and the Greens' amendment. However, the minister did actually raise the high roller one.
—If I can just take a moment to explain my position, I did not start this. The minister started it by at the beginning of play on the GST bills jumping up and saying, `There was something in the papers this morning I did not like and I am now going to put down a government statement about it.' He proceeded to do that and opened up the issue. If we were proceeding with this in an orderly manner, when we came to the amendments that the government has tabled on this issue we ought to, as Senator Murray has rightly observed, deal with this issue then. But the government has chosen this opportunity to try and redress what it considers is an unfavourable press report about its view of the GST and how it favours its mates and does not look after those in need, and it has proceeded to open up this debate.
I am happy to hold my fire and debate this later on, but in view of the statement I just thought I should say now that, as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned, when those amendments come along we will not be supporting them. We think those amendments are favouritism to the high roller mates of the Liberal Party. We think those amendments do bias the system unfairly. We do not see a basis at all for giving casinos a break which is not extended to other areas of the community in a like manner. We do not see particularly that the casinos are a deserving group in Australian society when we have had so many other organisations that I think have made a very compelling case to the inquiry 
 and ought to have their needs met; yet we see that the government ignores their needs but concedes the needs of the casinos.
We are talking about a class of player at the casinos who are not your mums and dads, bread-and-butter gamblers that put up 50 bucks and go in and gamble in dollar lots. We are talking here about the ultra rich of the world, the international patrons, the ones that go into the high roller room, to which you would never be allowed admission wearing a pair of slacks and an open-neck shirt. We are talking here about the ultra rich that fly into airports in their private jets and then wander down in their chauffeured limousines to the Crown Casino, or whatever it is, and move straight into the mahogany room to risk in gambling half a million dollars or more a throw—as the paper said today, up to $5 million dollars a throw—and we are talking about the government giving a concession to casinos for that class of player.
—It is obscene.
—I take that objection about it being obscene. The issue is: has this country lost its principle? What about the fair go? What about the average Australian? What about concerns about the equity and fairness of this tax package? Senator Kemp may not like the publicity that I read on the front page of this morning's Sydney Morning Herald . If you were in government you would say, `God, we've taken a hit here,' but the government have taken a hit legitimately because they are their amendments. The explanation that is being made now is that this is what they always intended to do. Does that make it better?
—That's right. They always intended to look after their mates.
—They intended to look after their mates. They forgot to look after their mates properly when they drafted the bill, so here they come in panting, amendment in hand, saying, `We'd better look after them now,' and `It's all right. We intended this all along.' Have we lost a sense of proportion? I think this is an extraordinary turn of events. Then to pass this off as if it is a routine technical amendment is the explanation that is so misleading about this.
The government started this big so-called tax adventure back in April last year. They brought down their package in the so-called ANTS document in October, they ambushed the electorate in an election later in October and then they claimed a mandate to roll this legislation through. Having got that far—having pushed it through with a guillotine in the House of Representatives before Christmas and it comes here and fetches up on the shores of the Senate—they now say, `We have 128 amendments we want to make. Somewhere in the middle of this sheaf of 128 amendments is a deal for our high roller mates that own casinos in Australia and we think that is only routine.'
Minister, you have made an explanation about this. I think that explanation will hang like an albatross around the neck of the government because ordinary Australians will be paying—if this legislation is given assent by this chamber—a GST of 10 per cent on everything but the international high roller jetsetting into Essendon aerodrome or into Mascot will be getting a tax break. If there is anything that goes about being an example of manifest unfairness, that will be. Your explanation today has not in fact cleared up the issue; it has clouded the issue and has tried to divert attention from the real sin that is occurring here.
I notice in the paper this morning that Reverend Tim Costello, who I understand is the brother of the Treasurer, has had devastating words to say about the government's morality and sense of proportion on this. I notice in the paper as well that the Salvation Army, who obviously know at first-hand the needs of the poor and the needy in our society—
—The low rollers.
—The low rollers; in many cases the no rollers because they cannot afford to have any money to even get through the front door of a casino. The Salvation Army too have launched a devastating criticism of the government. All I can say is that, quite clearly, we will debate this if the government is foolhardy enough to persist now with the amendments that it has foreshadowed in the face of what is a gathering 
 public storm of protest about the priorities and principles of this government.
I happen to think that a prudent government, faced with this public outcry, would do the sensible thing and quietly over the weekend just pull those amendments out of the pack and forget about proceeding with them. If you had any sense, that is what you would do, not that I am in the position of advising a government—far from it. But if I were to, I would suggest that is what you ought to do: over the weekend quietly forget the matter—bury it—and get on with the other issues of the GST.
But I suspect you will not because the intricate web of the connections of influence between the Liberal Party, particularly in Victoria, and casino ownership is so intense and so important to the functioning of that operation that you cannot forget it and cannot do the sensible thing, that you are captive here and you are obliged to proceed. I suspect that is the truth. I hope you prove me wrong, and if you do I will be the first to acknowledge that you have done the sensible and prudent thing. But I suspect I am right and that you will proceed to press these amendments.
There is nothing in the explanation that has been provided today that should cause anyone that is offended by this manifestation of naked greed to be mollified in any way. There is nothing in what has been said by you, Minister, today that would cause anyone to think the government is moderating its position. In fact, there is every reason—taking the explanation that you have made—to presume that the government is digging in. That is the reason you made the explanation in the first place. You made the explanation because you wanted to try and defend the government's position. You wanted to try—utilising this phase of the debate—to step forward and quietly, just before lunchtime on Thursday, make an official explanation and hope the whole thing might therefore serve as a press release to be run round the gallery and counter the outrage that is being expressed by community and church leaders around Australia. 
I do not think this occasion can go past in this chamber with us allowing that type of `sneak the explanation through'. We are bound to stand, to mark the spot and to now say: when these amendments come forward, if you are foolhardy enough to persist with them, the Australian Labor Party will defeat them. The basic argument in this debate on a GST has boiled down to an argument about fairness. And that is a good argument to have. One of the things that is basic to the ethic of Australia, to the egalitarian nature of our own society, to the idea of a fair go for everyone is let's do it fairly, let's treat everyone reasonably and let's give everyone a break.
The GST is a percentage tax that applies equally to everyone irrespective of income and it takes a bigger slice of the income of the poor than it does of the wealthy. It is a regressive tax. The debate is about how you make that fair. Our submission in this debate is that you cannot. The very nature of the tax makes it unfair and the compensation you might award to try to overcome the unfairness for those on middle and low incomes in this nation will be compensation delivered up-front now, if it is, but future governments will knock it off, change it or erode it and the tax will remain forever but the compensation will fade away. The unfairness will, as the years tick by, get more and more gross. That is what this debate is now about.
On top of this debate, as we are talking about how gross it will get and the options to lock in fairness, comes the story in this morning's press about the casinos and how the high rollers, the international billionaires who gamble in the exclusive rooms of the major casinos in Australia, are to be assisted by having some of their losses handed back to them and the handing back of their losses, because of the size of their losses, is a tax deduction for the casinos. We are talking here about capturing the international casino trade and the way we do it apparently in this country is that, when a higher roller has bet and lost a million dollars, we hand some of their losses back to them. We then say, `That is free of the GST.' And we say, under your amendment, `This is fair.' Tell that to the rest of the patrons of the casino.
I am not a patron of a casino, but I respect the right of people to gamble if they want to. I deplore where it is done in excess, but I am not opposed to the principle of gambling at all. But it is not fair for the rest of the patrons and as sure as hell it ain't fair for the rest of Australia.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-04-29,"—We are not up to that, are we?
—No, we are not. We are still on Senator Margetts's amendment to the Democrat amendment. But the minister started the discussion.
—I have had a good look at those amendments. I am not now referring to the bingo and raffle amendments. I had expected to hear the detailed arguments from the minister when they came forward. The minister has now advanced arguments in favour of those amendments and, unless there are any other pressing arguments that might be influential in the chamber supporting those amendments, on the basis of what has been said thus far, I cannot see that the Senate would support those amendments.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-29,"—I was upstairs at a hearing into the financial sector bills and I arrived a few minutes late for the recommencement of this debate and I missed the minister's remarks on 
 this matter. I will have to refer to Hansard  to get them. As you know, I took a point of order to say that perhaps we should delay the debate until later, but since the minister has raised the matter and since it is an issue of immediate importance I think I should add a few remarks to what has been said already.
My first remark refers to the different roles of the select committee, the Senate and the government. The select committee received confidential submissions on this matter. The select committee did not take evidence in camera from the witness concerned, and I am concerned about the possibility that the confidential submissions to the committee have gone to the government to influence their amendment. Perhaps later on in the debate the minister could indicate whether the source for the government's gambling amendments was separate or different from confidential submissions to the Senate select committee, because there would be a matter of privilege attached to that, and that is an important issue.
The second issue that I wish to draw to the minister's attention, and on which perhaps he can take advice and advise us in the debate, is the sequential nature of transactions which are being discussed—namely, that a bet is placed and subsequently a rebate is provided. To my mind, in the law with which we are dealing, those constitute two separate transactions of a service and would be separately subject to a GST. I would like to draw your attention to that too.
The third area is an area of priority in policy and very much goes to the nub of what Senator Cook was saying. It is that inbound tourists have been refused GST free status as exports. Inbound tourists happen to be ordinary people, mostly. They are honeymoon couples coming to Australia, they are mums and dads visiting their children, they are friends of business people here, and they are ordinary tourists wanting to enjoy Australia. As an export industry, the legitimate claim for GST free status has been ignored by the government, and yet the government has been very rapidly responsive to a different class of tourist—the rich, the elite, the high rollers, who patronise a few very large establishments 
 with which the coalition has intimate relationships. You need to dust off your reasons and explain to the Senate why you would treat the mums, dads, friends, honeymoon couples and business visitors coming in on inbound tourism packages entirely differently from high rollers. I make those points briefly in response to the remarks made so far.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-04-29,"—As the minister has opened this debate now—I thought we would be having it a little later when we got to the government amendments—I need to move on from some of those questions that Senator Murray has asked that I hope the minister will be able to answer for us today. Are you just talking about high rollers, and do you expect that these people will be, overwhelmingly, tourists? If the answers are yes and yes, then I have to ask why it is that you are concerned about jobs in casinos but not about the myriad of jobs in the tourism industry—the jobs on charter jobs, in hotels, restaurants, et cetera. Why is it that we seem to be narrowing in on one particular group of jobs and ignoring all those other tourism jobs?
As we well know, there are only two export industries that have not been covered in your tax package, and the one that stands out the most is the tourist industry. This package was supposedly designed with a view to supporting exports, and yet one of our most successful export industries—the tourism industry—has been ignored. Whereas other countries offer a range of different incentives for tourism, here there are none—until now. We now have some incentives for one particular group of tourists to travel to Australia. As my colleague Senator Murray said, the government's attitude is, `Forget about the families and forget about the honeymoon couples. We want the high rollers.' If the minister is not prepared to answer these questions today, we certainly need them to be taken on notice. When we get back to this debate, I think the fundamental questions will be: why are some tourists now going to be preferred over others, and why are some jobs going to be preferred over others?

—I rise on a point of order to clarify the situation.
—What point of order?
—I am entitled to take a point of order, Senator. I am perfectly entitled to take a point of order and I intend to. The debate commenced with Senator Sherry's comments about the amendments that the government brought forward. What I was doing, quite rightly, was an illustration of—
—Minister, what is your point of order?
—The point of order is that I am trying to explain to the Senate precisely how this debate commenced.
—There is no point of order.
—In that case, I will wait until Senator Conroy has finished.
—Minister, this morning you responded to a question from Ms Kirk on AM . She asked:
But is the gambling industry better off or not—yes or no—thanks to this amendment?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-29,"—There is nothing against the forward estimates as a result of the amendment. This amendment, as I have stated clearly, restores the original intent.
—I am listening.
—Let me finish, Senator. You have asked me a question and I plan to answer it. As I said, there are no changes to 
 the forward estimates—that is the advice I have received—as a result of this amendment.
—That is not the question I asked, and you know it.
—You asked what the revenue effects are of this. My answer is that on the advice I have received from my advisers there are no changes to the forward estimates as a result of this change. That answers the question.
—That does not.
—You can go and shake your head all you like, but that is the answer to that particular question, Senator. That is the response you asked for, and I have given it to you.
—That is not the question I asked; that is not the response.
—It is indeed the question you asked, Senator, and I have responded. In response to remarks made by other senators, this is not a concession. This is not an export concession, which I think is the matter raised by Senator Lees. This is about the taxing of the true player loss; about what the true player loss is. As we set out in the commitment that we went to the election on—and we have given effect to that—it is clear that the way in which the original bill was drafted did not take into account all of those issues, and as a result of this amendment we have given effect to what the original policy intent was.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-29,"—Senator Kemp has not answered the question that I asked. Senator Kemp has continued, as he has for the last couple of days, to try to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public on this issue. The question that I asked was what the revenue implications of this amendment are, not what the revenue implications of the original bill were.
We agree that the original forward estimates stand. The question is that the bill did not achieve the original revenue estimate; it diverged. This bill does not actually match your forecast. So the question is: where did the forecast go? What is the extra revenue you are picking up because of the mistake you made? Therefore, when you say, `We're 
 returning to the original forward estimate,' we are agreeing with you. We accept that that is where you are returning to. The question is: as the bill stands now, before the amendment, what is the difference? How much extra money are you picking up than you originally planned for? So when you say, `This amendment returns you to the original forecast,' we agree. The question is: what is the divergence between the new revenue estimate and the one that is in the documents? That is the value of the concession you are giving to Crown through this amendment. I will wait for the minister to respond.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-29,"—Senator, you have agreed with me that you understand there are no changes to the forward estimates. That is precisely the case because this was always the policy intent of the government. Senator Conroy, I am pleased to say, has said he agrees with me—there is no change to the forward estimates; that is the position I stated. This amendment restores the policy intent.
—Restores from where?
—It restores the policy intent, which we promised at the election, on how we would tax gambling. This fully gives effect to the policy which we went to the people on and which we had outlined to the people. It was clear that the bill brought before the parliament did not give proper effect to that policy and this amendment, as I said, now restores the position on which we went to the election.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I want to ask Senator Kemp about a couple of points. What is the revenue gain to the casino industry, and specifically to Crown Casino, as a consequence of this amendment? What is the revenue gain to the gaming industry as a consequence of you presenting this amendment, which you have described as a minor technical amendment on previous occasions? Secondly, did you or the officers of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, have discussions with Crown executives, or any representative of Crown, about this particular issue? Did they explain to you, to the Treasurer or to officers of Treasury what this amendment was worth to Crown? Is it true that this 
 amendment is worth tens of millions of dollars to the casino industry and, in particular, to Crown? We would appreciate those details. We could have avoided this, Senator Kemp, at least in part, if you had not insisted that these were minor technical amendments—
—Revenue neutral.
—Revenue neutral, minor technical amendments with no cost. When I have questioned you more closely about the financial implications of these 128 amendments, you have slightly retreated in that you have admitted they were not just minor technical amendments but that some of these amendments `reflect consultations' you have had with the wider community. We would like to know what were the consultations that you had with Crown Casino about these particular amendments and what the financial worth is to Crown Casino. Crown Casino must have given you or Treasury some figures about what these amendments are worth to them.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-04-29,"—The minister may think that he is going to be able to stonewall all day today and tomorrow and get to the weekend without actually fessing up, without actually putting on the record the answer to the questions Senator Sherry has just asked—that is, what is the revenue gain to the casinos and Crown? Why did you get your forward estimates on the bill itself wrong? That is the point, Senator Kemp. You have got the forecast for your forward estimates wrong. They do not reflect what the bill does. 	 When you say that you are returning them to the original estimates, on that point there is agreement. But the key is: what is the value? How much money? Is it tens of millions of dollars that Crown is better off by because of this amendment? You will not be able to run; you will not be able to hide.
On the substantive issue, I ask anybody listening and watching today, including other senators, to turn to page 98 of your ANTS document under the section `Gambling and lotteries'. I will read to the chamber and to anyone who is listening what it says in your `Gambling and lotteries' section:
That is, the tax will apply to the difference between total ticket sales or bets taken by the operator of the gambling or lottery activity and the value of the prizes or winnings paid out.
That was your policy intent. That is what your document says: `value of the prizes or winnings paid out'. The problem you have, Senator Kemp, is that your amendment reclassifies gifts and rebates on losses, not on winnings. Your amendment is about losses.
—A special deal for Crown.
—It is a special deal for your mates. It is quite clear that your amendment does not go to the words of your policy intent. You have consistently misled the Australian public and this chamber today, because your policy does not go to rebates on losses.
—But not losses for anyone.
—No, losses only for the high rollers and the mates at the casino. You might think—just because you have written it in your legislation—that reclassifying rebates and losses is all of a sudden consistent with your policy intent, but it is here in black and white. Page 98 of your document is not about rebates on losses. It is not about running up bills at Crown Casino as part of your final tab at the end of the day and having them written off as a rebate. It is not about getting your hotel room paid for. It is not about getting any in-room services like videos, food or a massage—if you feel like a massage you call up the Crown and get the masseur up—paid for. Those services are going to be able to be passed off because of your amendment. It is not in the original bill, it was certainly not the original intent, but that is what you have tried to do in your amendment. You have actually classified losses and debts as winnings.
—As prizes.
—You have been exposed. You have tried to claim them as prizes—they are not—and you cannot get away with it because everybody is listening at the moment and they are watching you. They know the difference between a loss—
Senator Margetts interjecting—
—We hope everybody is listening to the debate, Senator Margetts. You cannot get away with classifying debts and losses as prizes and winnings. It is not what you say in your document. It is there in black and white. You are trying to pass an amendment and trying to claim that black is white on this one. It is not going to wash. You have been exposed for looking after your mates. Ron has been on the phone, Jeff has been on the phone and Lloyd has been on the phone. They bankroll the Victorian Liberal Party—you know it. You have a state election coming up and what you have wanted to do is give them a bit of money so they can kick into your coffers in Victoria later this year.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-04-29,"—Of all the disgraceful speeches that Senator Conroy has made in this chamber, that must really have to be one of the lowest. Senator Conroy, you know that the allegations you made are untrue. This might be the way that the Labor Party operates; it is not the way the Liberal Party and the coalition operate. What you are saying is absolutely untrue. It is a pity that a serious debate has to sink this low, but inevitably it does with Senator Conroy. A couple of issues were raised. Let me tackle them. One was the issue of privilege in relation to the confidential submission that was made to the Senate select committee. I have never seen that submission.
—Have any of your staff seen it?
—I was not aware that there was a submission, Senator, and I am not aware whether any of my staff have seen it. Senator Lees asked how that confidential submission to a Senate select committee was leaked. If the Senate wants to conduct a full inquiry, I hope that all senators—Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy—will take part in that because I think it is an important issue that was raised. I for one would welcome an inquiry into how a confidential submission to a Senate select committee happened to be leaked. I hope that Senator Conroy when he stands up will also say that he would welcome such an inquiry. I think it does go to the issue of whether people can make submis 
 sions to Senate select committees and how those submissions are treated. I put it on the record—and I hope you will, Senator Conroy—that I would welcome an inquiry on how this particular document happened to be leaked.
Let me make it clear that I have had no discussions with Crown. I am not aware of any meeting with the Treasurer. I understand there were meetings of Treasury with the Casinos Association about the amendments and the way the legislation as drafted applies to gambling. This was the basis on which discussions were held with the Australian Casinos Association. As a result of those discussions, it was pointed out—to summarise it—to the Treasury that the legislation as drafted did not give proper effect to the policy position that was outlined by the government; hence the changes have been made. 	Senator Conroy quoted from the ANTS package. Regrettably, he did not read the full text of what was stated there, and this is fairly typical of Senator Conroy when he gets excited and carried away. From memory, Senator Conroy did not indicate a key phrase. He left out a sentence, which rather throws some different perspective—
Senator Cook interjecting—
—I know this is probably hurting you, Senator Cook, but let me read what Senator Conroy did not bother to read out. He did not bother to read out the following statement:
The GST will apply to the operator's margin of these activities, not to the prizes paid out.
Senator Conroy read all succeeding comments, but not that comment which throws some different perspective on it. That phrase applies to the margin.
—Not at all. It is a rebate; it is not a prize. They have lost. A prize you get when you win. These are rebates for losses.
—I know that this might be of concern to Senator Conroy, but we are giving effect to the policy which this government took to the election. The tax is applied on the margin. We have ensured in looking at the margin that the margin is properly as 
 sessed. That is precisely what we have done. Senator Conroy may not like that, but that is the full position.
It is most unfortunate that when you get up you constantly impute the illest possible motives to people. It might suit the short-term politics that the Labor Party relentlessly runs, but it does not reflect reality. For the Labor Party with its record to get up and attack the coalition government in the way that it has, I totally and absolutely reject. The allegations are appalling; they are untrue and add nothing to the debate.
Senator Conroy has agreed. He probably made a mistake on this and will undoubtedly be ticked off by his colleagues when he leaves the chamber, but he made a very important statement. He understands and agrees there are no changes to the forward estimates. That was a very important statement made by Senator Conroy. If he had seen the glares coming from Senator Sherry and Senator Cook, he would have been somewhat horrified.
The Hansard will show that, after all the carryings on from Senator Sherry and the histrionics from Senator Cook, Senator Conroy got up and, encouraged by his colleagues, he too indulged in the arm waving and the shock horror. But he did make a very important concession and I welcome that. Senator Conroy stood up and said, `Yes, yes, Senator Kemp. I agree there is no change to the forward estimates.'
—No. You have returned them, you idiot.
—What does that imply? I know this is embarrassing for you, Senator Conroy, because you have blown it.
—Senator Conroy, you will have your chance further in the debate.
—You have blown it. You had your chance and you have blown it. You said, `I know there is no change to the forward estimates. I agree there is no change to the forward estimates.' What follows from that?
—You have returned them to their rightful position.
—Could we have a little bit of silence from you, Senator Conroy, because you have comprehensively blown it.
—Minister, please address your comments through the chair. Senator Conroy, you will have your chance in the debate.
—Thank you. He is very provocative. I am just taking Senator Conroy through how he has comprehensively blown the Labor case. The Labor Party has to be careful who it gets up to deal with these issues, because Senator Conroy said, `I agree there is no change to the forward estimates. Yes, Senator Kemp, we agree there is no change to the forward estimates.' What does that imply? That we are giving effect to the policy intent.
—No, not at all.
—Senator Conroy, you have proven my case. I could not have welcomed a more supportive statement than the one you made: `Yes, yes, Senator Kemp. I agree there is no change in the forward estimates.' Because, when you made that statement, at the same time you effectively agreed—
—You can stand there and flap your lips for the next ten minutes.
—Order, Senator Conroy!
—Thank you for your protection, Mr Temporary Chairman.
—The minister should address his remarks through the chair. It would assist the debate.
—I thanked you for your protection. I thought I was addressing the chair.
—Yes. You are doing very well.
—I think I am doing well, too. I also welcome your expression of support.
—I am not commenting on the merit of the argument.
—Senator Conroy, you have comprehensively blown it.
—You are the only person in the building.
—Order, Senator Conroy! You will have your opportunity to address this issue later in the debate.
—This is a serious issue. I thought the Labor Party were going to roll out the top guns, but they rolled out Senator Conroy—the pop gun. What in fact happened was that Senator Conroy agreed with my position. The position I have put is that this gives effect to the policy intent. There is no change to the forward estimates and Senator Conroy agreed with me that there was no change to the forward estimates. Therefore, it logically follows that you also agreed with me—
—That's where you blew it. You took a jump and tried to say I agreed with you on it.
—There can be no other way of interpreting your comments. When you said that, you agreed that we were giving effect to the policy intent on which we went to the election. When you said that, you blew the Labor Party case absolutely sky high. That is the danger of allowing someone like Senator Conroy loose. That is the trouble. You did not stick to the script; you made it very clear, as you should have. You made this comment and you agreed with me that we had not changed the forward estimates. There is no change to the forward estimates and, therefore, it logically followed—
An opposition senator interjecting—
—I know it is embarrassing for you that, after ten minutes during which you thought you were on a big run, Senator Conroy has comprehensively blown the Labor Party case sky high. In conclusion, I would welcome an inquiry into the leaking.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-04-29,"—I seek leave to table a report and make a brief statement.
—Leave is granted.
—I table a report by World Vision, entitled Kosovo: the women and children . It has been prepared, primarily, by Brenda Fitzpatrick from World Vision Australia and is a report on a recent mission to Albania for the specific purpose of looking into the situation of women and children who are refugees.
I was honoured to accompany that mission, although I left Albania on my fourth day and these people spent much more time there. They heard the harrowing and oftentimes very sad and chilling tales of these brave refugees. We saw refugees in a variety of circumstances: in camps, hostels, hotels, a sports stadium and hospital situations. I commend this report to the Senate and urge all senators to read it. I thank those senators who were at the earlier briefing with World Vision members. I particularly draw your attention to the recommendations contained in the report.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-04-29,"—In speaking today about this special bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999 , I wish first of all to reaffirm the bipartisan approach that the opposition has taken in this situation.
The humanitarian crisis in the Balkans has now reached previously unthinkable proportions, with close to three-quarters of a million people displaced from their homeland and a list of atrocities and family tragedies that grows with each day. At a time like this, it is necessary to set aside differences and focus upon those who are most in need. Australia is a wealthy, mature, culturally diverse nation, and it is imperative that we act as such, without reservations and with altruism foremost in our minds. Therefore, for the record, I reaffirm the opposition's in principle support for this legislation, designed to provide 
 assistance to some 4,000 displaced refugees from Kosovo should the need arise to accommodate them in Australia.
Having set on the record our support for this stance, I want to emphasise to the government that it now has a great responsibility to look after these refugees not only if they arrive on our shores, but also if it is decided it is best for them to stay close to their homeland. It is clear from the government's actions that, while its intent was good, many of the decisions taken were reactive and, ultimately, possibly detrimental to the cause of these refugees. The pause in the humanitarian operation initiated by the UNHCR has given the government a second chance to iron out all the problems with its operation and, most importantly, it now has the time to clearly think about the consequences of its decisions.
There are several areas that could and should be improved upon with regard to Australia's response to this humanitarian crisis. The opposition is still of the opinion that the government's efforts have not gone far enough and are still too reactive given the pace at which this crisis continues to grow and given that this human tragedy is spilling over to neighbouring nations. It is important that the government keeps an open mind to new developments and that the focus is maintained in the best interests of the refugees. In this instance, the eyes of the world are upon us and Australia has an enviable record when it comes to assisting those who are less fortunate. We must make sure that we build on that reputation and that our wealth and resources are shared for causes such as this.
As part of keeping an open mind to the needs of the refugees, the opposition calls on the government to consider an expansion of the permanent humanitarian program to cater for the Kosovo refugees. Temporary residence may not be the appropriate answer to cater for these poor people, especially if the conflict escalates and ground troops are used. Should this happen, the likelihood of a protracted conflict in the region will increase and the need for a more permanent solution for 
 refugee accommodation will certainly be required.
While, on the surface, it may seem that we are facilitating the work of Slobodan Milosevic by providing a permanent safe haven for those he is trying to remove from Kosovo, in reality there will be many refugees who will not be able to return to their homeland even after the end of hostilities. Some will have nothing and no-one to go back to, some may face persecution if they return and some will have developed ties to and within Australia after many months here and may feel settled and secure in our country.
Already, the UNHCR has begun to reassemble family units among the Kosovo refugees. This is a sad and unforgiving task, but it aims to bring some normality back into the lives of thousands of people who, until now, have not only tried to survive but have also been burdened with the thought of never seeing their families and loved ones again. These are the sorts of people who require our help and compassion. The government will have to consider the wisdom of sending them back against their wishes once the conflict is over, whenever that may be. While the answers are not easy, what we clearly say is that an open mind and an open heart must be kept.
The Australian Labor Party when in government understood this situation and in 1995 decided to expand its humanitarian intake by borrowing from forward programs to cater for the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was a good decision. Those who came over under this scheme have now become productive members of our community and they are proud to call Australia their new home.
The opposition has examined the bill that is before the Senate today. We note the intent of the government to safeguard the integrity of the migration program by providing broad discretionary powers to the minister. These powers are designed to ensure that those refugees accepted in Australia comply with all character and criminal checks. These provisions are desirable as we must ensure that those people that we choose to accept are the needy and those looking for a safe haven from the tragedies of war.
We also note that the bill quite clearly prevents the refugees from applying for any other form of protection visa while holding a temporary safe haven visa. The opposition has always held reservations in cases such as these where opportunities for individual choice are restricted. We note, however, that the bill contains provisions for the minister to effectively override these considerations and allow a person or group of people to apply for different protection visa classes should their circumstances warrant it.
The opposition asks the minister to use these broad discretionary powers with wisdom and generosity, keeping in mind that these refugees' first choice would have been to remain in their country and continue to lead peaceful and productive lives. Their decision to seek asylum in Australia, if they choose to do so, should be interpreted by the minister as an act of desperation and a wish to rebuild a new life.
Another aspect of this legislation that concerns the opposition is the inclusion of a six-month sunset clause on the safe haven visas. Again, I note the intent of the government to safeguard our migration program. However, if the situation in Kosovo deteriorates further, this six-month sunset clause will prove unrealistic and Australia may well breach international conventions on the rights of refugees.
To ensure that this situation does not eventuate, the opposition calls on the minister to exercise his powers without delay following the expiry of the sunset clause should the hostilities not be resolved. At that stage, the government will need to realise that a permanent solution to the fate of the 4,000 refugees is required and that all avenues of appeal and asylum determination must then be opened for these people.
Under our international obligations and our moral obligations as a responsible nation, we are bound to ensure the safety of these refugees and we must not cause unnecessary trauma and anxiety in these people's minds about their fate. In the event that our assistance in accommodating these refugees is no longer required or that alternative arrangements are reached by the UNHCR in the 
 meantime, the question will then arise as to what to do in terms of Australia's aid effort. Currently, the monetary element to which the government has committed itself is $6 million. This figure, given the recent developments and the gravity of the situation, seems more and more inappropriate as each day goes by.
The government needs to realise that this is no longer a game of numbers and figures but is a serious attempt to alleviate a crisis of global proportions. In the event of the UNHCR no longer requiring our logistical assistance in relocating the refugees, the opposition calls on the government not to rescind its offer of assistance and to donate to humanitarian agencies the total worth of the aid package as Australia's contribution to solving the Kosovo crisis.
While there are no figures attached to this resolution, it is expected that it might comprise the overall costs that would have been associated with relocating, housing, feeding and supporting the 4,000 refugees while in Australia. The final figure may, of course, run into many millions of dollars but, given the circumstances of this tragedy and the alternatives in terms of loss of human life and what is essentially the displacement of a whole nation, we say that it is the least a country like Australia can provide in assistance. It is with those considerations and issues in mind that the opposition gives its support to the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-04-29,"—The Senate is considering the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999  brought forward by the government to enable them to offer temporary safe haven visas at this stage to people who have been displaced from Kosovo as part of the current escalation of conflict in that region and applies specifically to those who have been displaced since the US-NATO bombing campaign started. It is unfortunate that we have a specifically limited time frame to debate this legislation—we have until only 2 o'clock—because it is very important. It is self-evident that it deals with a matter of extreme interest to the Australian community and on which many people in the 
 community have quite strong opinions and have a great deal of interest in seeing significant assistance being provided to refugees in the Balkans at the moment.
Indeed, it is probably not unreasonable to suggest that it is because of that great degree of concern within the Australian community that the government came forward with this initiative to offer 4,000 temporary places. So it is a shame that we do not have time to go into as much detail of the bill as would be desirable. If we do run short of time, I would hope that the government and, I am sure, the Democrats would be quite happy to use an hour of Senate time tomorrow, setting aside the tax debate for a little while, to deal with this issue. I notice there are a number of speakers on the speakers list.
The bill is important not just because people are interested in helping refugees in Kosovo; it is equally important because of its content. The bill has some potentially very far-reaching measures. It is easy to dress it up and say that this is just the government on behalf of the Australian people offering a helping hand to people in need. I am sure that is partly the government's intent, but the bill has some very significant potential ramifications. Indeed, the whole concept of offering only temporary assistance to refugees in itself has potentially significant ramifications for long-term refugee policy in Australia. That being the case, it is very dangerous for the Senate to just wave it through as a goodwill measure on the part of the government. There are a lot of potentially very serious, very significant and long-term ramifications from proceeding down this path.
The view of the Democrats is that this bill is unnecessary. There is no need to have special legislation for Australia to offer assistance to refugees from Kosovo. We can offer assistance today by providing permanent places in Australia. Indeed, the government has provided permanent places for 200 refugee families, as it announced last week, and the Democrats welcome that. The big problem with that is that it is not 200 extra places as part of our refugee humanitarian program; it is 200 places specifically earmarked for Kosovo refugees out of the existing program 
 which means that 200 other families elsewhere in the world will now miss out. The Democrats believe it is essential that the overall size of our refugee and humanitarian intake program be expanded as part of the things that need to be done to assist with this current crisis.
I did have a second reading amendment circulated seeking to have a Senate vote establishing that principle. However, because of the government's inability to get this legislation brought on during normal debate in the Senate, and because we have to debate it in what is euphemistically called the `non-controversial legislation' lunchtime debate where we are not able to call a division on anything in the bill, I indicate to the Senate that I will not proceed with that second reading amendment because I think it is important enough to call a division on. I will do it by way of notice of motion or some other mechanism in the not too distant future, and as an indication of the Democrats' willingness to be cooperative about this matter, despite our very serious and significant concerns about some of the shortcomings of the bill.
Senator Faulkner indicated at the start of his contribution that it is important for us as a nation to focus on those most in need and with altruism foremost in our mind. I certainly agree with those words. That being so, we need to look at how best to address that need. It is the view of the Democrats that this bill is clearly not the best way. The best way to help these refugees is to provide extra funding and technical assistance where they are now. Again, I acknowledge the commitment that the government has made to date of $6 million in that regard. That is one way. The other is to provide genuine, permanent refugee places under Australia's program as it already exists. As I have already said, this should be by way of increasing the size of the program.
Offering temporary haven to these people, as Senator Faulkner pointed out, has a number of dangers which may well lead to increasing the trauma they have suffered. People who work with refugees know that one of the traumas for refugees is the event that forced 
 them out of their homes. That is a very traumatic immediate event. The other major traumas that refugees and refugee families suffer are the ongoing sense of displacement, the ongoing uncertainty about their future, the ongoing loss of control about where they can call home and what is going to become of them.
There is a danger with the temporary haven approach that we will be exacerbating that trauma, that we will have people here for an indeterminate length of time with no control over their future. Obviously they will be able to return whenever they want, but they will have very little or no control over how long they can stay. They will be completely at the mercy of the government and the minister as to how long they can stay here, and they will be unable to apply for a humanitarian visa or any other visa while they are here. There is a small exception to that in the legislation but, as the minister's second reading speech pointed out, the minister will only allow an exemption to that policy under exceptional circumstances—that does not exactly give great cause for hope that he will exercise that discretion in a large number of cases. We have the problem that offering temporary haven may well exacerbate the uncertainty that these refugee people have over their future.
It is misleading to use the label `refugee' in the context of this legislation because the main purpose of this bill is to prevent people from claiming refugee status. The 4,000 people who come here through utilising the power established via this legislation will specifically be prevented from claiming refugee status. They will basically be saying, `We are not refugees' or `If we are refugees, we are not going to claim it in Australia.' To claim refugee status, they will need to go offshore and be part of the queue for a not very sizeable number of spaces. Indeed, some of the problems with offering temporary asylum were well outlined by Minister Ruddock and Minister Downer before the Prime Minister's backflip on this issue earlier in the month. Other refugee organisations, and Amnesty International, have highlighted these problems. I emphasise that those problems are 
 just with the general concept of offering temporary safe haven.
The Bills Digest from the parliamentary library deals with some of these and it briefly highlights, by way of general comment, some of the difficulties that may arise in relation to this legislation and the dangers involved in not meeting the crucial principle of the non-refoulement of people, which basically means not returning refugees to a place where they are still in danger. If there is a very clear potential conflict the bill in itself does not mean that that will happen. It does not automatically mean that refugees or what would otherwise be refugees—the holders of safe haven visas—will be sent back against their will, but it gives the minister the power to do that.
It is all very nice to have commitments saying, `We will not do that, we will call on the government not to do that,' but it gives the minister the power to do that. Again, it leaves the future of these refugees very much in the hands of the minister. For all the exhortations one might make about the humanitarian approach of the minister—broadly speaking, I would not demur from those—he is not the only person in the government. I am sorry to say that, as much as I would like to have goodwill in relation to an issue such as this, I think it is very difficult to believe that all people in the government are motivated completely by humanitarian concerns in the treatment of refugee issues.
I refer the Senate to an article by Richard McGregor in the Australian of 13 April which specifically deals with the government's reversal on the Kosovo refugees and going down this new route of offering temporary humanitarian assistance. It also deals with the fact that this approach of the government does not signal a softening on refugee issues. Indeed, the article highlights that our immigration policy is getting tougher, particularly for refugees. The approach of the government on refugee issues broadly is not one that makes one feel that humanitarian concerns are always at the top of the list. Passing a piece of legislation which empowers the minister to ignore humanitarian concerns is something 
 that needs to be highlighted and it needs to be recognised that that is what we are doing.
I also point to Alert Digest No. 7 of this month which draws the attention of senators to provisions in the bill which may be considered to `trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties and make those rights unduly dependent on nonreviewable decisions.' Because this is a specific, deliberate policy decision of the government, the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did not see it as appropriate to comment further on that. It is important to emphasise that that is what this bill does. This bill offers temporary safe haven. Inasmuch as it may provide some relief from immediate suffering, the Democrats welcome that. We reiterate that to do that it is not necessary to pass this bill. We can bring people in immediately under our existing refugee program.
It is important again to emphasise what else is actually being done as part of this bill in establishing this temporary safe haven. The minister can reduce the length of temporary safe haven visas without appeal, solely on the grounds that he believes temporary safe haven is no longer necessary. There are no criteria he needs to measure in relation to that. He does not specifically have to address the principle of non-refoulement. I note that Senator Margetts has an amendment in the committee stage which goes part of the way to redressing that in terms of requiring the minister to ensure that there has been a significant change of circumstances indicating that the country is more stable and that the changes are durable and fundamental. That is welcomed, but there is a lot more to refugees and dangers in returning home than simply being able to say, `Well, the war has stopped, so off you go.'
I think the World Vision report that my colleague Senator Stott Despoja tabled just previously highlights that there are a lot of very personal and very traumatic experiences that people endure. That World Vision report particularly highlights women and children. There is a lot in terms of a place not being safe to return to on an individual level and personal level that may have very little to do with whether or not the war has actually 
 stopped. So it is a fundamental issue. This legislation empowers the minister to send people back to somewhere where they believe they are not safe and it seeks to enable him to do that without any appeal.
Holders of these visas, as I have already said, cannot apply for refugee status. They cannot apply for any other visa without going offshore. The minister can cancel the visa without regard to natural justice—it is specifically in the legislation. And that decision is not appealable or reviewable—or the legislation seeks to enable that to be the case. A decision by the minister to shorten or extend a visa is not reviewable. He has no duty to consider any request for a visa extension due to personal circumstances. Again, he may, but he does not have to. Obviously, political issues can come into play here.
The minister can cancel or refuse to grant a visa on character grounds without appeal, without notice, without natural justice. The assessment of what makes someone's character undesirable can include something as general as past  and present general conduct, that their presence may prejudice Australia's international relations or that they have been sentenced to 12 months gaol or more. The definition of gaol includes residential drug rehab or residential programs for the mentally ill. I know a number of these are similar to existing legislation, but remember that we are talking about refugees here. This enables the minister to cancel the visa solely on those grounds. Perhaps even more dramatically, if a person has their visa cancelled on character grounds, this automatically extends to each immediate family member without even any requirement for notice to have been given. The whole family is immediately able to have their visas cancelled without review and without notice. I think it is important to emphasise that those powers are being put in there.
One of the significant objectives of this bill is to create a class of visa holders who can be removed easily with minimum cost and with no regard for the opportunity for appeal. The legislation seeks to do this by insulating the minister from the fetters of the rule of law when making certain decisions concerning the 
 granting and termination of the class of visa and granting him more power to cancel visas of those he considers undesirable. It is debatable whether or not this objective will be achievable. It is quite possible that visa holders may still be able to bring writs or injunctions in the High Court, despite this government's  ongoing attempts to restrict the ability of people—refugees and other migrants—to appeal to the courts. They have found it a bit difficult to date to stop people being able to go to the High Court because of the awkward and annoying thing of the Australian Constitution. It will be interesting to see whether or not that may still apply in relation to this bill.
The issue of refugees which this bill relates to is something that I think is of great significance if we are to take human rights seriously. As a nation we have had an unfortunate debate in the last couple of years when we have really had to question whether or not as a nation we are welcoming towards refugees any more—whether we are welcoming towards migrants. I do want to express my pleasure, my gratitude to the large proportion of the Australian community who have indicated that we are a generous nation, that we do want to help people in need. And I hope we can recognise that and hold on to it so that that does not just dissipate as this crisis slips off the front pages. I hope it is an ongoing commitment to assisting people in need and it does not just apply to white Europeans but we have a similar level of concern for people in Asia, for people in sub-Saharan Africa or elsewhere.
There are a number of other issues I would like to go into which I do not have time to because of circumstances. There are some significant issues in terms of the United Nations protocols and conclusions on international protection and refugee status that I think allow the government to basically ignore those international conventions. That is a matter of great concern to the Democrats. I hope to have the opportunity to ask for some clarification by the government on some of those issues in the committee stage of the debate. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-04-29,"—On 6 April 1999 the government committed to accept 4,000 Kosovar refugees. The provisions of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999  allow for a visa class to be known as class UJ, temporary safe haven visa. These visas will be temporary only. A holder will not be able to apply for another visa class unless the minister grants permission to do so in the public interest. The minister's decision to allow a person to make or not to make an application for another type of visa will not be judicially reviewable. The minister will decide when the visas are no longer valid. The decision will not be judicially reviewable.
The power to remove persons once a visa is deemed no longer valid will be given to the department. The minister will also have the power to refuse to grant or to cancel a person's temporary safe haven visa based on character grounds. This decision will apply to each member of the immediate family of the person and will not be reviewable. So, no matter what the implications for each of the members of that family, it will not be reviewable.
I would like to congratulate the government, however, on their efforts so far on several counts. The minister has responded swiftly to the call from UNHCR to offer to take refugees from the Kosovo crisis. Also, there has been a high level assessment team sent to Macedonia to assist with preparations for the possible evacuation of Kosovar refugees to Australia. The government are to be congratulated that the legislation has been presented to the parliament for debate so swiftly such that the conditions and safeguards will be in place before refugees arrive, if they do arrive. The government are to be congratulated that the act and regulations would minimise administrative tasks to be undertaken by the refugees. There would be no need to fill in forms for the initial application or for the renewal of visas. This may sound like an insignificant detail, but for a refugee the fewer bureaucratic requirements they have to fulfil the better. We know that the situation many of the refugees find themselves in is that they currently have no docu 
 ments with them. Their documents have been removed, so it would be very difficult for them to fill in the normal kinds of application forms that would be required for haven in Australia.
The Greens (WA) do have several concerns. As the bill stands, the minister and the minister alone has the power to decide when the Kosovar refugees will be made to return home. It is not a sufficiently accountable mechanism that the return of persons to Kosovo be contingent upon whether or not in the minister's opinion temporary safe haven in Australia is no longer necessary. That is from schedule 1 of the bill. The government has expressed its concern that these people, who have left their homes in traumatic circumstances, be provided with a safe and stable retreat where they will be protected from further exposure to traumatic events and will therefore be able to continue their lives with minimal further disruption. This, of course, is a very laudable aim, and one that government and non-government organisations are working hard towards.
It is one thing, however, to create stability through physical surroundings and another thing to create stability through the psychological certainty of knowing that you will not be sent home before enduring stable conditions have returned to your country, or perhaps even your part of the country. To safeguard against this happening, greater transparency and objective ability to verify need to be built into the decision of the minister. To this end, I will be moving an amendment that the minister be required to present a case that his or her decision meets various criteria as outlined in conclusion 69 of the executive committee of the UNHCR.
The Greens (WA) are also concerned that the minister's decision to extend or shorten the visa term will not be reviewable. I am not at all comfortable with this provision, but I understand that the government wishes to make the process of managing the Kosovar refugees in Australia as expeditious as possible. We all know that reviews can take time. It is intended in any case that the introduction of greater accountability in the minister's decision will minimise any need for a review. 
 I hope, therefore, that I will receive support in amending the minister's accountability requirements.
Whilst I congratulate the government for offering help to Kosovar refugees, I hope that the provision of temporary protection will not become a trend. These people are refugees; that is demonstrably and palpably so. Under the refugee convention they have a right to permanent protection, and Australia accepts this standard in domestic law, that is, permanent protection if they so seek it. With such massive, sudden movements of refugees, it should be possible that Australia increase its humanitarian quota to respond in a way that is compassionate and that conforms to international law, that is, in a way that offers permanent resettlement and its consequent rights and privileges. It is a pity that we are restricted in the way we can deal with amendments in this lunchtime debate, because I would certainly be supportive of Senator Bartlett's amendment to that end.
It is pertinent to take note, in respect of the points I have mentioned, that Canada will not be enacting legislation for the Kosovar refugees that it accepts. This is simply because Canada has found that temporary protection for refugees is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada's alternative to temporary status has been to offer visitor visas to Kosovar refugees, giving them the freedom to subsequently apply for permanent residency through the normal refugee application process. This may not be the appropriate response for the Australian government, but it does highlight the fact that temporary protection for refugees is not ideal human rights practice. The high commissioner has asked Australia to take Kosovar refugees on a temporary basis only, and this bears on the situation. I also recognise that some latitude has been given to the minister to allow certain persons, in the public interest, to apply for permanent protection. I do not think this goes far enough, however, and we will be moving an amendment to broaden the person's ability to apply to stay permanently and to be treated on a case basis. In any case, I would certainly hate to think that with the passing of this bill the government considered 
 that it had some degree of mandate for treating future refugees on a similar temporary basis. I hope I am not pre-empting things here, but a prime example that springs to mind is that of the East Timorese people.
I realise that this whole debate is hypothetical to some extent. If it becomes apparent that Australia's assistance will not be needed to care for Kosovar refugees in Australia, I would welcome any commitment by the government that the money be allocated instead to the aid efforts in Kosovo itself. In that, I would agree with Senator Faulkner's proposal for the transfer of those funds. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees continues to remind governments that assistance to rebuild Kosovo is going to extend far beyond the disappearance of news from the headlines. If money can be found to assist Kosovar refugees onshore, then this money can be earmarked for contributing to long-term rebuilding efforts in Kosovo. I urge the government to provide a commitment to do this.
The issue of refugees from Kosovo is obviously a very real issue for many people. We have seen the pictures nightly on our television screens and in our newspapers and have read the very traumatic stories. We realise that the issue of the future of Kosovo is going to be very complex and very traumatic for all people concerned. The opinion has been expressed by a number of people that it is important, where possible, that the refugees stay close to Kosovo. Many of the refugees, where they have been interviewed, have indicated that they would like to stay close to Kosovo and that they would not like to cut their ties with Kosovo. In many instances I guess the process of choosing the 4,000 potential refugees in Australia would likely relate to whether or not those people feel that they have some interest in making that move—temporarily at least—or whether they might have families, connections or some interest in Australia.
I would like to think that the concept of the visibility of the problem in Kosovo should be uppermost in many people's minds and that we will not be part of a process to take the problem out of sight and out of mind. How 
 ever, given that the offer is there, if there are 4,000 people who choose to come to Australia and if the UNHCR suggests that this is the right and proper thing to do at that time, I would urge the government to treat those people as proper refugees. I would urge the government to enable the people from within those 4,000 to be able to argue their case if they know and they can prove that their circumstances will mean that, even if it might be safe for a broad category of refugees to return, it will be unsafe for them to return.
We know the kinds of circumstances that have occurred because we have seen them on our television screens. We know that the individual circumstances or the circumstances of villages or of other parts of that country are very traumatic. We know that if it is possible to solve the broad political problems, and my feelings are that there are probably broad political, historical and economic problems to deal with in an open way—going back to the source of the problems, dealing with them, trying to make peace and trying to deal with the resolution of conflict—there will still be problems within those countries which put people's lives at constant risk. I would like to think that people will not be forced to leave their temporary haven in Australia, and go back to where their lives will continue to be at risk as a result of that, simply because they are in a broad category and cannot be looked at according to their own circumstances as legitimate refugees.
I know that on many occasions in the past Senator Harradine has been very strong on these issues and I am not even in a position to know whether Senator Harradine has had a chance to see the proposals for my first or second amendments. I know that the government has indicated that it is not prepared to support the second amendment at this stage, but I would like to think that there is still a chance of getting approval on the second amendment and I would urge support from honourable senators on the issue of being able to deal with people by treating their cases on their merits without putting them at undue risk simply because they are in a category of 4,000. ",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I begin, as other speakers have begun so far, by saying that, as I understand it, everybody in the chamber agrees with the government's intention of helping people from Kosovo and that the government is to be congratulated on that. I also acknowledge the work that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Philip Ruddock, has done. He is a man with whom I have sat on committees over the years and who is clearly a person of compassion. So, as Senator Faulkner said on behalf of the opposition, we are behind the government's intentions to relieve the situation amongst the people fleeing from Kosovo—and that, I think, is a proper way to begin this speech. Senator Faulkner went on to say that the opposition has some problems with the legislation in its current terms, Senator Bartlett, on behalf of the Democrats, said the same thing and Senator Margetts has some problems with the legislation which should be looked at.
The  Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999  has been brought on at a time when non-controversial legislation is normally brought on. I am not sure that gives the right significance to this legislation. This is legislation that should be debated at length. We are presently debating the GST, which is of course vital legislation and which you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, would understand in all its ramifications more than most people not only here but generally, so you understand the importance of the debate about the goods and services tax and the new tax system. That deals with issues of money—how much money is going to be paid out and who is going to get that money; all very important stuff—but this legislation deals with people's lives, their futures and their ability to get away from an absolutely dreadful situation. I see Senator Schacht here. He will be speaking later on and I think he will say things about that. Senator Stott Despoja has told us of her experiences.
The message coming back is that this is a fearful and dreadful situation, a real horror in the true sense of the word. To debate this issue in the short term that is proposed seems 
 to, as I say, signify an importance or a weight that is insufficient. Certainly more time should be made available to debate these issues, and soon, because this is urgent legislation.
But even at a technical level there are some great issues raised by this bill. It anticipates in many ways a debate we are going to have later on about the extent to which there ought to be quality control exercised by the courts over the administration of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. This bill seeks to send the way in which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is administered back to the pre-Senator Ray days, if I can put it that way.
In the eighties—as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—the decision as to who did or did not come to Australia was left very much up to the minister. During the time that Senator Ray was minister, he began the process of saying, `There ought to be standards, there ought to be criteria, according to which people can come to Australia. If they meet that criteria they can come. If they do not meet that criteria they cannot come.'
People could see the criteria, could see the basis upon which decisions were made, could see that basis upon which people were brought here, could see the basis upon which people were refused. That made the whole system much better and much more open. It took a lot of pressure off the minister, who would otherwise have had to make the decision. I think that things worked very well.
There has been a tendency to go back to that system where the minister makes the decisions. If you look at this piece of legislation, there are clauses in it which clearly demonstrate what I am saying. I will go through them. In schedule 1 of the bill—in fact, there is only one schedule to this bill, as I remember it—proposed section 37A(5) says:
(5)	 The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (2) in respect of any non-citizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the non-citizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.
It is a clause that is directed straight at any ability of people to have a review of the way 
 they are to be treated. Clause 91H says the same sort of thing. Clause 91K is another. Clause 91L, subsection (2) says:
(2)	 The power under subsection (1) may only be exercised by the Minister personally.
That talks about an application that is made under that section. Subsection (6) of 91L says:
(6)	 The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under subsection (1) in respect of any non-citizen, whether he or she is requested to do so by the non-citizen or by any other person, or in any other circumstances.
So the whole thrust of this bill is to take away the ability of the courts to exercise that quality control which is their traditional function. Clause 10 says:
10	 Section 337 (at the end of the definition of  Part 5 reviewable decision )
Add ""but does not include a decision to refuse to grant, or to cancel, a temporary safe haven visa"".
It is quite clear that this bill wants to go away from the trend of the open exercise of migration affairs set under Senator Ray back to having the minister make all of the decisions. As I say, the minister is a person for whom I have great respect, who has a tradition of humanitarian concerns. But, nevertheless, it is not good to be going back to having him be the sole maker of decisions which affect the lives and the futures of people like those who are fleeing from Kosovo.
I just want to say something about the people who are fleeing from Kosovo. We think very much in terms of giving humanitarian aid. We think that the only benefit in us taking people from Kosovo is to them, that somehow we gain no benefit from it. I propose that the people most likely to help Australia are people like the refugees from Kosovo, people who are highly skilled, who have been forced to flee and who may be brought here.
I want to tell a little story. We were talking about this last night. It is about a young man—who I came to know when he was much older and I was much younger—who fled from Austria at the outbreak of the war. He was from the Jewish community and had to flee. It was proposed to him, `We will get 
 you out of there, but you've got to do something for us.' He said, `Yes, what is that?' He was told, `You have got to go down to a house and get some documents, because we think these documents are very important.' So he went down to the house and got these documents—and they were genuine documents, of course—and put them in a brown envelope. He translated the name of the person who had written these documents, and he put on the documents `A. Stone'. That was the translation of the person's name, which was Einstein.
Steve Strauss, who later became a judge of the Family  Court of Australia, had a very distinguished career. Steve has a great legal mind; he is now retired and is still doing great work. He probably was not as good at physics as Einstein, who had gone to America as had many people from Europe during the 1930s and since. Steve Strauss came here on the Dunera and was as good as the best of the people on the Dunera.
When we talk about people fleeing the situation in Kosovo, we are not simply talking about people whom we are going to help. They are people who well may come to help us. If we are going to do the right thing in the general moral and political sense, then we ought to make sure they come here as welcome visitors. The difficulty with this legislation is in its terms, which seem a bit mean because they say, `You can come for only a particular period of time. When you come here, we are going to put tremendous limits on the rights you might have as citizens of the world who are fleeing your country.'
This bill is consistent with the coalition's reaction to the Tiananmen Square issue. That is something we can all remember. When the tanks rolled in and broke up the student movement in Tiananmen Square, a lot of students were left here, and a lot of students fled to Australia. On the initiative of the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, they remained here. There was tremendous concern about the effect they might have on our migration program, but the people who came here have added to the quality of life in this country. They have jobs, they have taken initiatives which have helped this place, and they are 
 now of no concern to anybody. They have been a very helpful addition to our population. If this legislation is a reaction to Tiananmen Square and our initiatives after that, then it is a wrong reaction.
I have quoted two examples, but there are others. I remember the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, and next year we will have the Olympic Games here again. Mr Acting Deputy President, we perhaps are a couple of people in this chamber who can remember the 1956 games quite clearly. You will remember the famous water polo match between the Russians and the Hungarians, and how the Hungarians stayed on afterwards. Our sports program has gained greatly because of that. Franz Stampl I think came to Australia at that time. You could go through a list of people who have come from countries tortured by war and who have helped us magnificently.
Given that context, to welcome these people here as the government intends is a good thing and is to be much praised. To welcome them here under the conditions that are set out in this legislation taints—and I use that word advisedly—that great act of generosity and humanitarianism that we as Australians have exhibited by making this offer. This bill needs to go through the committee stages, and the Senate needs some time to examine it.
I am going to sit down now so that Senator McKiernan—a very eminent and learned senator in this area—can have some time to speak. I think it would be a blot on the Senate simply to put this bill through without a proper discussion on the basis that we have to get onto other matters which include the GST. As I said at the start, the GST is a most important bill, but when you think of our spirits, our souls, our milieu as Australians, we ought to be talking about this legislation pretty solidly and not pushing it through just now.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I thank my colleague Senator Cooney for giving me the opportunity to make a short contribution to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999 . It will be a short contribution because we are anxious to conclude the second reading debate at this time. 
 I wish I had more time for it. I am not so certain that what we are doing—hopefully, with the passage of this legislation—is what we ought to be doing to alleviate the dreadful situation that is apparent in Kosovo and in its neighbouring countries.
I, like earlier speakers, also have grave reservations about the temporary safe haven class of visa coming into existence in that it may be seen as a future remedy for other situations and other circumstances. I think that Australia is strong enough and wealthy enough at this time, and ought to be generous enough, to give 4,000 permanent positions to those people in Kosovo who need them.
Let us get things into some sort of perspective. The minister's second reading speech delivered in this place on the 21st of this month mentioned half a million refugees—500,000 people. Now the figure is up to something like three-quarters of a million people. If our proposals go through and we are providing some relief to some people, we will reduce that total of three-quarters of a million people to 746,000. I wonder if we could not do better in the circumstances. I wonder if Cabinet could not have done better when it made its decision on 6 April to allow 4,000 refugees to come to Australia and be granted temporary safe haven. I wonder if the earlier publicised position of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this issue might not have been the best way to continue—that is, rather than expend resources to provide relief for 4,000 people that those resources be given directly to the UNHCR and that safe haven be provided in a country somewhat closer to Kosovo. I wonder whether that would be a better situation and circumstance—perhaps it would; I do not know. But I do praise the minister, the government and the Prime Minister for at least doing what they are.
I have one other point that I want to make mention of, and I reiterate that there were many others that I wished to address that caused me grave concern in relation to the government's announcement. I quote directly from the minister's second reading speech. He said: 
In Australia, defence establishments have been prepared to receive displaced persons and a range of Federal and State agencies . . .
That caused me grave concern because I had visited a defence establishment which was looking after people who were claiming refugee status when the then government used the Curtin air base in Derby as a holding place for people who were claiming or purporting to claim refugee status. It may have been appropriate in those circumstances but certainly I do not think an establishment such as Curtin in Derby would be appropriate in the circumstances for Kosovan refugees. I do not claim to be an expert on Europe, but I have seen the TV reports—as everyone else has—and they are coming from an extremely cold climate. It is their springtime but there is a lot of snow, frost and ice around and Curtin in Western Australia may not be the appropriate place for them.
A military establishment might not be an appropriate place for persons who are traumatised in the way that these people have been. Bearing in mind that we are talking about only 4,000 people, it might be better if they were placed in a more integrated part of society. I am sure there are those in our community, including the church groups, who could handle that number of 4,000. Unfortunately I must conclude my remarks at this time in order that the second reading vote can be taken.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN VISAS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-04-29,"—I want to make some remarks about the Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999  but in view of the time I will make my remarks in the committee stage, briefly.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-04-29,"—Thank you. I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I realise that, as Senator Cooney said, it is difficult when there is a short time frame, but I think all honourable senators are aware of the importance of getting this bill through so that, if the UNHCR indicates that 
 it believes it is appropriate for us to take refugees under this Migration Legislation Amendment (Temporary Safe Haven Visas) Bill 1999 , we are ready to do so. I believe that, with the goodwill that has been expressed to me by honourable senators in this chamber, that is what we want to do.
I will not go into the detail of the bill. I believe that all of us are profoundly affected by the crisis in Kosovo and by the conditions that the refugees are in. I just want to say that, from the letters the minister has received and the ones to which I have responded, large numbers of people have offered support—from offers of accommodation in their homes to offers of practical support in terms of goods and services. If and when the refugees come we may be able to use those offers, but we may not be able to use them all. I think it shows the enormous goodwill that exists in this community towards people who are much less fortunate than we are and that it gives a great hope and pride in our fellow citizens. I think that is something that has come out of this terrible tragedy. I thank honourable senators, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-04-29,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Family and Community Services. It appears she is not here. I don't know whether there is a change in ministerial arrangements. I am happy to take advice. I seek your direction, Madam President.
—I will answer it.
—You could direct it to the Leader of the Government.
—It is a serious question and requires a serious answer. I 
 would prefer to ask it of Senator Newman, with all due respect to Senator Hill.
—I might give another senator the opportunity to ask a question. I call Senator Carr.
—That might be a better alternative, Madam President.
—Senator Newman has arrived. Madam President, I would prefer it if Senator Evans were to ask his question of the minister, who should be here on time.
—My question is directed to the Minister for Family and Community Services.
—Madam President, I take a point of order. Surely it is the height of discourtesy for Senator Evans to deliberately commence asking the question when he well knew that Senator Newman was some distance away from her seat. The very least he ought to be able do is to wait until she is ready or else defer to Senator Carr.
—There is no point of order.
—Madam President, on a further point of order: you would agree with me, no doubt, Madam President, in this point of order that it is the height of discourtesy for a minister to arrive two minutes late for the commencement of question time.
—I think it is time we commenced question time. It is two minutes late.
—Madam President, I just want an answer to my question. Can the minister confirm that on signing the Commonwealth-state disability agreement last year the Howard government gave a commitment to the states and territories that the critical issue of unmet need would be specifically addressed at a specially convened meeting within 12 months? Can the Minister further confirm that when she finally convened the 9 April ministers' meeting the Commonwealth failed to make any offer to the states or territories or provide any leadership in meeting the huge unmet demand for services for people with disabilities? Is the minister aware that all state ministers have 
 condemned her failure to offer any leadership and that WA Premier Richard Court has described the meeting as `a fiasco' and the Commonwealth's response as being `as bad as Commonwealth-state meetings get'?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-04-29,"—Madam President, I have a supplementary question. I accept that the minister has a very different view of the meeting than all the state ministers who were present. Can the minister explain why the meeting on 9 April did nothing more than endorse the unmet need identified in a report published in 1997? Why should people with disabilities regard this as progress? Can the minister explain to the thousands of needy Australians how long they will have to wait before she takes any positive action on their behalf?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,question
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-04-29,"—I must have guessed that Senator Evans wanted to ask me a question; I was running all the way to the chamber to hear it. I am sorry if I didn't run fast enough.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Evans clearly wants to hear the answer to this question and his colleagues should allow him to do so.
—I hope he does, Madam President. I did, I think from memory, address most of the issues that were in his question a week or two ago. I would direct him to the communique which was released by the federal, state and territory ministers after the ministerial council.
Senator Evans is right in saying that when the agreement was signed last year—I think from memory the last state signed in June last year—it was agreed that in the first 12 months of this agreement the Commonwealth minister `will convene a conference of ministers to specifically address this issue'. That is precisely what I did. So it was well within the 12 months. The second line in that agreement was that `ministers may subsequently agree on the contribution of additional funds for this purpose'.
I think in his question Senator Evans said that I made no offer. In fact, I told the states that the Commonwealth was prepared to put more money in to help meet unmet need. I asked them would they give that commitment. They said they were not prepared to give that commitment at this stage; they wanted to see the amount that the Commonwealth was prepared to put in. The wording of the agreement that Senator Evans referred to in his question that ministers may subsequently agree on the contribution of additional funds for this purpose will be met.
During the course of this year there will be another meeting of disability ministers at which I hope and trust we will all have 
 figures that we can negotiate between us. At the meeting referred to there was a general acceptance—it was endorsed in the communique—that there was a considerable degree of unmet need. We believe that the report that was given to us by the Institute of Health and Welfare that said it was something in the order of $300 million was probably about right to the best of anybody's knowledge and that that would be the sum that we would be working towards, together in partnership, to achieve better outcomes for people with disabilities.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,14,1,answer

The answer read as follows—
Senator Amanda Vanstone—on 22 April 1999 (Hansard Page 3586) Senator Woodley asked the following question of the Special Minister of State, Senator Ellison:
Is it true that the Commonwealth government is pressuring the Queensland government to accept some 250 amendments to its native title state regime legislation? What is the nature of the amendments which are being proposed? Is it true that the effect of these amendments will be to wind back the rights of indigenous people which have been achieved by the Queensland government in their recently passed legislation? Is this an attempt by the Commonwealth government to ensure that the inadequacy of the Commonwealth's Native Title Amendment Act is repeated in Queensland?
The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
No. The Commonwealth government is not pressuring the Queensland government to accept amendments to its native title state regime legislation.
The Native Title Act 1993  (NTA) as amended by the Native Title Amendment Act  1998 allows State and Territory governments to introduce their own alternative regimes to operate instead of the NTA right to negotiate provisions. This is designed to allow States and Territories to integrate native title procedures into their own land management systems provided the Commonwealth is satisfied that the criteria set out in the NTA are met. The determinations necessary to allow the State or Territory provisions to apply instead of the NTA are disallowable instruments.
A number of jurisdictions are working towards establishing such alternative native title procedures and some have introduced or passed relevant legislation. As would be expected following the recent comprehensive reform of the NTA, officials from my Department have had discussions with a number of jurisdictions in relation to the NTA criteria that must be met.
Following extensive discussions with Queensland officials, I am advised that they are considering a number of amendments to their native title provisions. However, Queensland officials have informed my Department that these amendments do not represent a change in policy; they relate to workability, compliance and technical drafting issues only.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Native Title: Queensland</title>,Miscellaneous,15,1,speech

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REFERENCES COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO PUBLIC DENTAL SERVICES
FEBRUARY 1999
Introduction
1.	 On 28 May 1998, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Inquiry into Public Dental Services released its report. The terms of reference for the inquiry covered:
.	 current and future dental needs of low income earners;
.	 the effect of the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program (CDHP);
.	 the nature of the Commonwealth's responsibility under the Australian Constitution to make laws for the provision of dental services; 

.	 the Commonwealth's role in setting and monitoring national goals for oral health in Australia; and
.	 options for reforming the delivery of public dental services.
2.	 The Committee made nine recommendations, some of which suggested some future Commonwealth involvement in aspects of public dental care, particularly through the Public Health Partnerships. Significantly, however, the Committee did not recommend the reintroduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program (CDHP) or some similar large scale funding intervention. The Coalition members of the Committee noted in their minority report that the recommendations appeared to be ""an expensive and ineffective method of tackling a problem which has traditionally been the responsibility of the States"". They were also reluctant for the Commonwealth ""to issue directives to the States, which should be free to deliver services in the manner they see fit"".
3.	 Notwithstanding the Committee's finding that some low income earners currently have difficulty accessing public dental services, the Government's position continues to be that the provision of public dental services is a State responsibility and that the States must resolve the structural, management and financial problems in their dental services. Unfortunately, the advantages gained by the CDHP in reducing waiting times and improving access were largely offset by the unwillingness of the States to use the time to enhance their public dental services, despite knowing that there was no guarantee that the CDHP would be extended. To its credit, Queensland accepted its responsibility when the CDHP was wound up and provided additional funding to maintain services. The fact that the access problems in some States are not evident in Queensland shows the problems are not as intractable as suggested in the report. Nor, by implication, is it necessary for the Commonwealth to intervene yet again in what is essentially a State matter. The Government also notes that the Committee concluded that while the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to provide or regulate dental services it can exercise that power at its own discretion.
4.	 With the introduction of the GST, States will be better off than they would be under existing Commonwealth/State financial arrangements. The additional revenue that will accrue to the States through the GST will be at the disposal of the States to augment the range of health services available to the public, including public dental services. It is the Government's intention to allow States to determine their own priorities in the level of public dental services they provide within their jurisdictions, as they traditionally have done. 

5.	 The Government's overall response to the recommendations of the report is that by and large, Commonwealth involvement in their implementation would be ineffective. The States must take up those recommendations they consider will improve access and service delivery. For its part the Commonwealth is prepared to assist the States to deliver better services by facilitating the inclusion of reliable oral health data in the National Public Health Information Development Plan, if this is what the States want.
6.	 The Government provides the following specific responses to the recommendations presented in the Senate Committee's report.
Recommendation 1: That the Commonwealth, in consultation with the States and Territories and other key stakeholders in the public and private dental sectors, support the development of programs to improve the promotion of oral health throughout Australia.
7.	 Under the National Public Health Partnership Memorandum of Understanding, to which all Australian Health Ministers are signatories, State and Territories are responsible for the provision of health promotion services to meet the needs of their respective populations. If a jurisdiction determines that oral health promotion is a high priority, it is able to develop specific programs within the context of the full range of health promotion services offered within the State. Oral health has not been established by Australian Health Ministers as a National Health Priority Area, which is the precursor to planning for coordinated national action to achieve agreed national targets and performance measures.
Recommendation 2: That the Commonwealth Government support the introduction of a vocational training program for new dental graduates, especially to assist in the delivery of oral health services to people in rural or remote areas. 
8.	 The Government supports the implementation of a vocational training program and notes that given each State's responsibility to maintain an adequate workforce in the public health sector, it is a State responsibility to cover the cost of establishing or maintaining such a program.
9.	 At the same time, the Commonwealth does provide some support for essential infrastructure in the form of multi-purpose service centres that are available to underpin the provision of oral health services to people in rural and remote areas, should States decide to invest in these services as a priority. Also Government's University Department of Rural Health Program has the potential to assist in the delivery of oral health services to people in rural and remote areas. The establishment of a university department at Whyalla in South Australia 
 provides an example of where the Government's 1996 initiative has established appropriate infrastructure in the nearby city of Port Augusta for a viable dental service. With the cooperation of the university sector, the model established at Port Augusta could be introduced in other rural areas of Australia where there are university departments of rural health: that is, Broken Hill, Mount Isa, Shepparton, Launceston, Geraldton and Alice Springs.
10.	 Some Aboriginal Medical Services have infrastructure in place which can be used to support dental graduates undertaking vocational training supported by the States. The use of facilities in these services by dental graduates undertaking training will not only provide excellent learning opportunities but will benefit the communities by providing a minimum level of service. Appropriate supervision arrangements for dental graduates would need to be a key element of the vocational training provided in these areas.
11.	 The Government notes from the Senate report that a working party with primary interests in the operation of a vocational training program for dental graduates is examining this matter and that the States and Territories will consider the report of the working party when it becomes available. The Senate report does, however, point to the difficulties of the proposal such as supervision of trainees in remote areas and the estimated cost; issues that will need to be considered by any authority adopting the proposal.
Recommendation 3: That the use of dental auxiliaries such as therapists and hygienists be expanded, particularly to cater for the needs of specific disadvantaged groups and that, to this end, the States and Territories be encouraged to review legislation restricting the employment of such auxiliaries.
12.	 The Government supports this recommendation. As State legislation limits the employment of dental therapists to the public sector and its provider agencies, the report has highlighted a need to examine and amend relevant State legislation, both in regard to where therapists can be employed and the age limitations of the client population they can treat.
13.	 The specific dental workforce requirements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the community sector will need to be addressed in any legislative changes made by the State/ Territories. These needs can be identified within the context of the Framework agreements for indigenous health between the Commonwealth, the State/Territories and the community sector where regional planning processes are being established. A National Health Workforce Modelling Project underway will also be assessing overall workforce requirements in this area.  

14.	 This recommendation appears to have the support of the key players in the provision of dental services and now requires adoption by States and Territories.
Recommendation 4: That support be given to a national oral health training strategy for health workers and carers, specifically including those working in the fields of aged care and Aboriginal health.
13.	 The intention of the above recommendation in promoting nationally consistent oral health training is supported. Should the States choose to develop national strategies through a forum such as the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, the Commonwealth would be supportive.
14.	 The Government recognises the special needs of older people with regard to dental health. The Standards and Guidelines for Residential Aged Care Services state that residents' oral and dental health should be maintained though ensuring that regular assessment, treatment and access to appropriate dental services occurs. Workers in the residential aged care sector have a responsibility to understand that oral health has a major influence on residents' quality of life. The guidelines suggest that staff education should address oral and dental care, including strategies for residents with dementia and challenging behaviour. While the Government encourages the pursuit of best practice in all facets of residential aged care, by both service providers and professional associations, it prefers not to be prescriptive in its approach as to how this can be achieved. However, oral health training strategies could be incorporated into existing education programs for carers of the aged, or where necessary, programs could be implemented.
15.	 It is important to consider oral health training, particularly training in prevention, in the context of the overall health needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Programs in oral health can be introduced into health worker training as part of the overall primary health care approach. A review of health worker training is currently underway and will be considering a range of issues including gaps in training delivery. Oral health care training can be taken into account as part of the review process.
Recommendation 5:  That the Commonwealth Government assist the States and Territories to establish, conduct and evaluate highly targeted pilot programs to address the priority oral health needs of the following specific disadvantaged groups:  pre school-age children (1 to 5 years), young adult Health Card holders (18 to 25 years), aged adult Health Card holders (65+ years), the home bound, rural and remote communities, and indigenous Australians. Such programs should include a capacity for the individual beneficiary to make a contribution to the treatment costs. 

16.	 The evaluation of highly targeted pilot programs to address priority oral health needs is highly desirable if the needs of specific disadvantaged groups are to be addressed. Under the former CDHP the Commonwealth funded several demonstration projects with the aim of evaluating strategies for improving service delivery in rural and remote areas, including services for indigenous people.  The evaluations provided some useful models of service delivery which States have incorporated into their public dental health care programs. At this stage it is up to the States to pilot programs for any other disadvantaged groups within their jurisdictions that they consider require special attention.
Recommendation 6: That the Commonwealth Government adopt a leadership role in introducing a national oral health policy, and give consideration to the possibility of using the National Public Health Partnership as the vehicle for developing and implementing that policy in partnership with the States and Territories. 
17.	 The National Public Health Partnership is a working arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to strengthen the national public health infrastructure and response capacity. Its focus is on public health; that is, disease and injury prevention and control, and health promotion. It does not have a mandate in policies and programs for the treatment, management and care of diseases and illnesses once they have occurred. Recommendations 6 and 7 clearly envisage a national oral health policy, which has a ""whole of system"" approach; that is, there is an emphasis on access to treatment services, quality and service targets in addition to prevention and promotion. Nevertheless, the National Public Health Partnership, in considering national public health information requirements, is including information about oral health status and service utilisation in its deliberations. This work should, in the longer term, enhance population health outcomes in the States and Territories.
18.	 In addition, the Commonwealth funds the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to support the Dental Statistics and Research Unit to collect and analyse data and report on adult access to dental care and adult oral care.

Recommendation 7: That the national oral health policy include the:
.	 Setting of national oral health goals;
.	 establishment of national standards for the provision of, and access to, oral health care and the quality of services;
.	establishment of national strategies and priorities for oral health care reform, with an emphasis on preventive dentistry; 

.	 setting of minimum service targets; and
.	 monitoring national oral health goals through  the maintenance of a national data collection and evaluation centre and undertaking research into current and projected needs.
19.	 This recommendation is partially supported by the Government, in so far as the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (funded by the Health portfolio) will continue to maintain its data collection, including dental statistics, for the foreseeable future.  This data will provide basic information for States' use in planning, policy formulation and evaluation.
20.	 At present the Commonwealth is unaware of any evidence for declaring oral health a National Health Priority Area, which would be the necessary first step for national policy development, encompassing a ""whole of health system"" approach, the negotiation of goals and targets, service benchmarks, national monitoring and reporting processes.
21.	 Nevertheless, the Commonwealth will table recommendations six and seven in the National Public Health Partnership forum to ensure adequate consideration of their public health aspects. Those aspects of the recommendations that relate to treatment as opposed to prevention and promotional activities would need to be separately considered by States and Territories as they are outside the domain of public health and are not the business of the National Public Health Partnership.
Recommendation 8: That the Commonwealth allocate resources for a national oral health survey, to be conducted as a priority, to establish data on the oral health status and oral health needs of the Australian community. 
22.	 The Commonwealth supports the collection of data on the oral health status and oral health needs of the Australian community. To this end the Commonwealth funds the Dental Statistics Research Unit of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.
23.	 Good baseline data on oral health is important and the Commonwealth is actively trying to include the collection of such information in the National Public Health Information Development Plan now being finalised as part of the work of the National Public Health Information Working Group.
Recommendation 9:  That the Commonwealth Department of Health and Family Services create a dedicated section or appoint an appropriately qualified senior officer with responsibility for oral health matters, and that the necessary resources to fulfil the role and responsibilities of such an office be provided.
24.	 This recommendation is not supported by the Government. The level of Commonwealth involvement in dental health is appropriate given that the 
 planning, funding and delivery of public dental services are State responsibilities. Policy matters across States are properly raised in the Health Ministers' forum. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) convenes specialist working parties when necessary to consider specific dental issues such as fluoridation of water supplies and amalgam and mercury use in dentistry.

17.	 The National Public Health Partnership is a working arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to strengthen the national public health infrastructure and response capacity. Its focus is on public health; that is, disease and injury prevention and control, and health promotion. It does not have a mandate in policies and programs for the treatment, management and care of diseases and illnesses once they have occurred.

.	establishment of national strategies and priorities for oral health care reform, with an emphasis on preventive dentistry; 

.	 setting of minimum service targets; and
.	 monitoring national oral health goals through  the maintenance of a national data collection and evaluation centre and undertaking research into current and projected needs.

—The Community Affairs References Committee tabled its report on the inquiry into the CJD settlement offer on 1 October 1997. The government responded on 31 March 1998 accepting all but two of the committee's recommendations. In accordance with recommendation 18, Professor Margaret Allars reviewed certain information on scientific matters that became available during the committee's inquiry. Following the completion of this review, the then Minister for Health and Family Services forwarded to the committee in August 1998 a copy of Professor Allars' report for the committee's information.
Drs Howes, Peters and Whitten, who had appeared as witnesses before the committee's original inquiry, were concerned about comments about themselves in the Allars report. The committee subsequently received detailed responses from each of the doctors to comments in the Allars report. The committee has agreed that, to resolve this matter, it would table for the information of senators the Allars report, the doctors' responses and an opinion 
 from the Clerk of the Senate relating to the status of the Allars report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,20,1,speech

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-04-29,"—Madam Deputy President, I seek leave to make a statement in relation to a question asked of me by Senator Schacht at question time.
Leave granted.
—During question time today, Senator Schacht asked me whether I had instructed ATSIC to remove from the ATSIC web site an assessment of the effects of the GST package on indigenous communities. I answered that I had not. I wish to reaffirm that I have not instructed ATSIC to remove any assessment of the effects of the GST package on indigenous communities from their web site over the term of this parliament. Naturally, I assumed that Senator Schacht's question related to this parliament and the current debate.
However, during the course of the campaign prior to the last election, ATSIC had on their web site an assessment of the effects of the GST package on indigenous communities. I considered that material to be highly political and, therefore, in breach of the guidelines relating to material that departments can have on their web sites during the caretaker period. The guidelines make it clear that material of a political nature must not be placed on departmental or ministerial web sites during a campaign. Naturally, I asked ATSIC to remove the material, as I considered it to be in breach of the caretaker guidelines.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Aboriginal Communities</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-04-29,"—I briefly want to speak to the motion to take note of the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on legislation that the government has before the Senate. The Senate is aware that at the moment there is a great deal of concern in the community about this legislation.
I want to reiterate that, if the change to the laws proceeds, we will have environmental powerlessness at a national level unseen since before 1972 when Lake Pedder in Tasmania was flooded. At that time the then incoming Prime Minister said that he did not have the constitutional powers to do anything about it although it was against the national interest that such a national heirloom and national park should be flooded for a hydro-electric scheme to produce one-tenth the output of a large mainland power station.
If this legislation proceeds we are going to be back in a situation where the federal government gives up its powers to intervene to protect this nation's heritage heirlooms, particularly where they do not have world heritage protection. It is not going to be possible, for example, for a federal minister or Prime Minister to nominate a place in Australia for world heritage listing as required under the provisions of the World Heritage Convention without the assent of the relevant state government, and that means the relevant state premier. So we are going to be in the position where the protection of Australia's heritage is going to be at the whim of a Robin Gray or a Joh Bjelke-Petersen or even a Richard Court or the current Tasmanian Premier, Jim Bacon.
Under the provisions of this legislation the Franklin River would have been flooded because the federal government would have been powerless. Under the provisions of this legislation the Daintree rainforest would have been chainsawed down instead of being proclaimed a world heritage area. Under the provisions of this legislation we would not have seen the protection of the Lemonthyme and southern forests of Tasmania. Under the provisions of this legislation we are basically disempowering the federal government. The 
 federal government is basically disempowering itself of responsibility.
This is at a time when the federal government and indeed the Labor opposition are moving to dismantle state powers in order to improve the reach of the corporate sector and make it easier for investment into and out of Australia, to get rid of barriers to trade and commerce. At this time it is disempowering itself in its vital need to protect the nation's environment.
I might add, it is disempowering itself to be able to act properly to tackle international problems like global warming because the state governments are basically going to be able to obfuscate any federal move to adequately deal with the problem of global warming at a national level.
It is rotten legislation. It is a throwback. It has obviously come about from the pressure of the corporate sector—not least the resource extraction industries, such as the woodchip, the mining and the fisheries industries. The input to the committee and the reports from the committee underline the alarm there is about this, in particular amongst the non-government organisations who are fighting for the environment in this country.
I have no confidence whatsoever that we are going to see future federal governments use their corporations powers to intervene to prevent maverick corporations from doing the wrong thing by the environment. Prime Minister Bob Hawke briefly entertained that idea back in the mid-1980s but was very quickly disavowed of it through pressure from the corporate sector. We are seeing here a dismantling of environmental powers at the federal level at just the time when they are required because of the raised environmental sensitivity of Australians and because of Australia's obligations to the international community. So it is a matter of extreme importance that the public be made aware that the environment is being let down by the government and in particular by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill, who has brought this legislation into this place.
It is remarkable that under the Westminster system, where the minister for the environ 
 ment ought to be going into cabinet advocating for environmental powers to meet the aspirations of Australians in this age, he is actually going into cabinet with a document to do away with his own powers and replace them with much lesser powers so that the corporate sector will not have to worry about the environment or the impact of federal intervention because of pressure from the Australian people. It is a matter that needs a great deal of public canvassing. Most of the Australian public are unaware that the minister for the environment, presumably at the behest of the Prime Minister and certainly of the cabinet of this government, is basically handing across environmental powers to the corporate sector. The corporate sector is well aware that they can much more easily—through their sheer wealth, lobbying power, access to legal power and so on—sway state governments than they can sway federal governments having to abide by federal laws. The outcome is a disastrous one for the environment.
The Australian Greens, along with environmental groups, are fighting hard to oppose this legislation. We are concerned to see that when it comes into this Senate, it gets a very thorough going through indeed. The Greens are preparing amendments to legislation which should not be here in the first place. We are going to do the job of the minister for the environment for him. He obviously cannot act on behalf of the environment. He obviously does not act on behalf of the environment. He obviously is selling out his portfolio obligations for the environment in cabinet. He would not have this legislation before the Senate were he a responsible advocate for the environment. We are obviously going to have to do his job for him.
The problem for us is that most Australians do not know that this insidious and disempowering legislation—which so threatens the Australian environment—is before this place. It is about to come on for debate at any time once the GST legislation goes through or other priorities, such as the budget, are finished. In fact, the minister for the environment has seen that this is No. 3 on the list of 27 or so bills we are to deal with between 
 now and June. I have no doubt that he has looked at the numbers and believes that he can get the support of Senator Harradine and Senator Colston to get this legislation through before 30 June. He knows that he would have no chance of getting it through afterwards. He is going to get a fight. It is going to be a long debate. This legislation is going to be dissected piece by piece, clause by clause, subclause by subclause, when it comes into this Senate. It is far too important to be dismissed.
The input to this committee shows how important it is to the people of Australia and their representatives, although it may not be given high priority by the government of the day. I do not know how strongly the Labor opposition, or indeed the Democrats, are going to fight against this or whether they are simply reduced to trying to amend it. The legislation is inherently wrong and should be opposed. That is what we will be doing when it comes before this place—with this report under our arms, because it reflects the fears and the anguish of environmentalists right around the country about this particularly bad piece of legislation.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,24,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1999-04-29,"—Yesterday the Senate witnessed an extraordinary display from one of this chamber's most respected political strategists and ministerial performers under Labor. It is a very sad thing to see a senator with such a capacity for positive contribution come into this chamber and indulge in an unworthy character assassination of political 
 opponents. Not only did his actions diminish those he specifically targeted; they diminished all of us.
Senator Ray's own reputation has suffered. I have frequently considered that his move to the back bench was too soon. I think back a couple of years ago to those heady days when Labor ministers could actually hold their own in this chamber. There was Button, Walsh, Evans, Richardson and Ray. They were Labor's powerful and strong leaders, and they commanded a government and their party.
But what we see today is a ramshackle frontbench and a backbench resorting to dirt files, because they are leaderless, rudderless and policyless. I thought it was a waste of time to have Senator Ray sitting on the back bench with all of that talent. Now I am going to revise that assessment. It has been known, of course, that after a period of glory as a minister senators and members return to opposition and become embittered. We have all seen that on both sides—angry, grumpy old men who cannot let go and have to be continually negative. That should not happen to such a person as Senator Ray, and I find it sad and regrettable.
But what have these attacks on the National Party achieved? They have set in train, inevitably, a series of counterattacks. It has been revealed by senators on this side of the chamber that Labor ministers did exactly the same sorts of things as did National Party ministers, because the guidelines have not changed. Already, senators who have suffered in the past from these kinds of attacks have been brought into this episode as well. Will we not ever learn? What has been achieved but a further battering of the image of parliamentarians? The price is very high, and the reward is short-term political gain that will inevitably rebound. The public react to the headlines one day and then do not get to read the real facts a week later which show that there was nothing sinister after all.
Just a couple of nights ago a person rang me up, and I understand that he also rang Senator Gibbs. The call was quite threatening in nature, and the caller was clearly under the impression that we were all a bunch of so-and-sos. There will always be some who 
 abuse the system, and a need to improve accountability is there. But I firmly reject that all too prevalent view that we are all here to sit around and do nothing but waste the taxpayers' money. I never thought that of Senator Ray, and I hope Senator Ray does not think that of me either. But I say to Senator Ray, `Your actions are only helping to foster that general perception out in the wider community. Your actions only serve to help radical groups like One Nation get into parliament.' These kinds of attacks simply reinforce the prejudices which get the David Oldfields of this world elected. By all means, expose the bad and the ugly where it can reasonably be said to exist, but do not be selective. Make sure it is really there, and that the facts live up to your own subjective assessment. Senator Ray did not follow the unwritten rule in this place that when you are about to be highly critical of someone you at least have the courtesy to let them know, as I have with Senator Ray tonight.
—There weren't any senators involved.
—But you could have rung their offices.
—They are in the Reps. They can't sit here.
—They cannot sit here, but they can turn on the television and listen. I have contacted two of the three ministers' offices involved, and they say that there was no such contact. So there was no way that they could defend themselves, as they had the right to do, or have me come in and defend them.
There is also the curious feature of this attack, that it is aimed fairly and squarely at the National Party. I really would like to know why that is. Senator Ray told the Senate yesterday that it was because previous experience has told us that they are the ones who get their snouts in the trough, first up and the biggest. What previous experience? That is simply highly offensive nonsense that says more about the speaker than it does about the subject.
There are pages of material which show how Labor ministers did exactly the same 
 thing. It presumably was not wrong then, so why is it being painted as some kind of heinous sin now? Ministers are entitled now, as then, to cover the cost of expenses incurred providing hospitality on appropriate occasions in the course of official business. Ministers do not have credit cards or accounts, and the department determines legitimate expenditure in accordance with Labor's guidelines. Labor ministers claimed expenses for taking out ACTU members, CPSU members, John Laws, media representatives, peak industry groups and official and departmental staff at restaurants around the country. I have got the documents, but I am not going to name them.
—You can't name me, Ron.
—I cannot name you, and I am not intending to name you. But when I say `ACTU' it would be the same as the National Party taking out their electorate council.
—We didn't criticise you for taking out business leaders.
—But what I am saying is: if you criticise us, take the plank out of your own eye. There were even claims for events hosted by a minister's staff but not attended at all by any ministers. What does Senator Ray say to that? He would say a lot if it was the National Party but he said nothing of his own side. It is the nature of this place that when you are attacked you have got to fight back or you will be considered a soft target the next time. But it is a pandora's box that gets opened and all sorts of people get hurt, as we have seen. I am not going to name the people that we have information on. I do not think it warrants it. I do not think they did anything particularly wrong. I think the ACTU thing was a bit off. But, for goodness sake, let us bury this now. If there are any capital offences, present them, but do not put one side against the other side when they both do the same things. I consider taking someone out to lunch is not a heinous offence.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Ministerial Expenses</title>,Adjournment,26,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-04-29," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 3 December 1998:
(1) On how many occasions did the department pay for dinners or functions, both in restaurants and elsewhere, attended by the Minister, not including those paid for and approved by the Ceremonial and Hospitality Unit of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet prior to October 3 1998.
(2) In each instance: (a) when did the dinner or function take place; (b) what was the purpose of the dinner or function; (c) who were the attendees for each dinner or function; (d) what was the cost of the dinner or function; and (e) what was the venue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Trade: Cost of Functions and Dinners</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,28,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-04-29,"—The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) The Department met the costs of 47 functions hosted by the Minister as detailed in the attached table. The information provided covers functions which Mr Fischer hosted in Australia and where the Department met the full cost or a substantial portion of the cost of the function. It does not include functions which Mr Fischer attended as a guest only nor does it include functions attended by the Minister while overseas since that information is not readily available in consolidated form and could only be obtained at significant cost.
The attached table reflects the demanding trade agenda with which Mr Fischer has had to deal since 1996, and the extensive representations necessary to protect and promote Australia's trade interests. This includes hosting key international meetings such as the Cairns Group of agricultural traders of which Australia is the chair, which are critically important to our trade and economic interests.
