"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-10-15,"—We were not aware that the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003 was being put on this morning.
—Are you seeking leave to make a personal statement?
—No, I am talking on the bill, Senator Lightfoot. Before I get to the substantive issue of the bill, I would like to make a point with respect to the management of the chamber. The opposition were not advised that this bill was coming on first thing this morning. We were advised that we were going to be dealing with superannuation. If this is the way the government wants to run this chamber, that is fine, but I do not regard it as an appropriate way to behave. We were told that superannuation was coming on first thing, and Senator Sherry was here. I do not blame the duty minister. Senator Coonan was clearly given instruction to bring on Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003. I do not know quite what this means, but I think it does mean that the government is in a mess on superannuation. Clearly it is not ready—
—I do not think this is amusing. These are chamber management issues. My point is that, if that is the way the Senate is going to run, that is the way the Senate is going to run. I do not think it is a very good signal for the rest of the year, particularly when the government wants cooperation with respect to its legislation program. At the moment we have very few bills, and that is an issue that I think people ought to be aware of. Recently the government gave notice of a motion to exempt eight bills from the cut-off because of its lack of legislation. We have a hole in the legislation program and now we have this issue occurring today whereby the government brings on a bill with no notice given to the opposition, and our shadow minister is not here at the moment. This will be taken up, and I do not think it is an appropriate way to behave. We were expecting the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003 to come on. Everybody is here ready to do superannuation. Just because the government cannot get its act together with respect to this set of bills does not mean it should display this level of discourtesy to the other parties in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to talk about the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003. What I actually would like to talk about is the lack of communication from the government with respect to their legislative program. It seems to be that the communication in this chamber has broken down from the government's side. Communication is integral to ensure that this place operates in a smooth and efficient way. The government can help to ensure that this place operates in an efficient way. The government have today demonstrated their lack of communication, which has caused both the opposition whip and now me to talk about communication. We can talk about communication for a long time, but we are a cooperative opposition. We really would expect the government to get in order, to be able to inform us with reasonable opportunity which bill is going to come on in this place. 
What I think, in truth, is that this government does not have a legislative program and does not have a bill to debate properly in this house. This government is getting legislation out of its back pocket so that we can talk about it today. The communication bill has been drawn out of its back pocket and thrown on the table. I have just been told that the government was told at 9.26 a.m. today that in fact it was not going to bring on for debate the three bills that were listed on the red—that is, the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003, the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Bill 2003 and the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003. Instead it found a fourth bill, the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003, in its back pocket to talk about today in the resumption of the second reading debate.
It appears, and I have thought it all along, that in terms of communication this government has been unable or unwilling to talk about its legislation in this chamber. We find either one of two things. Either the government is incompetent and cannot manage its program—and I am happy for the government to admit to that—especially in relation to communication legislation or it does not have sufficient bills in this house to talk about. As a consequence, if there is a slight hiccup in the program then we get a very late change or an amendment which affects our ability to deal appropriately with the legislation.
We are fortunate that we do have available this morning the relevant people, as I understand it, to talk on the communications legislation bill. I am not sure whether the government has the relevant people here to talk on the communications bill. Is Senator Coonan, the minister in the chamber, going to talk on the communications bill? If the minister who is going to talk on this bill is not in the chamber then perhaps they should be, to at least explain why it is necessary to bring on the bill for debate now. The opposition would like to have the opportunity to understand why this bill is being brought on now. I understand that there were a number of issues relating to the superannuation bill that needed to be dealt with.
—If you sit down and stop raving, I'll tell you.
—I will take that interjection, because I am not raving. If you want me to take up time then I will.
—You're asking for an explanation and I'm willing to give it.
—In respect of your comments, you are exciting the opposition to say that this is an abomination and mismanagement. If you want to admit to the mismanagement then I am happy for you to stand up and say, `I'm mismanaging this chamber on behalf of the government.' If that is what you want to do then that is what you should do, rather than accusing us of raving. It is unacceptable in this chamber to bring in legislation and change it when you have a red. The chamber has to work efficiently and effectively, and we are happy to manage it with you and cooperate with you in respect of this program. But if you are going to act like this then there will not be any cooperation at all and we will see how this chamber works then.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-10-15,"—by leave—The indignation of the opposition would be entirely warranted were it not for the fact that at 9.26 a.m. the government received a request for a rearrangement of the business, and I was given the message as I was literally rising to my feet. The request for rearrangement came from the Democrats, not from the government. Obviously the government endeavours to accommodate all of its colleagues in the chamber. It is certainly not the way in which the government normally runs its business and it is certainly not the way in which the whips normally run the business. Unfortunately, as I understand it, this was not raised by the Democrats at the whips meeting, which would have been the ordinary course by which to alert the government, the opposition and indeed all parties to the need to rearrange the business. Had it been done then, I would have thought that, in the cooperative way in which the chamber normally runs, to assist everyone who needs to speak in the chamber and to run the agenda in an orderly way, we would have had an agreement that it be done so.
The government very much regrets that this request came in a way that simply did not provide an opportunity, with the bells already ringing, to properly alert the opposition and all other honourable senators to the need to rearrange the business. I did want to take the opportunity—and I thank the Senate for its indulgence—to provide a point of clarification. It was certainly not an intended discourtesy on the part of the government. It is not the way in which the government either desires to, or would normally, run its business. It was unavoidable and, in the circumstances, reasonable to give the Democrats an opportunity, but it certainly is not appropriate to blame the government for this last-minute request. I do not think that anything is served by me continuing to make remarks or respond in kind to Senator Ludwig. I am sure he would not have made the remarks he did had he been aware of the explanation that I have now given and the clarification as to how this has been approached.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-15,"—by leave—I would like to respond to that explanation with a short statement of my own. The problem is not with Senator Lundy here; it is with the Democrats. It is about the superannuation legislation. Despite knowing for days that this was coming up, our dilemma is about continuing with the package that the government and the Democrats have worked out to cut superannuation tax rates for rich people and have co-payments for some poorer people. But there has also been a breakthrough with the Labor Party coming on board to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and dependent partners in most of the areas of superannuation.
This is breakthrough legislation for the nation. The House of Representatives, that is the government, has rejected that amendment to get rid of discrimination in superannuation and I have no doubt that is causing a great deal of heartache with the Democrats. But I just want to take this opportunity, because the decision obviously has not been made, to say that the Democrats must stand firm and united on that. An artificial split is a cave-in. The party as a whole must stand firm. They have been champions in getting rid of discrimination in superannuation. The moment is there now. The Labor Party has come on board and the Democrats must stand firm on that. Then the government has to take the pain of considering what it is going to do. I would advise the Democrats strongly not to take the pain themselves.
—Why don't you join the Democrats if you want to run with them? If you want to run with the Democrats, take out an application. They are quite capable of thinking for themselves. 
—You will see from Senator Boswell's outburst there exactly what I mean: transfer the difficulty of making this decision of imposing and continuing discrimination onto the government. Listen to them go to town over this. The Democrats will come out of this very strongly if they do that. That is my advice; that is my injunction; that is the best way to go.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-15,"—by leave—For the last three days my office and the Labor opposition had been informed that the three messages relating to the superannuation bills were to be considered this morning first thing. Senator Coonan has now given an explanation as to why we are not dealing with the three superannuation messages. She did not give an explanation when she moved to rearrange the business initially. It would have helped the chamber, I think, if she had explained why the government has had to seek a rearrangement of the legislative program at such short notice so that we can now deal with Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003. We now have the explanation but it would have been better if it had been given when the motion was moved. That in itself, given the very short notice, would have been satisfactory. 
It is not just the Labor opposition that has to be considered here. There are other senators to be considered. We know the position of the Democrats—they are in an absolute mess at the moment. They cannot even meet in the same room on the same-sex couples superannuation bills. That is the guts of the problem they have got. But there are other senators in this chamber. There is Senator Murphy, there is Senator Harradine, there is Senator Brown and there is Senator Harris. There are other senators who are not members of the Australian Democrats or the Labor opposition.
—And Senator Lees.
—Senator Lees, that is right—I forget what her party is called. I think it is a gross discourtesy to other senators in the chamber who were expecting the three surcharge bills and the attached messages to be dealt with. It is a gross discourtesy to them because the three messages relating to the superannuation bills are of interest and they may have a crucial say in the success of amendments that will be considered as part of the message. They may have a crucial say and they quite rightly deserve consideration in terms of notice given the crucial nature of the three bills we are to consider. I do not think it is reasonable. 
Obviously, the government traditionally in this chamber lays out its program for the day, albeit it is at very short notice. I do not think it is reasonable though when the government has known for some time that the Australian Democrats are in a mess on the issue of same-sex couples and the superannuation bills we are to consider. As I understand it, the mess has got worse as the days have gone on. The minister well knows that the entire package that will be considered in the three messages could go down if the Australian Democrats are not clear in their position and are not going to vote for the government's package, as they have indicated apparently in writing.
The Labor opposition is ready and willing to deal with the business that we were told would be dealt with first. Apparently, that is not to be the case. An explanation should have been given when the business was re-ordered; it was not, but that explanation has now been given by Senator Coonan. But at the fundamental heart of all of this are the problems that the Democrats have got. They are huddled in meetings trying to work out how to deal with the messages relating to the superannuation bills. But Labor stands ready. Labor will also be standing firm on its position in respect of the bills and the messages that I have enunciated on previous occasions.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-15,"—by leave—I just want to indicate that the Democrats are prepared to handle the superannuation bills this morning for the good, orderly management of the business of the Senate. I do apologise that a request was made that these bills be put off for a short time and that we deal with other legislation in the meantime. Senator Sherry of course takes this opportunity to suggest that we are in a mess and cannot even meet in the same room. All of that is rubbish. The situation is that we expected last night to have a response from the government on an issue that we had raised with them. That response was not forthcoming. We expected it to be forthcoming early this morning, and it was not. We would like to get some clarification from the government as to what that response might be and when it might be coming. We are quite happy to deal with these bills and I reject the nonsense that the Labor Party has just gone on with. I am sure that the Senate's time will be usefully spent on the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003 and perhaps even one other until the response from the government that I indicated is available to us.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I do have a few comments to make that are pertinent to the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003 on behalf of the opposition. The bill makes minor amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and the Telecommunications Act 1997 in relation to solus and two-service regional television markets, datacasting transmission, digital broadcasting, implementation plans of the national public broadcasters and penalties payable for certain offences under the Telecommunications Act. 
With regard to solus television markets, this is a minor technical amendment which helps ensure regional broadcasters in solus commercial television markets can flexibly meet options to increase their programming output, including analog and digital simulcasts through multichannelling. This helps facilitate viewers receiving more services in solus television markets.
With regard to two-service television markets, this section amends the BSA to facilitate the earlier potential availability of new commercial television services in regional two-service television markets. The transmission of datacasting service provisions of the bill amend restrictions on the commencement dates of commercial and national public broadcaster datacasting services. These provisions, which were designed to afford some protection to non-television datacasters, are no longer needed as the government is no longer allocating datacasting licences due to its failed datacasting policy, a matter that some three years ago I foreshadowed would occur. Removing these restrictions will ensure that the provision of any datacasting services by regional broadcasters is not slowed.
There is an amendment dealing with the requirement for variations to approved implementation plans. The national television broadcasters, the ABC and SBS, are obliged to present implementation plans to the minister on their conversion over time from analog to digital television. Variations to plans are also approved by the minister. To date, around 600 services requiring conversion and variations have been put forward. The amendments therefore delegate approval of variations to the digital implementation plans of the national broadcasters to the secretary or senior officers of the department, and these are sensible amendments. 
With regard to penalties payable instead of prosecution, this section amends the Telecommunications Act with regard to offences dealing with customer equipment and cabling. The amendments provide for a `penalty in lieu of prosecution' scheme for these offences. This will help ensure a greater compliance with these sections, as the ACA will be able to more readily pursue a medium-level regulatory response to non-compliance with customer equipment and cabling laws. Labor supports this bill as it is non-controversial. These are all minor technical amendments designed to enhance various pieces of communications legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 3) 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-15,"—The Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2003 primarily corrects minor anomalies in the legislative framework relating to the introduction of digital services in Australia by making minor technical amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act, the Radiocommunications Act and the Telecommunications Act. The Democrats agree that the amendments are sensible amendments that improve the operation of the various pieces of legislation. However, there is a technical problem in schedule 1 of the bill that in our view needs to be addressed before the Democrats will support the bill. The government noted:
Under section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act, commercial broadcasters in two-service regional markets can elect to provide a third service in digital mode. The Act currently provides that, where these markets overlap with remote licence areas, the date on which the broadcasters can elect to provide a third service under section 38B is set in the context of the digital conversion arrangements for the overlapping remote area. As arrangements are yet to be finalised for the introduction of digital television services in remote areas, this is likely to delay the availability of new services in the relevant regional markets.
The bill breaks this nexus by allowing the ABA to determine separate dates in overlapping regional and remote markets from which licensees can elect to provide a third service under section 38B.
While the Democrats support such an initiative, we are concerned that the ABA's power is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. In the Alert Digest No. 7 of 2003, the scrutiny of bills committee drew senators' attention to the provision, arguing that it may be considered to insufficiently subject the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny, in breach of principle 1(a)(v) of the committee's terms of reference.
In responding to the committee's concerns the government has raised three issues. The government has argued that subjecting a determination under new subsection 38B(27) to possible disallowance would create considerable uncertainty for the industry and the regulator. In their response, the committee noted:
... the potential for uncertainty applies to all disallowable instruments, and is in fact the price of the administrative convenience implicit in the making of delegated legislation. The Committee has consistently taken the view that this, in itself, does not provide sufficient reason for the Parliament to abrogate its responsibility to properly scrutinise delegated legislation.
We would also argue that the government could avoid uncertainty by stipulating that the date applies once the determination has passed the Senate. The government further argued:
... such a determination is a minor procedural measure which does not affect the ABA's existing powers in a substantial way.
In responding to the government's point, the committee found it difficult to reconcile the government's claim that the measure is a `minor procedural matter' with the concern that the potential for disallowance would cause considerable uncertainty. 
The third point the government made was that determination under the subsection affects not the substance of the law, but its application. They said that `a determination of a designated time for a particular licence area commences the application' of the scheme for allocating additional licences. The committee argued that this is the very point that concerns them—that the responsibility for determining the time for the commencement of the law is delegated without provision for parliamentary scrutiny. The Democrats agree with the scrutiny of bills committee's comments and will be moving an amendment to make 38B subject to a disallowable instrument.
Question agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-15,"—I might rescue the Senate for a moment, with this bill, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2003, coming on so suddenly to the debating agenda. This bill is to do with, amongst other things, occupational health and safety. I am at this moment drafting an amendment to—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Brown, let me interrupt you for a moment. Would senators on my right either resume their seats or leave the chamber.
—You will know, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, that just yesterday this bill was introduced; the necessary checks and balances to give time for reference to the community were swept aside and here we have the bill today suddenly. I have just issued drafting instructions for an amendment to the principal bill which would disallow seismic testing for petroleum off Australian shores. This is an urgent and critical matter that is confronting people in Victoria and South Australia at the moment. There is widespread distress at the prospect of seismic testing and the impact that will have on fisheries. It is known to disrupt fish hatcheries and it affects the whole food chain from microorganisms right through to the great whales. 
Recently, there was some sound testing by Spanish naval vessels off the Canary Islands. As that testing occurred, some whales washed up and died on the beaches of the Canary Islands. For the first time, it was established that there was damage to their hearing apparatus. In fact, immediate autopsies demonstrated haemorrhaging and death of parts of the whales' brains and a clear connection between underwater sound activities, including explosions, and the death of these whales.
The same sorts of sonic booms are currently authorised by the Victorian government and, I think, by the South Australian government—up to 200 decibels—to penetrate the bedrock of the ocean to allow explorers to find the fossil fuel deposits beneath the ocean. If you are going to let off a sound like that, you can expect that there is going to be major disruption to the living marine ecosystems as a result, and it turns out that that is the case. Early evidence is that there is disruption, if not death, throughout the food chain—right from the smallest organisms to the greatest—and we should be more prudent than to allow that to happen.
The amendment that I will be moving, if given time, would require those who are using seismic testing to establish before they can proceed that it would not have a negative impact on the marine ecosystem. At the moment, it is anything goes. We know it is damaging, but there are no environmental assessments—in fact, there is no adequate assessment at all—and this is giving rise to increasing alarm in the fishing industry of Australia as well as amongst environmentalists.
We are way past the time when we just carry on until we see damage occurring before we stop and think about it. There is an urgent need for seismic testing—and, indeed, underwater activities by navies and commercial shipping—to halt until we understand the ramifications it is having on marine ecosystems. It is not a trite matter. A very major assault is occurring on those ecosystems off the Otways, in the western Bass Strait region of Australia and along the South Australian coast. I have spoken to South Australian Premier Rann about it. My office has communicated our concern about this to the Victorian Minister for Environment and Water. I am not aware of a response—there may have been one—but the opportunity to amend this legislation at national level by simply using the precautionary principle of not proceeding until you can show there is not an adverse environmental impact from massive noise explosions for petroleum exploration has to be implemented. It is reasonable, it is sensible and the Senate can take that action at this stage. We have had a truncated morning in getting to this piece of legislation. I am asking that the opportunity for my amendment to be considered be taken into account.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I was very surprised to see this piece of legislation come before the Senate so quickly this morning, given its place in the order of business today. I apologise if my inability to get to the chamber at the appointed time inconvenienced the Senate, but that was caused by the fact that there was no notice of this piece of legislation coming on almost until the ringing of the bells for a quorum.
The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2003 amends the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, and its primary purpose is to create a nationally consistent occupational health and safety regime for the offshore petroleum industry by the establishment of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority. Provision is also made for the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority to have jurisdiction over onshore petroleum industry sites should the relevant state or territory agree. Schedule 2 of the bill corrects a minor anomaly relating to the GST component of certain fees levied on the industry, whilst schedule 3 establishes new industry data management practices. 
The offshore petroleum industry is strategically and economically important to Australia, and any serious disruption to supply due to an accident would have major economic consequences. The authority, to be established by Commonwealth legislation, will deliver a uniform, national safety regulatory regime for Australia's offshore petroleum industry and will reduce the regulatory burden faced by industry participants. We understand that it is to be an independent agency, accountable to Commonwealth, state and Northern Territory ministers, and that it will be established via an amendment to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, as mentioned earlier.
The bill also contains amendments to the occupational health and safety provisions of the act. These amendments will improve safety administration and outcomes for offshore petroleum facilities and pipelines and will also, importantly, reduce risks to the environment. Amendments in the bill, when mirrored by state and Northern Territory legislation, will also provide a consistent safety regulatory regime across all Commonwealth waters and state and Northern Territory coastal waters.
There are two further sets of amendments in the bill. Schedule 2 seeks to amend section 129 of the act to rectify an anomaly whereby the full amount of fees paid by the offshore petroleum industry need to be redirected back to the states and the Northern Territory, yet the goods and services tax legislation requires GST deductions from some of these fees. Schedule 3 seeks to amend the data and management provisions in the act. These provisions cover the submission of data by petroleum owners to the regulator and the later releases of some of that data to the public. The amendments will enable the machinery provisions covering both submission and release of these data to be placed in new objective based data management regulations under the act.
Since 1967 the act has provided for the regulation of all aspects of offshore petroleum and mining, including titles, exploration, production, pipelines and safety regulation. Following a High Court decision in 1975 that confirmed Commonwealth jurisdiction offshore—that is, below the low-water mark—in June 1979 the Commonwealth and the states agreed to a division of offshore powers and responsibilities, known collectively as the offshore constitutional settlement. The purpose of the settlement was to generally maintain the states' role in the management of offshore areas.
In relation to offshore petroleum arrangements post OCS, the states and the Northern Territory have been granted by the Commonwealth title to all waters, including seabed and landward of the three nautical mile limit, and have the same powers to legislate over those coastal waters as they do over their land territory. Another significant outcome of the OCS was an amendment to confine the application of the Commonwealth act to waters outside the three nautical mile limit, with the states and the Northern Territory enacting mirror legislation applying in waters landward of that boundary.
Beyond the coastal waters, cooperative governance of the Commonwealth's legislation vests executive powers in a joint authority—which is the Commonwealth minister and the relevant state or Northern Territory minister in respect of each adjacent area—on all major decisions affecting petroleum exploration and development, with the Commonwealth minister's view to prevail in the event of disagreement. Day-to-day administrative duties and regulatory functions have been exercised by the designated authority, who is the relevant state or Northern Territory minister. 
Until the safety authority commences operations on 1 January 2005, safety regulation will continue to be administered under the existing legislation and arrangement. A particular feature of the act in its present form—prior to 1 January 2005—is that the occupational health and safety requirements in schedule 7 of the act do not apply to Commonwealth waters adjacent to a state or the Northern Territory if the law of that state or the Territory provides, to any extent, for matters relating to the occupational health and safety of persons employed in the area. In that case, the occupational health and safety laws of the state or the Territory apply. As a result, each jurisdiction except Western Australia has applied its own state or, in the case of the Northern Territory, Territory occupational health and safety law in its own coastal waters, and that law was applied by the Commonwealth act in Commonwealth waters. Western Australia has relied on the application of schedule 7 of the act. Each of these laws is different. Consequently, companies with offshore facilities in more than one state or in the Northern Territory adjacent area have had to meet the requirements of these different laws. Furthermore, those companies operating mobile facilities, such as drilling rigs, have had to comply with different requirements as their rigs move from job to job around Australia.
In response to the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea, the act was amended in 1992 to include schedule 7 and in 1995 to provide for implementation by regulations of a safety case regime. The term `safety case' is used to describe a sophisticated, comprehensive and integrated risk management system. This is characterised by an acceptance that the ongoing management of safety on individual facilities is the direct responsibility of the operators and not the regulator, whose key function is to provide guidance as to the safety objectives to be achieved and an assessment of performance against those objectives.
The operators can achieve those objectives by developing systems and procedures that best suit their needs and agreeing these with the regulator. This safety case then forms the rules by which the operation of the facility is governed. The safety case also forms the basis for ongoing audits by the regulator of the facility and its operation throughout its life. The safety case regime has been fully operational since 1996, when detailed safety case regulations under the act, underpinned by guidelines for their preparation and submission, came into effect. The safety case regime remains as it is and is not altered by this bill. It is proposed, however, to revise the regulations to clarify the operation of the regulations.
In August 2001, the Commonwealth government report on offshore safety, entitled Future arrangements for the regulation of offshore petroleum safety, was delivered to the former Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. The primary conclusion of the review was:
... the Australian legal and administrative framework, and the day to day application of this framework, for regulation of health, safety and environment in the offshore petroleum industry is complicated and insufficient to ensure appropriate, effective and cost efficient regulation of the offshore petroleum industry. Much would require improvement for the regime to deliver world-class safety practice.
In particular, an independent review that formed part of the above report recommended that a national petroleum regulatory authority be developed to oversee the regulation of safety in Commonwealth offshore waters. The Commonwealth view, strongly supported by industry and employees, and the ACTU in particular, was that it would be more efficient and effective—and it would reduce the regulatory burden—to have a single national agency covering both Commonwealth waters and state and Northern Territory coastal waters, a view subsequently shared by states and the Northern Territory. 
The Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources subsequently endorsed a set of principles for regulation of safety of petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters and state and Northern Territory coastal waters in Australia and agreed that the council's standing committee of officials would examine how best to improve offshore safety outcomes, primarily through a single joint national safety agency. This work led to the agreement upon which this bill is based.
The safety authority will function as a regulator of occupational health and safety in relation to offshore petroleum facilities and offshore petroleum diving operations in Commonwealth and designated coastal waters. Individual states or the Northern Territory may also confer powers on the safety authority under the onshore legislation of the state or Territory in respect of particular petroleum operations. Where this occurs, this bill authorises the authority to exercise those powers. In acting under state or Northern Territory `onshore' legislation, the authority will be entirely subject to the governance arrangements established by that legislation.
Labor support this bill, which we note enjoys the support of all industry players and the support of the ACTU. With regard to Senator Brown's comments about an amendment which is in the process of being drafted, I personally knew nothing of that proposition before it was announced today. We would be reluctant to deny Senator Brown the opportunity to move his amendment, and we suggest to the government that, before we proceed to the committee stage of this bill, we ascertain the status of that drafting so that, if it is intended to proceed to the committee stage, we do not do so in a way that would prejudice any senator's opportunity to put an amendment to the Senate for consideration.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-15,"—I indicate Democrat support for the legislation. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2003 will make long overdue changes to the way in which occupational health and safety issues are managed and regulated on offshore petroleum facilities. At present the states and the Northern Territory regulate occupational health and safety issues associated with offshore petroleum operations in their coastal waters. With respect to Commonwealth waters, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 allows the states and the Northern Territory to extend their OH&S laws to offshore petroleum activities in adjacent Commonwealth waters. I understand that all jurisdictions except Western Australia have exercised this option. As a result, operators of offshore petroleum facilities are subject to a range of different OH&S laws in relation to offshore petroleum operations in Australian waters. This creates a confusing situation for workers and employees and imposes unnecessary costs on operators.
I also indicate that the Democrats would like to see this bill go into committee, even though we do not ourselves have an amendment. There are some practices which I would like the minister to clarify with regard to what is being proposed on occupational health and safety issues relating to the removal of naturally occurring radioactive material, otherwise known as scale, on pipes and so forth.
This bill will enable the establishment of uniform occupational health and safety laws for offshore petroleum operations throughout Australian waters. It will also establish a single OH&S regulator for these activities, namely the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority. This will be facilitated by the enactment of mirror state and Northern Territory legislation after this bill has been passed. The creation of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority and the establishment of uniform OH&S laws in Australian waters is a very important initiative which the Commonwealth and the states should be applauded for, as should the ACTU and the industry groups that have been involved in these changes. Workers on offshore petroleum facilities face many dangers. If administered appropriately, this new regime should allow for the improvement of safety conditions associated with these activities.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-15,"—It is very good to be here to close the debate on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2003 and on the Offshore Petroleum (Safety Levies) Bill 2003, which is an associated bill. Mr Acting Deputy President, when you looked around the Senate for speakers on this bill and looked my way I was engaged in conversation with the Manager of Opposition Business in this place, Senator Joseph Ludwig, and we were discussing the last-minute changes to the program this morning. I take this opportunity to put on record my apologies, as Manager of Government Business, to the opposition. After the bells rang to summon us to the chamber this morning we were informed by parties who had an interest in item No. 1 on the program, which deals with some superannuation matters, that they were not ready to proceed with that debate. It was very last-minute advice and I was assured that we could go on with the next bills. This did, however, leave some communications undone.
I think Senator Ludwig would admit that on most occasions communications between the parties are excellent. We try to advise each other with plenty of notice about changes to the program—which does change quite regularly—but this change was at very late notice to the government. Clearly it is hard for all parties to have to change speakers at the last moment when you come into the place expecting to do one bill and are told, `We are going to do another.' Having said that, I am very pleased that the Senate has been able to make good use of the first hour this morning in dealing with some important measures. Of course, none is more important than the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 2003 and associated bill.
—Keep going. You've got 18 minutes left—talk it out. Unless you tell us what's happening, we don't know what's going on.
—That is not what I am here to do; I am here to close the debate. I was making a very frank apology to the Manager of Opposition Business, taking the opportunity do so in summing up on this bill. I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on these measures—measures that will establish the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority. This will increase certainty for a very important Australian industry. It will ensure that there is a consistent safety regulatory regime across all Commonwealth waters and state and Northern Territory coastal waters.
The establishment of the authority represents a major achievement by the government in responding to the wishes and needs of the offshore petroleum industry, and of the work force in this unique and important industry, in relation to safety regulation. As you would recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, it was an election promise made prior to the last election in 2001—a commitment to Australia's offshore petroleum industry and all of those outstanding Australians who work in that industry—to deliver this uniform national safety regulatory regime to improve safety outcomes and reduce the regulatory burden faced by industry. It is in essence a win-win measure. It means a safer environment for an important industry and will at the same time lighten the regulatory burden. 
I think all Australians, particularly those who are driving around in their vehicles on the roads of Australia listening to the parliamentary news network this morning—who are in fact burning the fuel that is often brought to the shore from the petroleum industry—can drive happily in the knowledge that the fuel that they rely on, and quite often take for granted, is, as a result of these measures being discussed in the national parliament today, going to get there in a better way. Those who are involved in the important business of extracting the petroleum products on offshore rigs through the offshore petroleum industry can do so under a much safer environment. Again, I do repeat my thanks to senators for their contributions to this debate. I wish the bill a speedy passage and reiterate my apologies to opposition and other senators for the late rearrangement of the program earlier this morning.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003. The bill is one of several pieces of legislation introduced over the past 18 months in an attempt to stem the rapid increase in public liability and professional indemnity insurance premiums. Last year insurance ministers from all jurisdictions received evidence that a significant factor contributing to the increase in premiums has been the growth in number and cost of claims for negligence. 
In response, all states and territories have introduced tort law reforms to bring claims costs under control. The reforms introduced have included caps on damages, thresholds to prevent the commencement of actions in relation to minor injuries and measures to allow the voluntary assumption of risk. For some time the insurance industry and others have expressed concern that the effect of the tort reforms could be undermined if plaintiffs sought to use Commonwealth law in the form of the Trade Practices Act as the basis of their claim rather than negligence. This forum shopping or cause of action shopping is possible because in theory the same conduct may form the basis of action in tort for negligence as well under provisions of the TPA. 
This bill seeks to remove this potential overlap. Its intention is to prevent the recovery of damages where conduct in breach of part V, division 1, of the TPA results in personal injury or death. These provisions of the Trade Practices Act deal with unfair practices. Without doubt, the most important consumer protection provisions in the part is section 52, which prohibits corporations from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. If this bill is enacted in its present form, a company that misleads a consumer in a way that causes injury or death will not be liable to pay any compensation under the Trade Practices Act. Nor will the ACCC be able to bring an action to recover damages on behalf of people who suffer such an injury. These amendments arise from recommendations of the review of the law of negligence that was chaired by Justice Ipp last year. They are said to be necessary to support the tort law reform instituted by the states and territories.
Labor has consistently stressed the need for Commonwealth action to support the efforts of the state and territory governments to reduce public liability premiums. We have supported amendments to taxation laws to facilitate structured settlements which reduce costs to insurers. We have also backed the principle that the TPA needed to be amended to allow people who engage in high-risk recreational activities to be able to waive their rights to sue. In addition, Labor endorsed legislation to remove the personal liability of volunteers performing work for the Commonwealth. As far back as last May, in response to concerns about forum shopping, Labor called for appropriate amendments to the Trade Practices Act to ensure that public liability claims costs did not blow out on another front following tort law reform.
We have always emphasised, however, that any reforms must reflect the need to ensure that consumers are adequately protected and that the legislative response is proportionate to the size of the problem. In order to ensure that this bill achieved these aims, we sought to refer this bill for inquiry by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. That committee reported in August. In their minority report Labor senators made it clear that the evidence received by the committee did not justify the enactment of the bill in its current form. All submissions agreed that at present the TPA is rarely used as the basis for a claim for personal injury. The Law Council could identify only nine reported cases between 1989 and 2002 where the courts had dealt with such claims. It should be noted that in several of these cases plaintiffs were not successful in recovering damages. In terms of representative actions, the ACCC stated that it had run only one representative action seeking to recover damages on behalf of consumers who had suffered personal injury as a result of a breach of part 5, division 1. These figures mean that the TPA can in no way be blamed for any blow-out in costs from personal injury litigation. 
Notwithstanding this fact, the government has argued that the toughening of negligence laws by the states will encourage plaintiffs to explore using the Trade Practices Act. Despite this claim, no evidence was submitted to the committee indicating that the number of personal injury claims being instituted under the TPA has increased since the state reforms were enacted. Given that some of these reforms, such as the Civil Liability Act in New South Wales, have now been in operation since June 2002—that is, over a year now—any trend towards the increased use of the TPA should have become evident by now. The case for removing the right to claim for personal injury under part V, division 1 is largely premised on the fact that provisions such as section 52 are strict liability—that is, it is not necessary to show that a company intended to mislead and deceive for liability to arise.
The government and the insurance industry argue that it is easier to bring an action under the TPA, since there is no requirement to prove fault, unlike in negligence cases. The glaring weakness of this argument is that section 52 has been a strict liability provision since 1974, when the TPA was introduced for the first time. If it were significantly easier to bring claims under the TPA than in negligence, surely we would have seen more use of it as the basis for personal injury claims. It is true that the elements of negligence are different from those required to establish misleading and deceptive conduct, but it does not follow that the TPA provides an easier way to make claims.
Some may ask why it is necessary for the TPA to cover personal injury, and why compensation cannot simply be left to the law of negligence. There are a number of reasons. Firstly, the committee heard evidence of several plausible scenarios where the removal of the right to bring an action under part V, division 1 could result in consumers being left without a remedy. Examples included cases involving defective products, where defendants had destroyed crucial evidence. The Trade Practices Act serves as a vital safety net in these rare cases. More generally, witnesses, such as the ACCC, the Consumers Association and even the Law Council, emphasised the contribution made by the Trade Practices Act in creating a culture of care in the Australian business community.
The Law Council noted the positive effects of the TPA on consumer safety in its evidence to the committee. The Secretary-General of the Law Council, Mr Lavarch, stated:
One of the consequences of that legislation, I think, has been that it has significantly improved the standards of behaviour that we have seen across the whole corporate world ... 
... in terms of product safety and the actions of corporations in terms of their potential to cause physical harm to individuals, there has been this strong benchmarked potential liability imposed upon them. On the whole, I would say that it has led to general improvements and one should be loath to go down a path of in a wholesale way taking out whole areas of action.
We do not accept the government's claims that concerns about the effect of this bill on consumer safety are misplaced, because the ACCC will retain the ability to bring a criminal action or seek an injunction to restrain conduct in breach of the act. The fact is that there is no criminal provision equivalent to section 52 of this act. In addition, the threat of an injunction is highly unlikely to be a substantial deterrent to misleading and deceptive conduct. While cases brought under the act for personal injury may be rare, the fact that the TPA imposes strict liability has encouraged companies to put an emphasis on consumer safety. In Labor's view, the complete removal of this incentive as proposed in the bill runs the risk of undermining the high standard of behaviour that consumers have come to expect. 
The ACCC's opposition to the bill was based largely on what is referred to as the `economics of accidents'. In essence, this work suggests that liability for the cost of accidents should be assigned to the party that could most easily and cheaply take the actions needed to minimise the risk of the accident. The commission noted that limiting the scope of part V is economically inefficient, in that it forces consumers to incur greater search costs to determine which suppliers are reliable. In addition, the commission pointed out that the removal of liability for personal injury and death would also undermine the competitive process by allowing firms that engage in misleading and deceptive practices to win customers at the expense of those that do not.
The Ipp review acknowledged the force of the arguments made by the ACCC but said that they needed to be balanced against `the inherent value of personal autonomy and the desirability of persons taking responsibility for their own actions and safety'. In Labor's view these concepts are of doubtful relevance in a context where a company misleads a consumer. Fundamentally, we do not believe that there is any reason to completely excuse companies who engage in misleading and deceptive conduct that causes personal injury or death from the consequences of their actions. Having said that, we do recognise that there is a theoretical possibility that claims that would otherwise be brought in negligence may be brought under the TPA as a result of the state reforms. However, in our view this bill is not a proportionate response to the size of that problem. This bill is very different from state reforms to law of negligence. Where those reforms instituted thresholds and caps, this bill abolishes an entire cause of action.
In Labor's view, the key problem is not that it is easier to bring an action under the TPA than in negligence; rather, it is that personal injury damages are capped under state and territory law but not under the TPA. If forum shopping is to emerge at some future stage, this will be the key driver. In our view the danger can be addressed by pursuing an option first suggested by the ACCC in its submission to the Ipp review. The ACCC proposed that damages for personal injury as a result of a breach of part V, division 1 should be aligned with those available under the relevant state or territory civil liability laws. I am pleased to say that Labor has been able to agree with the Democrats on a set of amendments that will achieve this outcome. These amendments have the benefit of reducing the motivation for plaintiffs to seek to evade restrictions under state and territory law while still providing consumers with a measure of protection under the TPA and maintaining incentives for companies to minimise risks.
I am aware that the minister has accused Labor of supporting amendments that will undermine the reforms of state and territory Labor governments. This of course is not the case. Our colleagues understand that these measured amendments will deal with the incentive for forum shopping in a balanced way. Labor has consulted widely on these amendments.
While the Insurance Council would prefer the bill in its present form, they have, as I am sure the minister is aware, indicated that they are comfortable that our amendments will deal with their key concerns about the impact of the TPA on the effectiveness of the tort law reforms. Given this fact, I would hope that the government would be able to support these amendments so that this legislation can be dealt with expeditiously. 
The amendments that we will move represent a proportionate response to what, at this stage, is just a theoretical problem. It is important to note that the amendments are also in keeping with the Ipp review recommendations for dealing with other provisions of the TPA that may found an action for personal injury such as those relating to unconscionable conduct.
Labor is firmly of the view that there is no case for completely removing the right of consumers to bring an action for personal injury and death under the TPA. Part V, division 1 of the TPA has played an important role in promoting consumer safety, and the complete removal of the ability of consumers and the ACCC to recover personal injury damages for breach of these provisions has the potential to expose consumers to increased risk.
Before I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to point out once again that consumers will only benefit from state and territory tort reforms if there is a mechanism to ensure that savings generated by the reforms result in lower insurance premiums. ACCC data shows that on average public liability premiums have increased by 88 per cent since 1999. Tort law reform was presented to the community on the basis that it would lead to reductions in premiums. So far this has not taken place and there is no indication that the passage of the bill will alter that situation.
Together, three of the major players in the public liability market, QBE, IAG and Promina, recently reported profits in excess of half a billion dollars. This year QBE's share price has increased by over 20 per cent, IAG is up by around 35 per cent and Promina has soared by over 50 per cent since listing in May. This is not an industry that is struggling any more. While premiums are forecast to continue to rise, there is evidence that tort reforms are lowering public liability claims costs. Market commentators have pointed to the favourable claims environment being experienced by the industry as one factor driving these results.
In NSW, the Attorney-General's Department has estimated that the number of public risk actions, including personal injury matters, in the District Court has fallen by 25 per cent in the last 12 months. Regrettably, the ACCC's August report on public liability insurance pricing indicates reluctance on the part of the industry to pass on the benefit of reductions in claims. Companies surveyed by the ACCC forecast that premiums would rise by a further 20 per cent this year and that at best tort reform will only moderate the increase by three per cent. Talk about having your cake and eating it too.
Last September, Labor introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Public Liability Insurance) Bill 2002, which proposed to grant the ACCC the necessary powers to ensure that savings resulting from tort law reform are passed on to consumers—the intended beneficiaries. Labor repeats its call for the government to give the ACCC these powers to ensure that premiums are reduced. Tort law reform was not introduced simply to prop up the profits of the insurance industry. Labor looks to the insurance industry to play its part in ensuring that premiums are affordable so we can redress some of the problems that are still out there in the community because they are paying too much for insurance premiums.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2003-10-15,"—I also rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003. The purpose of the bill, which was the focus of a recent inquiry, is to amend the Trade Practices Act to prevent individuals and, more importantly, the ACCC being able to take action and recover damages for personal injury and death where there has been a contravention of part V, division I of the TPA. Part V, division 1 of the TPA contains key consumer protection measures, the most commonly used being those that deal with misleading and deceptive conduct under section 52 and false and misleading representations under section 53. Currently, where there are provisions in part V, division 1 of the act that are breached, a person may recover damages from any loss they have suffered as a result of a contravention of the provision and the ACCC may also bring representative actions on behalf of the person who has suffered loss where any of the provisions in part V, division 1 are breached. The amendments that are contained in this bill will prevent actions for damages to part V, division 1 where the damage is or results in personal injury and death and will prevent the ACCC from being able to bring representative actions under this part of the act. 
It is important to keep in mind that the bill is part of the government's solution to the insurance crisis and implements recommendations 19 and 20 of the Ipp review of the law of negligence. By far the most widely held belief is that the rising number and cost of claims is the primary driver behind the cost of insurance. However, rather than implementing solutions that limit the number of claims, the central theme of all of the solutions has been to limit the amount that can be claimed in the first instance. Consumer advocates as well as the Australian Democrats have challenged this approach and the Australian Democrats still await preventative solutions from the government that concentrate on restoring some balance to the current reforms—balance being the element that is absent in this particular bill.
The Australian Democrats understand that in the past and since the collapse of HIH the insurance industry has sustained losses in both the public liability and professional indemnity classes of insurance. However, we are not convinced that there exists conclusive evidence that claims costs are out of control, given that HIH was the largest underwriter of public liability policies and HIH's exit from the market removed a great deal of supply.
The inquiry into the bill highlighted the fact that the Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association, among others, did not support the bill and viewed it as unnecessary. However, in line with the ACCC's submission in 2002, they suggested that a more palatable approach would be to ensure that taking actions under the TPA was not a more attractive alternative than taking actions under state tort law. The Australian Democrats are somewhat supportive of this view and believe the need to prevent forum shopping is the most important part of the Ipp review's recommendations. However, at present there is no forum shopping to speak of, which brings into question why the government believes there is an urgency to abolish consumer rights in such an extreme way.
Given the comments of the insurance industry during the inquiry, I do not think that, if the bill were passed, we could expect automatic premiums savings for the community. In fact, the Trade Practices Act has had no impact on premium pricing in the past, and we are only debating this bill today because of assumptions about the future. During the inquiry, my colleague Senator Andrew Murray raised concerns that there is a potential that devolving damages caps to the states could also be problematic. As was highlighted in the inquiry, there is the danger that individuals themselves might be disadvantaged, depending on the particular state that applies to their action. 
While noting these concerns, the more critical concern is that, if this bill proceeds as is, an entire right of action will be abolished, leaving no options for consumers at all, regardless of state and territory differences. Whilst state and federal governments have convened numerous meetings to try to address the affordability and the availability of insurance, with a view to coming up with a nationally consistent approach, the government has been unable to ensure that the end products were consistent. As a result, there is a patchwork quilt of reforms across the entire country, which further justifies the claims of the insurance industry that more needs to be done before the community can expect savings in insurance premiums.
Contrary to the win-win situation that the Commonwealth and state governments have been promising, these inconsistencies—in my mind, at least—create a lose-lose situation for the community and make the task of preventing any forum shopping more difficult. But, as I will discuss later, the Australian Democrats believe this can be achieved without resorting to abolishing consumer rights altogether.
I want to talk very briefly about another bill that we dealt with last year. Another consideration that the Democrats have had in mind is the effect that this bill will have in light of the reforms made to the Trade Practices Act in 2002, when we dealt with liability for recreational services. That was about providing that recreational service providers were able to rely upon waivers accepted by consumers. The Australian Democrats supported the principle that individuals do take responsibility for their own actions. However, we could see the harm to consumers of a blanket acceptance of waivers if there were no corresponding assurances regarding safety standards employed by recreational service providers, which was why we proposed amendments at that time.
The outcome of reforms in 2002 makes it all the more important that we do not do away with consumer rights completely, which is what this bill intends to do. The tenor of the current legislation goes even further than other reforms that have been enacted so far. I believe that by doing away with rights of action completely we are tipping the balance too far and jeopardising consumer rights unnecessarily. This is especially so given that the government have not been able to secure any guarantees from the insurance industry that the community will in fact receive savings in insurance premiums as a result of the sacrifices they have had to make so far.
In their submission to the inquiry and in the media more recently, the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association highlight a number of scenarios where the passage of this bill, coupled with changes to the Trade Practices Act last year regarding waivers, could potentially have dire consequences for consumers because the incentives to ensure safe environments have largely been compromised.
An example highlighted in the inquiry was the scenario where a company sets up a bungy jump and promotes itself as the `safest bungy in Australia'. A backpacker, goaded on by her friends, agrees to participate. Taking advantage of the new legislation, the jumper signs a waiver to prevent her from taking any action for negligence and voluntarily assumes all of the risks associated with the jump. The bungy cord is due to be replaced at 500 jumps, but the operator forgot the cord that morning and planned to get it at lunch time. As the cord had been used for only 470 jumps and the morning's jumps averaged 20, he was not concerned. However, the backpacker group took the number of jumpers to 36 for the morning, beyond the safely limit, causing her to strike her head on the ground and resulting in serious injuries. As this scenario highlights, allowing a company to rely on waivers as well as be free of personal injury and death claims for misleading and deceptive conduct does allow companies to relinquish their responsibility for consumer safety. 
Another consideration which must be taken into account in the passage of this bill is the fact that the TPA and the law of negligence have existed side by side for a number of years. Individuals have always had the opportunity to use the TPA for personal injury claims, but evidence shows that this has not been the case. And the fact that some state tort reforms have already been in force for the last 12 months has not resulted in any bypassing of existing laws. The Ipp report, which has been used as the report that has guided all of the changes regarding the insurance crisis, has highlighted that the relevant sections of the TPA are rarely used in order to claim damages for personal injuries and death. Therefore, it seems to me that abolishing rights and closing the door on consumers completely would be premature, extreme and unjustified.
The reason that the current reforms have been implemented or proposed is to provide greater certainty and to encourage insurers to re-enter the market, acknowledging that in recent years the public liability and professional indemnity classes of insurance have been unprofitable at times. The recent ACCC monitoring report, released in July of this year, provides an insight into the performance of the industry during the last year and suggests that insurers have returned to profitability in both classes of insurance.
While the Australian Democrats do not believe there has been sufficient justification for the large-scale limitations that have been placed on individuals' ability to take legal action, we understand the goal of this reform is to prevent forum shopping. But I think we have to look at the bill in the bright light of day. It is yet another erosion of consumer rights and, given there is no evidence that part V, division 1 has been used to bypass tort law, actions under the TPA for personal injury and death should not be abolished, in my view. Were the bill to proceed as it currently stands, there would be the danger that the high standards and accountability that the TPA currently commands would be undermined and consumers would be further and unnecessarily disadvantaged. For this reason, the Australian Democrats will be moving an amendment to the bill.
As Senator Conroy has already mentioned, the amendment that the Australian Democrats and the ALP will be proposing is essentially designed to alleviate insurance industry concerns that state tort law reforms will promote forum shopping. But it will also leave the door open for personal injury victims who may not be able to recover damages under negligence law and where it is more appropriate to use the Trade Practices Act. As some of the inquiry submissions highlighted, there may be situations identifiable in the future where the failure to access provisions of the Trade Practices Act for personal injury and death may amount to a terrible injustice.
We will also be seeking amendment to ensure that the ACCC can continue to fulfil its current role and be able to take representative actions, because it seems to me that the ability of the ACCC to bring actions is important for the maintenance of high standards of conduct and is an important proactive tool to avoid future conduct that contravenes the act. In my view, the ACCC could hardly be accused of bringing unmeritorious claims to the attention of the court and, as the inquiry has highlighted, the decision to take representative actions is not taken lightly. Consideration has to be given to available recourses, the public interest aspects of the case and the consequences of the particular conduct. 
Given that division l, part V of the TPA is not readily used to pursue damages for personal injury, I am certain that abolishing the right altogether is unnecessary, and I believe that this amendment is a vast improvement to the current bill. I also believe that, if the assumption about the future, held by the Ipp review and insurance industry, proves incorrect, and forum shopping does not increase, the effects of this bill on consumers will be minimal. At the same time, we believe that these amendments should deliver the certainty that the insurance industry is seeking and has been calling for. Given the limitations that have been made to consumer rights over the absence of affordable and available insurance, the government must, as a first priority, ensure that the insurance industry plays its part in delivering on its end of the bargain.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-15,"—The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 is the latest instalment in the government's program to curtail the rights of citizens who suffer as a result of another person's negligent behaviour. We have seen one attempt after another to protect the interests of insurance companies ahead of protecting the rights of injured people. In this case, the government is seeking to amend division 1 of part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to remove the right of a person to take legal action for damages for personal injuries and death as a result of misleading or deceptive conduct. The bill also prevents the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, from taking action on behalf of a person who has suffered loss as a result of breaches of part V of the act.
The government has relied upon a sense of panic in the community, generated by the collapse of insurance company HIH and medical indemnity provider UMP, and a misconception about damages awards in a handful of cases, to drive its program. It has been aided and abetted by the states and territories, which have signed on to the so-called reform agenda—that is, the curtailing of rights under tort law. Governments have been far less diligent in pursuing some sort of long-term care program for people who are injured. In the absence of such a program, it is unacceptable to be restricting and, in this case, removing rights to seek funds to assist a person to provide the care that they need.
The government claims that the measures in the bill are aimed at limiting public liability claims costs in order to remove pressure on insurance premiums and assist in delivering affordable liability insurance. There is in fact no justification for this legislation. It is based on the view, lacking any evidentiary support, that, because the states and territories have restricted the right to sue for damages, people will rush to use this provision under the Trade Practices Act.
As the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association has noted, the TPA is not frequently used to recover compensation for personal injury or death. In evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, the association's National President, John Gordon, said that this part of the act has always been limited in its utility. For example, to establish liability under section 52, it must be shown that a corporation acting in trade or commerce is guilty of misleading or deceptive conduct.
Even if we accept the government's contention that the raft of measures by state, federal and territory governments will reduce insurance premiums, governments have done nothing to ensure that insurance companies pass on any cost savings to policy holders in the form of lower premiums. The insurance companies must be laughing loudly behind closed doors. Business journalist Mark Westfield, writing in the Australian on 29 August, noted the profit reports of QBE, the profits of which had more than doubled again for just six months; Suncorp, which had a net profit of $384 million for the year to 30 June; Promina, which had a net profit of $135 million for the six months to 30 June; and IAG, which had a profit of $153 million in the year to 30 June. We agree with Mr Westfield's observation that: 
It is breathtaking that politicians keep giving the industry concessions but don't seek offsetting undertakings to reduce premiums to stop the gouge.
The government's arguments in support of this bill are confusing and contradictory. The government claims that removing this right to seek damages under the Trade Practices Act will not leave people without a legal remedy, because they can take action under common law. Of course, that common law now contains new hurdles: time limits on commencing actions and caps on damages. However, if people have access to the common law, why does the government assume that they would take action under the Trade Practices Act in the first place? There are particular tests to meet in proving a claim under the Trade Practices Act, for misleading and deceptive conduct, and this provision is used occasionally, not regularly.
The government does, though, acknowledge that some claims for personal injuries or death as a result of conduct prohibited under this section of the Trade Practices Act will not succeed at common law—that is, people will be worse off. This is further acknowledged in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, where the government states:
These amendments may lead to some increase in social security, Medicare and related expenditure. This is because there may be circumstances where a person is unable to pursue a claim under tort or contract law but who might have succeeded in a claim for damages under the TPA for personal injuries or death as a result of conduct in contravention of Division 1 of Part V.
This bill will have financial implications, although the government has not been particularly forthcoming about the extent of them. Treasury officials failed to clarify the matter when appearing before the Senate inquiry into this bill. In answers to questions taken on notice they simply referred back to the explanatory memorandum, adding:
While there is expected to be no significant financial impact on the Commonwealth from the passage of this bill, it is not possible to provide a more detailed assessment of that financial impact because of a lack of relevant data.
In other words, the government has no idea of the financial impact on the public purse, let alone the burden individuals will carry as a result of these amendments.
The Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association has made some particularly important points about the context and implications of this bill, which are worth mentioning in this debate. Association president Rob Davis, writing in the University of New South Wales Law Journal earlier this year, observed that many of the legal rights that governments have legislated away in response to the Ipp review of the law of negligence were abolished `to fund the market driven mistakes and excesses of insurers'. He went on:
The local campaign follows the blueprint for industry driven attacks on citizens' rights refined in the US over two decades ... The goal of the campaign is to confuse the Australian public about the true causes of the current crisis in the insurance industry and, in the process, convince them to surrender valuable legal rights. 
Mr Davis pointed out that, according to the Productivity Commission, the amount of civil litigation has declined gradually over the past seven years. The rate of claims against insurance policies has declined since the mid-1990s. Australian general insurers have not suddenly experienced a negative underwriting result; claim costs have exceeded premium income for 20 years. Rather, what changed recently were the investment returns of insurance funds, the source of their profits for two decades. This has forced insurance companies to increase premiums. Mr Davis cited a 1999 United States study on the effects of tort law changes in that country covering 25 years that showed no relationship between tort law reforms and premiums. He concluded that, as the current crisis in insurance has nothing to do with litigation or an increase in Australians' propensity to blame others for injury, restricting civil litigation rights will not resolve the crisis.
Denying an injured person the right to take action against these provisions troubles the Greens, but we are also concerned about the conclusions business and the community will draw from the removal of this right whilst retaining the right of a person or corporation to sue for monetary loss. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats are proposing amendments to pick up concerns raised in the committee inquiry. These deal with giving courts the capacity to consider contributory negligence—a concept that applies in the case of tort law but which the High Court has found cannot be considered in cases under the Trade Practices Act—and putting limits on payouts which accord with relevant state tort law.
There may be some unintended consequences in the case of the contributory negligence amendment, and I will be seeking clarification of that from Labor during the committee stage of the debate. Whilst the Greens disagree with the caps and restrictions that the states and territories have imposed on civil liability litigation—and have voted against these measures in state legislatures—we will be supporting the second amendment, as it improves the bill by retaining the capacity to take action under the Trade Practices Act, circumscribed though it may be. The Australian Greens acknowledge that there are problems with the current arrangements for seeking redress for personal injury and death. I mentioned them in speaking on the government's medical indemnity insurance bills last year.
The adversarial system does nothing to reduce the incidence of adverse events or to address systemic causes of problems. It does the opposite, because the threat of legal action works against a culture of openness—a necessary prerequisite for reducing the incidence of adverse medical events. Nor is the current system fair. Two people who suffer a similar adverse outcome or medical misadventure may have the same requirements of care and income replacement but under the existing system may be treated very differently, based on chance. One may be able to make a successful legal claim by proving negligence and the other may not.
Our focus needs to be on prevention, on ensuring adequate treatment and care and, as far as possible, on rehabilitation. We are a long way from meeting these goals, although this kind of approach is not new. Justice Owen Woodhouse conducted a royal commission into workers compensation in 1967 and recommended a no-fault approach to compensation for personal injury. A parliamentary inquiry followed the royal commission, reporting in 1974, but no scheme emerged. More recently there was the Neave report, commissioned by the Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers and released in September last year. Professor Marcia Neave's report proposed an integrated package designed to reduce the number of adverse medical events and minimise litigation by improving patient safety; reduce the need to litigate and encourage early finalisation of disputes; provide fair compensation to people who suffer loss as a result of medical negligence; and ensure affordable and sustainable insurance premiums. 
Some people argue that we cannot afford a no-fault scheme, but the Greens say that we cannot afford not to investigate this option. The Commonwealth government needs to move quickly to investigate a system of long-term care for people who are injured that will achieve the objectives identified in the Neave report instead of continuing to tighten access to the existing arrangements, which do nothing to ensure fair and just outcomes or address the causes of injury and death.
On this point, we agree with the Australian Medical Association that the government's measures to address the medical indemnity crisis are unsustainable, though we note the current problems were caused by the medical indemnity insurer and the Commonwealth was warned years ago. The announcement by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, of a review to address this matter and to report by the end of this year is just another quick fix and is completely inadequate. This is an issue that affects every single Australian. The government needs to instigate a public inquiry into a national, public, no-fault compensation scheme along the lines of the New Zealand accident compensation scheme.
Whilst we recognise the shortcomings of the existing approach to negligence and personal injuries, the Greens will not support restricting the rights of people to seek damages that are used to help them meet the costs of ongoing medical care needed as a result of negligent or deceptive behaviour by somebody else. The Trade Practices Act provisions that the government wants to abolish are important to individuals and, in the case of groundbreaking litigation, are important in changing poor and even dangerous corporate practices. This bill sends entirely the wrong signal on the matter of responsibility. It removes an important right without justification and it will leave some people worse off without just cause. For these reasons, the Australian Greens will be opposing the bill.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-10-15,"—The Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 will remove the ability of consumers and the ACCC to recover damages for personal injury and death sustained by consumers as a result of conduct that breaches the Trade Practices Act. The key provisions of the act are part V, division I, section 52, which prohibits corporations from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct; and section 53, which prohibits false representations that goods or services are of a particular standard, quality or grade.
It is said that the reforms before us are necessary to support state and territory tort law reform and have been introduced in response to the rapid increase in public liability insurance premiums over the last few years. Particularly notable here is the case of HIH. More specifically, the intention of the bill is to address concerns about forum shopping. It is my view that what we are being asked to support here through this bill will in fact make forum shopping easier and less beneficial to those who have been injured. The intention of the bill is to address concerns about this forum shopping. This would mean that plaintiffs faced with tougher negligence laws would seek to manipulate their action to bring it within the Trade Practices Act. 
The Labor Party support moves that would prevent forum shopping, but we also say that any proposed changes should aim to limit rather than remove the right to sue for personal injury damages under part V, division 1 of the act. This goes further than what the government is proposing. The government argues that the removal of the right to seek damages under the Trade Practices Act will not adversely affect consumers because these consumers still have the ability to seek damages under state law. In my state of South Australia, there can be no assurance that an affected consumer will have the protection suggested in the government's proposal. In fact, the South Australian government is waiting for the Commonwealth to pass this bill before proceeding with its own amendments, so there can be no assurance or feeling of comfort for potential applicants. In my view, what the South Australian government is doing is wise, given some of the uncertainties of the federal government's proposals. 
One of the things that seems to be unclear from a policy perspective is whether the bill will define standards for different forms of loss under the Trade Practices Act. I am thinking here of loss of personal injury or death versus economic loss. From my reading of it, the bill has the potential to remove the culture of care that has developed in Australia since the Trade Practices Act was first enacted. As a consequence of this, I have a fear that consumers will be exposed to greater risk of injury, hence they will face greater real loss. While it can be said that few cases of personal injury have been brought under part V, division 1, the potential for liability under the act has encouraged companies to put a real emphasis on safety and protecting themselves from potential litigation for unsafe acts or products. 
It is interesting to note what the Law Council of Australia saw as the positive effect of the Trade Practices Act in its evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I will just quote one piece from that from a witness, Mr Lavarch, who said:
One of the consequences of that legislation, I think, has been that it has significantly improved the standards of behaviour that we have seen across the whole corporate world, in terms of ... product safety and the actions of corporations in terms of their potential to cause physical harm to individuals, there has been this strong benchmarked potential liability imposed upon them. On the whole, I would say that it has led to general improvements and one should be loath to go down a path of in a wholesale way taking out whole areas of action.
This seems to me to be a very commonsense observation but it does not sit all that well with the government's argument that removal of the right to seek damages under the Trade Practices Act will not adversely affect consumers because they will still be able to seek damages for negligence under state law. The Law Council of Australia has, in its remarks, taken into account the lack of protection inherent in some states' laws.
The ACCC, in its submission to the government-initiated Ipp review, which produced the report titled Review of the law of negligence, was rightfully strong in its opposition to the removal of liability for personal injury. Based on the literature known as the economics of accidents, where it is suggested that the cost of accidents should be assigned to the party that could most easily and cheaply take the actions needed to minimise the risk of accident, the ACCC made a number of good points in their submission and I think it is worth reflecting on these for a moment.
Firstly, the ACCC pointed out that section 52 of the Trade Practices Act provides an important incentive for business to behave fairly and have regard for consumers' safety. Without this important remedy, the standard of behaviour that consumers are entitled to expect may break down. It seems to me that consumer protection has to be first and foremost in relation to this act and any change to the act that alters or shifts the onus for consumer protection largely renders the act impotent. Unless changes are as near as practicably aligned to those state and territory civil liability laws as they can be, that is exactly what we will be left with—an impotent piece of legislation. 
The second thing the ACCC pointed out was the limiting of the scope of part V of the act. They said this would make the bill inefficient in that it would force consumers to incur greater search costs to determine which suppliers were reliable. Based on that, it is my view that we could be confronted with a grossly unfair act which, rather than protecting consumers, would, in fact, expose them to a lack of protection from unethical companies. They would be exposed to greater costs and confusion and it would not provide the remedial actions that could be taken to address their concerns. In addition to that, you would have this problem of shopping around to find the best jurisdiction to seek redress.
The final point I wanted to refer to from the ACCC's submission is their view that such a limitation also undermines the competitive process by allowing firms to engage in misleading and deceptive practices to win customers at the expense of those who do not. It would be a case of gain for the unethical and the cheats and loss for the fair and the honest within the industrial community. That simply would not be tolerable.
It is interesting to note that the Ipp review accepted these propositions put forward by the ACCC and felt they were valid considerations but argued that the review had to balance the submission against the inherent value of personal autonomy and the desirability of persons taking responsibility for their actions and safety. I am always concerned when individuals are given the responsibility to care for their own actions when it could have devastating effects on others. You need a strong regulatory forum and you need a strong and effective method for redressing the irresponsible within the community.
The views contained in the Ipp review show a lack of courage on the part of that review, particularly as its terms of reference required that it proposed reforms that would meet the objective of limiting liability and the quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death. The arguments by the review panel lack substance because there can be no reason to excuse companies that engage in misleading and deceptive conduct, particularly conduct which causes personal injury or death as a consequence of their actions.
The terms of reference gave the review panel a chance to grasp the nettle. They chose rather to weaken that part of the act that is there to protect consumers. Part V, division 1 of the Trade Practices Act has, over the years, played an important role in promoting consumer safety. The complete removal of the ability of consumers and the ACCC to recover personal injury damages for breach of these provisions has the potential to expose consumers to increased risk. At the end of the day, legislation should be in place to guard against exposing consumers to risk.
An example of how a person could be affected would be a drug company which markets a drug, claiming that the drug will ease the effects of morning sickness suffered by women during pregnancy but knowing that tests have shown that the drug can result in horrendous birth defects in a substantial number of cases. So while the drug is fine for easing morning sickness, a side-effect is that you could have defects in the child when it is born. To protect itself, the drug company destroys its tests. A litigant would have all the difficulty in the world to pursue it to the end. That is negligence. It is a hypothetical case, and I guess drug companies at the moment are easy to pick on. There are many good drug companies producing drugs of great benefit to society, but there have also been difficulties with drug companies. It is one example of where a litigant would have all sorts of difficulties, because there would be no evidence tracing fault back to the company. Where does the litigant turn to? The best protection that can be offered would be through the act as it exists now. 
It is our responsibility to do all those things necessary to guard against such cases and to offer an avenue of genuine redress. That avenue of redress could be substantially reduced by what the government is seeking to do in this bill and be at greater cost to consumers. It could also lead, as my friend Senator Conroy spoke of, to forum shopping, and that is something that should be guarded against. Evidence presented to the Senate committee showed that litigation under part V, division 1 of the Trade Practices Act had the potential not to strengthen but to undermine state and territory tort law reforms, while the arguments put forward by those supportive of the government's proposed legislation were weak and unconvincing. The amendments in this bill implement recommendation 19 of the Ipp report, preventing individuals from recovering damages for personal injury and death brought about by a breach of part V, division 1 of the act. Arguably, these amendments reduce consumer rights to redress under the Trade Practices Act. For these reasons it is my view that the proposal being put forward by the government to alter the strength of that act should be opposed and should be defeated.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003. I should point out that I am not closing the debate on the bill; I am rising as one of the many interested senators who are concerned about the impact that insurance premium rises are having on the wider community, particularly in the area in which I hold ministerial responsibility—sport and the arts.
I was a bit shocked to hear the closing comments of Senator Buckland opposing this bill. My understanding is that all six Labor states support this bill. Six Labor governments around Australia support this bill and we have just heard that the Labor Party in this chamber opposes the bill. There is a bit of a debate on Senate obstruction these days and whether the debates in this chamber are of a constructive nature or simply of a blocking nature. Those who may be listening to this debate and who listened to Senator Buckland and the comments that he made should understand that Senator Buckland's views are not supported by any Labor government of which I am aware around Australia. The next Labor senator to speak in this debate can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that to be the case.
The public liability and professional indemnity insurance crisis has had a significant impact on the Australian community and despite its limited jurisdiction in this area—and senators will know that the main constitutional responsibility in relation to insurance issues rests with the state governments; perhaps that was not clear from what was said by some of the Labor speakers—the Australian government has taken a lead in trying to progress an appropriate reform agenda. This has involved commissioning the Review of the Law of Negligence—the so-called Ipp review—and chairing ministerial meetings involving all states and territories. At this stage I would like to congratulate the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, on the lead role she has taken in this area in trying to progress reforms with the six Labor states and the two Labor territories. I know Senator Coonan understands that these are key issues, not only in relation to the wider community but particularly in relation to the arts and sports communities. I thank her for the interest and support that she has given. 
Senator Kate Lundy recently put out a press release—and I shall touch on the facts of this a little later in my remarks—looking at the rises in insurance premiums that are being faced by some of the surf lifesaving clubs. I made the point then, and I make it today in this chamber, that this is an issue on which I think Senator Lundy, in attempting to score cheap political points, makes a serious mistake. This is a case where we have to work together to bring about legal changes so that the downward pressure on premiums can be increased. We all understand that there are balancing issues involved and we understand that these are often complex issues but I again put on the public record that Senator Lundy can play a constructive role. 
One of the big issues that have been brought to my attention is the inconsistencies between the state laws relating to public liability insurance matters. The state governments are Labor governments and Senator Lundy is a Labor shadow minister. Those Labor governments have the key constitutional responsibilities in this area and I will be looking very closely to see what constructive action Senator Lundy proposes to take in this area because I believe that she can have an influence. Rather than attempting to score weak political shots with press releases, Senator Lundy can get down to doing some hard work and consulting with her Labor colleagues. And she can bring to the attention of her Labor colleagues in the states the problems that inconsistency in legislation is causing. I put Senator Lundy on notice that this is an issue that I will continue to press with her. 
At the meeting of state treasury ministers in November 2002, treasury ministers agreed to a package of reforms implementing key recommendations of the Ipp review. Ministers agreed to implement these key recommendations, which go to establishing liability on a nationally consistent basis, and each jurisdiction agreed to introduce the necessary legislation as a matter of priority. The Australian government is working to support nationally consistent reform of the law of negligence, and amendments proposed to the Trade Practices Act will ensure that it cannot be used to undermine state and territory civil liability reforms in relation to claims for damages and personal injuries or death. States and territories—and I make this point, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, because I know that you are a man of considerable influence in your own state—have demonstrated their strong support for this bill. The Labor government in Victoria have demonstrated their strong support for this bill and therefore I think it is beholden on you to represent the views of that government and not to attempt to undermine, by any votes or amendments, the general thrust of this bill. I will be monitoring your performance on this in particular because I know that you always seek—
 (Senator Marshall)—Thank you, Senator Kemp. You are not trying to engage me in debate, are you?
—No, I have noted that you sometimes seek to play a constructive role, so I draw to your attention exactly what your Labor colleagues in state governments are saying. I am aware that New South Wales and Tasmania have passed amendments to make the equivalent changes to their own fair trading acts, and other jurisdictions are expected to make similar amendments. So, as I said, I think it is beholden on this chamber to act in a constructive and responsible fashion.  
The Insurance Council of Australia has indicated that enactment of this bill will ensure that cost savings resulting from state and territory liability reforms will be available to be passed on to consumers with confidence and that these savings will not be eroded by claims costs arising from alternative causes of action dealt with in this bill. However, the level of cost savings and the ultimate impact on premiums will therefore depend on the nature and extent of liability reforms in each of the states and territories. I am concerned about the availability and affordability of public liability insurance. It continues to be a major issue of concern to so many not-for-profit arts and sports organisations. And I am particularly concerned about the impact on the not-for-profit arts and sport organisations that fall within my portfolio responsibilities and I continue to work closely with Senator Coonan on their behalf to ensure that their interests are fully considered in the response to the insurance crisis.
Some of these actions in relation to the concerns that have been brought to the attention of Senator Coonan I think have been very productive. Arts and sports organisations have been able to say that they have had at least some of their concerns addressed. In particular, for example, the definition of `recreational services' in the Commonwealth Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Act 2002 includes a sporting activity or similar leisure time pursuit. This act amends the Trade Practices Act to allow people to sign waivers and to assume the risk of participating in inherently risky recreational activities. The specific inclusion of sport in the definition of recreational services was retained despite a suggestion from the Ipp review that would have resulted in it being removed.
While this particular instance represents a good outcome for the sporting sector, it is disappointing that definitional issues and legislation dealing with waivers have not been consistent across the states. I raised this issue at the most recent Sport and Recreation Ministers Council meeting. Ministers agreed to examine the impact of current public liability insurance reforms on sport organisations and, where appropriate, raise issues with their treasury counterparts. Legislative inconsistencies and high premiums continue to be issues of concern for many organisations. I know that within my portfolio legislative inconsistencies across jurisdictions have made the implementation of national policies a challenging task. The Australian government continues to receive representations from organisations expressing frustration that the pace and extent of reform has differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, specifically in terms of providing exemptions to accredited rescue organisations from liability when acting in good faith and in emergency and rescue situations. The Prime Minister, Senator Coonan and I have been working to improve the position of these organisations.
Senator Coonan has raised the position of emergency rescue organisations with treasury state ministers on a number of occasions, to ensure that the work of organisations like Surf Life Saving Australia is not compromised. At their most recent meeting, on 6 August, ministers agreed to clarify the extent to which current legislative provisions operate to give adequate protection for the organisations responsible for emergency rescues, and to report findings at their next meeting. Surf Life Saving Australia is one example of an organisation that is suffering as a result of inconsistent legislative reform. Surf Life Saving Australia only very recently secured public liability insurance for the coming year, with premiums increasing by 152 per cent. There are other examples that one can quote. Time prevents me from going through those in some detail. The general principle remains that the inconsistencies of response, the definitional issues, are causing problems to these organisations. I congratulate Senator Coonan in her efforts to work towards achieving consistency across the states, and I hope that this work will ultimately prove to be very fruitful. 
At the second meeting of treasury ministers on 30 May 2002, the Australian government indicated it was prepared to take a leadership role to deal with risk management where required—and it has demonstrated its commitment in a number of ways. Certainly within the arts and sport portfolio there is a range of work being undertaken around risk management. Research undertaken by the Australian Sports Commission showed that sports organisations were generally not well informed as to their insurances, levels of cover, exclusions and claims history. This indicates that legislative change alone will not solve the current insurance crisis for sporting organisations.
The Australian Sports Commission, I am pleased to report, has taken a proactive and hands-on role in supporting national sporting organisations with their insurance challenges. The commission is providing specific risk management education programs to national sporting organisations and is currently working with the legal fraternity, insurance and sports industries to develop sport focused risk management tools and insurance awareness programs. It has also introduced minimum risk management requirements with respect to funding agreements with national sporting organisations. There have been, I am pleased to report, a number of success stories resulting from action that organisations have taken to improve and strengthen their risk management practices. Let me just instance one case. I understand that Cycling Australia have demonstrated their diligence in risk management to their insurers, and this has resulted in reduced premiums.
Let me conclude by saying that the Australian government has worked, and continues to work, hard to maintain the momentum of reform. It is important that the proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act be passed, to prevent the act from undermining state and territory reforms, to support the benefits of state and territory civil liability reforms being achieved, and to assist in delivering affordable public liability insurance by reducing some of the pressure on insurance premiums.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-10-15,"—I commence my contribution to the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 by placing on the record that One Nation is very concerned about the direction and the cost of insurance in Australia and in our economy. We have moved from being a very low-litigant society, even in relatively recent history, to being one in which at the drop of a hat somebody will turn around and sue somebody else for an incident which in the past we would have accepted partial responsibility for. Our society has moved away from accepting responsibility for the decisions that we make when we participate in certain activities, and that may be from driving a car down the street, to going out to a community hall, to participating in a function, or to participating in a physical activity like motocross, horse riding or skiing—there are numerous examples that we can use.
Now, rather than accepting the responsibility for making the decision to participate, we have moved into this area of practice where we tend not to accept that responsibility. We lay the blame on somebody else—when we are injured by diving into the ocean, we sue the local council, or when we fall off the side of a private swimming pool on a person's property that we had not even been invited to, we have the temerity to turn around and sue the owner. As a society, we have to come back to a situation where we are prepared to accept some of the responsibility for participating in the activities that we set out to participate in. 
The issue of insurance is even impacting on academic people who largely work in universities and provide services. It could impact on a statistician crunching numbers for somebody or it could impact on a company that is largely giving environmental advice. This is not an aspect of personal injury, but we are having so many problems now with personal injury and death because of the other pressures that are being placed upon our insurance industry. One Nation does support the government in their attempts to rein in this ever escalating cost of insurance.
One Nation is also using this opportunity, while the bill amending the Trade Practices Act is in the committee stage, to move amendments to the bill which will amend section 46 of the act. The reason, again, that we will be moving these amendments is that the pressures on the decisions that are being made in this country in relation to market competition are also having adverse effects on our society and the way in which we conduct our business. Section 46 of the Trade Practices Act states that a firm with a substantial degree of market power must not take advantage of that power for an anticompetitive purpose. Many small businesses have expressed frustration with this provision of the act and, more importantly, with how it is actually being administered. Typically, the problem for plaintiffs has been establishing that a defendant with substantial market power has acted for an improper purpose. The issue came to a head in 2002 and 2003 in the context of the Boral case decision by the High Court. The case is widely seen as strengthening the position of big business in fighting off allegations of misuse of market power by small business.
The reason I am raising this issue in the context of this bill is to move an amendment that will bring into the act a provision that will clearly set out what the objects of the act are. My comments are in context because they go directly to the Trade Practices Act. The objects clause—and I indicate to the chamber that I will move this amendment in the committee stage—would insert at the beginning of the Trade Practices Act a set of objects. Those objects would be: to enhance the welfare of Australians through promoting competition and fair-trading and the provision of consumer protection; to encourage the expeditious settling of marketplace disputes by mandatory dispute resolution mechanisms including mediation; and to minimise legal technicalities in the litigation of marketplace disputes that should be settled in a reasonably simple manner. Because of the court's decision in the Boral case the legal arguments around the issue are becoming such an intense cost to industry that they reflect what is happening in the insurance industry as well. There is a comparison between the issue that I am raising and the insurance side of the bill that we are debating.
The objects clause would also ensure that, when disputes in relation to competition and fair trading arise, the act is used to arrive at a resolution which is focused on averting the anticompetitiveness or unfair trade practice which is the subject of the dispute. The amendments in relation to section 46, if they are successful and accepted by the chamber, will take the focus away from the technical arguments that are currently being used and put the focus on the uncompetitive sections that are currently being overlooked. 
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-10-15,"—As I have stated in this place previously, the ABC is a vital element in our nation's broadcasting. Its standing ensures that it wields great influence and plays an indisputable role in shaping debate within Australia, as well as in influencing the way in which we are perceived internationally. Much of this it owes to its position as a taxpayer funded organisation with the resources needed to provide a first-class broadcasting service. That taxpayer status imposes on the ABC a duty to be independent. But it imposes another duty, part of the first but arguably even more important: it must be balanced, non-partisan and accountable. It is proper—actually it is essential—that the ABC be rigorously held to this duty and not only honour it fully but also be seen to honour it fully. When it fails to do so, that is a matter of the greatest importance and should be and must be a cause of deep concern. 
There is here an issue that I have raised before and will raise again until it is fully resolved. In my view it is completely unacceptable that a policy remains in place under which ABC news and current affairs staff are prohibited from referring to Australia's service men and women as `our troops'. In my view Australians are rightly and unashamedly proud of Australia's service men and women, who accept the dangers of going in harm's way for the sake of defending our country and our values. I believe that is the view of the vast majority of Australians too. Our troops are our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives. It is fit and proper that our national broadcaster should refer to them as `our troops' because we are proud of them and grateful for what they do. 
The ABC refuses to accept this. It explicitly prohibits Australian service men and women from being described in the national broadcaster's news and current affairs programs as `our troops'. This is an insult to the Australian Defence Force and all those who serve in the three armed services. But the greatest damage it does is to the ABC, for it highlights a narrow-mindedness, a lack of generosity of spirit, a detachment from the perceptions and understanding of ordinary Australians that can only undermine the ABC and impede it from achieving its mission. I have called several times for this policy that prevents Australian service men and women from being referred to as `our troops' to be revoked. I now call for it again. And let me say this: for as long as that policy remains in place, I will continue to call for its revocation. 
Resolving that matter is, however, merely a first step. It is also essential that the ABC take seriously the issues of bias that I have raised before and that remain pressing. I am deeply disappointed by the dismissive way in which the ABC's managing director responded to the findings of the ABC's Independent Complaints Review Panel review of the complaints brought by Senator Alston. I believe there are many flaws in the panel's review. It plainly sought to set the bar so high that only the most blatant instances of prejudice would be counted as amounting to impropriety. 
But the facts are clear—even that panel found 12 instances of serious bias. Additionally and separately, in 16 instances it criticised the behaviour of the journalists involved generally for failings which seem inconsistent with the standards the community expects from the taxpayer funded ABC. In August I wrote to Mr Balding following the ABC's written responses to questions placed on notice at the estimates hearing in May. Mr Balding wrote back to me last month and several things he said in that correspondence were interesting. But there was one area in particular where I felt he demonstrated the clear fact that, unless change is forced upon it, the ABC will remain a virtual law unto itself in matters of bias and lack of balance. 
Responding to my question about why it should be that leftist—or `politically acceptable' organisations—were not identified as promoting that particular class of political view when being used as talent by the ABC when right-wing think tanks were thus identified, he said this:
Your comments ... appear to suggest that the ABC should label organisations when reporting their comments. The ABC's role is to offer a broad range of views without itself making value judgments about the political or other perspective that a group represents.
Of course, if only the ABC would do that—just that—without the subliminal subtext, then everything would be fine. Mr Balding went on to say:
While I appreciate the point you are making, I believe that if the ABC were to `label' groups as you have suggested, we could rightly be accused of over-simplification and stereotyping.
Dealing with a rash of complaints in that area, of course, would present a wholly new and entirely novel challenge for the ABC's in-house complaints review process. It would give them all a nice change of air—a sea change perhaps, something of real value. There is nothing like a real challenge to get the circulation going. Mr Balding concluded:
We prefer to present a range of views in accordance with our published editorial policies and leave it to the audience to make up their own minds about the merits of these different perspectives.
That is how the system is supposed to work, of course. The problem is that it is not working that way. The problem is that the ABC still does not see that there is a problem. Let us be clear about what is at issue in these cases.
What is at issue is the use by individuals of a taxpayer funded service as a platform for expressing their own prejudices under the pretence of reporting on current affairs. This is an abuse of public moneys. It is completely at odds with the purpose for which these individuals were hired and it is inconsistent with the responsibilities they have been given. It ought to be completely unacceptable, first and foremost, to the management of the ABC. I find it incomprehensible that those individuals who have been found to so abuse their office should simply be allowed to continue as if nothing had happened. It is completely unacceptable that the presenter of AM, Linda Mottram, who has displayed what even the panel describes as `serious bias', should escape censure. It does nothing to convince the community—the community that funds the ABC—that the national broadcaster is serious about balance, accountability and professionalism. 
There are other individuals who also, in my view, deserve censure. One of them is John Shovelan, whom the independent complaints panel found had basically indulged his personal penchant for bad-mouthing the American President from his post in Washington. Another is the head of news and current affairs, Max Uechtritz, who is still stoutly defended by managing director Russell Balding over his highly questionable judgment in conference remarks overseas. 
But it is not only the corporation's failure to act in this respect that is a matter of grave concern. The panel's report, defensive of the ABC as it is, surely made one thing clear. The ABC's much-vaunted complaints review executive is a sham. Even the panel notes that the complaints review executive, when it upheld a complaint, only did so in a grudging way. Obviously there were many faults that the panel found which the complaints review executive had chosen to ignore. This is obvious. It is incontestable. Yet the corporation treats it as if it had not occurred. Rather than admit there is a problem that needs to be addressed, Mr Balding merely notes the panel's `taking a different view to the Complaints Review Executive on some issues'. 
I believe that the ABC must make it a priority to review and improve its processes for dealing with complaints. The fact of the matter is that the ABC's internal complaints-handling processes are far from meeting reasonable expectations. They buy the ABC time, they help put off all but the most determined and they create a pretence of objectivity, but they are merely ways of shielding those who would abuse their positions and keep the community's resources from genuine and effective accountability. A complete overhaul of those complaints procedures is therefore needed.
Since I first raised these issues in this chamber, I have received correspondence from an organisation that calls itself the Friends of the ABC, and I want to read that correspondence to the Senate. The president, Mr Gary Cook, wrote to me and said:
You were reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 17 September, 2003 as having written to ABC Managing Director, Russell Balding, describing yourself as a “true friend” of the ABC.
Please desist from describing yourself as such. To do so is an insult to thousands of members of Friends of the ABC throughout Australia who are passionate devotees of the ABC with no vested interest but to defend the ABC from unwarranted attacks on its editorial independence.
You and your colleague Senator Alston should be held accountable to the Australian taxpayer for wasting countless hours of ABC staff time in answering your baseless allegations.
That was from the Friends of the ABC. I wrote back to them and said:
Dear Mr Cook
I have received your letter of 19 September 2003.
Allow me to confirm to you that the Sydney Morning Herald accurately reported me as a true friend of the ABC.
It is always pleasing to be accurately reported and to have one's views correctly interpreted. Let me also confirm to you my unshakable belief that there are many more (true) friends of the ABC than those who are to be found within the incorporated NSW entity of which you are the president.
These self-proclaimed defenders of the ABC seem to believe that they have the ABC's best interests at heart. They are passionately convinced that all those who question how the ABC conducts its affairs are, by definition, the corporation's enemies. I have no reason to doubt these people's sincerity, but I do believe that, with friends like these, the ABC hardly needs enemies for, like all mere flatterers, they are fake friends who actually cause more harm than good.
If the ABC is to fulfil its charter and rise to its responsibilities, thereby protecting and preserving the standing it has inherited from the past, what it most desperately needs are friends who are willing to speak the truth. It needs friends who will identify those areas where things are not as they should be and insist on the need to meet community expectations to ensure performance to the highest standards. It is in this way, and in this way only, that the corporation's future can be assured. Those in the community who are the ABC's real friends—and I again stress in this place that I count myself among them—therefore should not and cannot shy away from the task of careful monitoring and ongoing review. Doing this is the key to securing an ABC that can match the best in the world in the professionalism and objectivity of its reporting. 
In saying this, I am mindful of a deplorable trend in the ABC's coverage of news and current affairs towards a reliance on exaggeration and sensationalism that is more commonly associated with the worst excesses of British tabloid journalism. I have had the opportunity to read a forthcoming Institute of Public Affairs report, written by journalists Tim Blair and James Morrow, that focuses on what might be termed the `tabloidification' of a once revered Australian institution. All the examples cited in that report relate to the coverage of the recent war in Iraq. I stress that none are from AM, the program examined for bias following Senator Alston's complaint. Suffice it to say that the examples Blair and Morrow cite verge on the lurid. Had they appeared in the daily papers, they would have been held up for scorn by the politically correct as examples of how low the Australian press had sunk. But, because they were on the ABC, they have been allowed to pass without the censure they call for and richly deserve.
To so debase the quality of journalism is not merely at odds with what Australian taxpayers can rightly expect from the broadcaster they fund; it also leads the ABC's journalists to act in ways that are increasingly unacceptable. It is surely this climate of sensationalism that induced an ABC journalist to knowingly place children's lives at risk for the sake of having a good story. I refer to the incident in which an ABC reporter encouraged some Iraqi children to pose near an unexploded bomb so as to make her account of the situation more compelling. It is true that the ABC has stated that such behaviour is inappropriate, and I recognise and applaud it for that, but it has done nothing to address its root causes. ABC management did nothing, at least publicly, until its own watchdog program, Media Watch, got onto them. It is also true that the person concerned has now resigned. But this does not excuse the ABC's original lack of judgment in allowing the screening of vision obviously staged in incredibly dangerous and quite unnecessary circumstances.
Nor is the ABC's problem confined to questions of whether it is, at all times and in all circumstances, perfectly balanced and profoundly unbiased. There are significant management issues that remain unresolved. The decision to cut schools programming and end the production of the veteran current affairs program for students Behind the Newsis, at face value, a matter for ABC management and its board. The decision to end the cadet journalist program is similarly something that, in an independent national broadcaster, is properly a matter for management and the board. But they are both bad decisions. Let me repeat that. They are both bad decisions. They demonstrate that the ABC is more interested in making political statements of its own—and, in relation to the cadet program, cutting off its nose to spite its face—than in controlling cost centres that really are secondary to its core business.
There is no real need to send Mr Uechtritz swanning around the world to make bar room quips at international conferences. There is no need to be quite so generous with the designer clobber they gift to their on-air people. They could probably make some pretty substantial savings in the car fleet, too, if they really tried. I have detailed all these costs in earlier speeches, and I will not go through them again but they are on the record and should be noted. The ABC repeatedly says that it is committed to accountability but it repeatedly provides fresh evidence that it is not. Regrettably, that is the reason that I need to stand up in this place time after time to report on it. If it genuinely thinks it is accountable then now is the time it must show that it is serious about tackling the issues and problems I have been outlining. Until the ABC backs words with deeds, all those who are genuinely committed to the national broadcaster should and will continue to press for the ABC to uphold its charter and meet the demands the community rightly places upon it.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-15,"—by leave—The Senate ordered that there be laid on the table no later than now the following documents relating to the voyage of the MV Cormo Express: the risk analysis concerning the return of the sheep stranded aboard the vessel and the latest master's report revealing mortality aboard the vessel. I am advised by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry that the government is still considering the emergency risk evaluation. However, the minister advises that the information will be made public and provided to the Senate when the government has finished considering it. The minister has provided me with a copy of the master's report dated 13 October, which was sought. This report is no longer the current one, which the government has received this morning.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-15,"—Senator Murray asked me a question during question time on 13 October 2003. It was a question regarding a question on notice to the Attorney-General. The simple answer to the first part of the question on notice asked to the Attorney-General was no because it was not the responsibility of the federal Attorney-General to start an initiative of this nature, as sexual offences are not dealt with in Commonwealth courts. Commonwealth sexual offences are dealt with in the state courts. However I should add that, contrary to the impression given by Senator Murray in this question, the Attorney-General provided a more detailed answer to the second part of Senator Murray's question on notice, drawing Senator Murray's attention to the protections the Commonwealth has enacted for children in criminal proceedings for Commonwealth sex offences. I have another 1½ pages of fairly close type, which I seek leave to incorporate as a complete answer to Senator Murray's question.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Murray asked Senator Patterson, during Question Time, on 13 October 2003:
(1) Is the minister aware that the Attorney-General last week answered `no' to the following question on notice concerning children? That question was:
Given the findings of the Australian Institute of Criminology Issue Paper Number 250 of May 2003, which included the following observations: (a) when asked if they would ever report on sexual abuse again following the experiences in the criminal justice system, only 44 per cent of children in Queensland, 33 per cent in New South Wales and 64 per cent in Western Australia indicated they would; and (b) in a case study of a cross examination in a Queensland committal, the crying child was repeatedly shouted at and asked more than 30 times to describe the length, width and colour of the penis of the accused:
(1) Does the Attorney-General intend to coordinate through the Council of Australian Governments far more sensitive and appropriate methods of enabling reported child sexual assault to be effectively pursued in state and Commonwealth courts and jurisdictions. 
Does the minister representing the portfolio for children and youth affairs agree that to answer `no' to such a question is a shocking and appalling indictment of government insensitivity?
(2) Does the minister representing children accept that such an attitude by the Attorney-General's in saying just `no' to that question means that children will continue to be discouraged from pursuing child sexual abuse in court and that the only beneficiaries of such an outcome are paedophiles? Will the Minister with responsibility for children apply cabinet pressure to change the views of the wrong-headed and hard-hearted in the Attorney-General's office?
Senator Patterson—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:
(1) The simple answer to the first part of the Question on Notice asked of the Attorney-General was `no' because it is not the responsibility of the federal Attorney-General to start an initiative of this nature. Sexual offences are not dealt with in Commonwealth courts. Commonwealth sexual offences are dealt with in State courts.
I should add that, contrary to the impression given by Senator Murray's question, the Attorney-General provided a more detailed answer to the second part of Senator Murray's Question on Notice, drawing Senator Murray's attention to the protections the Commonwealth has enacted for children in criminal proceedings for Commonwealth sex offences.
The Government is committed to protecting children from exploitation and abuse and has led international efforts to combat sexual offences against children. The Government is always looking for opportunities to improve its response to this terrible crime. However, child sexual assault is primarily a matter for State and Territory Governments. It is the responsibility of each State and Territory Government to ensure that there is adequate protection for child complainants and child witnesses in proceedings for child sexual assault under State or Territory criminal laws.
The Commonwealth has already enacted this protection for children in criminal proceedings for Commonwealth sex offences. Relevant Commonwealth offences include Australia's child sex tourism legislation and sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting legislation. The child sex tourism legislation is considered ground breaking, and is one of the toughest of its kind, containing penalties of up to 17 years imprisonment for Australians involved in sex offences against children overseas. This Government introduced strong legislation in 1999 which criminalises some of most serious forms of exploitation of persons. This legislation prohibits slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting for sexual services and provides tougher penalties where a sexual servitude or deceptive recruiting offence is committed against a child under 18.
The model provisions contained in the May 1999 report of the Model Criminal Code Officers' Committee (MCCOC) entitled Sexual Offences Against the Person included improved offences, provisions for the protection of witnesses and complainants in proceedings for sexual offences and provision for a sexual offences counselling immunity. The report was developed in cooperation with State and Territory Governments through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and involved a considerable resource input from the Attorney-General's Department. A number of jurisdictions have implemented the MCCOC recommendations.
The Government's ongoing commitment to fighting child sexual abuse is also demonstrated by a number of recent policy developments. On 11 December 2002, Australia signed the United Nations Protocol relating to Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children. On 8 August 2003, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed to establish a working group to examine options to better integrate the federal family courts with state child protection systems. Another important initiative is the Government's leadership role in combating child abuse in indigenous communities. On 28 August 2003, the Prime Minister announced a commitment of $20 million to address the consequences of violence and child abuse in indigenous communities.
On 13 October 2003, the Government announced a comprehensive whole-of-government strategy to combat trafficking in persons. The initiatives, totalling $20 million, include improved legislative, preventive, law enforcement, and victim support measures. 
These initiatives demonstrate the Government's commitment to investigating, preventing and prosecuting the insidious crime of trafficking in persons, especially women and children.
(2) State and Territory Governments are responsible for ensuring adequate protection for child complainants and child witnesses in prosecutions for child sexual offences under the State and Territory criminal laws. The Commonwealth has already demonstrated a strong leadership role in this area by enacting protections for child complainants and child witnesses in proceedings for Commonwealth sex offences to ensure that child witnesses are able to testify as freely and effectively as possible. The relevant provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 include the following protections:
	a court may disallow a question put to a child witness in cross-examination in a proceeding if the question is inappropriate or unnecessarily aggressive
	a child witness's evidence in proceedings must be given by means of closed-circuit television (some limited exceptions to this rule apply)
	a child witness may choose an adult to accompany the child while the child is giving evidence in a proceeding
	evidence of a child witness's or child complainant's sexual reputation or activities is inadmissible unless the court gives leave or the evidence is of sexual activities with a defendant in the proceedings
	if there is a jury, the judge is not to warn or suggest to the jury that that the law regards children as an unreliable class of witness
As mentioned above, the model provisions contained in the May 1999 report of the Model Criminal Code Officers' Committee (MCCOC) entitled Sexual Offences Against the Person included improved offences, provisions for the protection of witnesses and complainants in proceedings for sexual offences and provision for a sexual offences counselling immunity.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Attorney-General's: Child Sexual         Offences</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-15,"—When Senator Ian Macdonald rose in response to the return to order, the normal courtesy would have been to allow the opposition the opportunity to move to take note of that response. Mr President, I indeed was rising in my place when you called Senator Patterson. I am happy to defer my motion until after the taking note of answers, if that suits the convenience of the government, or I can do it now. But I will be seeking leave to take note of the statement on the return to order, in which Senator Ian Macdonald advised us that Minister Truss has declined at this stage to comply with the return to order in relation to the import risk analysis.
—I think you should do it now.
—I seek leave to move to take note of that response.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Labor does not accept the minister's explanation for the government's failure to comply with the return to order, particularly in relation to the import risk analysis. The explanation is that the government is still considering the document, not that the document does not exist, and no other reason is given. There is no reason that that document cannot be provided to the Senate, particularly as the minister admitted to its existence on 30 September, over two weeks ago. If the government is still considering it—if it is not yet convinced that the impact risk assessment that it has had since 30 September is viable—then one wonders why the government is so adamant that returning the sheep to Australia is a viable option. If it is so convinced, why is the government still considering it? 
That really begs the question, because today is the 72nd day of this Cormo Express fiasco. Fifty-seven thousand sheep left Fremantle on 5 August and arrived in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on 21 August. The ship was scheduled to depart the Kuwaiti port of Shuwaikh, bound for Australia, early this morning, but I understand that there has been a further delay. So it has been in that port for 13 days, when it initially was expected to be in that port for two days. Apparently it will leave later today. The Prime Minister has repeatedly ruled out slaughter at sea.
—So he should.
—It appears the sheep are headed back to the Australian mainland for slaughter following a quarantine inspection at the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Senator Ferguson interjected, `So he should.' I have read what is said in the paper. The government considers that that option is a public relations disaster.
—It's not that at all. It's against our obligations.
—That is an interesting comment, Senator Ferguson. Perhaps you can rise in this debate and tell us what has happened to the 5,000-odd sheep from this voyage that have died. Where were they disposed of? I will tell you where they were disposed of: except for those who remain on the vessel now because they could not be disposed of in the port of Shuwaikh, they have been disposed of at sea. That is the procedure for other live animal shipments where mortalities occur. Indeed, that has been mentioned in a 60 Minutes report and in a number of documents which are circulating—and which I am certain the government, Minister Macdonald and other senators in the chamber are aware of—as a common practice in relation to mortalities on these vessels.
I heard what Senator Ian Macdonald said in relation to some international law issues, but I ask the question: what has happened with the 5,000 sheep who have already died on this vessel, and what has happened to their bodies? I can assure the Senate that they are not still on the vessel and they have not been disposed of in port. We have had no absolutely clear statement from the government on its intention. Information, however, has been dribbling out via media doorstops, radio talkback, background briefings and indeed leaks from the coalition party room. A growing number of nations have rejected the sheep. That is a fact. A number of nations, such as the Indonesian government and the Iraqi interim administration, have publicly reaffirmed that rejection.
The departure of the sheep from Kuwait today is the very reason that the Senate has demanded the documents in its order. It is not a very complicated one. Clearly the government has the documents; that has been admitted by Senator Ian Macdonald. We have a master's report which is three days old. I wonder why we cannot have the latest one—perhaps because it tells us the up-to-date mortality situation on this vessel. Nevertheless, the government has chosen not to produce it. 
The government is steadfastly refusing to disclose its assessment of the quarantine risk associated with the return of the sheep to the Australian mainland or to release proposed quarantine controls. Because the document existed on 30 September, one wonders whether what the government ultimately might release will have been amended to suit the government's political needs, rather than the actual document that we have asked for. I make it clear that the opposition will be insisting on ultimately seeing the document and its variations through whatever process we need to follow to obtain it. The government's refusal to comply with the Senate order today is entirely consistent with the secretive way in which it has dealt with this fiasco. I understand that that document, as I said, has been available since at least 24 September and was referred to by Minister Truss in a press conference on 30 September. I actually wrote to Minister Truss on 1 October asking for that document.
Honourable senators will be aware of a letter from Dr Bill Gee—former chief veterinarian, former head of the international animal health organisation OIE and former President of the Australian Veterinary Association—which has been published in major newspapers over recent weeks warning of dire quarantine concerns and consequences if the sheep return to Australia. He referred to exposure of Australian livestock and native fauna to exotic diseases including sheep pox, blue tongue, screw worm fly and Rift Valley fever.
The National Farmers Federation, the Cattle Council of Australia, the Sheepmeat Council of Australia, WoolProducers, the Australian Meat Industry Council, the Western Australian Meat Marketing Cooperative, the Sheep Breeders Association of Western Australia, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the NSW Farmers Association and the Australian Veterinary Association oppose the return of the sheep on quarantine grounds. This week, Liberal members Mr Tuckey, Mr Haase and Mr Hawker broke ranks with Mr Truss and Mr Howard and openly opposed the return of the sheep. I understand that at least 18 other government backbenchers questioned or criticised at yesterday's joint party room meeting the decision to potentially allow the return of the sheep.
—You obviously weren't there.
—Senator Ferguson suggests that it is not true, but there are very strong stories circulating about that. I suggest I am relying on more reliable sources that I have heard so far.
—More reliable than those that were present?
—They may well be more reliable, for reasons which are well known to those present. Former Victorian Liberal Leader of the Opposition and experienced vet Dr Denis Napthine has also opposed the plan to return the sheep. For weeks, most animal liberation groups, including Animals Australia and Animal Liberation NSW, have advocated slaughter at sea.
An important matter related to quarantine is the impact of the return of the sheep on Australia's trade position. Not only will the return of the sheep without adequate quarantine controls impact on Australia's export markets—in lamb, for example—it will also serve to undermine Australia's defence of its quarantine regime in the World Trade Organisation. An EU challenge on quarantine is currently under way. In the face of all this, the government has said nothing about how it proposes to manage the quarantine risks associated with the MV Cormo Express, nothing about this assessment of risks and—except for the placement of fly swatters on the ship and additional blood tests—nothing about how it will control the risk represented by these sheep. Nor has the government said where the sheep are going to be slaughtered. 
The Senate order demanded the production of the master's report revealing mortality aboard the vessel. We have one that is now three days old, which was tabled by the minister today. But we know that the government receives a daily report because Senator Ian Macdonald told the Senate just that. We have a report that is three days old; I wonder why we cannot have a more up-to-date report. The government should explain that. It was not explained in the statement, other than saying that the government was still looking at it. One wonders why it cannot release for the Senate's information and certainly for public consumption more up-to-date figures on the mortality events for the ship.
While two independent veterinary inspections have cleared the sheep of any infectious diseases or conditions, including scabby mouth, the sheep have been confined to pens aboard the ship for 72 days. At least 5,200 have died, and it is not clear how many might survive a return journey, especially if that journey is via Cocos (Keeling) Islands with some quarantine checks to be conducted there. Australia's livestock and meat processing industries deserve to know how the government proposes to manage the quarantine risk associated with the return of the MV Cormo Express and so do the 57,000 thousand Australians whose jobs depend on Australia's livestock and meat sector not being compromised. The Australian people are sickened by Mr Truss's inept handling of this fiasco, and they deserve an answer on the condition of the sheep aboard the vessel. The Senate deserves full compliance with its return to order, and I ask the minister to reflect on the inadequate response which he has given and table the requested documents.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-10-15,"—I do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily as I appreciate that the take note of answers is still to be dealt with. I do want to respond to Senator O'Brien though and tell him what the people of Australia are really sick and tired of, and that is the opposition playing politics with a matter that is of significant national interest. It is a situation that has arisen not through the government's making but one which we are responsibly addressing, along with the industry and along with many other stakeholders. I do urge Senator O'Brien, who I think, generally speaking, has the interests of Australia at heart, to consider what these petty political attacks on Mr Truss are doing to Australia's reputation.
Mr Truss has received universal commendation for the way in which he has handled this most difficult issue, and I think the people of Australia understand better than you, Senator O'Brien, that this is a difficult situation and it has to be worked through. You raised the issue of disposal at sea. The legal advice I have is that sheep dying on the way over were macerated and disposed of—this is allowed for under the convention. But that is a bit different from throwing overboard 50,000 recently killed sheep with their stomachs slit open. That is in conflict with the London convention on disposal of wastes at sea, as I am advised. There is a very big difference between disposing of 20 or 30 sheep overboard a day while the ship is moving and 50,000 sheep overboard, and I would have thought that whether or not that is the legal position—although I am advised it is—even commonsense would explain the difference between those two situations. 
I reiterate that the minister for agriculture has advised that the information will be made public, and I anticipated that when I first answered this question. The government has been investigating it and looking at putting in place risk management regimes in conjunction with the industry. The master's report has been tabled. The most recent master's report only arrived this morning and has not been considered but it will be made available.
Mr Truss has been open—I will not say more open, because government ministers are always open in everything that they do—and I do not think anyone could criticise the openness with which Mr Truss has dealt with this matter. He has held regular news conferences. He has appeared on national television. He has explained the government position. He has not hidden anything whatsoever. It is a most difficult position and whichever way you turn there are problems to be addressed. The government is addressing those problems maturely and responsibly. I would have thought that this is one instance—there are not many that happen in our business—where national wellbeing would override any political point scoring that might be thought to be obtained from this very difficult issue.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by opposition senators today.
Today we have seen this government exposed yet again for its soft-touch regulation when it comes to dealing with the top end of town. Let us just revisit history for a minute. When the government released their much-vaunted first draft CLERP bill nearly one year ago, their proud boast was the 72 pages and 44 recommendations in the bill. But there was one issue that never got a mention in the 72 pages and 44 recommendations. There are no prizes for guessing it was about executive remuneration. Twelve months ago, in your big CLERP 9 document, there was not one word. You have been dragged screaming and kicking on this issue.
—What did you do about it?
—Senator Ferguson asks what we proposed. Our proposals were already on the table. We had already put our proposals on the table. This is a government that is soft on the big end of town. This is a government that has been forced to adopt Labor's proposals on how to deal with corporate excess. The strategy from this government on this issue is: what is the minimum we can try to get away with to look respectable? We have seen the government dissembling.
Ross Cameron blew the whistle. Last Friday in the Australian Financial Review he said that shareholders should stop indulging in `carping negativity', because they dare to ask questions about why their shareholders' funds are being looted by CEOs in this country. We are not talking about the US and the grossly obscene excess we have seen there; we are talking about the looting of Australian publicly listed companies, and shareholders have had enough. Ross Cameron is out of touch when it comes to this issue. We have seen the sort of excess—and I know that some of my colleagues are going to talk about some of it—and the looting that has gone on. 
We have seen David Higgins, the ex-CEO of Lend Lease, take home $8 million on his departure including—and wait for this—he has lost $715 million of shareholders' funds in one year. They paid him $1.61 million to not go and work for a rival. I would have paid him that much to go and work for their rivals! That was what they gave him. This year we have seen David Murray of the CBA take home $2.5 million. That is a 7.4 per cent increase for running the Commonwealth Bank despite the fact that the bank's net profit slumped 24 per cent.  
That is what gets up the nose of shareholders; that is why it is important that something be done about this sort of excess. Why? I want to quote from the Harvard Business Review about why these reforms are important:
When shareholders fail to engage, either in setting direction or holding board members accountable for their behaviour, an important link in the governance system is missing. In this context, a director's allegiance shifts from its proper base—the shareholders—to the nearby boardroom, where fellow directors and management fill the void.
What Labor has been about in leading this debate is empowering shareholders. What has been the Prime Minister's attitude? Let us talk about the crocodile tears of the Prime Minister. The only thing John Howard has ever done about corporate excess in this country is talk about it. In 1996, in relation to wage restraint, Mr Howard said:
... the obligation to display wage restraint, the obligation to ensure that wage increases are linked to productivity gains, is not an obligation that is confined to people on low and middle incomes. It is an obligation that is also to be accepted and to be met in full by people on high incomes.
This government has a record; it is a record of self-regulation and light touch regulation, and it has been the green light for corporate greed. We will not get much out of this government. As they describe it, they are committed to finding the right balance. That is a balance that does the minimum amount it can to stamp down on corporate greed in this country. We have to do more than just what is in this package if we are going to give shareholders power, start reining in the greed and get the snouts out of the trough.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-10-15,"—The Senate is taking note of certain matters that relate to what is commonly referred to as CLERP 9. For those listening to this debate, that refers to a coalition initiative, the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, a great initiative by the government. I would like to take this opportunity of acknowledging the outstanding contribution made by the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Hon. Ian Campbell, in developing this bill and this act. His contribution was very significant and no doubt contributed to the Prime Minister's decision to elevate him to ministerial status.
Interestingly, this bill was referred to a Senate committee before it hit the parliament. It was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which for the first time looked at a major matter in relation to the private sector. The JCPA has had a long history of actively seeking to improve the role and independence of the Commonwealth Auditor-General, and the government believed that it was an essential agent of the government's accountability to parliament and for ensuring that there was good corporate governance in the public sector. This inquiry was a great opportunity for the committee to bring its expertise on audit, corporate governance and other matters to independently review this particular legislation. The examination was carried out and the report was presented in August 2002.
What is surprising is that it was a unanimous report from a committee that included Labor members and senators. It is also surprising to find that since that report has come down, the Labor Party have moved away from what is in those recommendations. That is indeed unfortunate. The Labor Party then took a position different from that which they are taking today. In a sense, there is a little bit of political opportunism here, because this is a far-reaching reform, an initiative of this government, to overhaul certain deficiencies which were in the law. There were deficiencies, and we are not walking away from that, and there were excesses. I remind honourable senators that those excesses were not nearly as bad as those in the United States, but we all have some sorrowful memories of HIH and other disasters. In relation to the opposition's current position, I will quote from the report of the joint committee—a unanimous report—where it says: 
The Committee is not convinced that an overly prescriptive reaction is warranted or appropriate.
I remind honourable senators that senators opposite in the ALP are now asking for an overly prescriptive approach—just the opposite to what was laid down earlier. The report goes on to say:
It is impossible to demand infallibility or implement a `zero-risk' policy.
Directors must take risks; they must get rewarded. The report continues:
Given the inherent risk of business and the need for risk to drive entrepreneurial activity, a risk management rather than a risk aversion approach is appropriate and increased accountability should be demanded of the corporate sector and audit profession.
It is significant that the government responded very positively to that unanimous report and agreed with virtually all of it. Where they did not agree they said that the concepts were embodied in the report as such and did not need a detailed prescription. We have here a situation where the Labor Party previously felt that detailed black-letter law was not appropriate but are now coming around to wanting that detailed prescription.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise to speak to Senator Conroy's motion, and I wish to speak particularly to answers given by the Assistant Treasurer in question time today. What we saw today, again, was the inaction and timidity that characterises this government's approach to corporate governance and corporate regulation. The CLERP 9 discussion paper was released in September last year. We have had it out for a year but it is only now that we have finally got to the stage of having a bill. Surprise, surprise, it is a draft bill, so we are going to have a further period of consultation with the corporate sector about regulation before anything can be done to rein in some of the documented corporate excesses which Australians have become sick and tired of.
So first there was inaction from the government and then, if you look at the text of the bill and the minister's answers today, timidity. They are extremely timid in their response to the corporate sector. One wonders why. Are they simply frightened of scaring the big end of town by requiring them to disclose properly to shareholders some of the practices in their boardrooms? The Howard government continues to put the interests of directors over those of shareholders despite their championing of Australia as a shareholding society. They keep playing to the big end of town instead of improving corporate practice and reining in corporate excess.
Today the Assistant Treasurer was asked a number of questions. One of them from me was this: why ought not directors disclose, when they are seeking election to a board, the relationship between the director and the company? Why ought not the director disclose that? The minister could not provide an answer to that. She could not provide a good reason why shareholders ought not be told, if a director is seeking election to a board, whether a director has a commercial or other relationship with a company or a relationship with one of the other directors. One fails to see what shareholder value would flow from such relationships. If there were shareholder value in such relationships, then you come back to the question of why you would not disclose it. Is it such an onerous task to disclose it? These are not issues that the minister chose to address in her answer. Instead she went on and on about not wanting to be too prescriptive. Her mantra is that CLERP 9 has struck the right balance and that the government does believe in transparency and disclosure. It seems they believe in transparency, but only a little bit of transparency, and disclosure, but only a little bit of disclosure. 
Another question the minister failed to properly answer in question time is why CLERP 9 proposals fail to prohibit a company loan to directors. This is a question I am sure a lot of Australians would be interested in. Why is it that directors might have access to either interest-free or cut-rate loans from companies when the rest of Australia has to go to a bank or other financial institution for this sort of credit? Is there shareholder value in permitting these loans to be advanced? If there is, perhaps someone on the government side can get up and explain to me what shareholder value is to be found in allowing companies to provide capital in the form of loans to directors at a cut-price rate. I cannot see how that leads to better corporate governance or in fact leads to more profitable public companies, and that is what we are talking about here. Again, the Assistant Treasurer simply goes on and on about not wanting to be prescriptive, which seems to be the standard response when asked why they are not doing anything at all.
We are simply told by the government that we in the ALP know nothing about doing business. I wait with bated breath for an explanation from the government benches as to why things such as disclosure of a relationship with the company and disclosure of a relationship with other directors are bad for doing business, why they would be such a fetter on the ability of business to engage in its activities, and finally why loans to company directors ought be permitted. I wait with bated breath for the explanation as to why these are important issues. Perhaps the minister could also explain how those things would be to the detriment of shareholders. If this government is interested, as it keeps announcing, in disclosure and in shareholders being informed about the activities of companies, why is it opposed to basic disclosure of things such as relationships between directors seeking election?

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-10-15,"—Today is a very interesting day. Later on we will debate an MPI based on the performance of this government in relation to the economy. I have never seen such a free kick to the government as that which will be proposed by Senator George Campbell at a later date in relation to the Australian economy. If there is one area involving the interests of Australians that this government can be terribly proud of, it is what has happened to our economy since 1996, when you compare it to our predecessor. We have Senator Conroy getting up and talking about executive remunerations and other things that this government has acted on in the time it has been in power, particularly in relation to CLERP 9. For 13 years Senator Conroy and his party did absolutely nothing about executive directors' remuneration—not a thing. The only party that is interested in making sure that there is some equality and some fairness in relation to directors' remuneration is this party, the government party, the Liberal-National parties. Senator Conroy comes in here and complains, and yet he and his party did absolutely nothing—not a thing—over a period of 13 years. We have this political opportunism from people like Senator Conroy and Senator Wong, who has just spoken, who feel that they can touch some little political nerve whenever we see the publicity about some executive remuneration. 
My colleague Senator Watson has already explained as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit that the Labor Party joined with the government in 2002 in a unanimous report in relation to executive remuneration, transparency and a range of other issues that were covered in that report. What has changed in the view of the Labor Party in relation to that unanimous view that they held only last year? Is it because they see some political opportunism because of public comment or have they gone back on the principles that were enshrined in that report, which was unanimous? That was report 391 of the joint public accounts committee. All I can say is that Senator Conroy, as spokesman, ought to go back and look at what his party thought 12 months ago. Perhaps he wants to come in here and say, `We were wrong; we should never have supported the unanimous view of this committee; we should have done something entirely different and gone our own way. We should have put an overly prescriptive regime in place. We made a mistake in 2002 in joining with the unanimous report of the public accounts committee.'
What Senator Conroy and Senator Wong want is black-letter law, more prescription. We have got to the stage now where we have had exposure drafts, where we have had a unanimous report and where we have given all the stakeholders a chance to have a say. Shareholders will have a far greater say than they ever had under the Keating government and the Hawke government. In the 13 years of Labor government there was no prescription whatsoever. They were very happy to let executives have a free rein then, but all of a sudden, having written and been part of a unanimous report, they have changed their minds and told nobody. Shareholders now have a say when previously shareholders had no say. When Senator Conroy talks about reining in the excesses of some executive directors, perhaps he ought to think about reining in the excesses of some of the union leaders who dominate his party. In many ways, the excesses of union leaders affect what happens in this country in a far greater way than anything that executives might do.
Report 391, the report of the joint public accounts committee, has dealt with transparency and disclosure. That is the important thing. We now have a situation where the government's CLERP package is designed to improve disclosure and transparency in relation to executive remuneration packages. This government has achieved the right balance, and what we want in this whole affair is the right balance between being overly prescriptive and black-letter law. This government has achieved the right balance in improving the level of disclosure to shareholders and in avoiding prescriptive regulations that will overburden companies with red tape.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I also rise to take note of Senator Coonan's answers in respect of questions asked of her today regarding CLERP 9. I look forward to hearing Senator Ferguson's contribution to the debate that will follow this one in respect of the government's performance on debt. I look forward to hearing his contribution, but I do not think he will be allowed near the debate at all.
In coming back to the issue of CLERP 9 and the questions to Senator Coonan today, Labor did not say that we were opposed to what is in CLERP 9. We welcome some of the reforms. We are particularly happy to see the government adopting Labor's proposals in respect of giving shareholders a non-binding vote on executive remuneration policy. But the reality is that the government has refused to take the issues far enough to deal with what are substantial excesses by the big end of town. 
In his contribution, Senator Watson talked about the excesses as if they were in the past—that they were gone, that no more excesses were occurring, that they had all been cleaned up. He spoke as though CLERP 9 had put the clamp on the corporate sector. Let me tell Senator Watson what happened yesterday at the annual general meeting of Southcorp, one of our biggest companies: they reported a $923 million loss and halved the share value of the company. That was the performance that the executive directors of Southcorp reported to their annual general meeting yesterday. But what did they do when it came to executive salaries? The CEO got a payout of $6 million and the top 10 executives got a payout of more than $1 million each. This is a company that has just lost $1 billion, that has just halved its share price, and the executives have got performance payment for doing it. And that is exactly what the corporate sector in this country has been doing since the mid-1990s: rewarding itself for corporate failure.
Senator Watson knows that there was a litany of corporate greed in this country in that period. Look at the performance of the executive directors of HIH. They ripped off people who had put their money into that company. Look at the performance of George Trumbull on AMP. He took a major company, put it down the gurgler and then took off to the United States with $13 million in his back pocket. They are the sorts of people who are running major companies in this country today. Look at Gilbertson from BHP Billiton. With $30 million in his back pocket, he said, `Thank you very much. See you later, friends. I'm off. I've got my share of the stake.'
We would be happy to support the government's reforms, but I do not think you are serious about them. You only have to look at the statement of your Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in the Financial Review on Friday. He said that we should not be obsessed with emoluments to executives and directors, that we should not worry about that. But you are obsessed with black-letter law when it comes to trade unionists and the union movement. You have about 12 bills wanting to put in place black-letter law, and you will have a whole raft of bills wanting to put in place black-letter law in the building industry when those bills eventually come before this chamber. It is all right for you to adopt the black-letter law approach—and I see you are smiling, Senator Brandis—
—I am always smiling.
—Be careful, because the voters might wipe the smile off your face at the next election. You are quite happy to bring black-letter law into this chamber when it comes to ordinary workers and suppressing their rights in the workplace, but you say that black-letter law is not an appropriate response to dealing with the excesses of executives of major companies in this country. Senator Watson, you know they have been like bees around the honey pot for the past decade, and this government has done nothing about putting the lid back on it—and you will not do it because you are not prepared to take on the people at the big end of town.
—It is a discussion paper, nothing more. Where is the legislation?
—Senator George Campbell, address your comments through the chair. 
—It is nothing more than a discussion paper, and it will be interesting to see—(Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I rise today to discuss a matter of major public importance, and that is principally the massive explosion that has occurred in consumer debt in this country and the fact that the government has done nothing to rectify the problem.
Since 1996 we have witnessed a massive explosion in debt in all areas of the Australian economy, particularly in foreign debt but also in relation to household debts. The government will claim that this is due to the increasing size of housing loans. Obviously that is a worrying part of the trend. However, the most significant increase has been in consumer debt, and this has the potential to increase the vulnerability of Australian families, reduce our long-term growth potential and reduce our economic sovereignty. The share of consumer debt to total household debt has gone from 16 per cent in 1996, when this government was elected, to 35 per cent in 2003. The rate of total household debt to disposable income has gone from 16 per cent in 1990 to an estimated 146 per cent by June 2003.
The majority of this increase has taken place under the economic stewardship of the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Treasurer, Peter Costello. The difference between income and consumption expenditure, or the borrowing gap, not including housing purchases, has increased from $13 billion in 1996 to $55 billion in 2002-03 or from four per cent to around 11 per cent of disposable income. According to the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, the build-up of consumer debt explained roughly one-third of Australia's growth rate between 1996 and 2001 and for the last two years has roughly matched the entire growth rate in GDP. Let me repeat this. According to one of the leading economic institutes, all of Australia's growth in the last two years and a third of the growth between 1996 and 2001 were solely due to an unsustainable explosion in consumer debt. This is not due to the housing boom; this is people consuming now and paying later.
This has been accompanied by a massive decline in Australia's savings. The net household savings ratio has fallen from 10 per cent in 1990 to minus 0.5 per cent in March 2003. That simply means that Australia as a whole is not saving anything. We are running down our present savings to pay our debts. These two circumstances, a massive increase in debt coupled with a negative savings rate, have some very serious consequences, a number of which I will touch on later. Access Economics stated that Australia is the most interest rate sensitive market in the world because we rely so heavily on debt—that is, the government's preferred economic consultants say that Australian families are extremely vulnerable to any interest rate changes. The government knows this is a problem, and it has known this since 1998. In the 1998 Senate estimates, Mr Ted Evans, the then Secretary to the Treasury, said:
Economic problems, almost wherever they occur, go to the question of debt—which is why Australian governments have been intent on reducing public sector debt to make the government sector less vulnerable. That same advice ought to go to private borrowers as well.
This is the government's chief economic adviser saying in 1998 that the level of household debt was making families vulnerable and that the government should do something about it. That was when household consumer debt was $61 billion. It is now over $230 billion—I repeat: over $230 billion—yet the government has done nothing to address this issue. 
The Reserve Bank has revealed that, last June, credit card debt totalled $24.24 billion, a jump of $205 million on May's figure. This debt rose from $6.6 billion in March 1996 to $24.24 billion in June this year, constituting an increase of something like 400 per cent. Insolvency and Trustee Services Australia, ITSA, released statistics last week that showed another worrying leap in debt agreements. For the previous year, 4,395 debt agreements were entered into. This is a significant rise on the preceding year, when 3,805 debt agreements were entered into—a rise of some 15.5 per cent. These figures mean that, even at the low interest rates we currently enjoy, many Australian families are having trouble meeting their financial commitments.
Mr Acting Deputy President, what do you think will happen when interest rates rise? This is not about talking down the economy, as Treasurer Costello constantly complains—although I am sure we will be accused of that by those on the other side of the chamber when they get to their feet—but at some point the reality is that interest rates will rise. Let me outline to you what will happen then: people will decide that they cannot afford to borrow to finance current consumption, so they will stop consuming. This will lead to an economic downturn and job losses, leading to a decline in property prices. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, warned last week that home owners holding $14 billion in mortgages could default on their repayments under a scenario of a 30 per cent plunge in property prices. This is what the government's own financial watchdog says could happen if interest rates go up.
Dr John Laker, board member of APRA and Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank, had some interesting things to say last week. He said:
The recent momentum of the housing market cannot be maintained. Credit growth must inevitably return to a more sustainable relationship with nominal GDP ...
Further:
Looking ahead, the main potential source of risk to financial stability would be a substantial correction in the housing market, impacting on the balance sheets of authorised deposit taking institutions through mortgage defaults.
This economic fall will obviously be greater because of the factors that have driven its growth in the last two years—essentially, consumer debt. Australia is spending more than it actually has. If our growth had been based on an expansion of industries exporting manufactured goods, the economy could survive a decline in domestic demand arising from interest rate increases. Since our industries have been driven by and have responded to domestic demand, this reduction in consumption will hit the economy hard. In fact, the economy will be hit harder than many people think, because the nature of the economy has been altered by the rise of consumer debt.
National Economics has set out three ways that household debt has adversely affected the manufacturing sector. Firstly, the debt explosion has crowded out direct foreign investment in manufacturing by forcing the interest rates and exchange rates higher than would otherwise have been the case. Secondly, it has allowed unsustainable growth in domestic demand resources, which would have otherwise been allocated to manufacturing expansion and has been reallocated to support the expansion in the construction and services sectors. This has resulted in a permanent loss of capacity and exports. Thirdly, this government has begun to think it is too easy. The coalition continues to believe that high and sustained economic growth can be achieved by letting the finance sector drive the economy. This government has cut export assistance and industry assistance programs and is lazy in its efforts to attract direct capital inflow. This will come back to haunt us when interest rates begin to rise and we can no longer rely on domestic demand to sustain economic growth. 
As discussed earlier, this has reduced our potential long-term economic growth rate. The debt explosion has led to a massive increase in levels of foreign debt, increasing our current account deficit, increasing Australia's vulnerability to international monetary changes and reducing our economic sovereignty. This consumer debt has almost solely been funded by foreign borrowings, which have tripled over the seven-year period between 1996 and 2003, from approximately $60 billion to $183 billion. This is clearly a position that is not sustainable.
When John Howard was Treasurer back in 1983, the current account deficit was minus 3.5 per cent and net foreign debt was 7.4 per cent. He helped blow out this debt by increasing Commonwealth general government net debt in his years as Treasurer, from one per cent of GDP up to 7.9 per cent of GDP when they were thrown out of office in 1983. And now foreign debt has hit an all-time record under the Howard government. It is $362 billion, and has doubled since Peter Costello became Treasurer in 1996. Who can forget the debt truck? Remember the debt truck that the Liberal Party toured around this country, saying that our foreign debt was at unsustainable levels? I again make the point that the Treasurer, who was a prime promoter of that debt truck, and the Prime Minister have managed to double our foreign debt in the seven years from 1996 till 2003. Who will ever forget the coalition partners, when they were in opposition, taking around this country the debt truck, parading it around the nation at that particular time?
And what did Prime Minister Howard say about the debt truck at that time? In a speech to the Real Estate Institute on 17 October 1995, he had this to say:
The debt truck has helped heighten in the eyes of the Australian community the link between our level of overseas debt and the high level of interest rates ... obviously if one has to borrow money from a situation where one is already in debt, when one is heavily mortgaged ... obviously one is going to be charged a premium ... The same thing applies for a nation.
Under the Howard government's economic management, that debt truck has become a road train that is now parked in the driveway of every household in this nation. Where is the debt truck? We have not seen it since 1996. They obviously have a big garage somewhere. They have stuck it in there, the cobwebs have grown over it and they have forgotten about the issue. They have conveniently forgotten all of the things they said to the Australian public in 1993, 1994 and 1995 about foreign debt, because they cannot sustain their arguments any longer, given that they have managed to double it in the short period of seven years.
This government is incredibly hypocritical when it comes to the most economically justifiable form of debt—that is, public sector debt financed infrastructure. There is nothing wrong with debt if the capital raised is invested and brings a return—be it social or private—that is greater than the sum borrowed and the subsequent interest payments. Yet this government is obsessed with running the nation's budget like a household budget. It does not realise the difference between a family running a household budget on $30,000 or $40,000 and the federal government with outlays in the tens of billions of dollars every year. Quite frankly, if a CEO ran a company with the zero debt mantra of this government, they would be laughed out of office. In fact, quite a few of them have in recent times; although they have taken most of their company's assets with them on the way. 
Productive investment financed by debt is a good thing; it is completely different from the massive consumer debt we are debating in this chamber. We should note that Peter Abelson, of Applied Economics, has found that the most efficient method of funding urban infrastructure is public sector borrowing or public sector bonds. The government's access to cheap interest rates, often at half the rates developers would have to pay, makes public sector debt financed infrastructure a more efficient option. Peter Abelson was quoted as saying: 
... for every $100 million of infrastructure, the community pays an extra $4 million to $5 million a year for the government's refusal to raise public money to finance the infrastructure.
These are serious issues that merit further discussion, and they stand in stark contrast to what we are discussing today, which is this government's failure to curb the massive explosion in consumer debt which has led to an increase in the vulnerability of Australian households to interest rate changes; a reduction in the productive potential of Australia's manufacturing sector; a decline in Australia's long-term rate of economic growth; and a massive increase in levels of foreign debt, increasing our current account deficit, increasing Australia's vulnerability to international monetary changes and reducing our economic sovereignty.
The reality is, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the government is sailing along, skimming along, on a fair wind at the moment, but once that wind turns you watch how rapidly the vulnerability of this Australian economy and its consumer debt and foreign debt will be exposed. You watch how rapidly things will change. We will have an entirely different set of circumstances to deal with that will be much more difficult to deal with in the longer term than were the circumstances that arose in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. For these reasons the government should be condemned, and I commend this matter of public importance to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Consumer Debt</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-10-15,"—I have to begin by saying how much I like Senator George Campbell. I like Senator George Campbell immensely. One of the things I like most about Senator George Campbell is that he has a terrific sense of humour! Just think of a Labor senator who was a union heavy before he came into this chamber, as was Senator George Campbell, coming into this chamber and giving this government a lecture on economic management. What a rich sense of irony Senator George Campbell must have. But it does not stop there. The economic issue on which Senator George Campbell decided to mount his critique of the Howard government was nothing other than the issue of debt. He must have thought we were having a pretty sleepy Wednesday afternoon and that we needed a bit of cheap entertainment—to have a Labor frontbencher coming into the Senate saying that the Howard government ought to be condemned on the issue of debt. Debt! When the Labor Party last had the reins of the Treasury, his party rolled up the public debt of this country to $96 billion. After 7½ years of hard work, proven economic management and skilful policy settings, the Howard government has reduced the $96 billion debt mountain which was left to us by Senator George Campbell's party to $30 billion. The Howard government has reduced that debt by more than two-thirds in only 7½ years. And Senator George Campbell—I have to give it to you, Senator Campbell; you have more front than Mark Foys—comes in here and gives us a lecture about debt. 
Let us run through the economic indicators which tell us what the policy successes of the Howard government and the economic outcomes delivered by Treasurer Peter Costello have brought to Australia. First of all, for the second consecutive month, we have unemployment at 5.8 per cent—functional full employment. Unemployment with a five in front of it: the old light on the hill aspiration that the Labor Party never delivered on but the Howard government has. That is the lowest unemployment figure for 13½ years. The second thing is inflation. The current inflation rate in Australia is 2.7 per cent. Consistently during the period of the Howard government the inflation rate has been within the target range prescribed by the Reserve Bank. The great destroyer of prosperity, the great destroyer of jobs—inflation—has been tamed by the Howard government. The third thing is interest rates. At the moment, the standard variable housing interest rate in this country is 6.55 per cent. Do you know how long ago it was that interest rates in this country were that low? It was in 1963, when I suspect Senator George Campbell was still on the Clydeside or wherever he came from. That was the last time that interest rates in Australia were as low as they are now. Yet Senator George Campbell comes into this chamber and gives us a lecture on debt!
Let me give you some other indicators, not from the government but from surveys conducted within the business community. Did you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the National Australia Bank index of business conditions in August this year indicated the most favourable business conditions in nine years? Did you know that the index of consumer confidence in September this year was just shy of the nine-year high posted in July this year? So we have the highest business confidence in nine years, the highest consumer confidence in nine years, the lowest interest rates in 30 years, the best employment figures in 13½ years, the best inflation figures in memory—and Senator George Campbell comes in here and gives us a lecture about the government's economic management! But do not just take it from me. Let us hear what the OECD has to say. In March 2003, the OECD published its annual survey of the Australian economy 2003-04. Let me read to you from the summary of its findings—its report card, in effect—on the record of the Howard government:
Dogged pursuit of structural reforms across a very broad front, and prudent macroeconomic policies firmly set in a medium-term framework, have combined to make the Australian economy one of the best performers in the OECD, and also one notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external. Incomes growth has remained brisk, employment is expanding, inflation is under control, and public finances are healthy. All the indications are that the continuing effects of previous reforms will continue to help the economy to combat shocks in the immediate future ...
Underpinned by historically low interest rates, rising terms of trade, strong productivity growth, a generous subsidy to first-time home buyers and high levels of business and consumer confidence, domestic demand growth has barely been affected by the recent cyclical downturn in most other OECD countries.
That is the report card of the OECD, the assessment by external economists; that is not Howard government propaganda. As you would know, being an economist yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry, OECD economists are very tough minded. That is their appraisal of the Howard government. 
I should interrupt myself to say that there is one area that the OECD singled out for criticism in the economic management or the structure of the Australian economy. Do you know what the OECD said was the largest outstanding problem? It was the failure of the Howard government to effect sufficient structural reform in the labour market. We know why that is: because on 16 consecutive occasions in the last 7½ years the reforms the Howard government has been trying to make to free up the labour market have been blocked in the Senate by Senator George Campbell and his ilk; and, to their shame—because they should have more sense—Senator Murray and the Australian Democrats. So the one black mark against the Australian economy, according to the OECD, is that authored by our good friend Senator George Campbell. 
There is one other statistic I want to tell you about, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator George Campbell warned us of the terrible consequences of household debt. The best measure of the impact of household debt on individual households is personal bankruptcies. In the last year, personal bankruptcies have fallen from approximately 6,000 to approximately 5,000. That indicator—it is a lagging indicator—speaks the opposite of the message that Senator George Campbell is trying to give us today.
Let me turn to what the shadow Treasurer, the member for Werriwa, Mr Mark Latham, thinks about Senator George Campbell's argument. This is what Mr Latham told Paul Sheehan, the Sydney Morning Herald columnist, in an article on 1 April 2002. Allow me to quote Mr Sheehan:
Interestingly, Latham isn't worried about debt. Like all good capitalists, he thinks our increased debt has been put to good use. “Debt is always relative to assets,” he told me. “In the mid-1980s, Australians held $4 in assets for every $1 in household income. Today, they hold $6.50 in assets for every $1.”
He even believes that much of the growth in levels of credit card debt has been put to productive use. “More than 50 per cent of small-business financing in Australia comes off the credit card. Most of these small-business operators can't afford an accounts department.” Many people who run small businesses are shrewdly using the centralised credit card and billing facilities of credit card companies as a cheap back-office operation.
That is Mr Mark Latham's view of Senator George Campbell's argument. So there we have it. This representative of the political party that over 13 years drove this economy into the dirt—
—The guilty party!
—The guilty party—that had home interest rates at 17 per cent—comes and lectures us. It is a joke!",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Consumer Debt</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-15,"—Whoever said that lawyers were dry and boring! I thank Senator George Campbell for the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. It does allow the Australian Democrats to express their views on the items he draws attention to concerning the national economy. Before I remark on my views, I would like to remark on the views of the Prime Minister. I think the Prime Minister deserves the very high reputation he has for political acumen. He has the caution that comes from a great experience and great knowledge of the political world. I recall him frequently saying, both to his party room and the public at large, that the worst thing you can do in government is to start to show the signs of hubris, overconfidence, arrogance and triumphalism. Forgive me for saying so, Senator Brandis, but I smelt, detected, heard and felt all those attributes in your remarks and, indeed, in the remarks of others within the coalition. I think it is a truism known to all men and women who participate in public affairs, probably over the many thousands of years we have been at this political game as a race, that it is when you are at your peak, at your most triumphant and at the top that you are most at risk. I seem to recall Julius Caesar was murdered at the very height of his powers. I am not suggesting anyone should murder this government—far from it—but I do suggest that Senator George Campbell has drawn attention to some concerns about where the economy is at present. 
Obviously, the government are going to criticise the Labor Party for their record on interest rates, and it is a cross they have to bear. That is as inevitable as the sun coming up in the morning. But, rather than simply going back 10 years and talking about the Hawke-Keating era, which is now in the long distant past, we should be concerned with the current economic climate in the country. The Democrats have been raising the problems that we see in Australia's economy for many years, and particularly in the past year. To put this in perspective, I must acknowledge that at the moment the picture is positive and that the government do deserve credit where credit is due. In particular, they have reduced public sector debt in a major way and they have balanced the books. There are low interest rates historically, low inflation and low unemployment—although not low enough. Economic growth is reasonable to good, and the government is in surplus for the reasonably foreseeable future. 
But, if that is a good story, we have to look at the flip side, the darker side. Although our interest rates are low by historical standards, they are high in real terms and they are high by international standards. What the government is failing to tell Australians is that, compared with the rest of the developed world, we are paying high interest rates. And it is worrying that economists, and even more worrying that the Reserve Bank, are talking about interest rate rises, possibly by the end of the year and certainly by next year.
This is unusual, as the last recorded economic growth figure did show GDP increasing by only 0.1 per cent in the June quarter, although I do recognise that was a low point and it is unlikely to continue at that low point. Everyone in the country knows that over the past few years we have had a massive boom in housing prices. This boom is unsustainable but has been fuelled by the government's policies. These policies have created as many losers as they have winners. For every property owner that has made a significant capital gain, another family has been unable to enter the housing market. For every happy seller there is a sad buyer who will find that they have paid too much. The buyer may be left with a massive debt when the property market cools. Senator Coonan today acknowledged that APRA is so concerned that it has assessed whether banks can take a 30 per cent drop in housing prices. That is pretty substantial. If there is one constant in economic history, it is that booms always end.
I mentioned our internationally high interest rates. It is worth pointing out that another consequence of this is a higher Australian dollar, particularly against the US dollar, and a negative impact on farmers and exporters, which is of quite some concern. High interest rates also impact on the cost of running business. Presumably, this is why this matter of public importance raised by Senator George Campbell deals with the manufacturing sector and the impact of these interest rates.
Unfortunately, the Labor Party has proposed no credible alternative economic policies as yet to deal with these specific issues. As far as I can tell, the Labor Party, if in government, would continue to fuel the housing boom. Unfortunately, Mr Latham was overruled when he recognised that negative gearing needed to be reformed. This is a massive cost to the Australian taxpayer. It is artificially increasing housing market prices. The Democrats believe that losses from investments, such as shares and property, should be quarantined. The losses should not be used to reduce tax on other earned income. Unfortunately, the Liberals and Labor are in bed on this issue. 
A fascinating graph on investment property debt appeared in the most recent ABS statistics on lending finance. The graph shows that before 1999 the monthly borrowings for investment properties were fairly stable and hit a peak of $2.2 billion. It is now, some four years later, at nearly $6 billion a month. It has nearly tripled. The graph of debt shows that it has steeply risen since 1999. Oddly enough, this coincides with another time when the Liberals and Labor were in bed together.
Labor allowed the government to cut capital gains tax in half. The Democrats did not support that cut at the time, but the Labor Party supported the coalition's policy and the result was a $2 billion a year tax cut for high-income earners. The only people who benefit from that are those with investment share portfolios and investment properties and this has helped fuel the housing boom. The Democrats assert that this is another reason for the massive increase in debt, because Australians have been taking advantage of this capital gains tax cut by borrowing excessively to buy property. Only the Democrats are promoting economic policies that would cool the property boom, policies that would be economically sound and socially fair that would result in reduced interest rates and allow the government to fund the health and education systems.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-10-15,"—I was rather incredulous when I read what the matter of public importance was about this afternoon, particularly when I saw at the bottom that the matter was being moved by the Labor Party. The whole matter is about debt. Briefly, I contrast the record of this government in the last seven years with the neatly balanced contrast of the previous government in the seven years which preceded that. If we compare our record from 1996 to 2003 with Labor's record from 1989 to 1996, there are two periods of seven years where you get an absolutely remarkable contrast of a very poorly performing ALP government with the excellent economic performance that we have had in the last seven years under the Howard government. 
I was absolutely amazed that Senator George Campbell raised this matter, given the comparisons over those two periods of the two governments in the areas of consumer debt, overseas debt and government debt. On all these counts, what Labor did was a massive failure. It took many years, in the early stages of the Liberal government, to turn this situation around. But we now have a situation where all the economic indicators after seven years are pointing in the right direction. It is absolutely amazing, given that track record, that Senator George Campbell comes in here on a fishing expedition based on speculation that maybe interest rates will go up.
If you have a look at the period I am speaking about, Senator George Campbell, you will see that interest rates have gone up a few times. They went up in 1994, under your government, and then they went up under us in 2001. On both of those occasions they were very weak rises in interest rates. They did not last very long and they collapsed back again. So, even if your proposition is right, you will probably find, given the excellent economic conditions in Australia, that you have exactly the same scenario. We are in a very different economy, very different from the one when you were running the trade union movement and when we had Paul Keating as the Treasurer. It is a much more robust economy, it is a much more resilient economy, and that is largely because of the policies of this government. 
I turn to three areas which have been indicated as areas of debt that you are concerned about, beginning with consumer debt. We find at the moment that the growth of household consumption is at an extremely high level. It was at 3.6 per cent in June 2003. But consumer sentiment—in other words, the confidence of the consumer—is running 18 per cent above the long-term norm. Why are consumers so confident? That is the basic question. If this is one of the forces that is driving the economy, why are they spending? The reason is that the government have delivered on jobs, on wages, on low interest rates and on tax reductions. We have had 1.2 million jobs created since 1996. We have interest rates running now at an incredibly low level—Senator Brandis mentioned the lowest in over 30 years at 6.5 per cent—and unemployment rates at 5.8 per cent. Real wages have gone up 12.2 per cent in the last seven years. That is real growth. That is not inflation. Senator George Campbell or the next speaker might want to enlighten us of the record of the Labor government over 13 years where there was a two per cent rise. We have gone way up. Here are the consumers with the best economic conditions in 13 years and, on top of that, they have real rises in their standard of living. Their real wealth is going up, their real income is going up and, Senator George Campbell, that is the reason why we now have this boom and why consumers are spending at such a high level.
Let us move to the second area: foreign debt. Senator George Campbell did make much of this in the debate. He said that during our time the level of foreign debt has gone up—and that is quite true; it has gone up from 39 per cent to 48 per cent of GDP. Let us have a look at what happened under the Labor Party. Senator George Campbell forgot to mention that under Labor it went from 14 per cent to 39 per cent. Just compare those figures. There was a massive increase under the Labor government.
The debt servicing ratio is the important thing that you have to look at here. The debt servicing ratio under us is 8.3 per cent and under Labor it hit 20 per cent. That was very worrying. Paul Keating used to stay awake at night worried about foreign debt. He talked about a banana republic. The whole nation was shocked and worried about that. It is not an issue at the moment. The reason it is not an issue is that the debt servicing ratio is down from 20 per cent under Labor to eight per cent.
Yet again we have support from Mark Latham. Senator Brandis quoted Mark Latham on another matter. That was a recent quote. I want to go back to 1994 and what Mark Latham had to say in the House about foreign debt. He said high foreign debt is a vote of confidence, blaming the coalition for a `tendency towards xenophobia on issues such as the current account deficit and foreign debt'. He said:
The truth is that the current account deficit is the equivalent of the capital account inflow. Capital inflow into Australia is a huge vote of confidence by international investors in the strength of our economy.
They have more confidence in our management, Senator George Campbell, than in your management. What is the measure? Let us pick only one measure. The Standard and Poor's rating under us is AAA. Under Labor it was downgraded; under us it was upgraded. That is the sign of great economic management. 
I do not have time to go into the other level of debt, which of course is government debt. That was covered by Senator Brandis very thoroughly. Of course, that is the shining example of good economic management. There was Labor racking up debt at more than $10 billion a year—their budget deficit hit $17 billion in two years. What have we done? We have returned it to surplus. We as a government have shown good economic management in terms of household debt, government debt and foreign debt. That is in marked contrast to the record of the Labor Party. We stand as a shining light in economic management, which makes this whole matter of public importance a total nonsense.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I too rise today to speak on this matter of public importance. I am amazed at the sensitivity that the government senators have approached this debate with. Your whole argument is based on spin and illusion. The state of this economy is really underpinned by low interest rates. It is really worrying to me that you do not seem to be in a position—
—Through the chair.
—through the chair, to acknowledge that there is anything wrong with this economy, even though both of the speakers for the government today have talked about their strong certainty that interest rates won't rise. They based their whole argument on that premise. We want the parliament to consider and expect the government to be considering the state of our economy if the economic situation does change and interest rates increase. We have some very grave concerns about the high levels of debt. These are the actual levels today, and you just simply want to ignore them.
—Oh, hypocrisy!
—Senator Abetz interjects. He only wants to talk about the past, but the reality is that we are considering today's economy. We are talking about the situation as it is today. I know you do not want to talk about it and you want to believe the spin and the illusions that this Treasurer constantly puts on the economy, but you ought to consider these figures and these issues very seriously.
During Treasurer Costello's seven-year preside over the Commonwealth Treasury we have seen the setting of a number of infamous records, none of which he, the government or the Australian people can be proud of. Under this government we have seen record levels of household debt, record levels of credit card debt, a record current account deficit, record levels of foreign debt and record low household savings. All those are facts. Senators opposite simply cannot deny that those figures are real. They are mixed into the total economy. It is really a concern to me that government senators can completely discount those economic indicators and keep pushing `As long as interest rates don't rise, everything will be fine.' That is a very dangerous situation for us in this country to be in. 
The Treasurer boasts about his record on retiring public sector debt, which he has successfully done by selling off Commonwealth assets. However, with the other hand Treasurer Costello has been pushing the nation's debt onto individuals everywhere, particularly families and students. We are now in a situation where even the most miniscule rise in interest rates will have a devastating effect on families and individuals everywhere who are already struggling to make ends meet under the Howard government.
—What's your proposal?
—I will get to that if I have enough time, Senator Brandis. You have been interrupting me a lot already. Let's just see how we go. Access Economics have stated that Australia is the most interest rate sensitive market in the world because the economy relies so heavily on debt. Tory Maguire states in his Daily Telegraph article of 16 September titled `When interest knocks hard on debt's door': 
It's the year of the mortgage and thousands of Australian families have borrowed big, not realising how close they are to disaster.
They are living on the financial edge and just a few interest rate increases could push them over.
The figures speak for themselves. Since 1995 the average annual increase in household credit in Australia has been 14.2 per cent; in the US it has been eight per cent; Japan, 2.9 per cent; and Britain, 7.4 per cent. Malcolm Farr stated in his Daily Telegraph article of 1 September titled `Price of paradise has added interest':
We would be international credit card champs were it not for Spain (15.7 per cent).
Reserve Bank figures released on 30 September reveal that personal non-housing debt in Australia has reached $94.6 billion, representing a staggering increase of almost $10 billion in the last year alone. In June 1996 personal non-housing debt stood at nearly $48 billion, or $2,614 per person. By August 2003 this figure reached $4,752 per person, representing an increase of 82 per cent in only seven years.
To put this figure in perspective so far as households are concerned, in June 1996 each household in Australia owed an average personal non-housing debt of $7,079. By August 2003 this figure had reached $12,402 per household, representing a 75 per cent increase in only seven years. The share of consumer debt to total household debt has gone from 16 per cent in 1996 to 35 per cent in 2003. The rate of total household debt to disposable income has gone from 16 per cent in 1990 to an estimated 146 per cent by June 2003.
The Reserve Bank's latest figures on credit card and charge card debt, released on 18 September this year, showed that Australian debt in this regard had exceeded $24.58 billion to July 2003—an increase of $273 million from the previous month—which represents another new record figure. That figure is also representative of an over 400 per cent increase on the $6.6 billion figure recorded in March 1996. The average amount owing on every credit card or charge card in Australia today stands at $2,284. When one considers that on average each household has just over two credit card or charge card accounts, average credit card debt per household has reached over $4,600. This figure represents a trebling of that recorded in June 1996, when the figure stood at $1,600. Our future prosperity is being placed on the credit card, and this is clearly unsustainable for the long term.
According to the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, the build-up of consumer debt explained roughly one-third of Australia's growth rate between 1996 and 2001 and, for the last two years, has roughly matched the entire growth rate in GDP. Our growth is being driven by consumer debt. So, here we have a Treasurer prancing into the parliament boasting about the nation's economic growth rate, but he is taking credit for a totally unsatisfactory result. The result: a 0.1 per cent increase in the June quarter was built primarily on consumer and household debt.
It is an economy treading water, running out of breath and being allowed to run on an unsustainable course which can only lead one way and to one outcome: a deteriorating national economy and a devastating effect on the household budgets of all ordinary Australians and their families. Consumer debt has been almost solely funded by foreign borrowings, which have tripled over the seven years of the Howard government. Consumer debt has risen from approximately $60 billion to $183 billion in only seven years. This is clearly not sustainable. The difference between income and consumption expenditure—not including housing purchases—has increased from $13 billion in 1996 to $55 billion in 2002-03, or from four per cent to around 11 per cent of disposable income. These figures are as startling as they are alarming. 
Moving on to the current account deficit, when John Howard was Treasurer back in 1983 the current account deficit was negative 3.5 per cent and net foreign debt was 7.4 per cent. Mr Howard helped blow this debt out by increasing Commonwealth general government net debt in his years as Treasurer from one per cent of GDP to 7.9 per cent of GDP when they were thrown out of office. Now foreign debt has hit an all-time record under the Howard government. It currently stands at $362 billion and has doubled since Peter Costello became Treasurer. Let me now turn to the issue of Australian household savings, where the figures, again, are very worrying.
—You ought to be worried about these figures, Senator Abetz. I know you just want to live in this illusory world where everything is fine, but try to put yourself above the spin and illusion and accept that you ought to treat these issues seriously.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2003-10-15,"—Speaking of illusions, I am sure no Australian is under the illusion that this is anything other than sheer puerile nonsense. To come to this place and accuse John Howard and the coalition government of somehow mismanaging economic policy in this country is just an affront to every Australian. Senator George Campbell must have drawn the short straw to be the one who had to bring to this place this discussion of a matter of public importance. One of my colleagues said to me last week, `Nige, don't worry about the economic policy of the Labor Party—they wouldn't know it if they were looking straight at it.' I think this MPI has vindicated that today, because they are looking straight at an economic miracle. That is recognised by not only people in Australia but also every international pundit in the financial area. They say, `This is where we need to look to for sustainable economic management of a country.' They look to the coalition in Australia; they look to the wider benefits that are afforded to the Australian people. The last line of this ridiculous proposal reads:
... the Government has failed to implement policies to generate sustainable economic growth.
We have only sustained economic growth at an average rate of 3.5 per cent since we came into office in 1996! We have sustainable growth that is the envy of the world. It is just a miracle. I am so proud to be part of a government who have not even achieved this in buoyant circumstances; we have achieved this, without precedent, in the most difficult international circumstances. We have had the Asian meltdown, where most of our near neighbours were in a position of critical mismanagement. That should have had a huge impact on us, because it certainly did on their other trading neighbours, but no—the Australian economy was resilient because this government had the fiscal knowledge to make sure that it did not turn down with the rest of those economies.
Then, of course, we had the synchronised downturn of some of the other major countries—the United States, France, Germany and Italy. The world shook its head when the American crash came and said: `Look out. The Aussie dollar and everything else is going to go down.' But suddenly there was nothing. There was more confidence in the economy because of good fiscal management. We have had a drought. In the last year we have had one of the worst droughts in Australia's history. It should have had a huge impact on our economy, but it seems that the economy is so sustainable and so strong that we will survive even that. There was the effect of Ansett and SARS on the major input of export dollars into our economy through tourism. Then we had the terrible tragedies of international security—Bali and September 11—which could have caused all sorts of terrible problems with our economy. But we survived. We not only survived, which is an A.D. Hope adage; we lived, we thrived and we have prospered through those times. Australia should look very proudly at this government, which has managed in those circumstances to bring such a wonderful array of benefits. But do not take my word for it. Take the word of international pundits in the media. The London Financial Times in September said of Australia's performance: 
In fiscal policy, prudence has prevailed, with small budget surpluses persisting for many years. A range of structural reforms which continue to have a long-run, dynamising effect on economic performance have given the economy the flexibility to withstand shocks such as the global economic slowdown in 2001.
You could go on forever with third-party endorsements from economic experts from around the world. They are pointing to us and saying, `Now that is the way forward.'
I will continue to look at figures in these areas. I have not been in this place long, and I have to say that I am not much of a statistician. I would like to convert these figures into something I understand: 1.2 million new jobs. What I understand from that figure is that there are young Australians today who are benefiting in a whole range of ways—in how they feel about themselves, their future, contributing to the community and being part of the community because they have a job. When the other side were in government, their mismanagement meant we were one million jobs down.
As has already been mentioned, we have productivity increases of some 2.4 per cent per annum. Under Labor's economic mismanagement in the 1990s, I can remember when not only my business—which happened to be a fishing boat—but also the home of my wife and me was at risk because interest rates were at 17 per cent. We almost lost our home. It was not the cyclones, it was not the difficulty of working in one of the harshest environments of the world; it was the fact that we were under a Labor government that mismanaged the economy that almost sent me to the bottom of the sea. That is the reason that many Australians in 1996 caused the Labor Party to come very justifiably a very clear second. Over one million people were unemployed. They remember those circumstances, as they should. They were not allowed to contribute to and participate in community life as a consequence of that mismanagement.
On the flip side of that, people ask why people are spending money. They are spending more money now because they have a high degree of confidence in the financial management capacity of the Australian government. Those with any appreciation of debt and financial management would understand that the important issue with debt is not the size of the debt but the capacity to service the debt. Obviously, we have bigger incomes and we can afford bigger houses. We have had low interest rates, which is attractive for growth, and I think that underpins the growth we are having in Australia today. But do not ask us. Mr Latham, the current shadow Treasurer, said in 1994:
So this empty piece of rhetoric about high national debt cannot be sustained once we look at the most important figures, which are those concerning debt servicing.
Perhaps he should have picked up the phone before he said this and had a chat to his then Treasurer about this issue, because I am sure he would have enlightened him. Every single Australian needs to stand proud and tall and point to the economic management of today that has allowed the rest of the world to look to us and say, `That's the economic miracle that is Australia.'

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-10-15,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
—Did you say it was from the chief of staff?
—Yes, Senator Carr; it is a response from the chief of staff to the minister and not from the minister himself. It is, I think, a matter that would have senators perplexed. One would have expected that the minister would have responded to the Senate, not his chief of staff, but obviously that is the minister's decision.
—That would be unprecedented, wouldn't it? 
—I cannot recall a circumstance where a government response to a resolution of this chamber has been delegated to a chief of staff. Perhaps the government will correct me and advise me of the circumstances, but I have not experienced it. I would be interested to know what the normal protocol is. One wonders whether the minister has seen the document—I presume he has but, if he has, why did he not sign it? Perhaps we can be further advised by the government as to what the protocol for this chamber is and what they expect of ministers in responding to resolutions of this chamber.
As I have said before in this place, the failure of the Cancun talks is a failure on many fronts. It is a failure of the WTO and, unfortunately, a failure of the Cairns Group. In the end, it must be seen as a failure of this government and, in particular, Minister Vaile. It is certainly a black mark against us as the chair country and Minister Vaile as the chair of the Cairns Group.
Australian farmers, and indeed all Australians, stood to share in increased export revenues of around $4 billion had the Cancun talks been successful in resolving issues around the so-called three pillars of effective world agricultural trade reform: improved market access; a reduction in domestic support; and a reduction in, with a view to the elimination of, export subsidies. Australia's dairy, beef and mutton producers could have been big winners from successful Cancun discussions on a protocol arising from the Doha Round. Another group who could have been winners—and for whom the failure of the Cancun talks is an especially bitter blow—is the Australian sugar industry. The sugar industry and the communities who rely on it have been buffeted for a number of years by the passing perils of drought and crop pests and obviously the perennial problems of a corrupted world market and low world prices. Unfortunately, they have also had to bear the blundering of Minister Truss and the effects of a trade minister who has obviously been asleep at the wheel.
The Cairns Group was established by a number of nations under the guidance of Labor in August 1986. The Cairns Group was committed to achieving a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system not only for the good of Australian farmers but also as a means of contributing to regional stability and wealth by allowing farmers of developing nations to have a fair go in world trade. With Australia effectively permanently the chair of the Cairns Group, it has been an invaluable tool to assist us to meet our trade goals and, through its network of 17 developed and developing nations, to understand the objectives of our trading partners better. Therefore, it is unbelievable to me that, as the chair of the Cairns Group, Mr Vaile was unaware and therefore unable to halt or guide the emergence of the Group of 22 nations—the G22 as they are known. It simply defies belief when you consider that at least 10 Cairns Group members became members of the Group of 22.
In Cancun, the developing nations led by the G22 found themselves pitted against, in particular, the European Union, Japan and South Korea—not on an agricultural issue but on the so-called Singapore issues. As a result of the pursuit of these issues by some developed nations and the opposition of the G22, including those 10 Cairns Group members, the talks at Cancun failed. Had Minister Vaile not been asleep at the wheel, had he known of the emerging group that would eventually become the G22 and had he worked with them, the outcome at Cancun could have been vastly different and potentially vastly more beneficial to Australian farmers and—perhaps as, or more, importantly—farmers in the poorer nations of our region.  
The minister has claimed that no result is better than a bad result. At least that seems to be the view of his chief of staff. My view is that no result is a bad result for Australian farmers. As I said earlier, I find it noteworthy that the minister did not view the resolution to be important enough for him to respond on his own behalf, but has asked or delegated that task to his chief of staff.
I will finish on this: we have not heard the end of the issue of the Group of 22 nations. We may have seen the end of the Cairns Group as an effective front-line negotiating force at WTO level. I hope that that is not the case, but unfortunately many commentators see that as a reality and that the Cairns Group may be relegated to a group which deals with some of the technical issues around trade rather than being front-line negotiators. If that occurs, unfortunately, that will put Australia back in the rank, as it were, with a whole lot of other nations. We would cease to be a lead force in WTO negotiations. That obviously has an impact on our international standing and the sooner the government recognises that, and finds a way of addressing it, the better. Certainly Labor, when it returns to office, will be seeking to address the problems which have been created by the lack of attention of this administration.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-10-15,"—by leave—This statement is on behalf of the Hon. Tony Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Nettle on 9 October 2003, as agreed by the Senate, concerning documents relating to the proposed Australia-US free trade agreement and the regulation of labelling of genetically modified foods in Australia and/or the United States. I table a number of documents relevant to the order, including correspondence between the Department of Health and Ageing and private individuals, whose names have been removed for reasons of privacy.
With respect to a number of other documents relevant to the order, I inform the Senate that the government considers that it would not be in the public interest to disclose those on the grounds that it could damage international relations. It is not in the public interest to release documents that relate to an ongoing negotiation between Australia and the United States. The government is also claiming public interest immunity for a number of documents prepared for the purpose of the deliberative processes involved in the functions of the government, as disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIA-UNITED STATES FREE TRADE AGREEMENTREGULATION OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,31,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-15,"—We are dealing with the first of three messages that relate to a package of two measures, and a third amendment that relates to the issue of the removal of discrimination with respect to superannuation that currently applies to same-sex couples. It is apparent from the messages that have been returned to the Senate that the Liberal government in the House of Representatives is intent on removing the successful amendment to the bill we are currently discussing—that is, the amendment to remove the discrimination that currently exists for same-sex couples.
As for the package of measures, this message deals with an exclusive tax cut to apply to high-income earners' superannuation. When I refer to high-income earners, I mean there is an exclusive tax cut for those who earn more than $96,000 a year. It is a very exclusive tax cut, because 95 per cent of the Australian work force earn less than $96,000 a year. The Labor Party does not support this exclusive tax cut, and I have made that point on many occasions both in this chamber and publicly at various forums. Labor does not support this tax cut for the fundamental reason that it is exclusive: it applies to a very small group of Australian taxpayers who have a high income, earning more than $96,000 a year, and it confers an exclusive and guaranteed benefit to that group of taxpayers. Labor has put forward what it considers to be a fairer and more positive alternative proposal: that is, to reduce the contributions tax that applies to most, but not all, Australians' superannuation from 15 per cent to 13 per cent. Labor has presented a positive alternative to the exclusive tax cut we are being asked to approve here this evening.
The second message relates to a matching government contribution of up to $1,000 for low-income earners if their income is $27,500 or less. So, with respect to the other element of the package, if an individual voluntarily places $1,000 into superannuation, they will receive a matching co-contribution from the government of $1,000, provided their income is less than $27,500. The matching contribution phases out as incomes approach $40,500. The Labor Party support the low-income earner co-contribution. We have been critical of some of the exaggerated claims made about who benefits. We have been critical and we have posed a number of questions, both to the minister in the Senate and in other forums, about precisely who will benefit from this low-income earner co-contribution and about the numbers. I have referred to exaggerated claims. I suppose the most infamous exaggerated claim was that made by the now minister, Senator Ian Campbell, who referred to Australians becoming millionaires as a result of this low-income earner co-contribution. Not even the minister, Senator Coonan, would dare to confirm the millionaire claim made by Senator Ian Campbell, who is now a minister. 
Labor has focused on trying to ascertain the approximate number of people who will benefit from this low-income earner co-contribution. Whilst the Liberal government, the minister representing the Treasurer on this occasion and Senator Cherry have been somewhat triumphal in their media releases and public comments, it is apparent that up to four and a half million Australians who could benefit—
—They could!
—I will take that interjection, Senator Cherry.
—They are eligible.
—They are eligible; that is right. It is apparent that the reality is very different. On the government's costings and projections, it is some 450,000 or 460,000 who will benefit. Despite those magic words of `up to' and `could benefit', the reality is very different. Indeed, the figure is remarkably close to the government's—
—I was going to draw the analogy with children's superannuation accounts, Senator Cherry. This government predicted on 5 November 2001, in the run-up to the election, that 470,000 people would take up children's superannuation accounts. To date, I am informed there are about 500 of them. However, I must say I do believe that the appeal of the low-income earner co-contribution will certainly exceed a 500 take-up rate. I would be confident of that, whatever the final figure may be. We have made an attempt to ensure that we have some real picture of the likely benefits to low-income earners.
There are a couple of potential flaws. The low-income earners co-contribution is open to middle- and high-income earners, because they can make the contribution on behalf of their lower income spouse or partner. So, indirectly, higher income earners can benefit from this program. The Democrats have insisted on a measure that will require some analysis of the partner's income. I have to take the credit here—I think it was my suggestion that the Democrats either kindly incorporated into the legislation or insisted the government insert into the legislation.
There is another reason why the Labor Party supports the low-income earner's co-contribution: it was a Labor idea. The co-contribution was a Labor policy initiative. Labor proposed a three per cent government co-contribution in 1995, which this government committed itself to keep and then dropped in 1997. Labor's alternative proposal of a three per cent government co-contribution, which would have applied to all Australian superannuation and not just to some 450,000 or 460,000, would have delivered an additional $4.5 billion into superannuation once it was fully operational, whereas the Democrat-Liberal government deal delivers some $215 million—I am using the 2007-08 year here—in additional superannuation contributions. Whilst we appreciate the government copying a Labor policy—one that the government had dumped—and then coming back and presenting a low-income earner's co-contribution, it is a very much watered down version. There is a contrast in that there is a guaranteed tax cut for high-income earners—all high-income earners get the tax cut—whereas approximately one in 10 low-income earners will receive the government co-contribution. Labor does not regard that as balanced. 
Let me come to the final issue, which is the successful Labor amendment to this bill we are considering, which the Liberal government rejected in the House of Representatives—that is, to amend the general superannuation law to remove the discrimination against same-sex couples. I am pleased that, before this matter was referred to the other place, the Senate voted to support Labor's amendment. I acknowledge likewise that Labor supported the amendment moved by Senator Brown and the amendment moved by the Australian Democrats on the same issue. I have been asked, quite reasonably, why Labor have on this occasion chosen to move such an amendment and support it when, on previous occasions, the Australian Democrats and/or Senator Brown have moved an amendment along similar lines, if not identical ones, and the Labor Party have not supported it. We have taken a position that this issue of same-sex couples and superannuation must be dealt with. It must be resolved. The discrimination must be removed. It is very difficult to do that when this government—which is clearly intractable, stubborn and determined to avoid this issue and remove the discrimination—has a majority in the House of Representatives. However, on this occasion, Labor have taken the approach that we need to try to force this issue—to get this Liberal government to deal with this issue of removing the discrimination against same-sex couples. This presented one of those few opportunities where realistically we are in a position to put much greater pressure on this Liberal government to agree to remove the discrimination against same-sex couples.
Labor hoped the government would have considered the amendments by the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party that were successfully moved in this place, and we hoped that the government would have reconsidered its position in the time we have had since this matter was last considered in the Senate. I understand that the government has not reconsidered its position—it has not even discussed it that I am aware of—and it has not taken the issue back to cabinet. Senator Coonan may be able to present us with some up-to-date information on the matter, but the government has point-blank refused. The Democrats might have some additional information. I will listen with interest. I understand they requested some sort of statement from Senator Coonan. I will be interested to see if we get it and, if so, in what form.
Labor saw this as an opportunity to press this issue of equal rights for same-sex couples with respect to superannuation. Labor has taken a view that there is a fundamental issue of human rights here with respect to same-sex couples. In addition to that, there is the fundamental issue of property rights. Superannuation in this country is the individual property right of Australians, subject to trustee supervision, management et cetera. The issues of the discrimination that apply to same-sex couples and superannuation have been well canvassed in the Senate. The actual details of that discrimination with respect to death and disability, insurance, estates, defined benefits and reversionary benefits have been well canvassed, and I do not intend to go into them in detail today. 
I did watch the debate in the House of Representatives, particularly the comments by the new minister, Mr Ross Cameron, who claimed in his speech that there is a forthcoming bill on choice of fund legislation. He took the opportunity to highlight that the government's choice of fund legislation, which is due to be debated in this parliamentary sitting, would allow same-sex couples to choose a superannuation fund that best serves their needs—that is, a fund with governing rules that allow payments to same-sex couples. It is absolute crap. It is absolute nonsense. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order—
—I withdraw that expression. This is a fundamentally untrue claim by Mr Cameron in the other place. It is absolute nonsense. His claim that the government's so-called choice of fund legislation overcomes the fundamental discrimination in law against same-sex couples is grossly misleading. It is not the superannuation funds that are at the heart of the problem; it is the law that the superannuation funds are required to meet that is at the heart of the problem. It is another example of this Liberal government refusing to deal with the issue of removing discrimination against same-sex couples and refusing to acknowledge the importance of this amendment.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-10-15,"—We all know that the Labor Party is suddenly against co-contributions and is against a reduction in the surcharge, small though it may be. It is interesting that, in order to try to get some additional support for its opposition, the Labor Party has joined with some minority senators in using the same-sex couples debate to try to destroy this legislation. Senator Sherry, I remember that you agreed during the hearings of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation that the committee regarded the co-contribution as a very important first step in assisting a targeted group of taxpayers to boost their retirement savings, and it supported the adoption of the government's co-contribution bill. Not long ago, we heard Mr Latham suggest a similar sort of approach: that low-income people should be given savings money—not for superannuation but for savings—on a very much more generous basis.
Which arm of the Labor Party is really talking? One arm of the Labor Party, its shadow Treasurer, is putting forward a suggestion that low-income earners need government assistance to boost their savings. We have a very generous measure, within limits, in the Superannuation (Surcharge Rate Reduction) Amendment Bill 2003, for low-income earners in particular, for amounts to go into superannuation. Senator Sherry had no objection to that; it was not a part of his minority report. There was a minority report attached to certain features of this bill but that was not one of them.
I remind the Senate that this exclusive tax cut, which we spent about 10 minutes talking about—to `a very exclusive group', he said; yes, it is a small group—addressed something that should never have been there in the first place. It was put there to overcome a black hole of $10 billion created by the Labor Party before it left office. To ensure that a good cross-section of the community suffered in the claw-back required to bring it back into surplus, the surcharge was introduced. I have always had problems with it. But here we have the first opportunity to reduce a front-end contribution tax and it looks as though it will be defeated. It is a small amount, and the Liberal-National Party coalition have gone a long way in meeting the demands of opposition senators in reducing the benefit. I applaud them for that. They cut a deal with the government—in other words, reduce the amount of the surcharge and increase the value of the contributions tax by extending the amount up to $40,000 before it cuts out. I applaud that because a lot of people will be affected by it, but it would be a pity if this whole thing were to be scuttled on the issue of same-sex couples.
Quite a number of years ago, honourable senators will recall, our Senate committee brought down a report that did see some injustice in this issue. But what I am concerned about is that the problem you are trying to solve is wider than just the same-sex issue debate. I think it would be a travesty of justice if we were to pass this sort of amendment that gives exclusivity to this particular group but that excludes other desirable people. I will give you a simple example: there are two sisters, one a professional going out to work and earning reasonable money and the other who stays at home to look after mum in her old age. The sister who stays at home has never been in the work force. Mum suddenly dies and there are two sisters living alone. That situation does not come under the same-sex couples banner. Don't you think there is an injustice in the sense that there is a denial of opportunity for superannuation funds to flow through that sort of channel? 
This issue really needs to be brought back under a banner that is not identified as a same-sex issue but as a justice issue, encompassing all these sorts of people. I say that we should look at this issue in a separate and wider context, rather than in narrow confines where there will be sections of the community saying, `We can't agree with this,' simply because it is seen to be primarily directed to a particular group. I believe it will be unfortunate if we kill a bill that will give a lot of benefit to people, because there is a lot interest out there.
Members of the committee, including Senator Cherry and Senator Sherry, would be aware that the majority of evidence that we received when this issue was taken to an inquiry in the outside world was that people saw some benefit, some progress, in a reduction in the surcharge as a first step. It was a first step, albeit such a small step that there would be an indication to future governments that this should be continued along the line. It would be a first step in the reduction of front-end taxes. We do not like front-end taxes because, across the spectrum, front-end taxes take off, in terms of compounding, the final benefit. Tax the final benefit—that is what everybody wants. In a sense the Keating government conned us all, with a few exceptions, when it introduced the concept of front-end taxes. Now the very people who introduced that concept are opposing this first step to reduce that front-end tax. The submissions say that it is better to take a reduction now in what has proved to be a generally unpopular tax, a tax that people acknowledge is costly to collect and is unconstitutional because it is not universal—there are exceptions now, as court cases have shown—rather than to debate the merits that are not included in the bill.
The government has listened to the call and made the co-contribution more generous. FitzGerald and others have demonstrated quite convincingly that this concept of co-contribution is the best way to go to help lower-income earners. To the credit of some of the opposition parties, the government has agreed to extend the threshold in the interests of getting the bill through. We have now had sufficient debate and it is time to get the bill through so that people who are in need can benefit from the legislation.
This is an important point. Getting rid of the surcharge, in a very small way, over three years is an equity measure. It is not a big amount but at least it is a signal of the intention to remove it. To remove it in one lump sum, I agree, is too much. For many people, superannuation is not a particularly attractive option because superannuation tax rates are significantly higher than the ordinary personal tax rates. Why should superannuation vehicles be taxed at a rate which is higher than the top marginal tax rate that applies to individuals? There is another side of the justice coin. You can say that they can afford it, but you have to bring some reasonable equality across the spectrum of tax and superannuation laws. The surcharge has been criticised, particularly when it applies to women who have had broken working patterns. When in later years they try to make up their superannuation, the contribution fund enables them to provide for a dignified and self-sufficient retirement—and that is what superannuation is all about. 
Where is the feminist movement within the ALP? They are not querying people like Senator Sherry who are leading the superannuation debate. People like Mr Latham are saying that we have to increase savings, but Senator Sherry says, `But not in superannuation.' Where is the consistency of your policy, other than the policy of outright opposition? I understand where Senator Greig is coming from. There is a solution, but the solution has to be seen to be wider than just being directed at the very narrow corridor that you are addressing. The community will not appreciate what you are trying to do or, if the government gives in, where it is seen to be giving in on this matter.
The issue has to be debated and clarified in a better way than barnstorming at this time. We know that the Labor Party does not want either and they see this as a measure for scuttling it. I think that is unfortunate. I say to the other senators: look at it in the clear light of day, on a proper occasion, but, for heaven's sake, let this get through because it is a signal of the importance of beginning to get rid of the surcharge which Senator Sherry fought for years and years—now we have seen a big U-turn. A lot of people worry about the credibility of politicians. 
It is important to get rid of front-end taxes, and a small reduction of the surcharge is not a bad first step in the right direction. Over time, as budgets permit, we would hope that successive governments will pick this up in relation to the general contribution tax and have taxes at the end, when people collect, as part of the general simplification of taxation laws. These sorts of measures complicate the system. We have to begin taking the complications out of superannuation and, as a first step, this is the way to go. Let us not deny that opportunity of moving forward. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,35,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-10-15,"—I rise to respond to the two previous speakers, who raised some interesting points. Firstly, Senator Watson is dead right: we need to go further than simply the same-sex issue, although discrimination against same-sex couples is part of the discrimination in a range of categories. I have in front of me an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case, [2000] AATA 8, 13 January 2000, concerning a son in a very close-knit family who died. The evidence says that the son lived at home with his parents and helped in the delicatessen on the weekend. When he died, the parents were taxed on his superannuation when it came back to them. In that case, the argument was that, even though the AAT acknowledged that the family had been getting the support of their son working in the shop and the emotional support of him living at home with them, he was not financially supporting the family; in fact, the evidence was the other way. His marriage had broken up, he had moved back home to his parents' house and his flat was being sold. The AAT decision says: 
15. In the present case there is no suggestion that the applicants were in any sense financially dependent on the deceased. Indeed, the evidence is that for almost all of his life the deceased relied in varying degrees upon the generosity of the applicants—
the parents—
for his financial support. The Tribunal understands that the dependence asserted by the applicants is one of physical support helping out with the running and management of the family business. 
16. However, the evidence does not support a conclusion that either applicant relied to any significant extent on the profits of the family delicatessen business for their financial survival.
Therefore, as financial dependence was not found, the family was taxed. What we object to is the notion that superannuation benefits should be taxed when they are passing within a family or a same-sex relationship or any of the myriad of different relationships that exist out there in modern Australia. That is why the amendments which the Democrats have moved to a subsequent bill are superior to the ones which Senator Sherry has moved to this bill—our amendments dealt with not just the same-sex issue but also with the broader category of interdependency and broader relationships.
I note that, in the message that has come back from the House of Representatives, the government has sought to argue: 
A dependant is ordinarily interpreted to include those partly financially dependent or financially inter-dependent with the member. Therefore, same-sex partners can usually access the death benefits of their partner where the dependency test is met and the House considers that this amendment is not necessary. 
The decision that I read out is case law and it is an example of the courts showing that that whole notion of financial dependency has its limits. To rely purely on financial dependency is to downplay the important emotional dependency or the important other physical support that can exist within a same-sex couple, a family relationship or a whole range of different circumstances. It is important that the Senate acknowledge that our law does have a problem. The problem arises because we are taxing death benefits in desperate family situations where someone has lost a loved one. We are taxing them and putting them through the angst of having to face a taxing situation if they cannot prove this economic definition of financial dependency.
A relationship is more than just finance. Finance is important, but a relationship is much more than just financial dependency. There is emotional dependency. There is, in this case, the dependency of helping in a family business. There is a whole range of different things that we need to recognise. I will deal with the merits of the amendments we are moving when we come to the third House of Representatives message, but certainly the Democrats are of the view that Senator Watson has raised very strong points. I think it is time that the government as a whole took on board the view that we do need to deal with the issue of the categories that fall outside this narrow law put in place by the Labor government in 1992. I think it is time we as a Senate and as a parliament reviewed it and that we actually deal with these discriminations.
The point is that we should not be taxing death benefits that are shifting within a close, interdependent or family relationship. We should not be dictating by law whom you can and cannot leave your superannuation to. The government talks at various times of the importance of choice—choice when a person is alive—but I think that choice should extend to when people are dead as well. I think it is a very important principle. That is one of the reasons why the amendments we have moved to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) (Consequential Amendments) Bill deal with these issues in a very comprehensive way. I thank Senator Watson for his comments, because I think they are important in acknowledging the need for us to go further and deal with all different types of relationships.
I acknowledge that partial dependency is picked up in the current law. There is plenty of case law in the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal that deals with partial dependency. When you look at cases like Faull's case, the courts have tried to stretch it as far as they possibly can to ensure that the tax impost on a family situation of a superannuation benefit passing through is not picked up. The High Court, the Supreme Court, the Federal Court, the AAT and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal have stretched this law as far as they can, but it still falls short because you still have to prove an element of financial dependency to get through the law. And that is the problem. Occasionally, various people in this place criticise judges and say that they should not be stretching the law, but judges have compassionate times. When you are dealing with a situation where you have a death benefit that should be passed on to someone else and the government is going to tax that because you cannot prove financial dependence, it is really criminal and really appalling to have that as a legal outcome. It is something that I think this parliament has to fix. That is one of the debates we need to have. 
Coming back to the package as a whole, and the wonderful speech that Senator Sherry treated us to earlier about the surcharge package, I remind the chamber that the Labor Party's policy is for a two per cent tax cut across the board in superannuation contributions. Under the package we are dealing with today, in this financial year the cut to the surcharge is half a per cent, next year it is 1½ per cent and the year after that it is 2½ per cent. The benefit after the end of three years under this package vis-a-vis Labor's is the grand total of half a per cent. That is what we are arguing about. What the Labor Party's package does vis-a-vis the package we have negotiated with the government is that it transfers money from low-income people to middle-income people. We had this debate earlier. 
The Democrats have got the government to agree—and I am very pleased with the underlying package we have reached agreement on—to transferring $460 million from the forward estimates on a surcharge cut to a matching co-contribution for low-income people. The result is that two-thirds of the funding of this package goes to people earning under $40,000 a year. There are 60 per cent of Australians earning under $40,000 a year. We can argue until the cows come home about how many of those will pick up the package. I was very delighted with—and I quoted it earlier in the debate—the research at the Chifley Research Centre which suggested that pick-up rates could be very high. The evidence from overseas is that these sorts of voluntary savings measures do in fact encourage people to save.
We had a debate on a matter of public importance earlier put forward by Senator George Campbell, which I had the joy to chair, that referred to the desperate need for Australia to increase its household savings. Why don't we encourage people to save by giving them a boost when they save? That is what Mark Latham was arguing when he was talking about his matched savings accounts and that is pretty much what George Campbell was saying today. We all need to save more. That is what this package is about: encouraging people to save more.
I cannot see why the Labor Party would want to take the money out of that savings incentive and give it to middle-income people as a tax cut on the superannuation contribution they are already making compulsorily. That does nothing to increase national savings.
—And voluntarily.
—And voluntarily as well, but the vast bulk of it will be a dead weight loss because it will be going on SG contributions which they already were making. It is a dead weight loss. At least under this proposal we are putting up, if they save more they will get more. We will actually get more money into the accounts of low-income people. The key thing about this package is that the vast bulk of the benefit goes to people on lower incomes. Under Labor's proposal—the two per cent across-the-board tax cut—the vast bulk of the benefit goes to people on above average incomes. That is why the Democrats are very proud to defend this package, because we are delivering a very significant benefit to low-income people at the bottom end. We will also continue to urge the government to move on this whole issue of recognising same sex interdependent relationships, but I will deal with those issues when we deal with those messages later. 
The point I make at this stage is that this package is a good package. It is a package which has the significant potential to expand the savings pool in Australia and to encourage people to save. From that point of view, it is worth doing. It is very much worth doing, because 90 per cent of the benefit in this financial year goes to low-income people and 70 per cent of the benefit in the second year goes to low-income people. Over the course of four years, 66 per cent of the benefit goes to low-income people. That is assuming a low take-up rate. That is assuming the same number of people pick up this benefit who currently pick up the superannuation low-income earners rebate. If any people pick it up over and above the current low-income earners rebate pick-up rate, then we will see even more of that money going to low-income people. That is an even better outcome for Australia. It means people are saving more. We are doing something about the fact that we are now the wooden spooner in the OECD with respect to our national savings rate. 
I cannot see why we cannot ensure this package moves through because it is such a good and important package. I cannot see why we cannot also deal with the issue of discrimination because it is a fundamentally important issue. Why are we in a situation where, when we are dealing with death benefits, we are putting death taxes on death benefits passing within family relationships? Why are we as a parliament doing that? The parliament does need to deal with that issue at some point. The Democrats are very keen to see the government's response to that later in this debate. We need to find a way through all of this to ensure that we get this very good package for low-income people. We need to get these incentives in place to encourage people to save and we need to deal with those issues that Senator George Campbell was talking about today—about getting our national household savings rate up. We need to ensure that when people do save they can have choice about what happens to their savings when they die. We need to deal with that in the SI(S) Act and the ITAA as well. 
It is interesting to note, when trawling through the various writings of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, that it has produced a very long paper—a very good paper—on the legal issues on death benefits. I commend that paper to senators. It deals with a whole range of issues that have come out of the 500 cases that the SCT has dealt with in respect of death benefits. Some of the issues that come out of that show the enormous complexity of this particular area. But it keeps coming back time and time again to the issue of financial dependency and the need to improve powers of financial dependency. 
I think families in Australia are about more than financial dependency. I think relationships in Australia are about more than financial dependency. I think they are about that physical support of running a delicatessen on the weekend. They are about the emotional support of a same-sex couple as well as of a heterosexual couple. They are about sisters living together and providing support, as Senator Watson suggested. They are about a whole range of things. I think it is time we as a parliament put value on that and ensure that the value we place on these relationships is not just a financial one but rather an emotional one, a physical one, thereby recognising all the different groups which make up our country. 
This has been a very interesting debate right from the very beginning. I want to pay tribute to the government's preparedness to amend this package to date to deal with the issue of low-income earners and to ensure those benefits flow. We need to ensure those benefits are capable now of flowing not just during someone's life but at the end of someone's life as well. That is an issue I do hope the government is prepared to address at the appropriate point. As other people will want to speak tonight, I will leave my comments there. But, from our point of view, I would note that the amendments the Democrats have moved to the consequential amendments bill do deal with interdependency as well as same-sex couples, which makes them superior to the amendments we are discussing here.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,35,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-10-15,"—I come into this debate late, but I listened very carefully to Senator Cherry and it seems to me that what he is suggesting with respect to these superannuation bills is absolutely correct. It seems to me that the majority of the money that is allowed on these co-contributions will flow to people earning up to $40,000, which is not a considerable wage. In fact, it is a fairly modest wage. I take on board what he said. Unfortunately, in my case, the same thing happened when my son passed away. The money was taxed when he passed it on to his nephew. I thought that was a bit rough at the time. I hope this legislation gets the support of the Democrats and that we do not get hung up on an issue that we would find, particularly in the Nationals, very difficult to support. 
—Property rights are difficult for the Nationals!
—No, it is not property rights. It is the other thing that I am referring to and you know it quite well—same-sex couples. We would find it very difficult to support it. I plead with the Democrats. This bill will assist low-income families and will help people who have family when a fairly low sum of money gets transferred from different areas within that family that requires 30 per cent or 40 per cent tax on it. I know it is very difficult. I have had quite a number of submissions made to me on this matter, where people have had a son or daughter die and they try to pass the money on to their sister, brother or nephew and find that half of it disappears in taxation.
—It has to be fixed.
—I hope it will be fixed. As I say, I have had personal experience of it, and it must happen time and time again. It seems to me that you have put so much work, effort and time into this bill. We all would like it to go through, for all the reasons that you enunciated in your speech. I have just done a quick exercise on my personal self-interest—you know it is racing, and now it is trying—but it will not make much difference to me. I think it is about $80 a year to people on our level of income. 
—That's not right. It is a lot more than that. In our fund it is, mate!
—Is it? 
—The first year.
—I have just got some advice. On the first year, I was told it was $80. 
—The first year.
—Yes, $80 in the first year. I am looking for advice on that. I am trying to say that it is not going to help the big end of town; it is going to help the very small end of town. I, for the life of me, cannot see why the Labor Party would not support it. But I have a great deal of difficulty fathoming the Labor Party on many issues and this one is just another mystery to me. They say they are the working man's friend, they stand up for the blue-collar workers and they support the battlers, yet when the $40,000-a-year battlers are offered something they walk away from it. That is totally wrong. The people down at the pub who spend all their money letting their three or four kids play football or basketball do not have any real excess income to put away. Then this bill comes along, supported by the Democrats and the National and Liberal parties. The Labor Party stand at the polling booth and say they support the worker, but they do not support the worker. That is probably why the worker does not support them now. That is probably why the workers and the Howard battlers now vote for the Liberal and National parties.
One thing raised at the National Party conference was the cliche `insanity is doing the same thing the same way and expecting a different result'. You are doing the same thing time and time again. You are neglecting your blue-collar workers, and they are neglecting you. You have been doing it for the last three elections, and you are going to do it again and you are going to get the same result. Those people are going to vote for the Greens, the Democrats or the Liberal Party; they are not going to vote for you.
—They're not voting for the National Party; we know that.
—They may not vote for the National Party, but they are certainly not going to vote for the Labor Party. They are looking elsewhere. That is why you are in a terrible situation where the Greens are gradually catching up on you. You are going to lose those inner city seats because what is going to happen—and you have seen it so regularly—is the Democrats will get a few votes, the National-Liberal Party will get a few votes and by the time the votes are parleyed up they will go past the Labor Party. If you keep neglecting your blue-collar workers, then you are going to lose seats. They are saying to you, `Listen to us, we need your help,' and you are ignoring them all the time, and consequently you are going to lose seats. You escaped by the skin of your teeth in Melbourne Ports and you lost a by-election to the Greens in a safe Labor seat.
You do not seem to be able to adjust. You put one hand in the fan and lose five fingers and then you immediately put the other hand in the fan and lose five fingers and you say, `What happened?' If that is the way the Labor Party want to go, that is the way they will go. Obviously you are not going to take any notice of me. I have seen it down at the polling booth. Let me repeat this anecdote. I live in a working-class area; in fact, it has never been held by anyone except the Labor Party for the last 100 years. The Nationals won it once in 1974, but it is basically a very hard-core Labor seat. When we had the referendum on the Constitution my wife came back from the polling booth and said, `I have never had a better day in my life. It was an absolutely fantastic day because, as I was handing out the cards, all the old Labor voters came and said, “Good on you, girlie, you are doing a great thing,” and then they walked over and abused the Labor Party.' She said that had never happened to her before. I am just saying that you keep losing contact with your basic workers. I might add that it got so bad that the Labor guys ran up the white flag at about 12 o'clock and went home, because they were sick of getting abused. Anyhow, it made my wife's day very happy because she said that normally she was on the other end of the abuse but this day was a terrific day because the Labor Party came down and congratulated her on standing up for their beliefs. 
This is a good bill. I have just come into it at the end. From my own personal experience and representations I have had from other people—not a lot; maybe 10 or 12 over 20 years—where this has happened, where a sister has died and tried to pass it on to another sister, brother or nephew, there has been a tax on it.
—Are you going to vote for the Democrat amendment on the third message then?
—I will not be voting for it. I am trying to be honest about it. I cannot vote for that. Our constituency could not support it—and I understand you have a different constituency—and we have to represent our constituency. I do not want to bring that into this debate.
—It just needs rebadging.
—Maybe it needs rebadging or something. As Senator Watson has said, it would be hard for us to do it. I would not want to see the bill go down and battlers on less than $40,000 lose their refund because we have a philosophical difference. We should sort out the philosophical difference. We can debate it as much as we like, but we cannot neglect or walk away from these people on less than $40,000 because there is a philosophical difference. You know the bill is good. We have accepted every amendment that the Democrats put up. We have backed it all because we think you have done a pretty good job and we are prepared to go along with you. So let us not fall at the last hurdle and cut the worker's nose off despite our face because of our philosophical differences. That is not what we are here for.
We are here to provide the best legislation for the majority of the people, and you—the Democrats and the National and Liberal parties together—have done that. The Labor Party then come in and say, `We're not going to do that, because there's a philosophical difference.' Of course we have our differences. We represent different people with different ideas. That is part of parliament. We come in and represent those people, and your constituency is different from mine. But it is for those reasons we should debate, for instance, whether we believe in same-sex couples or something like that. We should not put a gun at the worker's head and say, `You're going to get shot because there was a philosophical difference.'
The bill is a good one. Your amendments have been accepted. I hope we can progress this, because there is not much in it at the moment. As I say, I went over and checked and—just as a rule of thumb—ran it through various income groups. It did not seem to me that there would be much in it for the big end of town. It seemed to me that all the benefits—or 66 per cent of the benefits—would flow to those I would call the battlers. Senator Watson is an expert on this bill. He has spent the last 10 years of his life working on superannuation; maybe he could add a bit more information to support the legislation going through.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (SURCHARGE RATE REDUCTION) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,35,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-15,"—In the few minutes remaining, I would like to make a few points. The most immediate point I would like to make is to express my shock at Senator Boswell saying that the Senate ought to have a debate on same-sex couples. On the very last occasion when I attempted that, Senator Boswell was screaming at me across the chamber to not do that and, in fact, that neither he nor his constituency wanted to do that, they never wanted to do that and they will never support bringing on the sexuality and discrimination bill. If he has changed his mind, fine. 
—It is true, Senator Sherry, that you have made some strong statements about this being a human rights issue and Labor being committed to this reform, and that you would insist on bills which the government really wanted. But at the time you did quarantine that to super choice. You did not mention this bill, and I think it is fair to say that in that context Senator Cherry went into negotiations with the government in good faith, knowing that the Labor Party would not insist on same-sex amendments to this particular bill. So, to see the amendment from Labor—their first ever on this issue—come out of the blue as it did was, as Senator Watson correctly said, to see Labor using the issue of same-sex couples as a torpedo or a weapon to sink a bill that they are ultimately going to vote against. I regret that.
I think it is also important to make the point that, if that is going to be your strategy from now on, then I must appeal to consistency. There is a bill that Senator Coonan is now promoting dealing with the splitting of couples' incomes. That is a proposal that would discriminate against same-sex couples. Are you going to be consistent and insist on amendments to that bill? To the minister I would say—given that your argument to date has been that this particular bill on co-contributions is about individuals and does not touch on relationships and, therefore, these amendments are not appropriate and you will support them on that basis—what possible argument can you provide to not support them on the income splitting bill, which is specifically about relationships? 
Mr Cameron in the other place has argued that the super choice bill would allow for same-sex couples to move to that particular regime and avoid the discrimination. I am deeply offended by that argument. Lesbian and gay people are the only people for whom it is suggested that market forces should be the answer to human rights.
—And they still get taxed.
—And they still get taxed. It is only the gay and lesbian community to whom anybody would dare suggest that, rather than having national legislation to end discrimination, it should be done by market forces. It is deeply and personally offensive, and it is wrong. Senator Watson has said that it would be a great pity if this bill were to fail on this particular point. I agree. But, if it does, the blame for that rests with the government and its ridiculous position on this issue. We know where it comes from. I do not think it comes from Senator Coonan. I think her heart is in the right place. It comes directly from the Prime Minister and cabinet. We know that because the Prime Minister stated, in an interview with Mr Kerry O'Brien on the 7.30 Report about two years ago, that he opposed equal rights and equal superannuation conditions for same-sex couples because it would lead to gay marriage. That is where it stops so far as the government is concerned.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-10-15,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The advice of the CSIRO annual report 2002-03 directly contradicts the puff piece that we see in the Financial Review today on the CSIRO. The claims on page 1 of the Financial Review today that the CSIRO is now going to establish prescriptive performance targets have demonstrated, once again, that journalists do not necessarily have the opportunity to check the facts. We have seen these types of performance targets set before, and we have seen many occasions when those performance targets have not been met. In fact, when we go through this annual report, we notice some fundamental trends being reinforced—trends I have identified through the Senate estimates processes. May I begin by asserting that CSIRO staff are doing an excellent job. There are many of our finest scientific minds employed by the CSIRO. They are doing that excellent job under extraordinary duress and despite the failure of this government to provide the adequate financial and infrastructure support that is required to ensure that the CSIRO is able to perform at its optimum. 
What we see in these measures, however, is that there is still no triennial funding. This is a position that I have called on the government to reverse—and I suggest it is appropriate that we all do so, because the government should restore triennial funding to the CSIRO. The effects of the government's short-term commercial emphasis are now becoming very clear. This report shows that IP revenue has fallen by 18 per cent in the year and that external earnings as a percentage of total revenue have fallen to 34.1 per cent—a further fall of 0.6 per cent on the past year. External earnings targets are somewhat higher than that, but the actual achievements are static and barely keeping pace with inflation. What has happened to the great leap forward that we were promised by the CSIRO in the last five-year plan? In today's Financial Review the CSIRO is quoted as saying it has a target of $1.1 billion in revenue by 2006-07. This compares with what was termed the `stretch target' of $1.3 billion in the last five-year plan. That was trumpeted as the great new performance measure that was going to be insisted on. We would like to know what has happened to that $200 million.
We see in this report yet again that the basic funding streams for the CSIRO, the basic drivers for their scientific achievement, remain static. At the same time, we see the number of refereed scientific publications and reports still below the 1997 level, while consulting or client reports increased by 35 per cent in the same period. There is a 10 per cent increase on last year. The number of postgraduate students supervised by the CSIRO has fallen by 28 per cent, which includes a net loss of 74 students in the last two years. There is evidence of a massive cultural change occurring within the CSIRO, but this is hardly in the direction that the government claims. The content of this annual report confirms that there is a drift towards short-termism, and we see that in the number of staff being appointed on short-term contracts. Any organisation must constantly refresh itself, but what we are seeing in the CSIRO at the moment is scientists of excellence, great experience and great knowledge being lost and younger replacements being brought in on short-term temporary placements. A Business Review Weekly article of 11 September put quite a contrasting position to that put in the Financial Review today.
It is quite clear, with the block grant of the CSIRO now directly under threat in the reviews being undertaken by this government, that the government strategy of moving to break up the CSIRO continues apace. We are seeing in this both the Chief Scientist and the ARC arguing for the removal of such funding. We notice from the Chief Scientist's recent report—which the government has yet to release but which we were able to draw attention to yesterday at the Press Club—that the position of Australia's scientific achievement is under serious threat because of the government's failure to provide the necessary research and development funds and the necessary research infrastructure. Our position by international standards is declining. This report demonstrates yet again further evidence of that. (Time expired)

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2003-10-15,"—I rise tonight to make some remarks about the commissioning of the Australian Defence Force's newest Anzac frigate, HMAS Parramatta, which was commissioned in Sydney on 4 October. It is fortuitous indeed that you are in the chair this evening, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins. I congratulate the new commander of HMAS Parramatta, CommanderMichael Noonan, on taking command of his ship and of course wish Commander Noonan and his crew the very best for their future activities. 
I found the commissioning ceremony to be a grand and historic occasion. In fact, it was an absolute honour to be there and the first opportunity I have had to attend such an event. The Parramatta is Australia's newest Anzac frigate. The primary roles of the Anzac class are surveillance and patrol, the protection of shipping and strategic areas, naval gunfire support in support of the Army, disaster relief in the region and search and rescue. To fulfil those roles they have very impressive specifications: displacement of 3,600 tonnes, a length of 118 metres, a range of 6,000 nautical miles at 18 knots and a speed of 27 knots. Any casual observation of HMAS Parramatta would confirm in anyone's view that she is indeed a very creditable addition to the Anzac frigate fleet. Parramatta is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which is her importance to the Australian Navy. To me, and to those of us who work in and around the city of Parramatta, she is a particularly important vessel. 
Also present at the commissioning ceremony were the member for Parramatta, Ross Cameron, and the Mayor of the city of Parramatta, Paul Garrard. I think it is fair to say that any casual reader of the Parramatta Advertiser would know by now that HMAS Parramatta has most certainly been embraced by the city of Parramatta and by the community. In the run-up to the commissioning, the reports of the Parramatta Eels providing jerseys and of the various parts of the community really welcoming Commander Noonan and his crew with open arms were very heart-warming. The commissioning ceremony itself offered a very valuable opportunity to see some young, dedicated and enthusiastic members of the RAN among the ship's company of 170 officers and sailors and to be part of, as I said, an historic occasion. 
In fact, the story of HMAS Parramatta is a very interesting one. `Parramatta' is the oldest name in Australian naval history. There have been three previous RAN ships to bear the name and each of those saw service in a major conflict. The name Parramatta was taken in recognition of the Burramatugal people, a clan of the Darug people whose territory extended from the Parramatta area to beyond the Blue Mountains—and, again, anyone who works in and around Parramatta and Western Sydney would knows that the Darug people are very proud of their heritage and their history.
HMAS Parramatta (I) was the first ship of the then fledgling Commonwealth Naval Forces, which became the RAN. She was a River class torpedo boat destroyer, displacing 700 tonnes and capable of a top speed of 28 knots. She was launched in 1910 and in 1913 entered Sydney Harbour for the first time as part of the RAN's first fleet. She served with distinction in World War I, most notably in the destruction of German signal stations at the outbreak of the war and during the hunt for the German Far East fleet. Her list of achievements and contributions goes on for some time. After the war, she was used in a variety of training roles and was eventually paid off from naval service in April 1928. Interestingly for the people of Parramatta today, the bow and stern sections of Parramatta (I) were salvaged in 1973 and later unveiled as memorials to the ship at Garden Island, where the bow lies, and the city of Parramatta, where the stern lies. I would pass it on most days travelling to and from my office.
HMAS Parramatta (II) was a Grimsby class slip of 1,060 tonnes commissioned in 1940. She sailed from Fremantle in 1940 en route to the Red Sea, where she spent the next nine months escorting, patrolling and mine sweeping in what was then one of the world's most torrid zones. It was extraordinary work. In April 1941 she took part in the British operations against Italian Eritrea and East Africa and then transferred to the Mediterranean station. There is a disturbing and typically challenging World War II story in relation to her involvement in action from that point. Suffice it to say, while escorting a small steamer into Tobruk in company with the sloop HMAS Auckland, the allied ships came under attack. At about midnight on 26 November she was fired upon several times and was finally hit by a U-boat torpedo. The ship was torn apart, rolled rapidly to starboard and sank—138 men lost their lives; 24 survivors were recovered.
HMAS Parramatta (III) was commissioned in 1961 as the first of the six River class antisubmarine frigates or destroyer escorts. She was then crewed by 250 officers and sailors and had a top speed of 30 knots. She completed several overseas deployments and spent many months on the Australia station. There were a number of highlights in her career, including escorting vessels to Vung Tau, Vietnam. She was extensively refitted between 1977 and 1981 and was decommissioned from the RAN in 1991. 
HMAS Parramatta (IV) follows a very proud tradition of ships of the Royal Australian Navy named Parramatta. The links she has with the city of Parramatta are also significant, including the design and origin of her badge, which is derived from the Parramatta City Council seal of 1939. As I said earlier, the salvaged stern of HMAS Parramatta (I) is situated in the city of Parramatta now. The Parramatta Eels have adopted the ship, the mayor has adopted the ship and, in a very short time, the rigid hull inflatable boats, or RHIBs, of Parramatta (IV) will be named by the schoolchildren of Parramatta in a competition they are currently participating in. The winner will be announced at Parramatta's foundation day celebrations on 2 November. The name of one of the RHIBs is to be related to Parramatta and the other must be an Indigenous name. I know the schoolchildren of Parramatta are heavily engaged in that process.
The history that was evident in the commissioning process itself was also extraordinarily impressive and in some cases quite moving. The ship's lady was Mrs Jill Green, who comes from a naval family. Her father, Lieutenant Bill Langford, was the executive officer of HMAS Parramatta (II) and was one of those lost in 1941. Mrs Green gave a deeply moving and very affecting speech on the occasion of the commissioning, and I was very proud to be there to listen to that. Even more moving, in some ways, was the presence of four members of the crew of HMAS Parramatta (II) for an exchange of caps with the new crew of Parramatta (IV). One could not help but be moved by the emotion overwhelming that particular aspect of the ceremony.
For the first time ever, I observed the blessing of the ship's caul, an old Navy tradition that requires the caul—a portion of a newborn baby's amniotic sac—to be carried in the security of the CO's safe as a guarantee of the safety of the ship and its crew. In olden times, sailors who carried a caul were said to have been immune from drowning at sea. The blessing of the caul on this occasion was made possible because of the birth of Commander Noonan's own daughter, Jaimie, 15 days before the commissioning, so she will have a small part of her travelling everywhere with her father in the vessel HMAS Parramatta. Her mother, Jan, is also a naval officer and it is obviously a very important event for the Noonan family. I understand Jamie was christened the next day on Parramatta, with two children of other members of the crew.
This was an inspiring and fascinating ceremony. It involved the most high-tech, modern example of military hardware that I suspect you could find in the RAN at the moment. It was mixed with the history and idiosyncrasies of naval tradition, which were revealed to some of us who had not previously had the opportunity to see such things. It was an enormous credit to the Royal Australian Navy. I was very honoured to be present, and I wish the Parramatta and her crew all the very best.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Defence: HMAS Parramatta</title>,Adjournment,37,1
