Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (10:03):  I rise to address the Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 and cognate bills and indicate that the opposition will be supporting the legislation. The Export Control Act 1982 provides the basis for ensuring that exports meet the requirements of the importing country. Labor welcomes this legislation, which will provide a fairer and more consistent approach to cost recovery for services provided by the Department of Agriculture to exporters. The legislation seeks to remedy technical defects and inconsistencies, which will in turn allow the Department of Agriculture to recover an estimated $1.9 million each year for the provision of export services for commodities which are currently excluded from the cost recovery mechanisms. Those items are cut flowers, dried fruit, fodder, nursery stock, nuts, seeds, timber products, tissue culture and ratite meat. I am not sure exactly what ratite meat is. I do not know if you know the answer to that, Deputy President Parry, coming from Tasmania. There are a few rabbits down there. But all of those things are currently excluded. Principally they were excluded because, at the time that the legislation was originally introduced, they were not items that we were exporting.


So the effect of this legislation is that it tidies up and standardises the definition of prescribed goods across seven statutes. These changes are important because in Australia we export around 65 per cent of our farm products, about 75 per cent of our fish products and some 60 per cent of our forest products. So obviously our international markets are absolutely critical to the health, wellbeing and profitability of our agricultural sector. As we strive to fully capitalise on the Asia led dining boom, a full and efficient cost recovery of export services will be of increasing importance, given how important our brand and image is in those international markets.


I think it is important to note that these are reforms that were commenced under the former government. We were very lucky in the Rudd-Gillard period to have three terrific agriculture ministers—Tony Burke, Minister Ludwig and of course, most recently, Minister Fitzgibbon—who all did a terrific job in this area. These changes are a result of the good work that those people did in the agriculture portfolio. I support this legislation.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:06):  I rise to speak to the Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Whilst I concur with Senator Farrell on the areas that need to be addressed, I wish to raise a number of points and flag concerns that the industry has raised with me and raises with me on a frequent basis. This becomes a question of the competitiveness of our export charges vis-a-vis those countries with whom we compete around the world, and it is a highly competitive market.


People should be aware, of course, that Australia agriculturally survives on its exports. We export some two-thirds of our farm produce, three-quarters of our fish products and 60 per cent of our forest products. Agriculture was worth more than $40 billion in 2012-13 but, more importantly, it is growing and growing rapidly. As the mining boom comes off, as we price ourselves out of the market for new oil and gas development around Australia—and I need speak no further than Santos's decision the other day to abandon their plans in the Bonaparte Gulf—agriculture once again is going to return to its pre-eminent position, and agricultural exports will of course be part of it.


In my home state of Western Australia, as with South Australia, about 95 per cent of our grain is exported. So it is critically important that people understand the implications of the legislation and the amendments being undertaken. I voice these concerns because we are at risk of becoming totally uncompetitive and pricing ourselves out of these markets.


Let me give you a quick example. When I was in the United States in December last year I met for a couple of days United States Department of Agriculture personnel. They told me that all costs associated with inspections for export, or at least the vast majority, are in fact met by the American taxpayer. You might say: why is that relevant to us here in Australia? The answer is that we are in intense competition with the United States in markets such as South Korea and Japan, and I hope we will soon be more active in the Chinese market.


The situation as described to me by the Americans, the USDA, is one where the only thing of interest to the American Department of Agriculture is the requirements of the importing country. They confine themselves only to those areas required by the importing country. We in Australia have now gone well beyond that. We are at the stage where we are almost giving advice to importing countries: 'Are you sure you don't want such and such an inspection service undertaken?'


We have to take a very correct and quick look at this to see where we are and what our role is. As the Americans said to me and I absolutely endorse, our high standards of inspection services are critical. We know that the US market is very important to us in terms of exports of beef and, depending on whether you look at value or volume, we are the second or third largest exporter of beef in the world behind Brazil and competing with India and their very much lower value buffalo meat. I for one will always defend, stand up for and argue for the highest standards. 


What I am here today to talk about are the cost-recovery circumstances we are facing. I was recently advised that research undertaken by the red meat sector to 2012 estimated that government influenced costs and charges in Australia account for almost 30 per cent of all costs incurred after the purchase of livestock and that did not take into account those incredibly increasing costs for the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. It is unsustainable that 30 per cent of all costs would be related to government. Furthermore, to give emphasis to this point, from 2005-06 to 2013-14, costs for example of export certification have increased by 122 per cent from $5 million to $10 million at a time when the number of livestock being exported has declined by one-third. How can we possibly sustain these improvements, these changes? The Public Service Commission, in a capability review released only two months ago, in March this year, stated:


It is notable that 60% of the department’s budget comes from cost-recovery operations. As part of these operations, DAFF manages many fees and charges and consults with well over 100 industry bodies … 


This creates a level of inefficiency that would not be accepted in private industry and represents a major threat to the department’s future capability. 


It went on to say that ultimately it will benefit both portfolio industries and the department if we achieve significant improvements. We have seen, for example, a 113 per cent increase in some charges in one year, in 2010-11. We have a circumstance in which industry currently pays all costs in live animal exports, including those not associated with export certification. As well as performing export certification services, the live animal exports group undertakes a range of activities such as answering parliamentary questions, briefing ministers, responding to correspondence, preparing financial reports, responding to FOI requests, public queries and supporting market access negotiations. Yet industry is paying for all of these costs under the industry recovery scheme. It simply cannot afford to do so. 


I am flagging this today, as I have with the minister, as I have with the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and as I will go on doing. Let me give you an illustration. Remember, we are one of 109 countries involved in exports. We have by far and away the highest costs associated with the exercise. Our hourly rate is absolutely unacceptable and I come back to producers because at the end of the day all costs end up at the farm gate. We have circumstances now where the return to a producer in the USA is double that of the return to a producer in Australia. We know from the current grass-fed beef inquiry that the return to the producer today per kilogram is no different from what it was 20 years ago. Yet the domestic consumption of beef has gone down and retail prices have gone through the roof. When you look at abattoir processing costs in our country, they are infinitely higher than the next highest and that is the United States of America. 


When one has a look at the costs imposed on industry by the Department of Agriculture—I am now referring to the draft Cost Recovery Impact Statement for 2014—one sees that these are costs associated with document processing and administration. These are the anomalies that our industry representatives are coming to me on a continuing basis to ask how can they be reconciled. Those are costs of document processing for a companion animal, $381 per hour; for a horse, $508 an hour; for reproductive material, be they embryos, semen or whatever, $405 an hour. But for livestock export that figure jumps to $671.80 per hour. These costs are absolutely unsustainable. As I said to the secretary during Senate estimates, we know that veterinarians and others in the Department of Agriculture are not being paid $625,781.70 per annum. If they were, I might consider applying for a job as a veterinarian in the Department of Agriculture. 


How is it that these costs are so high? We have a circumstance where small exporters are being priced out of the market. In one circumstance put to me the gross return for a small export was going to be $1,000 and the cost of processing the documentation to actually give effect to that export was $1,000, 100 per cent of the actual return to the producer. So you say to yourself, 'What happens in other countries?' Senator Colbeck, Senator Sterle and then Senator Kerry O'Brien and I were in New Zealand two years ago, through you, Deputy President, to Senator Colbeck. In that country they have outsourced much of the export inspection services for a range of animal species and indeed for costs associated with laboratory testing et cetera. We in Australia have not done that. Here in Australia the Department of Agriculture sets the rules, licenses the exporters, attends to the inspection and then acts as the appeals board should there be any complaints or disagreements with those fees and charges. That is exactly where we are at the moment. You bet that industry is complaining bitterly when it is looking at proposals of $671 an hour, when it is looking at an increase from 65c per kilometre—which is reasonable, in industry—up to $1 per kilometre with no explanation being given, and the other attendant charges of this cost-recovery about which I spoke in the last few minutes. 


I have presented to relevant parties a circumstance which is occurring at the moment in terms of live export charges. These are those associated with documentation et cetera. We have the anomalous situation in which the hourly rate for these inspection services changed dramatically and I want to explain how they do. There are three classes of cattle getting exported: those for breeding purposes, those which are known as feeder cattle and they will go into feedlots, and others that will go directly for meat processing. The price per animal for feedlot cattle is called tier 2 and this is $3.90 per beast. You say to yourself, 'Well, $3.90 per beast, if that is what the fee is, it is going to go back to the producer eventually but we can wear that.' But as I presented tax invoices the other day the circumstance exists at the moment where that $3.90 per beast is for the first 22 hours of an inspection service. In industry we would think, if you have a look at any aspect of industry, be it professional services, be it trades or whatever, the larger the number of animals or the larger the number of units, the larger the number of electric light bulbs that an electrician might be replacing, the actual unit cost would go down. But that is not the case under this new cost-recovery scheme. After 22 hours, and that is a very small number of hours for the complexity of the work being undertaken, and I am going to come to ESCAS in a moment, after 22 hours that figure changes dramatically in what is referred to in the tax invoices as a penalty fee. That penalty fee for the invoice I have in front of me jumped from $3.90 per beast to $70.50—yes, $70.50—per animal.


Any of us who have been involved in business, anybody who has been involved in the provision of services, whether professional services, trades or labour related services, would know that you factor in your costs before you present them to a potential client. So, if $3.90 per animal is the fee, you have factored in the associated costs—your head office costs, your costs per diem if the person has to travel. You take all those into account and the figure is, in this case, $3.90 per animal. There can be no circumstance in which that fee jumps up to $70.50 per beast to be processed.


I do not care how people try to defend that to me. I cannot understand it if they come to me and say, 'We think this is associated with factoring in all of the costs.' My answer to them is that the $3.90 should factor in all the costs. Furthermore, I say again: when there are more animals, more electric light bulbs or more hours of consultation that a legal firm may give a client, one would expect the unit cost to come down, not to go from $4 per animal to $70 per animal. This is totally and utterly unacceptable and without exception.


As industry says to me, there is no cost pressure. There is no cost competitiveness. I understand that the officials of the Department of Agriculture are very diligent, but if you know very well that for the first 22 hours you are going to get $3.90 per beast and after that you are going to get a very much higher figure—and in the case I quoted it is $70.50—where is the incentive to get the work done more efficiently, in a shorter amount of time? More particularly, if it is the statement of our government—and it is—that we are trying to reduce red tape, that we are open for business, then it is incumbent on us to be driving these prices down, to be improving efficiency.


I come to the question of risk—and this is the mechanism, in my view, by which this can be done. Obviously, if we are to retain the status that we enjoy internationally in terms of the quality of the product that we export, the standards of inspection that we enjoy, the return to producers and others in the chain, then of course it is absolutely critical that we are able to go to the international markets and assure them of our ongoing and continued commitment in this area.


But I ask this question. If, for example, live animals are exported from the same farms, using the same transporters, using the same feedlots, using the same ships, into the same importers' facilities, into the same abattoirs for 40 years, with obviously high trust by the purchaser in the quality of our product and the price at which we are able to put it into the market, where is the justification, from a risk analysis point of view, for spending exactly the same amount of time reviewing that export and a new request for export to that market when we know that there is no change in all of that supply chain?


The point I want to make is that in a risk analysis process what we must do, of course, is to have a look at the risk. If it is a new exporter, if it is a new importer, if it is a new participant in the supply chain, if it is a new market or if it is a new product, then we should devote all of that time and attention to satisfying ourselves here in Australia and to satisfying the end customer that we can in fact preserve the integrity of our product. That is where the money should be spent.


At the moment, where is the incentive, I ask, for an excellent exporter, controlling the supply chain in an efficient way, to continue their level of excellence? Where is the reward from the regulator which says to that exporter: 'You are performing at or above industry, international and national expectations, so we will lower the level of audit upon you. We will charge you a lower figure. We will continue to keep an eye on you, of course, and should there be any problems we'll come down on you like a tonne of hot bricks'? But where is the incentive for that exporter to maintain their excellence when in fact they are going to be the subject of the same levels of this $671 an hour, for example, or the ridiculous figure of 22 hours at $3.90, jumping up to $70.50? There is no logic in this particular exercise.


I say again that we are operating in a highly competitive market. Following my visits to the USDA in Washington, I met with participants of the cattle industry, the export industry, the Texas Department of Agriculture in Austin Texas, the Texas A&M University and producers and exporters. Their continuing question was: 'Senator Back, why are importing countries who you have long supplied with product here in the United States of America trying to source supply from us when we know very well that the quality of your product has stood up over 40 years? We know you lead the world in transportation. We know you lead the world in animal welfare standards. Why are they?' I could name them for you. They asked me, 'Why are they here in the United States trying to source product?' The answer, regrettably, is that we are at risk of not continuing that high level of reliability for which we have earned an enviable reputation in live animal exports, beef, sheep meat and associated products.


I support this legislation, but I put out a call very strongly on behalf of industry that what we are moving towards is unsustainable. We cannot sustain it, the producers of Australia cannot handle the added costs upon them, and I urge government and the department to address this. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I just reflect on Senator Back's very powerful contribution. We cannot ignore what Senator Back has outlined. They are very real concerns in terms of Australia's slipping productivity and competitiveness. These are real issues that we must address, otherwise we will lose significant export markets. We will not be able to compete on the world stage. We will not be able to compete in global markets. The consequences of that for our agricultural sector will be disastrous. It will have a cataclysmic effect on our agricultural sector and, indeed, our economy unless we address these issues. Senator Back's contribution makes specific reference to some of the extraordinary charges. We know that Senator Back is a former vet—once a vet always a vet. Fees of $625 an hour being charged is extraordinary. Fees have been ramped up without, apparently, any level of transparency, accountability, rhyme nor reason. It must be addressed by this place; it must be addressed by the department. I would urge the minister, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, to read every word of what Senator Back has said in terms of our lack of competitiveness and our slipping productivity.


In relation to this bill, I have real concerns about cost recovery when it comes to export markets. I acknowledge that the Department of Agriculture is operating on less than half the budget it had only seven years ago, which is a ludicrous position. Agriculture, food production and exports are vital to the Australian economy. The department should have enough funding to provide support to the industry. It should not have to bill the very people it is supposed to be backing, because the enormous economic benefits of having a strong export market for what is our ultimate sustainable, renewable resource—agricultural products—is something that we must be able to support rather than put roadblocks in the way. Exports and agricultural exports in particular provide a net benefit to the Australian economy. These activities should be supported by the government as a whole rather than penalised by extra fees. That is what my real concern is about.


There appears to be no bipartisan consensus with respect to these fees over the years. I think we have gone in the wrong direction. We should be acknowledging that, if you build export markets, it means that those businesses will be more profitable and they will be paying more tax, and they will be employing more people, who in turn will be paying tax. That is the approach we need to have philosophically. To make matters worse, the application of cost recovery has been, I believe, a disaster—although, to be fair, I believe that Minister Joyce and the current government understand some of these issues and seem to be willing to address them. Cost recovery is spread unevenly and I think that it needs to be dealt with.


I will be supporting this bill but I do have serious and significant reservations about the whole concept of cost recovery. I note that Minister Joyce and his office have been very supportive in addressing particular concerns I have had about matters relating to this bill. In particular, I have had representations from Ross Hampton, the CEO of the Australian Forest Products Association, and from Gavin Matthew, the manager of processing, and there have been some useful and fruitful discussions with the department and with the minister's office in respect of those representations. The minister and the department have now agreed to hold off on applying tonnage charges to the forestry industry until a review of the proposed fee application has been completed. I would like to take this opportunity to table a letter from the minister outlining this agreement. It was a letter received from the minister this morning. It is undated but it is a letter that was prepared this morning. I seek leave of the Senate to table that letter.


Leave granted.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I will just read into the Hansard the letter from the minister, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, MP. In this letter, which is addressed to me, the minister states:


I am writing with regard to the planned fee review for plant export industries.


The fee review will commence in July 2014 and will include consideration of the equitable distribution of a quantity (tonnage) charge for timber products.


In determining appropriate fees and charges the Department of Agriculture will develop a draft Cost Recovery Impact Statement (CRIS) after consultation with industry. This will be facilitated primarily through the Grain and Plant Products Export Industry Consultative Committee and the Horticulture Export Industry Consultative Committee. The draft CRIS will be released for public comment and further feedback will be sought prior to its finalisation and, if required, eventual submission to the Minister for Finance for approval. Ultimately I will consider a legislative package that will be subject to usual parliamentary consideration.


I am advised the process outlined above will take an estimated 9 to 12 months with implementation of the new fee regimes to commence after that process has been completed.


Thank you for your willingness to engage with me on this important issue.


Yours sincerely


Barnaby Joyce MP


I think that gives a degree of comfort and support to the industry to give them time to adjust to a tonnage charge. The process means that, in effect, there will not be a tonnage charge in place until at least 1 April next year, given that the process will take nine to 12 months. I am very grateful to the minister's office and to the department's advisers who put up with me last week in a number of meetings that we had in respect of that issue, but I think it was a good and fair result.


My concern about recovery fees is maintained. My concern is that cost recovery is spread unevenly across the sector. A proportion of experts are currently carrying the burden for everyone, which is patently unfair. I note the department is planning to review the ways fees are charged, and I hope they will be more considerate and flexible when it comes to applying these charges, and also to take heed of the issues raised by Senator Back in terms of what appear to be less than transparent charges that have been in place for a number of years.


It is also not fair for small exporters to pay the same as large exporters, or for forestry products to be charged per tonne in the same way grain is, when these products have very different tonnage values. I have spoken in this place before about Mick and Tanya Punteriero, who are niche lime growers in the Riverland—people from your neck of woods, Madam Acting Deputy President Ruston, in the wonderful Riverland of South Australia. I know that you have done a lot of work with them to assist them. Mick and Tanya export a small number of pallets of their limes to New Zealand each year. The application of cost recovery, however, meant that they were charged the same amount as a large packing house exporting thousands of tonnes. It was a fixed charge that was unreasonable—around $8½ thousand.


I understand that a number of matters have flowed on from that through your work as well, Madam Acting Deputy President, which has been of some assistance to growers such as the Ponterieros. But, while there are some rebates for smaller producers, there was no guarantee how long these would last. A fee structure that does not recognise the size of a business or what they are exporting is not just unfair but also a disincentive to export. If you want to encourage those small exporters to become medium to big exporters in the future, encourage them now; do not hit them with punitive fees that are simply too uneconomic for them to be involved in the export market. It means that smaller shipments like those into new or niche markets just are not available and, without innovation, our industries will stall.


I will be supporting this legislation with some reluctance and, while I acknowledge the work of the minister and the department in addressing some of these issues, I am still philosophically and practically opposed to the way cost recovery is applied at the moment. I hope that when the budget issues have been addressed the government will reconsider the use of cost recovery in the agricultural sector to the extent it is now being used and also to kick-start incentives for the small exporters which will become the big exporters and the bigger employers in the future.


In the meantime, I hope the fee reviews will be thorough and will take into account concerns raised by the industry and the concerns raised very ably by Senator Back. If cost recovery is going to exist, it should at least be equitable and fairly applied. I believe these measures agreed to by the minister will go some way towards achieving this and for the forestry products industry I believe that the undertakings, the letter from Minister Joyce today, will give them some comfort and ability to plan for their sector.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (10:35):  I thank senators for their contributions this morning. I particularly recognise the interest shown in this issue by Senator Back, by Senator Xenophon and by you, Acting Deputy President Ruston. The government recognises that export fees and charges are an issue of concern for the agricultural export community. I know that a number of senators have been spending a lot of time working on this issue going back to 2008-09, when changes in the cost recovery process and the 40 per cent rebate on cost recovery was removed by the previous government.


As intimated by Senator Xenophon, there are $15 million in this year's budget to assist small producers over four years in export sectors where there are specific export certification charges. The government has also announced that it is doing a full review of export fees and charges. That is a very important piece of work, to consider the way these fees are applied. Senator Back was correct when he said we are part of a competitive export supply chain and that the costs of government go to the cost of participating in the export sector. We need to ensure we are competitive as part of that process as well, no different from any other private supplier in the market. That is a principle we need to consider as part of the export fees and charges review process.


I commend the bills to the Senate.

Labor welcomes this legislation, which will provide a fairer and more consistent approach to cost recovery for services provided by the Department of Agriculture to exporters.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:06):  I rise to speak to the Export Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. Whilst I concur with Senator Farrell on the areas that need to be addressed, I wish to raise a number of points and flag concerns that the industry has raised with me and raises with me on a frequent basis. This becomes a question of the competitiveness of our export charges vis-a-vis those countries with whom we compete around the world, and it is a highly competitive market.


People should be aware, of course, that Australia agriculturally survives on its exports. We export some two-thirds of our farm produce, three-quarters of our fish products and 60 per cent of our forest products. Agriculture was worth more than $40 billion in 2012-13 but, more importantly, it is growing and growing rapidly. As the mining boom comes off, as we price ourselves out of the market for new oil and gas development around Australia—and I need speak no further than Santos's decision the other day to abandon their plans in the Bonaparte Gulf—agriculture once again is going to return to its pre-eminent position, and agricultural exports will of course be part of it.


In my home state of Western Australia, as with South Australia, about 95 per cent of our grain is exported. So it is critically important that people understand the implications of the legislation and the amendments being undertaken. I voice these concerns because we are at risk of becoming totally uncompetitive and pricing ourselves out of these markets.


Let me give you a quick example. When I was in the United States in December last year I met for a couple of days United States Department of Agriculture personnel. They told me that all costs associated with inspections for export, or at least the vast majority, are in fact met by the American taxpayer. You might say: why is that relevant to us here in Australia? The answer is that we are in intense competition with the United States in markets such as South Korea and Japan, and I hope we will soon be more active in the Chinese market.


The situation as described to me by the Americans, the USDA, is one where the only thing of interest to the American Department of Agriculture is the requirements of the importing country. They confine themselves only to those areas required by the importing country. We in Australia have now gone well beyond that. We are at the stage where we are almost giving advice to importing countries: 'Are you sure you don't want such and such an inspection service undertaken?'


We have to take a very correct and quick look at this to see where we are and what our role is. As the Americans said to me and I absolutely endorse, our high standards of inspection services are critical. We know that the US market is very important to us in terms of exports of beef and, depending on whether you look at value or volume, we are the second or third largest exporter of beef in the world behind Brazil and competing with India and their very much lower value buffalo meat. I for one will always defend, stand up for and argue for the highest standards. 


What I am here today to talk about are the cost-recovery circumstances we are facing. I was recently advised that research undertaken by the red meat sector to 2012 estimated that government influenced costs and charges in Australia account for almost 30 per cent of all costs incurred after the purchase of livestock and that did not take into account those incredibly increasing costs for the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. It is unsustainable that 30 per cent of all costs would be related to government. Furthermore, to give emphasis to this point, from 2005-06 to 2013-14, costs for example of export certification have increased by 122 per cent from $5 million to $10 million at a time when the number of livestock being exported has declined by one-third. How can we possibly sustain these improvements, these changes? The Public Service Commission, in a capability review released only two months ago, in March this year, stated:


It is notable that 60% of the department’s budget comes from cost-recovery operations. As part of these operations, DAFF manages many fees and charges and consults with well over 100 industry bodies … 


This creates a level of inefficiency that would not be accepted in private industry and represents a major threat to the department’s future capability. 


It went on to say that ultimately it will benefit both portfolio industries and the department if we achieve significant improvements. We have seen, for example, a 113 per cent increase in some charges in one year, in 2010-11. We have a circumstance in which industry currently pays all costs in live animal exports, including those not associated with export certification. As well as performing export certification services, the live animal exports group undertakes a range of activities such as answering parliamentary questions, briefing ministers, responding to correspondence, preparing financial reports, responding to FOI requests, public queries and supporting market access negotiations. Yet industry is paying for all of these costs under the industry recovery scheme. It simply cannot afford to do so. 


I am flagging this today, as I have with the minister, as I have with the secretary of the Department of Agriculture and as I will go on doing. Let me give you an illustration. Remember, we are one of 109 countries involved in exports. We have by far and away the highest costs associated with the exercise. Our hourly rate is absolutely unacceptable and I come back to producers because at the end of the day all costs end up at the farm gate. We have circumstances now where the return to a producer in the USA is double that of the return to a producer in Australia. We know from the current grass-fed beef inquiry that the return to the producer today per kilogram is no different from what it was 20 years ago. Yet the domestic consumption of beef has gone down and retail prices have gone through the roof. When you look at abattoir processing costs in our country, they are infinitely higher than the next highest and that is the United States of America. 


When one has a look at the costs imposed on industry by the Department of Agriculture—I am now referring to the draft Cost Recovery Impact Statement for 2014—one sees that these are costs associated with document processing and administration. These are the anomalies that our industry representatives are coming to me on a continuing basis to ask how can they be reconciled. Those are costs of document processing for a companion animal, $381 per hour; for a horse, $508 an hour; for reproductive material, be they embryos, semen or whatever, $405 an hour. But for livestock export that figure jumps to $671.80 per hour. These costs are absolutely unsustainable. As I said to the secretary during Senate estimates, we know that veterinarians and others in the Department of Agriculture are not being paid $625,781.70 per annum. If they were, I might consider applying for a job as a veterinarian in the Department of Agriculture. 


How is it that these costs are so high? We have a circumstance where small exporters are being priced out of the market. In one circumstance put to me the gross return for a small export was going to be $1,000 and the cost of processing the documentation to actually give effect to that export was $1,000, 100 per cent of the actual return to the producer. So you say to yourself, 'What happens in other countries?' Senator Colbeck, Senator Sterle and then Senator Kerry O'Brien and I were in New Zealand two years ago, through you, Deputy President, to Senator Colbeck. In that country they have outsourced much of the export inspection services for a range of animal species and indeed for costs associated with laboratory testing et cetera. We in Australia have not done that. Here in Australia the Department of Agriculture sets the rules, licenses the exporters, attends to the inspection and then acts as the appeals board should there be any complaints or disagreements with those fees and charges. That is exactly where we are at the moment. You bet that industry is complaining bitterly when it is looking at proposals of $671 an hour, when it is looking at an increase from 65c per kilometre—which is reasonable, in industry—up to $1 per kilometre with no explanation being given, and the other attendant charges of this cost-recovery about which I spoke in the last few minutes. 


I have presented to relevant parties a circumstance which is occurring at the moment in terms of live export charges. These are those associated with documentation et cetera. We have the anomalous situation in which the hourly rate for these inspection services changed dramatically and I want to explain how they do. There are three classes of cattle getting exported: those for breeding purposes, those which are known as feeder cattle and they will go into feedlots, and others that will go directly for meat processing. The price per animal for feedlot cattle is called tier 2 and this is $3.90 per beast. You say to yourself, 'Well, $3.90 per beast, if that is what the fee is, it is going to go back to the producer eventually but we can wear that.' But as I presented tax invoices the other day the circumstance exists at the moment where that $3.90 per beast is for the first 22 hours of an inspection service. In industry we would think, if you have a look at any aspect of industry, be it professional services, be it trades or whatever, the larger the number of animals or the larger the number of units, the larger the number of electric light bulbs that an electrician might be replacing, the actual unit cost would go down. But that is not the case under this new cost-recovery scheme. After 22 hours, and that is a very small number of hours for the complexity of the work being undertaken, and I am going to come to ESCAS in a moment, after 22 hours that figure changes dramatically in what is referred to in the tax invoices as a penalty fee. That penalty fee for the invoice I have in front of me jumped from $3.90 per beast to $70.50—yes, $70.50—per animal.


Any of us who have been involved in business, anybody who has been involved in the provision of services, whether professional services, trades or labour related services, would know that you factor in your costs before you present them to a potential client. So, if $3.90 per animal is the fee, you have factored in the associated costs—your head office costs, your costs per diem if the person has to travel. You take all those into account and the figure is, in this case, $3.90 per animal. There can be no circumstance in which that fee jumps up to $70.50 per beast to be processed.


I do not care how people try to defend that to me. I cannot understand it if they come to me and say, 'We think this is associated with factoring in all of the costs.' My answer to them is that the $3.90 should factor in all the costs. Furthermore, I say again: when there are more animals, more electric light bulbs or more hours of consultation that a legal firm may give a client, one would expect the unit cost to come down, not to go from $4 per animal to $70 per animal. This is totally and utterly unacceptable and without exception.


As industry says to me, there is no cost pressure. There is no cost competitiveness. I understand that the officials of the Department of Agriculture are very diligent, but if you know very well that for the first 22 hours you are going to get $3.90 per beast and after that you are going to get a very much higher figure—and in the case I quoted it is $70.50—where is the incentive to get the work done more efficiently, in a shorter amount of time? More particularly, if it is the statement of our government—and it is—that we are trying to reduce red tape, that we are open for business, then it is incumbent on us to be driving these prices down, to be improving efficiency.


I come to the question of risk—and this is the mechanism, in my view, by which this can be done. Obviously, if we are to retain the status that we enjoy internationally in terms of the quality of the product that we export, the standards of inspection that we enjoy, the return to producers and others in the chain, then of course it is absolutely critical that we are able to go to the international markets and assure them of our ongoing and continued commitment in this area.


But I ask this question. If, for example, live animals are exported from the same farms, using the same transporters, using the same feedlots, using the same ships, into the same importers' facilities, into the same abattoirs for 40 years, with obviously high trust by the purchaser in the quality of our product and the price at which we are able to put it into the market, where is the justification, from a risk analysis point of view, for spending exactly the same amount of time reviewing that export and a new request for export to that market when we know that there is no change in all of that supply chain?


The point I want to make is that in a risk analysis process what we must do, of course, is to have a look at the risk. If it is a new exporter, if it is a new importer, if it is a new participant in the supply chain, if it is a new market or if it is a new product, then we should devote all of that time and attention to satisfying ourselves here in Australia and to satisfying the end customer that we can in fact preserve the integrity of our product. That is where the money should be spent.


At the moment, where is the incentive, I ask, for an excellent exporter, controlling the supply chain in an efficient way, to continue their level of excellence? Where is the reward from the regulator which says to that exporter: 'You are performing at or above industry, international and national expectations, so we will lower the level of audit upon you. We will charge you a lower figure. We will continue to keep an eye on you, of course, and should there be any problems we'll come down on you like a tonne of hot bricks'? But where is the incentive for that exporter to maintain their excellence when in fact they are going to be the subject of the same levels of this $671 an hour, for example, or the ridiculous figure of 22 hours at $3.90, jumping up to $70.50? There is no logic in this particular exercise.


I say again that we are operating in a highly competitive market. Following my visits to the USDA in Washington, I met with participants of the cattle industry, the export industry, the Texas Department of Agriculture in Austin Texas, the Texas A&M University and producers and exporters. Their continuing question was: 'Senator Back, why are importing countries who you have long supplied with product here in the United States of America trying to source supply from us when we know very well that the quality of your product has stood up over 40 years? We know you lead the world in transportation. We know you lead the world in animal welfare standards. Why are they?' I could name them for you. They asked me, 'Why are they here in the United States trying to source product?' The answer, regrettably, is that we are at risk of not continuing that high level of reliability for which we have earned an enviable reputation in live animal exports, beef, sheep meat and associated products.


I support this legislation, but I put out a call very strongly on behalf of industry that what we are moving towards is unsustainable. We cannot sustain it, the producers of Australia cannot handle the added costs upon them, and I urge government and the department to address this. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:27):  I just reflect on Senator Back's very powerful contribution. We cannot ignore what Senator Back has outlined. They are very real concerns in terms of Australia's slipping productivity and competitiveness. These are real issues that we must address, otherwise we will lose significant export markets. We will not be able to compete on the world stage. We will not be able to compete in global markets. The consequences of that for our agricultural sector will be disastrous. It will have a cataclysmic effect on our agricultural sector and, indeed, our economy unless we address these issues. Senator Back's contribution makes specific reference to some of the extraordinary charges. We know that Senator Back is a former vet—once a vet always a vet. Fees of $625 an hour being charged is extraordinary. Fees have been ramped up without, apparently, any level of transparency, accountability, rhyme nor reason. It must be addressed by this place; it must be addressed by the department. I would urge the minister, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, to read every word of what Senator Back has said in terms of our lack of competitiveness and our slipping productivity.


In relation to this bill, I have real concerns about cost recovery when it comes to export markets. I acknowledge that the Department of Agriculture is operating on less than half the budget it had only seven years ago, which is a ludicrous position. Agriculture, food production and exports are vital to the Australian economy. The department should have enough funding to provide support to the industry. It should not have to bill the very people it is supposed to be backing, because the enormous economic benefits of having a strong export market for what is our ultimate sustainable, renewable resource—agricultural products—is something that we must be able to support rather than put roadblocks in the way. Exports and agricultural exports in particular provide a net benefit to the Australian economy. These activities should be supported by the government as a whole rather than penalised by extra fees. That is what my real concern is about.


There appears to be no bipartisan consensus with respect to these fees over the years. I think we have gone in the wrong direction. We should be acknowledging that, if you build export markets, it means that those businesses will be more profitable and they will be paying more tax, and they will be employing more people, who in turn will be paying tax. That is the approach we need to have philosophically. To make matters worse, the application of cost recovery has been, I believe, a disaster—although, to be fair, I believe that Minister Joyce and the current government understand some of these issues and seem to be willing to address them. Cost recovery is spread unevenly and I think that it needs to be dealt with.


I will be supporting this bill but I do have serious and significant reservations about the whole concept of cost recovery. I note that Minister Joyce and his office have been very supportive in addressing particular concerns I have had about matters relating to this bill. In particular, I have had representations from Ross Hampton, the CEO of the Australian Forest Products Association, and from Gavin Matthew, the manager of processing, and there have been some useful and fruitful discussions with the department and with the minister's office in respect of those representations. The minister and the department have now agreed to hold off on applying tonnage charges to the forestry industry until a review of the proposed fee application has been completed. I would like to take this opportunity to table a letter from the minister outlining this agreement. It was a letter received from the minister this morning. It is undated but it is a letter that was prepared this morning. I seek leave of the Senate to table that letter.


Leave granted.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I will just read into the Hansard the letter from the minister, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, MP. In this letter, which is addressed to me, the minister states:


I am writing with regard to the planned fee review for plant export industries.


The fee review will commence in July 2014 and will include consideration of the equitable distribution of a quantity (tonnage) charge for timber products.


In determining appropriate fees and charges the Department of Agriculture will develop a draft Cost Recovery Impact Statement (CRIS) after consultation with industry. This will be facilitated primarily through the Grain and Plant Products Export Industry Consultative Committee and the Horticulture Export Industry Consultative Committee. The draft CRIS will be released for public comment and further feedback will be sought prior to its finalisation and, if required, eventual submission to the Minister for Finance for approval. Ultimately I will consider a legislative package that will be subject to usual parliamentary consideration.


I am advised the process outlined above will take an estimated 9 to 12 months with implementation of the new fee regimes to commence after that process has been completed.


Thank you for your willingness to engage with me on this important issue.


Yours sincerely


Barnaby Joyce MP


I think that gives a degree of comfort and support to the industry to give them time to adjust to a tonnage charge. The process means that, in effect, there will not be a tonnage charge in place until at least 1 April next year, given that the process will take nine to 12 months. I am very grateful to the minister's office and to the department's advisers who put up with me last week in a number of meetings that we had in respect of that issue, but I think it was a good and fair result.


My concern about recovery fees is maintained. My concern is that cost recovery is spread unevenly across the sector. A proportion of experts are currently carrying the burden for everyone, which is patently unfair. I note the department is planning to review the ways fees are charged, and I hope they will be more considerate and flexible when it comes to applying these charges, and also to take heed of the issues raised by Senator Back in terms of what appear to be less than transparent charges that have been in place for a number of years.


It is also not fair for small exporters to pay the same as large exporters, or for forestry products to be charged per tonne in the same way grain is, when these products have very different tonnage values. I have spoken in this place before about Mick and Tanya Punteriero, who are niche lime growers in the Riverland—people from your neck of woods, Madam Acting Deputy President Ruston, in the wonderful Riverland of South Australia. I know that you have done a lot of work with them to assist them. Mick and Tanya export a small number of pallets of their limes to New Zealand each year. The application of cost recovery, however, meant that they were charged the same amount as a large packing house exporting thousands of tonnes. It was a fixed charge that was unreasonable—around $8½ thousand.


I understand that a number of matters have flowed on from that through your work as well, Madam Acting Deputy President, which has been of some assistance to growers such as the Ponterieros. But, while there are some rebates for smaller producers, there was no guarantee how long these would last. A fee structure that does not recognise the size of a business or what they are exporting is not just unfair but also a disincentive to export. If you want to encourage those small exporters to become medium to big exporters in the future, encourage them now; do not hit them with punitive fees that are simply too uneconomic for them to be involved in the export market. It means that smaller shipments like those into new or niche markets just are not available and, without innovation, our industries will stall.


I will be supporting this legislation with some reluctance and, while I acknowledge the work of the minister and the department in addressing some of these issues, I am still philosophically and practically opposed to the way cost recovery is applied at the moment. I hope that when the budget issues have been addressed the government will reconsider the use of cost recovery in the agricultural sector to the extent it is now being used and also to kick-start incentives for the small exporters which will become the big exporters and the bigger employers in the future.


In the meantime, I hope the fee reviews will be thorough and will take into account concerns raised by the industry and the concerns raised very ably by Senator Back. If cost recovery is going to exist, it should at least be equitable and fairly applied. I believe these measures agreed to by the minister will go some way towards achieving this and for the forestry products industry I believe that the undertakings, the letter from Minister Joyce today, will give them some comfort and ability to plan for their sector.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (10:35):  I thank senators for their contributions this morning. I particularly recognise the interest shown in this issue by Senator Back, by Senator Xenophon and by you, Acting Deputy President Ruston. The government recognises that export fees and charges are an issue of concern for the agricultural export community. I know that a number of senators have been spending a lot of time working on this issue going back to 2008-09, when changes in the cost recovery process and the 40 per cent rebate on cost recovery was removed by the previous government.


As intimated by Senator Xenophon, there are $15 million in this year's budget to assist small producers over four years in export sectors where there are specific export certification charges. The government has also announced that it is doing a full review of export fees and charges. That is a very important piece of work, to consider the way these fees are applied. Senator Back was correct when he said we are part of a competitive export supply chain and that the costs of government go to the cost of participating in the export sector. We need to ensure we are competitive as part of that process as well, no different from any other private supplier in the market. That is a principle we need to consider as part of the export fees and charges review process.


I commend the bills to the Senate.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


Questions today dealt with three of the Attorney-General's most recent blunders. There was Senator Brandis's notorious foray into foreign policy, where he suddenly invented new government policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict—which has jeopardised Australia's interests in this strategically sensitive region of the Middle East. There was also his rush to judgement on the impact of the High Court decision in the Williams No. 2 case, where there was no need for the Solicitor-General to provide advice—because Senator Brandis QC was on the case, delivering his verdict on the judgement before the ink was dry. Finally, there was his greatest triumph of all, where this cabinet minister has succeeded in uniting Australians across the political divide, uniting Australians from all religious, ethnic, political and social backgrounds against his plans to remove legal protection against speech that offends, insults or humiliates on the basis of race. 


In fact, this Attorney-General has a rare distinction. He is one of the few cabinet ministers who has single-handedly created an enormous grassroots movement against him and his own government. It is quite a political feat. Those on the other side must constantly be asking rhetorically, 'I wonder who it is that George has offended this week?' 


Senator Brandis's responses to these questions today were—in part—what we have come to expect. What we generally expect from Senator Brandis is smug and self-important rhetoric and deliberate obfuscation—and we know we always get pomposity. We know that George is always pompous. But interestingly, and I will come back to this, we also saw a new side of George—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, you should refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator WONG:
  I apologise, Mr Deputy President. 



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator WONG:
  We saw a new side of Senator Brandis, who has  magically discovered the benefits of reticence. He is all of a sudden—a man who generally you cannot shut up—talking very little. One can surmise why that is. You need only look at some of the commentary about what Minister Bishop has had to promise and implement with respect to Senator Brandis's injudicious comments in Senate estimates.


On the ABC website this morning I was interested to read some character assessments of Senator Brandis from his own colleagues. They covered a range of areas, including: 'I think Senator Brandis would not know a live animal if he fell over one,' and various other things. One can surmise where that came from. But the most interesting character description was one of his own Liberal colleagues describing him to the ABC this morning as 'intellectually arrogant'. I do not fully agree with that character assessment. 'Arrogant'—true; that goes without saying. But 'intellectual'? I do not really think so. Senator Brandis might have installed a $15,000 taxpayer funded wall-to-ceiling bookcase in his office—complete with stepladder—not once but twice, but that does not make him an intellectual. He is meant to be the first law officer of the land, not an assistant law librarian. 


Would a true intellectual defend the Racial Discrimination Act amendments that he was putting forward by arguing:


People do have a right to be bigots, you know. 


Is that the response of a true intellectual? Would a true intellectual take his riding orders on the Racial Discrimination Act from a single newspaper columnist and ignore every community organisation in the land? Would a true intellectual rush so ignorantly into foreign policy by claiming that no Australian government has ever accepted the term 'occupied' in relation to Palestinian territories? Senator Brandis's last blunder has triggered a rolling foreign policy fiasco for the government and has damaged Australia's interests. This is not the act of an intellectual. It is the act of someone who is reckless and arrogant. 


Senator Brandis is meant to be the first law officer of the land, not a freelance foreign minister. So it is no wonder that the actual Minister for Foreign Affairs has instructed the Attorney-General to stick to his day job. The position of Attorney-General is an important one in our system of government. It is a position which requires integrity, intelligence and sound judgement. It is not a position for someone who acts like he is in student politics. It is not a position for someone who has been described as a bull who brings his own china shop. It is certainly not a position for someone who displays the arrogance and poor judgement— (Time expired)

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Second Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:07):  Don't you have to feel sorry for them? As I sat here in question time I was reminded of a mob of bleating poddy calves. I was reminded of a yard full of orphaned lambs, as they struggled and bleated and carried on. It is amazing that, with references to animals, only now did Senator Wong talk about bulls. Senator Cameron and Senator Wong led this parade of 'what about the budget', as we asked intelligent questions and got intelligent answers.


Today, six opposition senators got an opportunity to ask a question. You would have thought they might have asked one on the budget. Did any of the six do that? Only in the final supplementary question from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, did they manage to get in a little bit of a question about the four-pillars policy, to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. We had Senator Dastyari and Senator Tillem going on about FoFA and Senator Sing asking the Attorney-General about Williams and chaplaincy. We had Senator Wong about the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. We had Senator Furner, and through you, Deputy President, I have to say, Senator Furner, you are a man I admire but I do not really admire the way your voice inflection attempted to make a fool of a colleague. I mean that in all seriousness, because you are a person I value highly. But you got well away from it, too, on 18C. We then had Senator Tillem having a crack at FoFA. And because time allowed we then had Senator Wong.


So here we are in question time, and with the budget out there the Labor Party would love to be out there saying Australians hate the budget, they hate the higher education elements, they do not like the health elements and they do not like the other aspects of education and they do not seem to like the seniors policy. Where were the questions, Senator Wong, Senator Furner and Senator Cameron? Even Senator Conroy managed to get in on the animal analogy when he leapt up and the funniest thing he could say was that Senator Fifield was attempting to get rid of Peppa Pig, a program that we know costs the Australian taxpayer a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year, through the ABC.


Let me stay with the animal analogy for a few minutes, because Senator Wong was critising the Attorney-General on what she was saying was an attack on Australia's agriculture, particularly Australia's exports of live animals. I would have thought that if there was one topic the Labor Party wanted to stay away from in this place it might be exports of live animals, when we reflect on the events of 8 June 2011, when they simply cut Indonesia off at its knees, and when they denied 69 million low-socioeconomic villagers in Indonesia the opportunity to get animal protein. Forget for a moment what they did to Australian producers and all those who support them.


I tell you that the full story of the conspiracies that went on has not yet been told in this place. I hasten to say that I do not believe that the Prime Minister at the time, Ms Gillard, nor the agriculture minister at the time were part of a conspiracy, but there was one, and they played into the hands of those conspirators. I am referring to the very countries in the Middle East that Senator Wong referred to in relation to Senator Brandis's apparent comments—countries that have long supported our exporters of both live animals and meat. Were they upset by some of those words? I remind the chamber of the answers given by Senator Brandis to the questions asked in Senate estimates. His statement was entirely consistent with that of the foreign minister.


But I am fairly close to the industry, as you know. Was there some concern? Yes. Was it addressed? Yes. Do we still have the confidence of those markets? Yes, we do. It was the actions of the then Labor government that caused all of the problems we see in the Middle East now—the fact that we do not have trade with Saudi Arabia, the fact that we can only now re-open trade to Egypt, and the fact that we have only just announced the re-opening of trade to Iran. Let us be very sure about who put all of that trade at risk. It was not the coalition or Senator Brandis. (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:12):  As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, my colleague Senator Wong, outlined, it has not been a good nine months for the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. The three blunders that have been highlighted today through questioning by the opposition make that very clear. It has not been a good time at all. Yet this reckless, arrogant attempt by Senator Brandis to meddle in other ministers' portfolios, and to meddle in his own portfolio and not have any success, continues to go from bad to worse. He would try to make the public and us believe that everything is fine, that the remarks he has made are supported. We know clearly that they are not supported, and now he is finding himself in the position of having to backtrack on almost every single blunder he has made, whether it be in relation to trying to repeal or change, or whatever it is he is trying to do, sections 18C and 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act, or whether it be in relation to his comments regarding the Williams No. 2 case, where he regarded it as erroneous and ignorant to suggest that case had implications for Commonwealth programs other than the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program, or whether it be his meddling now in Minister Julie Bishop's portfolio in relation to his comments regarding East Jerusalem.


Just last week we saw the head of the Palestinian delegation to Australia, Mr Izzat Abdulhadi, who relayed to the ABC that the meeting they had with Minister Bishop did not resolve the confusion. That is why the question was put to Senator Brandis again today. It was to give him yet another opportunity to explain what he was on about during Senate estimates when he made his remarks. On one hand we have Minister Bishop making it very clear that the government's position has not changed, that the government supports UN Security Council Resolution 242 and various other UN resolutions. But then all of those resolutions, as we know, do use the term 'occupied'. So is Senator Brandis out of step with Minister Bishop? What is going on in the government when it comes to this? What clearly seems to be going on is that those in the executive are having to gag Senator Brandis for his remarks. Indeed, he has made quite a blunder that now has affected our trade relations with the Arab nations.


And it seems that Senator Brandis is losing more and more support by the day when it comes to other areas within his own portfolio. I refer, of course, to the Racial Discrimination Act. The question clearly put by Senator Furner was about Project 18C and the rise of local government. Local government, of course, is the level of government that is at the grassroots, the coalface, of the community. It has seen the outpouring of condemnation for the changes that Senator Brandis wants to put forward—or is proposing or whatever it may be. Local governments do not want the change. A number of these local government councils are in Liberal-held electorates. When will this government listen to the people? When will it start to recognise that there is no support for Senator Brandis's changes? I mean, some of Senator Brandis's own backbench are willing to cross the floor on the proposed changes that he has out there for comment. And there are some 5,500 submissions. Is he just going to ignore them? We know he will not release them, because he does not want us to be made aware of the outcry of condemnation for the changes that he is proposing to put in place. He is a libertarian, he believes in free speech, but he will not release those submissions. We have not had any legislation brought forward, clearly because Senator Brandis does not have the support of the executive and the backbench. It has been nearly six months now, and still there is no legislation. It shows clearly that Senator Brandis is out of touch not only with the Australian community but with his own Liberal Party.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Government Whip) (15:17):  What we have seen today is a dreadful deterioration and disintegration of what the Senate is all about. Those on the opposite side are playing the man. When they were in government and we were strongly prosecuting the case against the shambolic policies that they were introducing—their policies on the run—we were accused of playing the man or, in the case of former Prime Minister Gillard, playing the woman. And how they cried! They cried foul because they were suggesting that we were playing the woman, when in actual fact we were playing the policy. We were against the policy of the day that they were creating and dreaming up overnight on the run. I have to say what an absolute hypocrite the leader on the other side of this chamber was to come in here today and play the man. I think it is a disgrace and damning of—




Senator Furner:
  Mr President, on a point of order: we know full well that the use of that language towards a person in this chamber is unallowable and should be withdrawn.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Kroger, it would assist if you did withdraw.




Senator KROGER:
  Mr Deputy President, I take the advice. But I do find it absolutely disgraceful. During estimates and over the last few months, the Prime Minister has been engaging at the very highest levels of office in a number of countries. And what did we see during that time? In my six years here in the Senate, I have never witnessed any behaviour like it. When the Prime Minister of Australia was visiting and engaging with presidents and prime ministers of different countries, we saw disgraceful criticism of him in order to diminish his credibility and his integrity. Whether it be former Foreign Minister Carr or former Prime Ministers Gillard or Rudd, at no stage did the coalition ever seek to criticise their engagement when they were in those countries. What we have seen during the last few months is extraordinary criticism of Prime Minister Abbott—notwithstanding the terrific way in which he represented our country. We saw absolutely appalling criticism. For instance, when he was meeting with the President of China and leading a very high-powered delegation to increase trade and understanding and agreements between our two countries, those on the opposite side were trying to bring down his effectiveness. It was the first time I have seen that, and I thought it was a disgrace.


If I can come back to question time today: I think it is a sad state of affairs when we have the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate getting up and playing the man. Senator Brandis is a man of superior intellectual capacity. He is a senior counsel from Queensland. He has an extraordinary intellect which we see presented here every day of the week when we are sitting. And yet here they are, trying to diminish the standing of the Attorney-General by coming in here today and saying what they have said. It reflects really poorly on the opposition. It is not inconsistent with what they were like in government, so we should not be surprised, but it is a very poor reflection on them. Those who are listening today and who were listening in question time will be able to determine that for themselves. (Time expired)

Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:22):  I also rise to take note of the answers provided by the Attorney-General today in question time. On the subject of listening, one merely needs to go out there and listen to the ethnic communities that certainly our side of politics represents and believes in. The Attorney-General claims that he is aware of a variety of views in the community about this exposure draft for the repeal of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which currently makes it illegal publicly 'to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people'. It would be advantageous for the Attorney-General and those opposite to go and listen to a variety of views in the community on this subject. 


I and a number of senators on this side of the chamber have been involved in that. Senator Dastyari has been involved in protests in Sydney by people in the ethnic communities, the multicultural communities—that we represent and know quite well­—who are outraged. Just last Friday, I was extremely privileged to be with my Senate colleague and good friend Senator Peris up in Brisbane, on the north-western side, conducting a forum, as some senators on this side have done. In that forum, we replayed that part of question time that Senator Brandis is now infamous for, where he claimed that people have a right to be bigots. The people in the audience at that forum who had not seen that particular part of question time were horrified to see someone in one of the highest positions in this country claim that people have a right to be bigots in this country.


Does the government really want to bring back cases like the Cronulla riots of 2005? Do they really want to bring back a group of people like those we saw around the election and the installation of Pauline Hanson, when xenophobia was overflowing in this country and people attacked other people for being of different origin, for having different coloured skin, for speaking a different language? Certainly we on this side do not want to see that. I am yet to hear from those in government whether that is the case with them or what the agenda is behind these changes to 18C of the RDA.


You need only listen to the people in these communities. The Chinese, Arabic, Indigenous, Greek and Jewish communities have been urging the government to abandon the proposal. In fact, the peak lobby group, the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia, has warned the government that these changes would leave Australia with no protection against racial vilification. Closer to home, I would suggest that I have one of the most multicultural offices in parliament. I employ a woman from a Filipino background. She is Australian-born but she goes out in public and she is vilified and harassed with comments that are absolutely disgraceful, referring to her ethnicity and her mother's origin. I employ also an African woman. I am certain that she as well has had circumstances in the past where she has been vilified in public. I also employ a Muslim Lebanese gentleman as a staffer, and I know for a fact that he has been crucified at times merely for his religion.


The ethnic communities out there are supporting our opposition to this amendment. We on this side believe that, if the repeal of 18C is successful, we will see more and more attacks in our communities by people that have no right to make those sorts of comments, who should not be in these communities and should not have a standing where they can go around making comments about people who are all Australians, people who have come to this country with a view to making it a better place. If we allow this amendment to go through, we will be in dire straits. In summing up, I repeat a reflection by William Maley:


And perhaps it is time for Prime Minister Abbott to think about whether in his own interest he might be able to find another Attorney-General, with smaller bookcases but more common sense.


That is a matter to reflect on. (Time expired)

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (16:10):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


""The actions of the Abbott Government in undermining consumer protections by weakening the Future of Financial Advice (FoFA) Laws.""


Last Friday, the Minister for Finance and still acting Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias Cormann, took initial steps to remove important consumer protections from Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms. Make no mistake, if the minister is successful in pushing through these changes, the Abbott government must take full and unambiguous responsibility for the scandals that will inevitably result. Labor in this place will vote down the proposed changes in their current form and use whatever Senate tools, be they disallowance motions or other, available to ensure that these important protections are not watered down. Labor will use whatever power it has to ensure that consumers are protected against a handful of criminals operating in the financial services industry who have given the many good financial planners out there a bad name.


When the Hon. Bernie Ripoll, now Labor's financial services spokesman, drafted the FoFA legislation in the wake of a series of horrific and costly collapses, it was after an exhaustive period of detailed public consultation. Throughout 2009, everyone from indebted victims, financial experts through to the big banks were given the opportunity to participate in developing these laws. But, last week, we had the co-author of the 'budget of broken promises', Senator Mathias Cormann, supported by a Liberal Party-dominated Senate committee, push for a repeal of this legislation.


I have spent much of the short time that I have been in this place listening to people who have been ripped off, often by fraud, deception and collusion, and left penniless by a financial advice industry that previously had no firm legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. I have sat on the Senate inquiry into the performance of ASIC and heard the horrific stories of fraud, abuse and utter dereliction of a basic fiduciary duty by players across the financial services industry—all the way from the boiler rooms to the nation's biggest, and supposedly respected, banks. Thousands of families were left out-of-pocket by the collapse of Storm Financial. The names Timbercorp, Opes Prime, Fincorp—




Senator Williams:
  Great Southern.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Great Southern, Trio and Commonwealth Financial Planning are synonymous with the abuse of trust that happened under the flimsy legal framework that existed before FoFA. All of these scandals have resulted in losses of almost $6 billion and have cost over 100,000 clients—many of them mum and dad investors—their savings, their homes and, in many cases, saddled them with debts that continue to grow. In the case of Timbercorp, the victims have been left paying double-digit interest rates on loans which, unfortunately, they had no idea they had taken out. 


Before FoFA, for the financial advice industry the living was easy! It was easy to make a living ripping off the little guys. Unfortunately, a minority of financial planners used that opportunity to rip off thousands of hardworking, decent Australians. But the introduction of FoFA created a clear and long-overdue legal barrier to end dodgy schemes being pushed, with sales commissions or remuneration structures that ignored the best interests of the client. It is the slipperiest of slopes when the incentives are stacked in favour of selling a product rather than providing impartial advice in a client's best interest.


It is not just the sharks who are guilty of this; the big banks would prefer FoFA were changed to allow them to quietly whittle away at their clients' savings, with fees from those little extras that bank tellers were once able to pitch over the counter. Those tiny amounts add up quickly. The big banks' profits in this country totalled $29 billion last year—a lot of money that is no longer in the bank accounts of ordinary Australians. This is the secondary effect of commission based advice: in addition to taking money from clients, it is also money that does not go into the national savings pool. The current FoFA laws have been estimated to add $144 billion to our aggregate savings by 2027. This massive national windfall will be directly jeopardised by the repeals proposed.


 Bernie Ripoll's FoFA reforms provided a strong legal framework to distinguish advice from sales. Our financial advice industry will not gain the trust of ordinary Australians until it makes a firm commitment to planning and tailoring advice, and explaining the possible risks to each client, whether they are saving for their first car, paying off a second mortgage or refinancing to grow a business. Of course, those who stand to gain financially from the old system want to go back to clipping the ticket, without the hassle of basic consumer protections. But their incentives should not dictate how our laws function. This is already bad policy and, with the government's proposed reforms, we now await some fascinating politics.


The minister, Senator Cormann, is an interesting character. While he favours some of the government's more extreme policies, he is also one of the government's shrewdest political operators. He knows that they are bleeding viciously after budget. Will he follow his ideological instincts and belligerently plunder the consumer protections in FoFA to appease a handful of sectional interests, who would love nothing more than to be taking fees and commissions once again? Or, as this debate progresses, will Minister Cormann be smart enough to back off?


 It took Prime Minister Howard nearly 10 years before he over-reached and destroyed his own government. Will Minister Cormann, Treasurer Hockey and Prime Minister Abbott smash this record, by both plodding forward with a deeply unpopular budget and pushing changes to FoFA that will hurt ordinary Australians and present a clear and present danger of the kinds of collapses that triggered the changes in the first place? These reforms were put forward for a reason, and that reason was to protect consumers. They do not need to be watered down. This is not simply a matter of removing little bit of red tape. This is a wish list from the industry, who want nothing more than to go to the good old days, when they could set their own fees.


Today I met with Naomi Halpern, a victim of the Timbercorp collapse and a spokesperson for the Holt Norman Ashman Baker Action Group—a group of people who unfortunately were the victims of dodgy, crude and incorrect financial advice that they were wrongly provided.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  And financial products.




Senator DASTYARI:
  And financial products. Ms Halpern is intelligent, articulate and incredibly well informed, but she was taken for a ride by a crook—a crook who continues to play golf around Melbourne, who continues to drive a sports car, who continues to live in a mansion—who has got away relatively scot-free, considering the pain and anguish that has been caused. We need to make sure that we have the toughest, strongest, highest set of standards, so there are no more victims like Ms Halpern in the future. What worries me so much about these proposals is that the exact events that occurred and resulted in people like Ms Halpern being ripped off are the same things that will once again be possible if the minister's reforms are adopted.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:20):  I start by saying that there has never been any issue whatsoever—and I look in the direction of Senator Whish-Wilson—about the tripartisan support that exists in this place for addressing the matter of financial advisers who seek to rip off their clients or to sign them up to dodgy products which are not in their interests and which really serve no purpose other than to line the pockets of those giving the advice. That is why, when we were in opposition, we actively participated in the Ripoll inquiry, which was referred to by the previous speaker. That inquiry came up with a unanimous suite of recommendations to address the issues that arose from issues like Westpoint, Storm, Trio and even Timbercorp. That suite of recommendations was unanimously adopted by the committee after looking at these issues, reflecting the tripartisan support of all parties involved to try to address these issues.


But FoFA went further. The legislation that the government put forward following the Ripoll inquiry went further than the inquiry's recommendations. We are seeking to make changes to the FoFA legislation to better reflect the unanimous recommendations of the Ripoll inquiry. In that sense, when Senator Dastyari talks about the Bernie Ripoll FoFA reforms he confuses me somewhat. I am not sure whether he is talking about the FoFA reforms or the Ripoll inquiry, because they are not one and the same. 


Before the election it was clear that if elected we were going to make these changes. In government we are now seeking to put in place the changes that we took to the election, which were based on our dissenting report in the inquiry to the FoFA reforms. The opposition now seeks to scaremonger. They seek to beat up the idea that we are removing the best-interests requirement that is contained in the legislation and that we are removing all the reforms that were put in place to increase consumer protection in the previous government's FoFA legislation. This is absolutely not the case.


Facts are important when we are looking at this issue, so let us look at a couple. Interestingly, I note today that Alan Kohler, who has been a bit of a critic of what the government is trying to do on FoFA, has put out an article headed, 'Why Cormann is now right on financial advice'. In that article he notes:


The other parts of the government’s amendments will make very little difference now that Mathias Cormann has 'clarified' his undying commitment to banning commissions and making advisers act in the best interests of their clients. Having clarified that, the Minister and his drafters must now focus on de-complicating financial advice, and genuinely making it cheaper for people to get a single piece of advice.


That, in itself, is one of the reasons that we are doing this. We want to make sure that financial advice is both accessible and affordable to Australians. I think the chair of ASIC at one of the earlier hearings that the Senate committee conducted into ASIC's performance made the comment that only about one in five Australians over their lifetime receives the benefit of financial advice. He thinks that that should be one in two Australians, but you are not going to see one in two if you make financial advice more expensive. We need to work out what can be done to ensure that financial advice is both of a high quality and accessible to ordinary Australians. Financial advice is no good if you make it so expensive that only those who have buckets of money in the first place are able to afford the benefits of advice on how to invest. You need to broaden the accessibility and ensure that advice is affordable to all Australians. When it comes down to it, it is often people who do not have a lot of money who really need the advice more than anybody else.


Interestingly, a few weeks ago ABC Fact Check, which is not well known for drawing conclusions in the government's favour, conducted a fact check on Chris Bowen's comments about financial advice, which are summed up in Senator Dastyari's closing comments on the motion. Fact Check looked at the commentary that the financial planning and advice industry is about to return to the bad old days when retirees lost their life savings in dodgy investments that paid big commissions to their advisers. They asked whether that is really the case and after looking into the issue in some detail they conclude:




Mr Bowen is scaremongering. The proposed changes to the conflicted remuneration provisions do not bring back the type of commissions that financial advisers could receive before FOFA was introduced.



It is important to remember that that fact check was undertaken prior to the changes that Minister Cormann announced last Friday, which make that conclusion even clearer. 


Let us look at the reality of what we are doing. The underlying objective of FoFA, as I said before, was to improve the quality of financial advice whilst building trust and confidence in the financial advice industry. Whilst the government agrees with the policy intent of FoFA, from the government's perspective it is quite clear that the legislation in parts went too far and impacted the balance between consumer protection and accessibility and affordability of advice. The objectives of the government's improvements to FoFA are to unwind the regulatory overreach created by the current FoFA legislation, which, in the government's and others' opinion, went beyond the original recommendations of the 2009 parliamentary joint committee inquiry; to reduce regulatory costs, thereby placing downward pressure on the cost of financial advice to consumers; and to provide certainty to the financial services industry by clarifying the operation of FoFA.


It is really important to clarify, because this is where scaremongering comes into the debate, that the key consumer protections and the objectives that were placed into FoFA when Labor first introduced it will remain. I emphasise that the key consumer protection objectives will remain in FoFA and I will go through them. Advice will continue to be in the best interests of the client. This is contained in section 961B(1) of the act and it is not changed at all. That makes it absolutely clear that the advisers must act in the best interests of their client. In addition, the advice must be appropriate to the client. That is contained in section 961G and also does not change under our proposed amendments. An adviser must provide a warning if there is any incomplete or inaccurate information. That is contained in section 961H and does not change under our amendments. An adviser must prioritise their clients' interests ahead of their own, which is contained in 961J. 


Interestingly, at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry, senior legal advisers gave evidence that the primary obligation contained in the legislation, and of a much higher standard than the best-interests requirement, was that the financial advisers must prioritise their clients' interests ahead of their own. Legal advisers thought that was a much higher standard than the best interests. I think it is. If you have to put your own interest behind those of your client when you are providing advice then it is quite clear who comes out of that in front.


Further, conflicted remuneration structures, including commissions, that have the ability to influence advice are banned. That is important: financial advisers are banned from accepting remuneration that might influence the advice that they give. That will remain under the changes that we are making. Consumers will also continue to have access to high-quality financial advice, which is clearly one of the objectives of FoFA.


I have mentioned the Senate committee report. The Senate Economics Legislation Committee was asked to look into this and on 16 June 2014 the committee released its report. Overall, the committee found that the proposed amendments achieve a proper balance between providing adequate consumer protection and sound, professional and affordable financial advice. The committee recommended that the bill be passed after the government give consideration to two recommendations: firstly, that the explanatory memorandum include a paragraph to clarify the best-interest obligations and the level of consumer protection that they provide and whether any further strengthening is required to ensure that these obligations cannot be circumvented. Secondly, the government should consider redrafting the conflicted remuneration provisions to ensure greater clarity. 


The government has since agreed with these recommendations and has responded by introducing parliamentary amendments and making changes to the explanatory memorandum to address the committee's concerns as expressed in their recommendations. Other findings of the committee included: that the best-interest duty remains robust and comprehensive; that clients receive scaled advice without diminishing their protections; that conflicted remuneration provisions redressed the problem of legislative overreach created by the original FoFA legislation, which essentially banned activities and remuneration structures that could not possibly influence the advice that was being provided to their clients and as such caught up in the net things that were never intended to be caught by FoFA. The committee also found that the amendments were not intended to bring back commissions in any form, which—contrary to some people's opinions or conclusions—was always the intention. Clearly, the wording, in the view of the committee, needed some tightening up to make that clear, even though the intention was that commissions were always intended to be banned in any form, whether upfront or trailing. Looking at general advice and conflicted remuneration, which is one of the hot spots here, the government made an election commitment to amend the law to enable incentive payments which do not conflict advice— (Time expired)

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:30):  Having worked in the financial services industry and having been part of this inquiry, I say that it is a very complex area. I see the FoFA laws that were implemented as trying to simplify a very complex area, although some say they had overreach or overkill. During the inquiry we were told that if financial planners, for example, were to exhaust the list of things they needed to do to act in their client's best interests, that list could potentially be 30 or 35 checklists long. That is why the catch-all provision was put in, as it has been for other professional industries: to make sure that everything had been exhausted. But it was not to go into the legislation because that would have been very complex. When it comes to scaled advice, even the experts disagree as to where it kicks in and where it does not. We still have problems with defining 'personal advice' and 'general advice'. All these complexities are the reason we needed a simple set of laws that achieved a balance in protecting consumers in this country.


Senator Bushby said the impact went too far and it tipped the balance. It was designed to increase confidence in the financial planning and financial services industry. It was designed to get more people to go to financial planners, and that is a good thing. I met a lot of really good financial planners during this inquiry, and I must say that a lot of the smaller financial planners who charge a fee for service do a great job and that they have amazing relationships with their clients. That is not the issue for the Greens. The issue is the large vertically integrated financial services companies that we know have a conflict of interest inherent in their business models. The Australian Bankers' Association said on the record during the inquiry that they wanted these FoFA laws changed before 1 July so that they did not have to put in place costly compliance mechanisms in their back offices. To me, the real issue here is the opportunity costs of their lost income; the big financial services companies make so much money out of cross-selling products to their client bases. It is that lost income that is the elephant in the FoFA room. Why have the Bankers' Association and the financial services associations, representing the big end of town, lobbied so hard for these changes before some of them are even implemented?


I think the Greens have taken an eminently sensible approach to this inquiry by saying that, in areas such as opt-in clauses or best-interest duty or scaled advice, we should give it some time to see whether there is an increased cost for provision of financial advice—whether there are problems with increased insurance premiums, et cetera. We have not had time to see this through yet; all we have is speculation. Choice, Seniors Australia, with 200,000 members, and Certified Practising Accountants, one of the biggest lobby groups in financial services, did not want to see these laws weakened. These are very important stakeholders in this country who want to give these laws a fair go—it is not just the Greens or Labor.


Only now are we seeing the wash up of the GFC—whether it was the collapse of Storm Financial or whether it was the CBA in the media or whether it was Timbercorp, as we have seen this week—our toxic debt from the GFC is now washing through the economy. This is not the time to be weakening financial advice laws. We need to keep them strong and we need to send a very clear message to not only a few bad apples but also the big end of town that it is a cultural issue that we have to tackle through strong regulation.

 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:34):  I will start my contribution with a quote:


Each one of these is what I feel: persistent feelings of sadness, feelings of failure, feeling overwhelmed, loss of interest, withdrawal from family and friends, frequent anger, lack of confidence, poor concentration, tiredness, sleeping problems, feeling sick and changes in appetite. 


All those is what I’ve been feeling in the last few months since we’ve been sold out of the market and just realising that it’s an impossibility to restore.


This quote comes from Storm Financial investor Phil Green when he was interviewed by the ABC. The interview formed part of a 2009 episode of the Four Corners program, entitled 'The Perfect Storm'. Phil Green told Four Corners that he earned $50,000 a year while trying to pay off a $1.8 million debt. Business commentator Robert Gottliebsen was also interviewed for the Four Corners program and told reporter Paul Barry that Australians had lost billions of dollars in margin-lending schemes. Like Westpoint and Timbercorp, Storm is an investment scheme that collapsed, destroying the lives of ordinary Australians who invested their life savings expecting their investments to be safe.


These tragedies occur because Australians receive bad financial advice. They receive bad advice because that advice is conflicted by commissions and vested interests. The only way to protect Australian investors from this exploitation is to make sure that they receive advice with one beneficiary in mind—and that is the investor. That was the principle which underlined Labor's Future of Financial Advice legislation, and that is the principle which is being fundamentally undermined by the Abbott government's attempt to dismantle our reforms. Rice Warner actuaries' modelling predicted that by 2027 the reforms would boost private savings by $144 billion, double the provision of financial advice and almost halve the average cost of advice. You see, Mr Acting Deputy President, what small investors need is genuine financial advice given by financial advisors, not a sales pitch given by marketers. They need advice which is in their interests, not in the interests of the people selling the product.



Submissions to the government's exposure draft of the bill and to the Senate economics committee inquiry into the bill reveal the breadth and depth of community opposition to the changes the government has proposed. The consumer advocacy group CHOICE, which is highly regarded, noted in its submission to the Senate inquiry that:


FoFA was a compromise between the interests of consumer protection and industry, and the proposed Bill tilts the balance further away from consumers.


In evidence given to the Senate inquiry, CHOICE described 'the best-interest obligation, the changes to rules about conflicted remuneration, the removal of the requirement that clients opt in to fees and the removal of the requirement for annual fee disclosure statements' as 'pretty basic consumer protections and, indeed, signs of basic good practice in business that any financial adviser should be happy to sign up to.' National Seniors Australia, an organisation which represents people over the age of 50 and has over 200,000 members, said in their exposure draft submission that the government's legislation would 'remove essential consumer protection measures and expose older Australians to greater risk and uncertainty'. The Council on the Ageing, another group representing seniors, told the Senate inquiry:


We believe the cumulative effect of these changes is to seriously weaken the reforms, giving less consumer protections and ultimately undermining confidence in the financial advice sector.


The criticisms from various professional, consumer and other community groups were nicely summed up in an opinion piece by experienced financial journalist, Alan Kohler, in which he wrote:


Under the cover of streamlining the laws and removing red tape to lower cost, the government is proposing eight changes to the law that will allow banks to once again use licensed financial advisers to sell investment products while pretending to provide independent advice.


In the detail of many submissions not only on the exposure draft but also to the Senate inquiry are criticisms of the government's proposal to weaken the best interest test; criticisms of the government's proposal to scrap the opt-in provisions; and criticisms of the government's changes to the annual disclosure and conflicted remuneration provisions. All these provisions were put in place by Labor as part of the FoFA reforms for one major reason—that is, to protect consumers.


Scrapping opt-in provisions means that most people will pay fees for services they do not get—some will pay fees without even knowing. The government's changes to the best interest obligation would effectively weaken that obligation to a tick-box approach. In fact, the government's changes will weaken this provision to such a degree that they may as well scrap it entirely. As for the changes to conflicted remuneration, various stakeholder groups including financial planning industry associations have raised concerns about the potential for this to lead to unethical practices. In its evidence to the Senate inquiry, Industry Super Australia pointed to research which estimated the cost to consumers of this change alone would be more than half a billion dollars a year. This is almost three times the estimated savings to business. Mark Rantell, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Planning Association of Australia, said in his evidence to the Senate inquiry that there were several risks in allowing commissions for general advice. In particular, he mentioned: the difficulty for consumers in distinguishing personal financial advice from marketing; the potential to shift licensees and representatives away from the provisions of personal advice in order to earn commissions; and the erosion of public confidence in Australia's financial system. With the government's legislation removing so many basic consumer protections, is it any surprise that there is such widespread opposition to these laws?


The Abbott government's attempt to dismantle FoFA has very few remaining supporters. As with anything else this government does, if you want to see who they represent, it is instructive to see who supports their actions. The few remaining supporters of this legislation are the big banks, AMP and the Financial Services Council. The FSC is essentially a proxy for the big banks, given that it is controlled by them. It is run by former New South Wales Liberal leader, John Brogden, and its political donations—at least those reported up to 30 June last year—have heavily favoured the Liberal Party. The acting finance minister, Senator Cormann, received $10,000 from the FSC in August 2012, and the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, received $11,000 through his—I might call it somewhat shady—fundraising vehicle, the North Sydney Forum.


Is it any surprise that this government would push a reform that is overwhelmingly opposed by groups representing seniors and consumers, while being supported by a small group of powerful vested interests? It is just one more of the many examples of how this government represents the big end of town; just like they represent the big end of town with their budget of cruel cuts and broken promises. This is the government which would tax ordinary Australians when they get sick, when they need medicine and when they need to go to the doctor—while giving a tax cut to billionaire mining magnates. This is the government which would cut payments to struggling families, and cut vital childcare assistance—while giving up to $50,000 to millionaire mums who have children. This is the government which would increase taxes on petrol—while cutting funding for public transport concessions. And this is the government which has the audacity, and the cruelty, to deny young jobseekers an income for up to six months—while increasing university fees and cutting money from education.


We know that this is a dishonest government; an unreliable government. We know that this is a government that lied before the election, and that delivered a budget full of broken promises. But there is one thing in which this government will always be consistent; there is a pattern of behaviour that this government can always be relied upon to adopt—and that is, given a choice between standing up for the least powerful or the most powerful in our society, they will always side with the powerful vested interests. They will do so even when it is at the expense of ordinary Australians.


These laws are not about removing red tape; they are about dismantling Labor's reforms and leaving consumers at the mercy of shonky and unethical financial advisers—dismantling the very laws that Labor designed to protect consumers from disasters such as the Storm Financial collapse. They are essentially the same laws that were proposed by their original author—do you know who that was, Mr Acting Deputy President?—Senator Sinodinos. And I would suggest that, just as Senator Sinodinos might have been sent to the back blocks for quite a while, so should the Prime Minister also send this reform to the back blocks for just as long.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-06-23,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (16:44):  Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, might I say how good you look in the chair's position there, and I hope that in the short future you are nominated for Deputy President; I think you would make a fine Deputy President.


I take offence to Senator Bilyk saying that those on this side just look after the big end of town. I started this job at the same time as Senator Bilyk and Senator Cameron, on 1 July 2008. In January 2009 I went to Redcliffe to meet with the Storm Financial victims. I was the first politician to meet with them, and I guaranteed them that I would do my best to get a Senate inquiry, which we had the numbers here to do. However, it went to a parliamentary joint committee. So, Senator Bilyk, do not come in here and tell me that I do not stick up for the battlers around this place, because I think I have done more for the battlers—those who have lost their money through shonky products and bad advice—than anyone else in this chamber.


I want to make it quite clear that I follow this very closely. I went on to the PJC, chaired by Mr Ripoll, and was on it right through that inquiry. And I will tell you what was wrong: the product was wrong. Storm Financial's product, as soon as there was a drop in the share market, was doomed for failure. The customers were geared so heavily with their debt that there was no way that the return on those shares and the capital growth in those shares could pay for the standard of living and all the interest on the debt for their house and their geared investments. It was a shonky product, and we need to see that more of these products are not out there.


But let me just talk about this whole FoFA modifications issue. The underlying objective of FoFA was to improve the quality of financial advice while building trust and confidence in the financial advice industry. We need an ethical financial planning industry with ethical products. Why is the government seeking to amend some of the consumer protections contained in FoFA? The amendments to FoFA seek to navigate the fine line between ensuring that unnecessary and burdensome regulations that drive up the costs of business and ultimately of consumers are removed. Just one in five Australians seek professional financial advice. We need to raise that. We need to raise that enormously, especially for the some 30 per cent of Australians who now have self-managed super funds—around $600 billion worth of money out of the $1.8 trillion worth of super. I am not going to see shortcuts in that advice.


This week Senator Bishop will deliver the report of our inquiry into ASIC that was supported by all around the chamber, especially Senator Cameron. I have made it quite clear on the public record that I want to see more. I want to see every financial planner licensed in this country—not just one licence for a big institution that may have 300 planners, but the whole 300 licensed. I want to see their history on the internet so that people can research them—whether they have been consistent in their employment, whether they have stayed in the one job for so long, what their record is like. And I want to see ASIC have the power to automatically suspend that licence—just one phone call; when ASIC receives information on wrongdoing, of not putting the interests of the client first, ASIC can call that financial planner and say: 'Charlie Brown, as of this minute you are out of your industry, your licence is suspended. You can go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and make an appeal, as everyone has a right of appeal, but my advice would be that perhaps you should go down to Centrelink, because we have the clear evidence that you are not putting the clients' interests first.'


And it is in there in black and white: the six points. The key consumer protection objectives of FoFA will remain. Advice will continue to be in the best interests of the client, full stop—not negotiable. The advice must be appropriate. An adviser must provide a warning if there is any incomplete or inaccurate information. An adviser must prioritise their client's interests ahead of their own. Conflicted remuneration structures, including commissions, that have the ability to influence advice will continue to be banned, and consumers will continue to have access to high-quality financial advice. That is what we are doing, and that is a protection of the general public, which is such an important issue to protect.


Regarding general advice on conflicted remuneration, I might add that in a division in here just last week Senator O'Neill said to me, 'Why are you bringing back commissions for general advice?' We are not. They are banned. They are not coming back. But let me say this: you can plug every hole in the wall as far as giving incentives to employees is concerned, but another hole will develop. I see nothing wrong with giving an incentive to workers for doing their job well and performing well, as long as they are not ripping off the people. For example, if a bank teller at the front counter talking to the public cannot get an up-front payment or commissions on it, that is fine. But what is to stop the bank from saying to that person, 'If you refer at least 50 clients to professional advice, we can knock 20 basis points off your home loan, or we can give you a company car.' You can plug every hole, but holes will still develop when it comes to institutions providing incentives for their workers. And in some cases—probably in many cases—the incentives are very good.


Commissions paid in relation to general advice will not be introduced, despite the scaremongering of many of the people trying to put out false information on this very issue. I come again to that point of ethical advice and behaviour. I mentioned what I would like to see come out about the licensing of financial planners. If they do not put the interests of their client first, regardless of what institution they work for, if they go flogging the products of their institution to get promotions or to get whatever and if that is not in the best interests of their client, then they should be suspended from the industry.


I want to move on to why the obligation to act in the client's best interests is being amended. The bills that are being introduced do not remove the requirement for advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. The requirement is enshrined in subsection 961B(1) of the Corporations Act. We have been through those parts that will remain, and they have to remain. As far as the opt-in goes, we received something like 460 submissions to that Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in relation to the collapse of Storm Financial, Opes Prime, Timbercorp, Great Southern et cetera. The requirement to obtain the client's agreement at least every two years adds an unnecessary and costly layer of red tape. And I will tell you why: new clients will continue to receive a fee-disclosure statement, which will contain the same information they would have had to have to determine whether they wanted to continue the fee arrangement or not. I will repeat: they will continue to receive a fee-disclosure statement. They will know what the fees are, they will know what their planner is charging them. That is the important issue here in this debate.


Stakeholders have indicated that due to the age of the systems involved it would cost almost twice as much to prepare a fee-disclosure statement for a pre-FoFA client than for a post-FoFA client. We cannot just go putting costs out, because, as I said at the start, only one in five Australians seeks financial advice from a financial planner. We need to raise that, and no doubt the ASIC inquiry we have just had has put a lot of smear on that industry—well, not smear, but it has certainly darkened it. And we need to lift that up and improve the quality so that people have faith in it.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2014-06-23,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (16:52):  Australians know how to use their discretion; they know how to make up their minds when receiving financial advice. We are sceptical of experts but often we decide to trust them. People expect that if they are paying someone to give them advice then that adviser is going to be trustworthy and have their best interests at heart. Is this a fair assumption? From what I have seen in a lot of cases, definitely not. It has not been in the past, and this government seemingly wants to return us to those days. In fact, we have not even left those days. We still feel the effects being played out on the front pages of our papers with the recent Commonwealth Bank financial planning scandal.


I could go on about the mechanics of the bill, but we have heard those time and time again in this place. I have talked to numerous people from all walks of life and with all sorts of backgrounds, and not constrained to one postcode or another, who have been done over by dodgy and/or incompetent advice. We as regulators have a duty of care to people. We need to have credible deterrents, accompanied by credible penalties.


Bad advice affects individuals, families and communities. I have had so many people come into my office who have been affected by bad advice. We hear from the government that we have to free financial advisers to do the right thing. The fact of the matter is that human nature does not change. There are some reputable people and there are some disreputable people. We hoped that the reputable ones would hold the disreputable ones to account. That has not worked. I do not wish to see any more people come in to my office who have had their life savings and properties and those of their families stolen from them, in effect. I do not want to see them end up having to seek welfare. I do not want to see either them or their families with mental health issues, now or in the future.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:55):  I am pleased to participate in this debate. I am really, really unhappy with the contribution made by Senator Williams. Senator Williams and I worked together on the economics committee for a long period of time, trying to get people proper protection in relation to financial advice. It was Senator Williams and I who argued strongly for the establishment of inquiries into Commonwealth financial planning and into ASIC's role as well. Senator Williams indicated that no-one has played a stronger role than him on this issue. Up until now, that may have been true. But now we see Senator Williams capitulating to the finance sector, Senator Cormann and the party—and that is not good for consumers. I do agree that Senator Williams has played a strong role, but that strong role is no longer there. Instead of being Batman, he is now the Joker. He has gone from trying to protect people to actually arguing that things should happen that are going to make it hard for people. I do not agree with the proposition from Senator Williams.


In all the arguments coming forward are two clear groups. You have representatives of consumers and academics who have studied the legislation saying, 'This is bad and it is taking protection for consumers backwards.' Then you have the banks and financial institutions saying, 'This is great. This is what should happen. We should be free to get in there and talk to our clients.' Underpinning that approach is that they think they should be free to continue the rip-offs that have taken place in this area.


The analysis that we saw in the inquiry is that this dilutes the best-interest obligation. It removes the opt-in requirement where financial planners have to renew every couple of years the contract that they sign. It limits the consolidated annual statement of fees to new clients. Also, it waters down the ban on commissions. I, like Senator Williams, have sat in hearings listening to people saying that their lives have been devastated by a financial planner from the Commonwealth Bank or another institution that you would normally think you could trust. But you could not trust them because the legislation was weak and ineffective and the loophole in it was used by the financial planners in the Commonwealth Bank.


I do not think we can have a position either where we have Senator Williams on the one hand arguing that the coalition are protecting the consumer at the same time as they have ripped $120 million out of ASIC's budget. ASIC themselves, the group that is supposed to be looking after consumers, said clearly, 'We cannot do our job the way we used to do it and the people who will suffer are consumers.' We are talking about $6 billion worth of rip-offs that have been identified over the last few years—ABC Learning, $2.5 billion; Kleenmaid, $82 million; Opes Prime, $630 million; and Storm Financial, $830 million. If that is not an issue that we should take seriously then I do not know what is.


We have seen the coalition establish a number of royal commissions based on attacking their political opponents and payback. If there is one royal commission that should be established, it is a royal commission into the finance sector. We should look at the protections and safeguards for consumers, the role of remuneration including bonuses and executive salaries, the role and resourcing of ASIC, the role of election donations and legislation, the impact on consumers, the impact on the economy, the issues for business regulation and the licensing and qualifications of financial planners, just to mention a few issues. If you ever needed a royal commission, it is a royal commission into the finance sector to protect the Australian public.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (17:00):  We should at least find it refreshing that the opposition has moved on from budget scaremongering about the government kicking grannies and starving students and beating up the unemployed. They are trying to develop a whole new scary monster at the bottom of the bed concerning the future of financial advice provisions. I remind the Senate that in 2009 the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I was a member and which was chaired by the now shadow minister for financial services and superannuation, Mr Bernie Ripoll, came up with a bipartisan response on how we might go about improving the integrity of financial planning following the Storm Financial collapse and the terrible problems that resulted from that. It was a bipartisan report, and two of the things it particularly looked at were the development of a best interests test for financial planners to ensure they are acting in the best interests of their clients and abolishing the payment of commissions and conflicted remunerations—commissions both up-front and trailing. This legislation does that, and that is exactly what the committee chaired by Mr Ripoll, with the support of the then opposition, the now government, agreed to and that is what we recommended. 


The committee went on to have inquiry after inquiry into the many tranches of Minister Shorten's future of financial advice legislation, and, as Minister Cormann pointed out in question time, only one submission suggested that we have opt-in requirements for clients. That came from the Industry Super Network—they were the only ones who suggested this should happen. Much of what the then government put into FoFA was basically about pleasing their political masters, not about protecting consumers. I would like to refer briefly to the dissenting report of the 2012 inquiry into FoFA. The coalition members of that committee, of which I was then the deputy chair, made the point that there were a number of high profile collapses in financial services across Australia, and we cited Storm Financial, Trio and Westpoint. We could add to that Timbercorp and the Sherwin Group in Brisbane—the list could go on and on. The point is that those collapses happened because financial advisers broke the law then—they behaved in a criminal fashion. They did not meet the requirements—which needed tightening up, I agree, but still they did not meet them. I feel nothing but extreme sympathy for people who have been affected by the like of the collapse of Storm Financial, but getting rid of the red tape in the FoFA legislation and making sure it is easy to use will in no way assist those people. I would quite confidently but sadly stand here and say there will be another rort conducted by someone, but that will not be someone who is acting within these laws—it will be someone acting outside the laws. I spoke to someone recently who had been affected by the collapse of one of these groups, and they said that we should legislate to stop it. We have done what we can to set up a very strong framework, but asking us to stop collapses happening is like asking us to legislate to stop burglary. The people who instigate those collapses, who con investors, are people who are breaking the law—and that was the law before FoFA was introduced.


In our dissenting report we brought up the fact that the current legislation as it stands around best interest duty is at best confused and at worst unenforceable. The Trust Company, who are not exactly a political body, have said:


The best interest duty as expressed in the Bill is a prescriptive duty and will cause confusion and uncertainty in the industry. It is confusing a duty of care on one hand with a duty of loyalty on the other. The Bill attempts to address a duty of loyalty by using standards and rules which are associated with the duty of care. These two duties cannot be confused. It is the duty of loyalty that underpins the fiduciary obligation and it is this duty that should be met


The Joint Consumer Group have said:


… it may be difficult for courts and external dispute resolution schemes to interpret the duty and there is a risk that their interpretations may not further the government's policy aim.


That being the then Labor government. The opposition can do their damnedest to develop scary monsters at the end of the bed, but in the end these are the expert people who know whether the law relating to best interest duty as the then government put it into place can be enforced. What is the point of a law that cannot be enforced? It is crazy for this scaremongering to continue. This legislation as we have developed it is exactly what we said we would do two years ago. It has been done to assist consumers as much as possible.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (17:07):  The Future of Financial Advice reforms legislation under the previous Labor government was not perfect, but it was one I supported because it addressed some yawning gaps in protections for consumers of financial advice—gaps which turned into a chasm of financial disaster for too many Australians. Scandals involving Storm Financial, the Commonwealth Bank's financial planning arm, Timbercorp and Opes Prime have led to massive losses by more than 100,000 Australians, including many who lost their life savings.


Who wants to go back to the bad old days which saw planners inherently conflicted between earning commissions and giving advice in the best interests of their clients? Last week the government released details of its reforms to FoFA, and the Acting Assistant Treasurer has indicated he wants the measures implemented by regulation. This is not good enough. A legislative framework is preferable to relying on regulations, and I look forward to the release of the interim report of the Financial System Inquiry, headed by David Murray, which is due on 15 July. I also look forward to the release later this week of the report of the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into the performance of ASIC, partly in relation to misconduct at Commonwealth Financial Planning Ltd.


Experts such as Dr Pamela Hanrahan of the Melbourne Law School have called for better targeted reform of not only financial advisers but also custodians, trustees, responsible entities, brokers and dealers. Dr Hanrahan, a former regional commissioner of ASIC, suggests ASIC should raise the bar for the industry by creating a register of dealers, brokers and advisers that are properly qualified and accredited by a professional body with proper disciplinary powers. She suggests advisers must accept a minimum four duties: a duty of care and diligence; an undiluted duty to act in the best interests of clients; a duty to avoid conflicts of interest, including on accepting conflicted commissions; and a duty of full disclosure.


Dr Hanrahan's approach appears sensible. Scrapping the best-interest requirement will only make consumers more vulnerable to being ripped off, so the government is wrong to abandon that test. In addition, the government has left the door open to big institutions earning commissions off some quite complex products—so long as they do not call it 'financial advice'. The distinction between services and products that do and do not attract commissions becomes pretty meaningless—customers can simply be referred to another department, and the institution will retain the business while another staff member earns the commission. Leaving the door open in this way is also a retrograde step, as is the move to wind back 'opt-in' requirements for advisers. If the industry has nothing to hide from its customers, then it has nothing to fear from requirements to get written confirmation that their services continue. This is important because two-thirds of financial services clients are completely passive, and may not even know they are paying advisers.


The government has already gone back to the drawing board with its ill-considered first round of proposed FoFA reforms. I suggest it needs to go back again in a way that will protect consumers and will best avoid any future financial scandals.

ASSET RECYCLING FUND BILL 2014



The Asset Recycling Fund Bill 2014 and consequential amendments establishes a new fund as a vehicle for providing financial assistance and incentives to States and Territories to invest in infrastructure.


The Asset Recycling Fund will support the Asset Recycling Initiative. It will assist the States and Territories to sell existing assets and allow the sale proceeds to be reinvested into new infrastructure. The Fund will also facilitate the Government’s investment in nationally significant infrastructure projects.


The Asset Recycling Fund is part of the Government’s infrastructure package announced in the 2014-15 Budget to support economic growth.


Under the Bill, the Asset Recycling Fund will receive an initial contribution of $5.9 billion at commencement, comprising of:


$ 2.4 billion of uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund; and


$ 3.5 billion of uncommitted funds from the Education Investment Fund.


Further credits will be made to the Asset Recycling Fund in the future, including the proceeds from the sale of Medibank Private.


The capital and earnings of the Fund will be available to fund new infrastructure priorities. 


Payments from the Fund will be made to the States and Territories for investment in infrastructure under National Partnership Agreements. The Fund will also accommodate other infrastructure payments, to be administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, including $350 million for the Roads to Recovery Programme.


The Asset Recycling Fund will be invested and managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians, which has a proven track record of managing investment portfolios on behalf of the Government, and maximising returns over the long term. 


The Bill requires the Finance Minister and Treasurer to issue directions to the Future Fund Board to articulate the Government’s expectations for how the Fund will be managed and invested by the Board.


The Asset Recycling Fund will support the substantial infrastructure package announced by the Government in the 2014-15 Budget.  This package is part of the Government’s investment in building Australia’s infrastructure, improving productivity and building a stronger, more prosperous economy.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:15):  I seek leave to move two motions together.


Leave granted. 




Senator WRIGHT:
  I move:


That item 4.10A of Schedule 1 of the Bankruptcy Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2014 No. 36 and made under the Bankruptcy Act 1966, be disallowed [F2014L00350].


(Eleven sitting days remain, including today, to resolve the motion or the instrument will be deemed to have been disallowed.) 


I also move:


That the Division 2.11 of the Bankruptcy (Fees and Remuneration) Determination 2014, made under subsection 316(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966, be disallowed [F2014L00367].


(Eleven sitting days remain, including today, to resolve the motion or the instrument will be deemed to have been disallowed.)


As the instigator of these disallowance motions, I rise to highlight exactly what they will disallow. I urge the Senate to disallow these provisions. In so doing, the Senate will send a clear message that we are looking out for vulnerable people in Australia.


Last year's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, MYEFO, directed the Australian Financial Security Authority to recover its own costs by introducing a new $120 fee for people who apply for a debtor's petition. What is a debtor's petition? It is a form of voluntary bankruptcy. A person files for a debtor's petition when their debts are insurmountable, when all other options have been exhausted and when they have finally—often after a long, protracted period—decided to take control of their own finances by filing for this form of voluntary bankruptcy.


In coming to the decision to move this disallowance,    I have been closely consulting with consumer advocates and financial counsellors, in particular the representatives of Financial Counselling Australia and the Consumer Action Law Centre who brought the consequences of this fee to my attention. Many of us in this place will not have personally experienced the stress and worry that others face as they struggle to get on top of stifling debts. No doubt some of us in this place have faced or will face such a situation, but I think there would probably be fewer here than in other parts of Australia. The debts some people face are impossible to deal with and are a constant living nightmare—people can often see no way to get out of the financial nightmare they are in.


Some Australians are in the midst of that nightmare right now. Just last week in South Australia, I met with some financial counsellors who told me about the experiences of a couple of their clients. One of them told me about a man who had developed a serious physical illness, a debilitating illness. He, along with his wife, had been running a small business. He had been struggling to continue with the business and to pay his mounting debts. He was initially very unwilling to consider bankruptcy, because he considered his debts his moral responsibility to repay. But the situation was becoming increasingly hopeless. There was no end in sight—either in recovery from his illness or in resurrecting his business. He finally came to a decision to petition for bankruptcy, but this fee, which came into effect on 1 April, was one more impediment—after the long series of steps he had taken in coming to that decision—and once again the situation seemed hopeless to him.


What these financial counsellors were at pains to convey to me—and they have been doing so all along—is that people do not undertake voluntary bankruptcy lightly. There is still a strong sense of shame and stigma in Australian society for people who have had to publicly acknowledge that their financial circumstances are out of their control. So people usually only go into voluntary bankruptcy after a long process of consideration and a series of steps. With that final decision—which they always make on a personal basis; the counsellors give them the options, but it is always the decision of the client—there often then comes a sense of relief. They start to have a sense that they are reasserting control over their lives, that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. However, what I have been consistently hearing from these representatives of vulnerable and marginalised people is that this final fee, this fee of $120, was just one more impediment—and often, in fact, impossible. 


For people on our incomes, $120 may seem little more than a meal out, perhaps. But there are many people in Australia who are struggling on low incomes. I am not even talking about people on fixed incomes, on pensions; I am talking about people on below average incomes who would find it impossible to find $120 in their budget for this. People who are contemplating bankruptcy, of course, are at the end of the spectrum where they have no hope of being able to control their finances. So where do they find this money? Can they put it on a credit card? Probably their credit card is one of the debts they have not been able to manage. Even if they did have some credit limit available, arguably it would be fraudulent to use the card for that fee—because they would know, at the time they put the fee on the credit card, that they would have no means of repaying that credit card debt. We know about the risks of going to payday lenders and the exorbitant interest rates they charge. Or do they go to an agency—an NGO somewhere—who can support them to find this fee? At best that is just cost shifting, but increasingly, in the current environment, it is not going to be possible anyway.


Financial counsellors have been telling me that those who truly need to go bankrupt may be, ironically, the very people who cannot afford it. I am told that, since the fee was introduced on 1 April, just after the Senate rose from the autumn sittings, it has already made it harder and more complicated for vulnerable people to decide to file a debtor's petition. It has already acted as a disincentive. In fact in Senate estimates in May I questioned the authority about this, and the authority's own figures confirm this. It is difficult to draw conclusions after a short period of time, of course, and there are seasonal factors from year to year and numbers go up and down, but certainly the number of people filing for a debtor's petition has decreased since the fee was introduced.


The alternative, if a person cannot take this step to resolve their nightmare situation where debts are just insurmountable, is to live with the anxiety that someone else may well then force your bankruptcy at any time. Any of your creditors can do that, and of course that means it is out of your control and you do not know when the blow is coming.


I now want to deal with a few furphies that are floating around. We know that there is a common perception that bankrupts are perhaps high-flying entrepreneurs who had one luxury vehicle too many—maybe people like the Christopher Skases of this world will come to mind—but in fact that is just not an accurate representation of the sorts of people who are needing to make this difficult decision. AFSA's own figures show that this is false imagery. They show that unemployment is by far the biggest cause of personal bankruptcy in Australia, and that most people earned less than $30,000 in the year before they ultimately became bankrupt.


Forcing people to live with debt that they cannot repay is not only unfair, but it is bad for the business sector and the economy. That is why the business sector, especially those who are common creditors, is on the record as saying that the fee should not be introduced because continued accessibility to an orderly, methodical means of resolving an ongoing situation like this, and to bankruptcy, not only supports debtors but also creditors and the entire financial system. They know that a very real consequence of this filing fee is a reduction in the number of debtor's petitions filed.


The Australian Greens stand with people on low incomes, consumer advocates and the business sector in saying that this fee is not acceptable. That is one of the reasons we are disallowing these instruments. It is an unfair and rather unsophisticated way to recover costs. The introduction of the debtor's petition fee hits disadvantaged people the hardest, quite obviously. Often they will have no other means to support themselves, and it is happening in the wake of a federal budget that we know is going to have increased adverse effects—it is a cruel budget—on people who are already struggling, such as the unemployed, older people, single parents and people who are already doing it tough. We know that these people are already in trouble. With cuts to services, cuts to benefits and the proposal that young people under 30 who are not earning or learning go without income support for six months, the conditions are rife to see an increase in the number of people who will be facing the incredibly difficult decision to file for bankruptcy.


The Australian Financial Security Authority, which is introducing this fee, at the government's direction, has published figures showing the profile of those who this fee would affect. Unemployment or loss of income has consistently been nominated as the most frequent cause of insolvency for non-business related bankruptcies since 2003. In 2011, the majority of bankrupts who owed less than $5,000 were not employed at the time of bankruptcy and had low-level utility debt.


As the Australian Greens spokesperson for legal affairs, I have fought for people's access to justice. Despite successive governments' obsession with full cost recovery, increasingly, the Greens believe that institutions like courts, tribunals and bankruptcy in Australia provide an essential service in ensuring that people have avenues to pursue their legal rights. I think the assumption that essential services such as these should earn back their own costs needs to be questioned. When the Labor government raised Federal Court fees, the then shadow Attorney-General and now Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, called it another disguised Labor tax. But the messaging has changed now that he is the Attorney-General and is looking at the same thing in relation to courts and so on.


Financial counsellors emphasise that no person makes the decision lightly to go bankrupt. It is considered as a last option, but an appropriate one in some cases. As a result of the Greens moving of a notice to disallow these regulations, a clear message has been sent that the Australian Greens are willing to heed the policy advice of those people who are currently working to assist some of the most vulnerable people in Australia. As a result I have had the opportunity to make the case to the Attorney-General's Department and to representatives of the Attorney-General himself. I do want to indicate that there has been a series of productive meetings where representatives of Financial Counselling Australia and the Consumer Action Law Centre have been able to strongly advocate against the introduction of this new fee and have painted a picture of its detrimental effects on their clients. They have been able to put to the government that instead of closing the debt recovery loop by hitting the most financially vulnerable people in Australia, the government could look at other options—for instance, to nuance the realisations charge, which applies to all administrations under the Bankruptcy Act.


The Financial Counsellors Association and the Consumer Action Law Centre, which is a community legal centre, are highly respected and highly expert people in the area of dealing with consumer credit issues with vulnerable people in Australia. I do find it somewhat ironic that they have indeed, I suppose you would argue, been engaging in advocacy by taking their combined experience with the effects of law changes on their clients and making a strong case about changing the law in a better way so that their clients are not disproportionately affected. Ironically, given the new mantra from the Attorney-General that funding for these sorts of organisations, particularly community legal centres, should not ideally be used for advocacy and instead should be used for front-line services, it would mean that perhaps in the future this advocacy may not be so possible, or the representatives of those organisations may have to do it on their own time, which would mean that the meetings perhaps would have had to have occurred outside business hours. But in any case there was an opportunity for these representatives to meet with representatives of the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General and make the case about this particular change, which is to impose a $120 fee that had not been there before, against the evidence in other countries that the fee becomes shifted and creditors end up bearing the cost, or else it shifts to other government agencies. They were able to make that case.


I do have an understanding that in fact there may be action coming forward on the part of the government to indeed waive that fee entirely and to find some other means of cost recovery, perhaps by increasing the asset realisation charge with a review to see how that is going ahead. If that is the case, I would certainly welcome that. That would certainly be something that would ameliorate the worst aspects of this fee as it has been indicated and conveyed to me and the Attorney-General's representatives. In that case, it may be that there will not be a need to look at disallowing a fee further in the future. We will wait and see what comes out of that. But if that is the case, then I would like to think that this has been a good example of a process whereby good policy can be pursued on the basis of information and evidence coming forward. 


Just to finish, I would say that the Australian Greens do urge the government to nuance its cost-recovery measures with AFSA in a way that provides real relief and good policy for those people who are making the most difficult decision to file for a debtor's petition and which indeed provides a genuine benefit to the Australian community, including the business and finance sector. I move that the Senate supports this motion.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:31):  I rise to also support this disallowance motion. I think Senator Wright has outlined clearly some of the reasons why this new fee is unfair. It is unfair on debtors. We know very well that voluntary bankruptcy is an important last-resort option for those who are unable to pay back unmanageable costs. It does happen; it is not something that people take lightly, but it is an option there. That is an important option. It still carries with it a very serious social stigma. Therefore, financial counsellors know when they deal with clients the awful effect of what that will mean for their clients that they are providing advice and support to, and therefore they do not make that decision lightly. It is not a course taken lightly at all.


Bankruptcy offers an orderly process in which all creditors are able to recover some of their outstanding debts, without costly debt collection and legal fees. That really is the key: without those costly collection and legal fees, it enables debtors to deal with their financial difficulty with some dignity. It is something where, whilst they do not take the decision lightly, it is in a sense a clearing of the decks and it allows them to start anew or start afresh. In doing that now, there is obviously this new fee on bankruptcy itself. It just makes those already at their rock-bottom face just another very hard financial hurdle. Yes, $120 may not sound like a lot; but when you already have however many hundreds or thousands of dollars of debt, a burden on top of that is simply probably too much to bear.


As Senator Wright pointed out, we are not talking about high-flyers here. We are talking about people who are often at their rock-bottom. People who opt for voluntary redundancy are often on incomes of less than $20,000. They are those poorer members of our society. On this level of financial hardship, with this $120 fee, for some of those people—if you think about it, they are on an income of $20,000 or less—that would be 30 per cent of their weekly income.


Those considering bankruptcy often have difficulty at things that we take for granted every day. They are things like being able to pay their rent. It is their basic expenses like rent, food, transport and the like. I was actually at the Fitzroy community legal centre last Friday and we were talking about this very matter. Some of the clients, some people that they support and deal with coming through their doors, are people facing financial hardship. It often does start with losing your job. This kind of downward spiral can occur from thereon in, where people end up getting into debt because they have not had that opportunity to find another job and the debt then keeps piling up. Their rent keeps becoming due, they need to get food on the table, there are transport costs, they may have a car, and it just keeps going on and on. You think about someone's life and how easy it is, if they were already on a low income, for them to end up in a debt situation.


I think that the government here has various options for recovering the costs of administering bankruptcies and I do not think the current option that they have is the right one at all. I do think it is unfair. I think the recovery of a small amount of revenue for government should not come at the expense of some of the most desperate people in our country. That is really what we are talking about here and that is why I think this disallowance motion is really important.


In a sense, this new fee has the absurd effect of rendering some of those in financial hardship—that is, some of those debtors—as too poor to go bankrupt. It is a bit ironic, but that is really where they end up. I would think that a lot of them do not have access to a line of credit if they are declaring bankruptcy. They would be in a position where they would be compelled to pay a fee with funds derived from wherever else they have them. Obviously, for a lot of those people who are on very low incomes, the only area from which they could derive funds to pay such a fee would be their welfare payments. So, if they are paying this $120 fee from their welfare payments, how are they living? How are they providing themselves with food and ongoing needs such as shelter and the like? There are also charitable institutions. But, surely, we do not see the role of charitable institutions as one of providing those in need with money to pay a government fee. This is not the role of charitable institutions. Basically, they are the only two options that I can think of for people who are on very low incomes and who are in the situation of declaring bankruptcy. They would be the only two options that people would have to try and find the money to pay this absurd fee. 


Senator Wright commented on discussions and so forth with the Attorney-General's Department, I think it was, and that there might be some movement in relation to this fee. The government might be reconsidering its options of how to recover such a fee. With whatever the government is going to be looking at, if that is a real outcome then it is fantastic; it is really good. It shows that this disallowance motion has certainly been worth its weight in gold in bringing about a change that will have an effect out there in the community for those people most in need. 


We also need to consider this issue in terms of the financial hardship currently facing a number of people who are on low incomes. We have already outlined that people do not take lightly the idea of having to go down the voluntary bankruptcy path; but, at the same time, if they are now going to face cuts to basic welfare payments that they have had to sustain themselves when they have lost a job then how is this fair and how are they going to be able to get back on track? I am thinking here of the indexation of the pension and also of young people who are seeking Newstart. Those who lose their job will not be able to access a welfare payment. If they have already got some kind of debt that they have been unable to pay and then there is not even a welfare payment there to support them—the safety net that it is—then how are they going to get ahead and move on until the next job comes around the corner? This is reality for a lot of people. It is not a matter of someone just knocking on their door and offering them a new job. When you lose a job it does take time, often, in between jobs—before a new one comes around the corner. It is at this crucial point that people can fall off the edge in relation to their financial situation. They find themselves without any savings, living on a low income, having to pay rent, food and ongoing transport costs and the like and not being able to make ends meet. 


Labor want to ensure that we have a safety net for people in this country, and that is why we have made our position very clear on the government's budget: it is a very unfair budget. Couple the budget with that fee for those people who have to make the really hard choice of declaring themselves bankrupt. It is just a ridiculous proposition to have someone too poor to declare themselves bankrupt because of a $120 fee that they have to pay. 


Senator Wright also touched on the issue of cost-shifting to creditors or other agencies. This is another factor that the government needs to consider; it is another potential from this policy. It is one thing for governments to come forward with policy ideas to raise more revenue but they really need to think about who they are targeting. In this case, they are targeting some of the most vulnerable, lowest income Australians, who really deserve to be given a bit of support to get back on track so that they can again become contributors to our society, as much as they wanted to do in the first place. We support this motion.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (17:42):  The Abbott government is determined to repair our budget and to put Australia on a path of sustained prosperity and this, as I hope everyone has realised, requires some tough decisions to ensure that the load is shared fairly and responsibly. Accordingly, our budget will protect the most vulnerable members of our community. 


We were pleased to work with Senator Wright to address concerns about the fee imposed on debtors who wish to file for bankruptcy. The government will not be opposing these disallowance motions, but it will mean that the cost of administering insolvent estates must be recovered from elsewhere in the insolvency system. This system plays an important part in the regulation of business and in fostering a flourishing economy in which investors and consumers can have confidence. Ironically, it is important to ensure the ongoing viability and integrity of the insolvency system. So the outcome of the proposed disallowance motions is that even more of the burden will be passed on to creditors through an increase in the asset realisation charge. The charge will be gradually increased to seven per cent from 4.7 per cent. It moves to six per cent on 1 July. 


I hope people realise that creditors already bear heavy burdens in the insolvency system. They are the other side of the coin to those people who need to go into bankruptcy. While the distress associated with going into bankruptcy is huge, it is important to remember that creditors are not all from what Labor and the Greens would call the 'big end of town'. They are not all big banks and big businesses. Creditors include sole traders such as hardworking tradespeople—electricians, plumbers and the like. They include husband-and-wife businesses and many other sorts of small businesses. Even parents and siblings who might have gone guarantor for a loan for a car or something like that can be affected. The other side of the coin is the harm that can be done to creditors by bankruptcy. 


With this in mind, the government will monitor closely the effects of the increased asset realisation charge to ensure that the insolvency system remains viable and that the burdens of insolvency are shared fairly.

But the messaging has changed now that he is the Attorney-General and is looking at the same thing in relation to courts and so on.


Financial counsellors emphasise that no person makes the decision lightly to go bankrupt. It is considered as a last option, but an appropriate one in some cases. As a result of the Greens moving of a notice to disallow these regulations, a clear message has been sent that the Australian Greens are willing to heed the policy advice of those people who are currently working to assist some of the most vulnerable people in Australia. As a result I have had the opportunity to make the case to the Attorney-General's Department and to representatives of the Attorney-General himself. I do want to indicate that there has been a series of productive meetings where representatives of Financial Counselling Australia and the Consumer Action Law Centre have been able to strongly advocate against the introduction of this new fee and have painted a picture of its detrimental effects on their clients. They have been able to put to the government that instead of closing the debt recovery loop by hitting the most financially vulnerable people in Australia, the government could look at other options—for instance, to nuance the realisations charge, which applies to all administrations under the Bankruptcy Act.


The Financial Counsellors Association and the Consumer Action Law Centre, which is a community legal centre, are highly respected and highly expert people in the area of dealing with consumer credit issues with vulnerable people in Australia. I do find it somewhat ironic that they have indeed, I suppose you would argue, been engaging in advocacy by taking their combined experience with the effects of law changes on their clients and making a strong case about changing the law in a better way so that their clients are not disproportionately affected. Ironically, given the new mantra from the Attorney-General that funding for these sorts of organisations, particularly community legal centres, should not ideally be used for advocacy and instead should be used for front-line services, it would mean that perhaps in the future this advocacy may not be so possible, or the representatives of those organisations may have to do it on their own time, which would mean that the meetings perhaps would have had to have occurred outside business hours. But in any case there was an opportunity for these representatives to meet with representatives of the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General and make the case about this particular change, which is to impose a $120 fee that had not been there before, against the evidence in other countries that the fee becomes shifted and creditors end up bearing the cost, or else it shifts to other government agencies. They were able to make that case.


I do have an understanding that in fact there may be action coming forward on the part of the government to indeed waive that fee entirely and to find some other means of cost recovery, perhaps by increasing the asset realisation charge with a review to see how that is going ahead. If that is the case, I would certainly welcome that. That would certainly be something that would ameliorate the worst aspects of this fee as it has been indicated and conveyed to me and the Attorney-General's representatives. In that case, it may be that there will not be a need to look at disallowing a fee further in the future. We will wait and see what comes out of that. But if that is the case, then I would like to think that this has been a good example of a process whereby good policy can be pursued on the basis of information and evidence coming forward. 


Just to finish, I would say that the Australian Greens do urge the government to nuance its cost-recovery measures with AFSA in a way that provides real relief and good policy for those people who are making the most difficult decision to file for a debtor's petition and which indeed provides a genuine benefit to the Australian community, including the business and finance sector. I move that the Senate supports this motion.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:31):  I rise to also support this disallowance motion. I think Senator Wright has outlined clearly some of the reasons why this new fee is unfair. It is unfair on debtors. We know very well that voluntary bankruptcy is an important last-resort option for those who are unable to pay back unmanageable costs. It does happen; it is not something that people take lightly, but it is an option there. That is an important option. It still carries with it a very serious social stigma. Therefore, financial counsellors know when they deal with clients the awful effect of what that will mean for their clients that they are providing advice and support to, and therefore they do not make that decision lightly. It is not a course taken lightly at all.


Bankruptcy offers an orderly process in which all creditors are able to recover some of their outstanding debts, without costly debt collection and legal fees. That really is the key: without those costly collection and legal fees, it enables debtors to deal with their financial difficulty with some dignity. It is something where, whilst they do not take the decision lightly, it is in a sense a clearing of the decks and it allows them to start anew or start afresh. In doing that now, there is obviously this new fee on bankruptcy itself. It just makes those already at their rock-bottom face just another very hard financial hurdle. Yes, $120 may not sound like a lot; but when you already have however many hundreds or thousands of dollars of debt, a burden on top of that is simply probably too much to bear.


As Senator Wright pointed out, we are not talking about high-flyers here. We are talking about people who are often at their rock-bottom. People who opt for voluntary redundancy are often on incomes of less than $20,000. They are those poorer members of our society. On this level of financial hardship, with this $120 fee, for some of those people—if you think about it, they are on an income of $20,000 or less—that would be 30 per cent of their weekly income.


Those considering bankruptcy often have difficulty at things that we take for granted every day. They are things like being able to pay their rent. It is their basic expenses like rent, food, transport and the like. I was actually at the Fitzroy community legal centre last Friday and we were talking about this very matter. Some of the clients, some people that they support and deal with coming through their doors, are people facing financial hardship. It often does start with losing your job. This kind of downward spiral can occur from thereon in, where people end up getting into debt because they have not had that opportunity to find another job and the debt then keeps piling up. Their rent keeps becoming due, they need to get food on the table, there are transport costs, they may have a car, and it just keeps going on and on. You think about someone's life and how easy it is, if they were already on a low income, for them to end up in a debt situation.


I think that the government here has various options for recovering the costs of administering bankruptcies and I do not think the current option that they have is the right one at all. I do think it is unfair. I think the recovery of a small amount of revenue for government should not come at the expense of some of the most desperate people in our country. That is really what we are talking about here and that is why I think this disallowance motion is really important.


In a sense, this new fee has the absurd effect of rendering some of those in financial hardship—that is, some of those debtors—as too poor to go bankrupt. It is a bit ironic, but that is really where they end up. I would think that a lot of them do not have access to a line of credit if they are declaring bankruptcy. They would be in a position where they would be compelled to pay a fee with funds derived from wherever else they have them. Obviously, for a lot of those people who are on very low incomes, the only area from which they could derive funds to pay such a fee would be their welfare payments. So, if they are paying this $120 fee from their welfare payments, how are they living? How are they providing themselves with food and ongoing needs such as shelter and the like? There are also charitable institutions. But, surely, we do not see the role of charitable institutions as one of providing those in need with money to pay a government fee. This is not the role of charitable institutions. Basically, they are the only two options that I can think of for people who are on very low incomes and who are in the situation of declaring bankruptcy. They would be the only two options that people would have to try and find the money to pay this absurd fee. 


Senator Wright commented on discussions and so forth with the Attorney-General's Department, I think it was, and that there might be some movement in relation to this fee. The government might be reconsidering its options of how to recover such a fee. With whatever the government is going to be looking at, if that is a real outcome then it is fantastic; it is really good. It shows that this disallowance motion has certainly been worth its weight in gold in bringing about a change that will have an effect out there in the community for those people most in need. 


We also need to consider this issue in terms of the financial hardship currently facing a number of people who are on low incomes. We have already outlined that people do not take lightly the idea of having to go down the voluntary bankruptcy path; but, at the same time, if they are now going to face cuts to basic welfare payments that they have had to sustain themselves when they have lost a job then how is this fair and how are they going to be able to get back on track? I am thinking here of the indexation of the pension and also of young people who are seeking Newstart. Those who lose their job will not be able to access a welfare payment. If they have already got some kind of debt that they have been unable to pay and then there is not even a welfare payment there to support them—the safety net that it is—then how are they going to get ahead and move on until the next job comes around the corner? This is reality for a lot of people. It is not a matter of someone just knocking on their door and offering them a new job. When you lose a job it does take time, often, in between jobs—before a new one comes around the corner. It is at this crucial point that people can fall off the edge in relation to their financial situation. They find themselves without any savings, living on a low income, having to pay rent, food and ongoing transport costs and the like and not being able to make ends meet. 


Labor want to ensure that we have a safety net for people in this country, and that is why we have made our position very clear on the government's budget: it is a very unfair budget. Couple the budget with that fee for those people who have to make the really hard choice of declaring themselves bankrupt. It is just a ridiculous proposition to have someone too poor to declare themselves bankrupt because of a $120 fee that they have to pay. 


Senator Wright also touched on the issue of cost-shifting to creditors or other agencies. This is another factor that the government needs to consider; it is another potential from this policy. It is one thing for governments to come forward with policy ideas to raise more revenue but they really need to think about who they are targeting. In this case, they are targeting some of the most vulnerable, lowest income Australians, who really deserve to be given a bit of support to get back on track so that they can again become contributors to our society, as much as they wanted to do in the first place. We support this motion.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (17:42):  The Abbott government is determined to repair our budget and to put Australia on a path of sustained prosperity and this, as I hope everyone has realised, requires some tough decisions to ensure that the load is shared fairly and responsibly. Accordingly, our budget will protect the most vulnerable members of our community. 


We were pleased to work with Senator Wright to address concerns about the fee imposed on debtors who wish to file for bankruptcy. The government will not be opposing these disallowance motions, but it will mean that the cost of administering insolvent estates must be recovered from elsewhere in the insolvency system. This system plays an important part in the regulation of business and in fostering a flourishing economy in which investors and consumers can have confidence. Ironically, it is important to ensure the ongoing viability and integrity of the insolvency system. So the outcome of the proposed disallowance motions is that even more of the burden will be passed on to creditors through an increase in the asset realisation charge. The charge will be gradually increased to seven per cent from 4.7 per cent. It moves to six per cent on 1 July. 


I hope people realise that creditors already bear heavy burdens in the insolvency system. They are the other side of the coin to those people who need to go into bankruptcy. While the distress associated with going into bankruptcy is huge, it is important to remember that creditors are not all from what Labor and the Greens would call the 'big end of town'. They are not all big banks and big businesses. Creditors include sole traders such as hardworking tradespeople—electricians, plumbers and the like. They include husband-and-wife businesses and many other sorts of small businesses. Even parents and siblings who might have gone guarantor for a loan for a car or something like that can be affected. The other side of the coin is the harm that can be done to creditors by bankruptcy. 


With this in mind, the government will monitor closely the effects of the increased asset realisation charge to ensure that the insolvency system remains viable and that the burdens of insolvency are shared fairly. 


Question agreed to.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:45):  Before I was interrupted for question time and other business I mentioned that the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 went through 20 drafts but that there was no consultation by government with Infrastructure Australia. I still find it quite unbelievable that there were 20 drafts but that Infrastructure Australia were not consulted at all. It is quite unbelievable. I have spoken about this government's inability to consult before making policy, but this certainly takes the cake. Not only did it fail to consult Infrastructure Australia; it did not consult any of the relevant parties outside government. To propose such major changes to Infrastructure Australia without consulting anyone outside government shows an absolute arrogance and lack of forethought, which the Australian people are very rapidly becoming annoyed about. At the very least, the government should have undergone an exposure draft process. But the Abbott government has a history of failing to consult, which unfortunately I do not think is likely to change.


Infrastructure Australia's evidence is more damning than just a failure to consult. Mr Deegan's submission states:


The Deputy Prime Minister's objectives and principles concerning the organisation's independence and transparency in decision-making deserve wide support.


Some of the provisions in the Bill are consistent with these objectives and principles. Others unfortunately are not - indeed, some proposed new provisions appear diametrically opposed to those objectives and principles.


I repeat: '… some proposed new positions appear diametrically opposed to those objectives and principles'. Is that why the government did not ask Infrastructure Australia for advice on reform of its own governance structure, or is it because they might have pointed out exactly what Mr Deegan pointed out in this submission—that the new provisions in this bill appear to be diametrically opposed to the stated aims of this bill, that this bill does not do what the explanatory memorandum says it will do but the exact opposite? As we on this side know, the government have a history of saying one thing but doing another. But to say the stated aims of the bill do one thing while the provisions of the bill do the exact opposite is an extraordinary act of hypocrisy, even from those opposite. Didn't they expect anyone to look at the bill?


The bill that was presented to the House and passed by the House sought to gag Infrastructure Australia through the now deleted section 5D. This section was to provide, and I quote from Mr Deegan's submission again:


… that Infrastructure Australia is not permitted to publish, unless it has a written direction from the Minister:


 its evaluation of project proposals under proposed section 5A, 


any evidence relied on in the preparation of any output, including national infrastructure plans,


the reasoning by which it reached its conclusions in any evaluation of any proposal, or in deciding the Infrastructure Priority List or preparing a national infrastructure plans, or even 


its conclusions.


The submission goes on to state:


lt is possible that the Minister will give a carte blanche direction to Infrastructure Australia to publish all this material. But even if the Minister does so, the provision makes any claimed independence or transparency an illusion.


The submission states that section 5D(1)(b): 


… makes whatever Infrastructure Australia does secret unless the Minister directs otherwise. 


Well, we are getting pretty used to secrets from those opposite. This section would have prevented Infrastructure Australia from giving the Australian people advice on the infrastructure needs of this country without the express permission of the minister. Infrastructure Australia would have been able to inform public debate on the infrastructure needs of this country only if their research and recommendations were ideologically consistent with the views of the minister. It is despicable that those opposite would seek to gag a body like Infrastructure Australia in such a way, and I am glad that Minister Truss has come to his senses and has at least deleted this section.


The government talk about making Infrastructure Australia more independent, but their actions conflict with their statements. The minister has already sought to move aside the Infrastructure Coordinator, Mr Michael Deegan, putting him on 'gardening leave', for the evidence he gave the Senate inquiry into this bill and for other criticisms of the government's infrastructure announcements. He has replaced him with an acting infrastructure coordinator, Mr John Fitzgerald. Unfortunately, Mr Fitzgerald may not be the best replacement. With regard to the East West Link in Victoria, Mr Fitzgerald put out a release on 29 April saying that it was a 'meritorious project'. In Senate estimates he indicated that, as a Victorian official of Treasury but also as a private consultant for KPMG doing work on this project, he advocated for the project. Unfortunately, in my book you cannot be both independent and a paid consultant at the same time. Mr Rod Eddington, the former Chair of Infrastructure Australia, has been replaced by a former Liberal minister, the Hon. Mark Birrell. This is just a case of jobs for the boys and a clear example of the Abbott government politicising Infrastructure Australia. The Australian people deserve much better than that—much, much better.


The bill that passed the House of Representatives sought to prevent Infrastructure Australia from performing its fundamental role of investigating projects and future infrastructure needs through the now deleted section 5A(2). Again I would like to quote Mr Deegan's submission to the Senate committee:


The proposed section 5A(2) empowers the Minister to determine by legislative instrument a class of proposals that Infrastructure Australia must not evaluate.


The rationale and policy intent behind this provision has not been explained. 


…      …   …


Use of proposed section 5A(2) is likely to be interpreted as minimising scrutiny of the business case for certain projects - or perhaps a wide class of projects such as proposals for the Commonwealth to fund public transport.


Section 5A(2) was put in there to ensure that the minister could prevent Infrastructure Australia from scrutinising projects that the government wants to approve—unwarranted infrastructure projects in Liberal-National marginal seats, for example—or to prevent proper investigation into projects that would be beneficial to the nation but that the government is ideologically opposed to. As with other expert bodies that provide advice which this government finds inconvenient, the coalition once again tried to limit what could be researched in order to minimise their own embarrassment and protect their own ideology. I am glad the minister has also deleted this provision from the bill that has come to the Senate. I am pleased that in the bill we are debating today we are returning to the provisions under the current act which permit ministerial directions of a general nature only. 


Labor is also putting forward amendments which will ensure that Infrastructure Australia retains the power to approve tax concessions for private sector co-investment in nationally significant infrastructure projects. This reform, brought in by the Labor government in the 2012-13 budget, aims to increase private sector involvement in major projects. The government proposed that this role be undertaken by a delegate of the minister, potentially outside Infrastructure Australia. Labor's amendment leaves this to the infrastructure experts within Infrastructure Australia.


We know those opposite are climate change deniers. That is why they have decided to delete the existing function to provide advice on infrastructure policy issues arising from climate under the government's changes. We on this side feel that this is a mistake and are opposed to this move. We know that the effects of climate change will have a significant impact on our future infrastructure needs. I was having a chat to my Tasmanian colleague Senator Polley, who is in the chamber and who has a bit of a background in shipping and transport. She was saying climate change is especially relevant, for example, when giving advice on ports and bridge heights. Labor's amendments will allow Infrastructure Australia to retain this important function.


The government proposes to remove the current function for Infrastructure Australia to review alignment of government funding decisions with Infrastructure Australia's advice. In the interests of transparency once again, Labor's amendment will retain this function. We on this side of the chamber want to know, and want the Australian people to know, that spending on infrastructure actually meets the nation's needs. I am glad that the government has made the changes that they have, but I call upon them to also agree to these sensible amendments. 


Having world class infrastructure in the most appropriate places is the key to Australia's future prosperity and it is too important for our nation for those opposite to politicise Infrastructure Australia for short-term political gain. Since its creation in 2008, Infrastructure Australia has overhauled, and has driven lasting improvements to, the way Australia plans, assesses, finances, builds and uses the infrastructure it needs to compete in the 21st century. Its achievements include: (a) completing the first ever infrastructure audit; (b) putting in place a national priority list to guide investment into nationally significant projects which offer the highest economic and social returns, with the former Labor government committing funding to all 15 projects identified as ready to proceed; (c) developing national public-private partnership, or PPP, guidelines to make it easier and cheaper for private investors to partner with governments to build new infrastructure; (d) finalising long-term blueprints for a truly national, integrated and multimodal transport system capable of moving goods around as well as into and out of Australia quickly, reliably and efficiently, including the National Port Strategy, the National Freight Strategy and more recently the Urban Transport Strategy; and (e) conducting pilot work on improving governance and developing rigour around evidence-based road funding. 


This bill fails to deliver on the coalition's promise to ensure better infrastructure planning and more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects. This is because the government do not want rigorous and transparent assessment of taxpayer-funded projects, because it is not in their own political interests. Unfortunately, the coalition government has a bit of form on politicising infrastructure projects. I quote from the Australian National Audit Office's performance audit of the Regional Partnership Program:


ANAO analysis revealed that ministers were more likely to approve funding for 'not recommended' projects that had been submitted by applicants in electorates held by the Liberal and National parties …and more likely to not approve funding for 'recommended' projects that had been submitted by applicants in electorates held by the Labor party.


Unfortunately, we have already seen from this government, which has been in power for less than a year, a similar willingness to skew projects towards their own electorates while cancelling projects in Labor-held electorates. A recent article in The Age highlighted that in the Abbott government's 2013-14 budget, of the new projects announced and funded, just under three-quarters were in coalition electorates. Monash University Professor of Transport Graham Currie was quoted in the article: 


Professor Currie said Australia's independent body for infrastructure decisions, Infrastructure Australia, was not being used by the current government to decide which projects to fund.


""The question is whether they want to be a professional government or they want to pork barrel, and whether we'll forge the idea of trying to be professional about how we manage resources or just do it on a political basis. 


""I don't think that's how a country should be run.""


I have to say that I agree with Professor Currie: I do not think that is how a country should be run either. 


The article also looks at the existing projects which have received more funding in the budget, including the— (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:57):  I rise to make a contribution in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 second reading debate. By way of starting, I followed the Infrastructure Australia debate through the Senate estimates process over a couple of years and noted with particular interest how much attention Infrastructure Australia received. In particular, its CEO, Mr Deegan, received a great deal of attention. I can concur with Senator Macdonald on at least one issue, and that is that Infrastructure Australia was well represented by Mr Deegan. He attended Senate estimates without a platoon or squadron of advisers and, in my view, was very forthcoming and forthright in his answers. So, for me, a rare moment of agreement with Senator Macdonald. 


I think it is worthwhile to go over the history of infrastructure and in particular Labor's history of infrastructure. I think that it was around 2005 that the Australian Labor Party announced it would establish Infrastructure Australia if elected. On 2 August 2007 the then leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd, detailed his plans for Infrastructure Australia, stating that it would have three divisions: one division to deal with policy and regulatory issues and drive reform on legal, tax planning and infrastructure finance matters; a division to audit the adequacy of the nation’s infrastructure, identify weaknesses and prioritise projects; and another division to evaluate the business cases of projects, project financing options, including private public partnerships, and to manage the probity process. So a reasonable person would conclude that that is not particularly skewed in any way; it seems like basic common sense. When you look at the Prime Minister's avowed intention to be the infrastructure PM, you would probably think that it was not a bad starting point, even though it was said by Kevin Rudd or set up by the then opposition. The average taxpayer and voter would expect there to be a business case, probity, an evaluation of projects and financing options. 


In Australia the responsibility for infrastructure is spread across the three tiers of government and the private sector, and so the burden of both funding and physical provision of infrastructure lies overwhelmingly with the states. The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and local government to fund infrastructure, but the states and local government are responsible for the physical provision. Now we have the private sector becoming increasingly involved in financing construction and operations. In that environment, surely you would start with a sound, logical and well-thought-out base—probity, evaluation, business case and those sorts of things. 


We know that Infrastructure Australia did an audit of all of Australia's infrastructure needs; that it did business cases and identified projects as ready to go. That would seem to be an eminently reasonable use of taxpayers' money and the use of good intelligence, good planning, good skills, good input from all sectors. I would have thought that was a reasonable basis for any government to go forward. But look at the coalition's policy of 5 September, where they claimed that only the coalition would deliver the infrastructure of the future. They deliver their claim:


If you vote for the Coalition, you know what we will deliver. We deliver infrastructure projects across Australia, including:


$6.7 billion to fix the Bruce Highway;


$5.6 billion to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway from Newcastle to the Queensland border;


$1.5 billion to get Melbourne's East West Link underway;


$1.5 billion for Sydney’s WestConnex;


$1 billion for the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane;


$615 million to build the Swan Valley Bypass;


$686 million to finish the Perth Gateway without a mining tax;


$500 million for the upgrade of Adelaide's North-South Road Corridor;


$405 million for the F3 to M2 missing link;


$400 million to upgrade the Midland Highway in Tasmania; and


$300 million for the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail freight line.


Some of those projects may have gone through the Infrastructure Australia process with no problem at all and some may well be among those projects earmarked ready to go.


There was a very clear, precise, well-thought-out base in Infrastructure Australia from which any government, whether we continued or the incoming Liberal government, could have simply gone forward using taxpayers' money in an eminently reasonable way by getting a business case up, getting the approval through, doing the necessary arrangements with state, local and private partnerships, if they were part of the equation. But we did not get that. During estimates I detected a great degree of antipathy for Infrastructure Australia, particularly from those senators from the National Party. I did not really understand at the time why they were asking about the view from the boardroom or how much the boardroom cost or how much was spent on lunch. All of these questions were designed to impugn or disparage the way Infrastructure Australia was conducting itself. If we delved into it a bit deeper, we may well come to the conclusion that politicians, being what they are—and I am one as well—would like the authority to spend money where they wanted them to. What Infrastructure Australia did was to put in some discipline: there had to be a business case, key performance indicators and it had to stack up in the national interest. The project had to be something very productive. 


One of the most productive outcomes for Infrastructure Australia is the Western Ring Road in Melbourne. The Keating government put about $550 million into it. It transformed the ease of access in Melbourne by freeing up congestion and helping people get around easier, but, more importantly, it put up the business case for someone in West Melbourne in an old site which constrained their efficiency being able to move when the ring road was in place. The value of the land in West Melbourne compared with the land around the Western Ring Road meant they could move for no cost. So they became more efficient, but they still could get to the port and their customers, and they had new premises. That is real productivity. Mr Abbott says in this document: 


I want Australians to spend less time in traffic gridlock on our roads and more time with their families.


That is fine; everybody wants that. These infrastructure projects cannot be assessed on the basis of traffic gridlock. They have to be assessed on the genuine economic prosperity they bring or open up. Very clearly, infrastructure projects like the Western Ring Road have demonstrably done that. That project took a long time to get off the ground and it is the subject of massive funding now—something like $2 billion is being spent on upgrading it. The ring road was built on a proper economic footing 


That is what this debate really should be about in this space—it should not be about pork-barrelling, or about allowing the Nationals to have more say on infrastructure. Why have we changed the way that Infrastructure Australia has operated? Has anybody been able to point to any startling failing in the way that it has completed its business? In the report by the Standing Committee for Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, the comments of Senator Sterle in his dissenting report are very pertinent:


In a short period, Infrastructure Australia has overhauled and driven lasting improvements to the way Australia plans, assesses, finances, builds and uses the infrastructure it needs to compete in the 21st century. To date its achievements include:


(a) completed the first ever infrastructure audit;


(b) put in place a National Priority List to guide investment into nationally significant projects which offer the highest economic—


most importantly—


and social returns – and the former government committed funding to all 15 projects identified as ‘ready-to-proceed’;


(c) developed national Public Private Partnership (PPP) guidelines to make it easier and cheaper for private investors to partner with governments to build new infrastructure;


(d) finalised long term blueprints for a truly national, integrated and multimodal transport system capable of moving goods around as well as into and out of Australia quickly, reliably and efficiently: the National Port Strategy, the National Freight Strategy and more recently the Urban Transport Strategy; and


(e) conducted pilot work on improving governance and developing rigour around evidence-based road funding.


So here we had an Infrastructure Australia that was doing a good job, and along came a new government and a new minister and—according to our Prime Minister, Hon. Tony Abbott—a prime minister who wanted to become known as the infrastructure Prime Minister—and the first thing he did was set aside, ironically, all of the infrastructure that was set up to deliver what he wanted, which is true economic and social outcomes worthy of this great nation in which we live.


The reality is that we have probably got down to a bit of pork-barrelling. Basically—and it is unfortunate—this decision seems to herald a return to decisions being made on the basis of politics rather than on the basis of true value for money for the taxpayer in Australia, or the true national interest. This might be dismissed as an idle concern, but I do not believe it is. Minister Truss was a minister in the former Howard government's Regional Partnerships Programme. That program was heavily criticised by the Audit Office—not by me and not by people on this side so much, but it was heavily criticised by the Audit Office and, clearly, it poorly prioritised road funding decisions. However, the projects involved here are much larger, and this minister will have new power to nominate projects for evaluation—perhaps not now that we have had some consideration of the Labor-inspired amendments. But will there be a less independent, less transparent Infrastructure Australia? I think that is clear. The model that was there was clear and transparent, and it was supported by the bus industry council and a number of other major contributors in this space. What we now see is less clarity, and less certainty about projects and about how they get up—will they really have the transparent tests applied to them? Will it all be published? Or will it be, basically, on the whim of the minister or his department?


What we thought were the strengths of Infrastructure Australia were its transparency, its independence, and its clarity. There was quite an interesting exchange between Senator Conroy and the new Acting Australian Government Infrastructure Coordinator, where the definition of a conflict of interest was brought into play. But with the departure of Mr Deegan, Infrastructure Australia has very clearly lost a bit of its mettle. It has lost a bit of its transparency. It has lost a bit of its strength—because Mr Deegan was not one for telling people what they wanted to hear. I am not saying that the person who has replaced him while he is on alleged gardening leave is saying what people want to hear. But aspersions were cast on the chain of employment that that person had, and on the fact that he may well go back to his previous job—which had people wondering a little whether he could really give truly impartial advice to the minister.


We do not want to say that the Deputy Prime Minister is out there to pork-barrel for his electorate; I do not want to say that anyway. And I do not really mind where the investments are in Australia, as long as they are based on the prudent guidelines that have been in existence for testing projects as to their propriety, their transparency, their economic worth to the nation, and the things that they bring to all of the population. Whether the project is in a National Party seat, a Labor seat or a Liberal seat, I think that if it has gone through the best possible process and can stand up in the cold, hard light of day as an independently arrived at decision, then that is where the investment should be. The Business Council supports the passage of this bill, subject to the amendments being made, or to the withdrawing of positions that give effect to ministerial powers to direct IA not to evaluate certain classes of projects. That clearly should not be in the minister's purview to say, 'Don't evaluate that', because you remove the transparency argument I have just put forward. On the requirement that IA can publish project evaluations and other information only when it is directed to: well, it should be publishing those things anyway; this is taxpayers' money. We pay tax, and we should be able to look, at the end of the day, at where those dollars are going. That should be transparent. And project evaluations should be openly available to all who want to see it.


These are the sorts of issues that had been fleshed out in the debate, and it is good to see that the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable Mr Truss, will agree to some amendments that put a little bit better case on the situation. But we cannot ever walk away from the fact that there is a significant amount of need for infrastructure in Australia, that there are significant taxpayers' funds invested in infrastructure in Australia, and that the federal government has the guiding role. One of the really disappointing things is this refusal to invest in urban transport. I have been a transport person all my life, and it was always road and rail. There is always a case for rail, and there is always a case for road, there is always a case for freeways and there is always a case for light rail and buses and the like. So, the fact that you steer all of your infrastructure dollars in one particular way may have the effect of skewing away from really good infrastructure in our cities. If a state government, local government or public-private partnership knows that the federal government will not involve itself or invest in urban public transport, then I think that is a bad move, which probably does not meet the transparency test, the real business case test.


We do need to look at roads—most particularly, around our major cities, to free up gridlock. If you look at the South Road redevelopment, it many save only six minutes per vehicle, but if that is 3,000 trucks that are saving six minutes every 24 hours then that is a huge boost in productivity. So, I fully understand that roads are very, very important. But I think it is equally important to recognise the whole transport network and that this government should build on the good foundations left to it by the previous government and have a clear, transparent Infrastructure Australia that has a degree of independence and transparency and delivers for Australia the productivity this country so richly deserves.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:17):  It is a great pleasure for me to rise and speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. I have known many trainspotters who have a fascination for rail and care about it, and I am thinking of a great friend of our family—my parents were Irish immigrants—Neville Wootton, who would be very pleased to know that his name is being recorded in this place today. He was a fan of the trains and did not live far from Toongabbie station.


An investment in rail and urban infrastructure in terms of rail is an absolutely vital part of our nation's mix moving forward. I second the comments of my colleague here in the chamber, Senator Alex Gallacher, who just made some points about the critical nature of Infrastructure Australia in making sure that that complex and important mix of different types of infrastructure build is constantly considered in a way that advances the entire nation.


But despite Uncle Nev's best efforts to interest me in rail, I have to put on the record that I am the daughter of a road builder; I am the sister of many road builders. And at this time of the evening—it is mid-winter—the lights will be off. Unless there is some emergency on a job and they have gone out and hired lights, probably from Camden Hire or some other agency that they use—another small business industry—they will be on their way home now, having participated in building the roads that will be a vital part of how our community moves around here in this state of New South Wales.


I grew up to be very proud of being a part of something that is national. I cannot tell you the pride that my father felt as an Irish immigrant with a very limited education but a great heart for work and a great interest in machinery. He shared with us his vision for what Australia could be when he spoke about his work on building the Bradfield Highway when he worked for Abignano. These sorts of things—this connection with building this country—is a powerful part of our sense of ourselves. Anyone who looks at the Harbour Bridge, whether it is celebrating Australia Day or celebrating New Year's Eve, anywhere around the world, can see that this is a country that had a vision for something powerful in terms of what infrastructure could deliver in advancing our nation.


What concerns me about the legislation that was put forward and is in such need of amendment is that it reveals a government that is backward-looking and miserly in its vision for this country, that is willing to carve out an entire sector of rail and that simply has not understood the way in which infrastructure captures the imagination of Australian people. The Prime Minister is playing at the edges, trying to claim the title of infrastructure Prime Minister. That is only authentic if you are actually going to outdeliver, outspend and outvision anybody who has done it before, and that is certainly not the case in what this Prime Minister is attempting to do, as revealed in this piece of legislation.


What concerns me particularly at this point in time is that infrastructure, under the piece of legislation that the government has put forward, is at risk of becoming a political plaything once again should this bill pass in its current form. Labor de-linked the infrastructure cycle from the electoral cycle. That was a very significant change. Right now we run the risk of the Abbott government returning us to the bad old days of pork barrelling, with Australians in Labor seats or Liberal seats or Nationals seats being left behind. But I fear that the whole construction of this piece of legislation is really to advantage the Liberal seats, even at the cost of the Nats. We are seeing that over and over in piece after piece of legislation coming through the Senate here in terms of education and health, as well now as infrastructure. Infrastructure decisions should not bend to political expediency. Infrastructure decisions should be blind to the electorate they fall in. If done correctly, good infrastructure decision making and investment will benefit every single Australian and not just those in the electorates in which they are funded and located.


It can be difficult for governments to overlook the benefits that may flow from such large expenditure, and we have seen that failure to have a vision for what infrastructure spending can do. We need to preserve this system that was instituted in the last parliament that clearly broke with former bad habits and established a transparent process to create a body which would auspice and determine in the national interest what is best for infrastructure—that body being Infrastructure Australia.


The hallmark of the previous Labor government was delivering nation-building infrastructure. We delivered what the Howard Liberal government refused to build for 11 years. I am just going to refer to the shadow minister's comments on Tuesday, 10 December, when he went through a list of some of the places that were the beneficiaries of the recommendations of Infrastructure Australia. I note many of my colleagues have made comments about the benefits for the electorate of the Leader of the Nationals in the other place, Warren Truss. He has benefited from many of these decisions. This is what the shadow minister, Anthony Albanese, said:


Thanks to the recommendations of Infrastructure Australia, here are some of the projects that the previous Labor government delivered: the Hunter Expressway … major upgrading of the Pacific Highway, worth $7.9 billion, through works including the Bulahdelah Bypass, the Kempsey Bypass and the Ballina Bypass, all opened by Labor; and the Bruce Highway, with funding of $5.7 billion, including work on what the now transport minister describes as the worst road in Australia, the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway.


He went on to say:


Minister Truss would know that because it is in his electorate. He just did not fix it during the 12 years in which he was part of the government.


That is the sad reality of a failure to have looked at the projects that needed funding and to have funded them during that period of great mining benefit to the country when we had money coming in. The Howard government simply lacked the vision and it certainly lacked to the structures to make powerful recommendations about the infrastructure that should have moved forward at that time in the national interest.


We came into government and removed the bottlenecks that the infrastructure-averse Liberal government would not. We did it to secure the productivity gains that drive jobs growth and we did it because we know that you have to invest in roads, ports, railways and airports. When in government it seems the Liberal Party just do not get this. They have an indelible belief that it should just happen and the private sector will make it happen, no questions asked. Or there is the alternative of grabbing the dollars and stuffing them into seats for sheer electoral advantage—the most disgraceful and uncompromising abuse of the power of government.


On this side of the chamber we know that the federal government needs to take a lead in making sure we have a unified and strategic vision about how we build our nation. To do that, Labor created Infrastructure Australia, which is the agency that is being debated at the heart of this piece of legislation. To be the holder of this vision, to remove the politics from these decisions and to do what is in the best interests of the nation is exactly what Infrastructure Australia was created to do and it is exactly what it has done. Let me just restate that: Infrastructure Australia was created to do exactly what we wanted in terms of having a region-blind and electorate-blind vision for advancing Australia's interests. It delivered exactly that.


But within a heartbeat of returning to government the coalition got on those Treasury benches and immediately wanted to take the reins and ride this horse of advantage into its own electorates. It seems that the coalition just cannot help itself except to see dollars in infrastructure as a place from which it can pork barrel. It wants to get rid of an independent body that provides expert advice and overturn a body, Infrastructure Australia, that was especially established to deliver an holistic approach. Instead the coalition just wants to dismantle it and feel free to cherry-pick projects that suit its political will. It is back to the bad old days when infrastructure was not an integrated process but simply a recipe for pork-barrelling.


This bill, without amendment, gives the government complete power and zero transparency. That is not even just on the big decisions. They also in this bill seek to micromanage time frames and the scope of audits and evaluations. The Labor Party will absolutely oppose this shift from transparency to a rule of darkness, hiddenness and uncertainty that smacks of self-interest and distortion of the national interest.


Infrastructure Australia deals with matters that should be open to scrutiny so that the people of Australia can see how the board works and see the projects of merit that it supports and advocates for. It is clear from the legislation it put forward that the coalition wants to weaken Infrastructure Australia by increasing the power of the minister to interfere in Infrastructure Australia's own evaluation processes. This government wants to be able to order Infrastructure Australia to evaluate particular projects nominated by the minister. Where is the transparency in that? The independent body of Infrastructure Australia should remain independent in the national interest. That is why we will oppose a piece of legislation that seeks to change that unless we have significant amendments to deal with the issues that I have raised.


Along with many of the other very positive aspects of Infrastructure Australia, the government proposes to scrap the tax loss concessions introduced by the Labor government in the 2012 budget. Labor's amendments to these bills will ensure that Infrastructure Australia retains the power to approve tax concessions for private sector co-investment in nationally significant infrastructure projects. This reform aims to increase private sector involvement in major projects. The government proposed that this role be undertaken by a delegate of the minister. Once again, instead of keeping it open and transparent, the government is pulling it back into the minister's realm so that, from on high, some lord, knight or elevated person of the realm can direct the traffic of Australia's infrastructure spending to their own gain and advantage. We cannot go back to that kind of a world.



Sitting suspended from 
18:30 to 19:30





Senator O'NEILL:
  Before the break I was speaking to the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 and pointing out some of the major problems of the coalition's approach to Infrastructure Australia—including the reduction in transparency with a return to the days where ministers can skew the process towards their own pet projects—and the concerns I have about undoing the fantastic transparency gains and the practical and genuine gains for the country of having a vision for infrastructure that extends beyond the boundaries of the immediate and the foreseeable future and beyond the boundaries that can be constructed around individual seats and people's particular interests. I put on the record a little earlier my particular interest in roads, but it is rail that matters, and ports. All forms of infrastructure, and their integration, are vital to the developers of the Australian nation. 


I am very concerned that this is a government that seems to have constructed for itself a very poorly defined set of rights around Infrastructure Australia, and such a poorly defined set of rights makes it very easy to sack people. They are giving themselves the power to dispose of advisers whose advice does not suit their political line. In addition to a failure to have transparency, they have constructed a model where they can get rid of advice that does not suit pork-barrelling of the kind that we saw the last time John Howard was in office. I am deeply concerned about the bill's provisions for allowing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to order Infrastructure Australia not to consider classes of infrastructure when it assesses the relative merits of infrastructure projects. The changes the coalition is seeking to what Infrastructure Australia was doing very well under the former Labor government will reduce transparency and take us a long way backwards. 


The federal government has explicitly ruled out funding for urban public transport projects such as the Melbourne Metro, Brisbane Cross River Rail, Perth light rail and Airport Link, and the Tonsley Park rail upgrade in Adelaide. To overtly signal that you are going to cut an entire section out of the development of Australia's infrastructure, to allow these changes to public transport to be excluded from Infrastructure Australia's scope, can only be seen as a negative and destructive view of the way complex and sophisticated infrastructure and infrastructure in the 21st century needs to be considered in order to advance the nation's interests.


For the coalition government to sit there and give themselves powers to exclude, for no good reason, an entire class of infrastructure can only lead to one thing—gaping holes, massive gaps, in the infrastructure that Australia will need in the future. We have seen the legacy of that from the Howard era, when we had a failure to invest in infrastructure that Labor had to make up for when we got back in. Under the coalition's proposal, expensive projects will be excluded, inconvenient projects will be excluded and projects against Liberal priorities will be excluded. This is not how any good governance model should operate, and it is certainly not the way to build a nation.


Labor's amendments to this bill are very important because they will allow infrastructure experts in Infrastructure Australia to be free to be the experts that they are—they will not have to take advice from a minister who may or may not have some family association with road-building, to which I have already owned up earlier in my speech. The reality is that the independence of Infrastructure Australia is critical to its success and our success as a nation. The problem is further exacerbated by the type of legislation this government have put before us because in the development of their legislation they did not listen to experts. In contrast, we have listened to very important stakeholders like the Business Council of Australia. They might know a few things about building infrastructure for the nation. There was also the Tourism & Transport Forum, the Urban Development Institute, public transport organisations such as the Moving People 2030 coalition—and Infrastructure Australia itself. All have called for enhancements to Infrastructure Australia, but not with additional powers for the minister to shape and interfere with the advice the government and the community will receive.


The explanatory notes for this bill state that the bill will strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia as an independent, transparent and expert advisory body through a change in its governance structure and through better clarification of its functions. The reality is that the minister opposed the creation of Infrastructure Australia and in this bill he now seeks to control it if it has bolted too far and he cannot completely get rid of it. He is attempting to weaken its independence by reducing scrutiny and independent advice—a backward move. This bill in its current form does exactly the opposite of what the minister is claiming it will do. Why would we be surprised to see that this is a government making an art form of saying one thing and doing another? I am hoping he is doing this because he does not understand the bill rather than because he is being purposefully deceptive, but people will have to make up their own minds about what is going on with this government that is hiding more and more from the Australian people.


Infrastructure planning is about the future—it is about the nation, it is about the community, and we want to build it. For that aim to be realised, a government needs a vision. Cutting, limiting, controlling and removing independent advice is not the sort of policy that is going to deliver a vision of anything good for this country. Under Labor, Infrastructure Australia conducted the first ever national audit of infrastructure needs. Anthony Albanese was, surprisingly and remarkably, the first minister for infrastructure in Australia. Can you believe we had been so unable to see the need for these measures? Since then we have seen an incredible delivery of investment in Australia and so much of our country has changed. We restored national leadership, we established Infrastructure Australia and we got on with funding the vital projects that changed this nation. Compared with the last full year of the Howard government in 2006-07, annual infrastructure spending under Labor in real terms was up by 50 per cent in the year 2011-12. Total public and private infrastructure spending over federal Labor's first five years in office was almost $250 billion—almost 70 per cent greater in real terms than the $150 billion spent during the last five years of the Howard government. 


There is a massive contrast with a limited, miserly and contained version of Australia that those opposite are seeking to force on this country, and the legislation as put by the government needs massive change. Labor believe in the vision of Australia—one that is brought about by transparency and openness. The coalition do not know that. They need to pay attention to our amendments and get on with doing a better job for this country. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (19:38):  It is an absolute pleasure to follow on from my colleague and friend Senator O'Neill, particularly after that passionate speech. I too want to make my contribution to the Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2013, and I think it is very, very important that we give a little bit of a history lesson to those who may be out there hanging on every word that is mentioned about this bill. Let's look at infrastructure.


Infrastructure can be a myriad of things, but it is about building this great nation. I come from a different angle, because infrastructure mainly is opening up our ports, our rail lines, it is talking about our roads, about public transport—about all sorts of things. As the deputy chair of the Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee, who undertook this inquiry, I do not want us to lose track of how infrastructure in Australia is funded. It is funded predominantly through the three tiers of government, being local—which in my opinion do a heck of a lot of the heavy lifting—state and federal. Up until the last few years, the funding of a lot of the infrastructure has predominantly been carried by the state governments. But what we did see in the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was massive injections of cash from the Commonwealth into numerous infrastructure projects throughout this great land.


I can give a quick history lesson on some of the nation-building stuff that was done in Western Australia when Minister Albanese had the carriage of the infrastructure and transport portfolio. It gives me grief that in this current government we do not even have a minister per se who is responsible for transport, or even for the word 'transport'. I do not know how seriously we can take that side of the chamber, and certainly Mr Abbott and his cabinet, if they cannot even appoint a transport minister. Fortunately we did have one, and we did very, very well. Some of the massive spends in Western Australia have delivered productivity gains that will last for generations to come, none more so than the Gateway project around Western Australia. For those who have not had the privilege of visiting Western Australia lately, there is construction equipment everywhere around the airport, and in the suburb of Kewdale/Belmont, where our domestic and international airports, our freight hub, our rail head, our warehouse and distribution centres are. This is where the bleeding heart of Western Australia's transport and logistics industry is situated. Finally we West Aussies are being dragged into the 21st century with some wonderful infrastructure initiatives implemented by the previous Labor government.


Let's have a look at how it all started. To do that we will have to go back to about May 2005, when the Australian Labor Party determined it was going to have this body called Infrastructure Australia. Then on 2 August 2007 the then leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd, detailed his plans for Infrastructure Australia. He said it would have three divisions, and I want to share with the chamber what these three divisions were. The first would deal with policy and regulatory issues, and drive and reform legal, tax planning and infrastructure finance matters. The second would audit the adequacy of the nation's infrastructure, identify weaknesses and prioritise projects. The third division would evaluate the business cases—a very important two words—of project financing, with options including private-public partnerships, and they would manage the probity process.


Unfortunately the clock is against me tonight. I reckon I could talk with a gobful of marbles under water about this for half an hour, but I am not allowed to, and I notice the shadow minister is in the chamber, so I will summarise my contribution very quickly. The last thing we would need, and which was the plan of this government, is to take away the opportunity for Infrastructure Australia to vet these projects. The danger is that allowing the minister the final say on any infrastructure programs could lead us to that shocking situation we were confronted with in the dying days of the Howard government. I cannot remember what the program was called—I think it was called Regional something, but it was commonly referred to as 'Regional Rorts'. 


I am not suggesting for one minute that Minister Truss would ever lower his standards to be in the same mould as the previous National Party minister at the time, Mr Anderson. I would make this very clear—Mr Truss is a man of integrity. He must be, because he has seen the common sense here. With Mr Anderson, we got to a stage in the dying days of the Howard government where a certain project worth quite a few million dollars was rushed through so it could deliver an ethanol project somewhere in his seat, I believe, or a Nationals seat—a $1.2 million grant which never ever delivered one single litre of ethanol. In fact, in that dark time of the regional rorting that was going on with National Party seats and some Liberal seats, some 16 grants worth a total of $3.5 million were approved in no more than 51 minutes. That is 51 minutes to approve $3.5 million. In the notes it says 'from 3.25 pm to 4.16 pm—by then Parliamentary Secretary—



Senator Fierravanti-Wells interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, through you—is that Senator Fierravanti-Wells endorsing rorting? Are you endorsing it? Are you endorsing rorting? Have you lowered yourself so far in the New South Wales Liberal right that you endorse rorting?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Order! Senator Sterle, ignore the interjections and direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator STERLE:
  I will, and thank you for that protection, Madam Acting Deputy President. I feel safer when you are in the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am glad you feel that, Senator Sterle.




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I think Senator Sterle should withdraw that. The point I was making was that, when Senator Lundy was the Minister for Multicultural Affairs, she took less time to sign off $14 million. That is the point I was making.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator STERLE:
  How embarrassing! Because it is getting late, I will just say that I do not support this bill. I am going to wrap it up there because there are other speakers who want to make a contribution. As I said, I challenge anyone on that side to have a public debate with me on infrastructure spending in this great country—how what was done under the Labor Party compares with the cloak-and-dagger stuff that is now being presented by Mr Truss and the Abbott government. Thank you very much.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:45):  Like many others, I have a number of concerns about the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 as it stands. The original intention of the bill was to provide Infrastructure Australia with greater autonomy, but the impact of the bill as drafted gives the minister far more control over the organisation's operations and reporting requirements than is appropriate. 


I think it is important to acknowledge that the government appears to have taken these concerns on board and has circulated amendments to address them. In particular, the amendments will remove that part of the bill which would have given the minister the power to declare certain types of projects off limits for consideration by Infrastructure Australia—and I think it was quite outrageous that that was ever in the bill in the first place. The amendments will also remove that part of the bill which would have given the minister the power to direct Infrastructure Australia in relation to the publication of information. While I acknowledge that this was intended as a positive power to allow the minister to require information to be published, I believe it is too open to abuse. I welcome the government's decision to remove this provision and I will be supporting the government's amendment in that regard. I think it improves the bill. 


However, I also believe that the amendments proposed by the opposition and the Australian Greens would improve the bill much further. In particular, I believe the requirement for the publication of cost-benefit analyses is very important. We have a duty to the Australian public to ensure that taxpayer funds are used efficiently and to the greatest benefit of the public. This amendment adds an extra layer of transparency and accountability. I will also support the opposition's amendment on 'nationally significant infrastructure'. I believe this is an important consideration when funding projects at a Commonwealth level and I support its inclusion in the bill. I also support the Australian Greens amendments on sustainability factors and public consultation. Both of these are vitally important considerations in the use of taxpayer funds and the quality and type of projects to be approved.


In addition, I will also be supporting the Australian Greens amendment on Infrastructure Australia providing advice on climate change issues that impact on infrastructure projects. There is no harm in doing so and I think it is particularly important in the context of Australia reaching its greenhouse gas abatement targets. Climate change is a very significant challenge. We need comprehensive strategies to address it across all portfolios of government. Taking into account carbon emissions, renewable energy and resource conservation must become part of policy on all levels. 


I support the government's aim to increase infrastructure funding through changes to Infrastructure Australia. These projects are vitally important for Australian jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Without support, and with the added burden of the closure of Holden, Ford and Toyota as automotive manufacturers in Australia, we are at real risk of causing a huge chasm in Australian manufacturing. The former Prime Minister's Taskforce on Manufacturing, in its August 2012 report, estimated that 950,000 people were employed in the sector and that it contributed eight per cent of GDP directly. That did not include the significant amount it contributes indirectly through flow-on effects to other businesses. It also contributed 29 per cent of Australia's exports, despite the high dollar. 


But the report also stated that, over the four years prior, over 100,000 jobs had disappeared from manufacturing. The report also estimated that another 85,600 jobs, at a minimum, would be lost in the five years following the publication of the report. That figure could well be significantly higher now, given that Ford, Holden and Toyota are planning to exit Australia by no later than the end of 2017—in Ford's case, they are planning to leave in 2016. If we lose our manufacturing sector, we will be at a global disadvantage. We will lose not only tens of thousands of jobs but also our self-sufficiency. That is why government supported infrastructure projects will need to play a vital role in supporting Australian manufacturing jobs and building the productive capacity of the nation. Unless it can operate independently and appropriately, Infrastructure Australia will not be able to play the role we so desperately need it to play. 


In summary, I support the bill—provided a number of amendments are passed to improve it significantly. In the absence of those amendments, the bill is fundamentally flawed. The amendments proposed by the opposition and the Greens are also, I think, worthy of support. I look forward to these amendments being debated further in the committee stage.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (19:50):  I propose to sum up for the government on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. The government fully supports Infrastructure Australia and its role as a key adviser to government on infrastructure projects and policy reforms. The government sees Infrastructure Australia's role as pivotal in its strategy to lift Australia's productivity. For this reason, the government has sought to strengthen Infrastructure Australia by establishing it as a more independent, transparent and expert advisory body through a change in its governance structure and better clarification of its functions. 


The Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill passed through the House of Representatives on 10 December 2013 and was introduced into the Senate the very next day. Since then, the bill has been subject to robust scrutiny through a Senate inquiry, the report of which was tabled in parliament on 17 March this year. That report recommended that the bill be passed in its original form. 


The business community indicated strong support for the bill. It did, however, suggest that Infrastructure Australia be provided with greater flexibility in three key areas: firstly, in the evaluation of infrastructure proposals; secondly, in publishing material appropriately; and, thirdly, in performing its function independently. The government has listened and responded to the business community's suggestions and has made three amendments to the bill. The amendments firstly remove the ministerial powers to determine a class of proposal that Infrastructure Australia must not evaluate. The opposition tried to make much out of this from the perspective of saying that it was all about public transport. Let me advise the Senate that the original intent of referring to a class of proposals was to exclude defence projects and projects seeking Commonwealth funding that was below the $100 million figure.


Secondly, the amendments remove the specific functions to be performed only when directed by the minister. The original intent of allowing for publication requests was to increase transparency to the public while striking the right balance with commercial confidentiality issues. By removing this reference it remains the responsibility of Infrastructure Australia to determine what it will and will not publish, in accordance with general law principles, including breach of confidentiality, the Privacy Act, and other common law principles, and of course the Freedom of Information Act.


Thirdly, our amendments remove the ministerial power to specify requirements related to the timeframe, scope and manner in which Infrastructure Australia must perform a function. Again, the original intent was to ensure that Infrastructure Australia would perform its functions in a timely manner and provide advice to the government on key policy issues of high priority. We know that Infrastructure Australia previously engaged in activities that were not part of their core functions. By removing this reference, the minister can provide directions of a general nature only.


These changes in part also address the opposition's key concerns. However, the opposition's amendments effectively keep the existing legislation as it is, and therefore do not empower Infrastructure Australia with the same level of independence as that proposed by the government.


Together with the new governance arrangements that set up Infrastructure Australia as an independent board, and abolish the role of the Infrastructure Coordinator, we are trusting Infrastructure Australia's judgment, as an independent body, to carry out its function suitably and according to the provisions the parliament has set.


I would like to emphasise that these changes do not affect the government's original commitments firstly to enhancing Infrastructure Australia's status as an independent statutory authority governed by a board; secondly, to abolishing the role of the Infrastructure Coordinator; thirdly, to establishing the role of a chief executive officer to be appointed to and report to the board; and, fourthly, to reforming Infrastructure Australia's key functions and asking it to undertake an audit of nationally significant infrastructure, and developing a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities. The bill still increases Infrastructure Australia's independence through its new governance structure, which will provide for an independent governing entity that is both legally and financially separate from the Commonwealth.


The bill still provides Infrastructure Australia with the remit to evaluate nationally significant infrastructure proposals and provide policy advice relating to the development of or investment in infrastructure, without waiting for a request from this government. The bill still better defines Infrastructure Australia's functions and deliverables so that infrastructure planning and prioritisation is improved on a national basis, providing a robust evidence based approach to allocating public funds to projects with the highest productivity returns. We are still holding Infrastructure Australia to account and ensuring that they assess projects seeking Commonwealth funding of $100 million or more, including those announced in the Infrastructure Growth Package.


In closing I would like to reiterate that through this bill the government is delivering on its commitment to broader infrastructure reforms. The reforms to Infrastructure Australia will help the government remain focused on delivering critical infrastructure, ensuring we are getting value for money, maximising productivity and building the infrastructure of the 21st century. These reforms are rightly provided for in this bill.


I thank senators for their contributions and I commend the bill to the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.


Question agreed to.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (19:57):  I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (19:57):  I will put a couple of general questions relating to the purposes of the bill. I would also like to acknowledge the amendments that Senator Johnston has just tabled. They actually go quite a long way, a remarkable way, towards quieting some of the concerns that have been expressed by those in the sector, by transport academics and by people who watch this area. So I would like to acknowledge quite genuinely that it is rare in this place to see errors as grievous as those contained in the bill not have to be shot out on the floor of the chamber but in fact moved by the government. It saves the opposition and the cross benches a great deal of time when a government of either political persuasion brings these amendments forward themselves.


Senator Johnston, I have a couple of general questions before we get into the substance and detail of the amendments that the Greens, the opposition and the government are proposing to move. Can you explain for us in simple terms why the Australian government has cancelled all funding for public transport and on what policy basis the Australian government has decided to get out of the business of funding urban rail infrastructure?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (19:59):  I think that question is a bit of a distraction and away from the bill, but the point is that the government has chosen where it seeks to augment and facilitate productivity and to enhance the Australian economy. We have acknowledged that road funding, which is an integral part of public transport, is a very important part of infrastructure that has been neglected.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (19:59):  I am also acknowledging, Senator Johnston, that this is not your portfolio. You are here in a representative capacity and you just have to make do with the best that your advisers can throw at you this evening. I found the answer profoundly unsatisfying. Are you aware of the productivity and economic benefits, agglomeration benefits and various other benefits in terms of quality of life and even just straightforward economic advantages of the Commonwealth funding public transport infrastructure? It is not only roads that have these benefits.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:00):  If we are going to be here talking about quality of life issues, I am sure that we are going to be here for the rest of the week. Can we get on with the amendments, please?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:00):  No, with great respect, I turned up tonight to do my job, not to make your life easy. Apologies if those two things sometimes come into conflict. Irrespective of expert advice, irrespective of the board of Infrastructure Australia and irrespective of Michael Deegan, the Infrastructure Coordinator, the government decided—or I should say, really, that the Prime Minister decided from opposition; he telegraphed it, no-one can say that they were surprised or they did not see it coming—that it objects to Commonwealth funding for public transport. The Prime Minister said, 'We should just look after our own knitting,' or some utterly bizarre words to that effect.


I do not understand why you would do that and it is directly relevant to this bill. The opposition has proposed sensible amendments that restore the independence of Infrastructure Australia, which you are proposing to take away. Why have you pre-emptively decided not to provide Commonwealth funding for an entire class of infrastructure?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:01):  Since you have drawn me into this discussion, let me tell you that, as you know, there was a Senate inquiry into this matter. The department, of course, gave testimony to that inquiry. It set out that it did not agree that the bill would limit the type of project to be evaluated by Infrastructure Australia and, in particular, its ability to assess public transport projects. The Australian Automobile Association also noted that it is neither the intent nor the practical impact of the bill to exclude proposals for investment in public transport. Gee, there is a revelation, Senator!


Furthermore, the department noted that the act currently provides for Infrastructure Australia to evaluate proposals for investment in nationally significant infrastructure only by ministerial request. In contrast, the bill would enable this function to be performed without a ministerial request, except in relation to proposals in the class determined by the minister under 5A(1)(a) and (2).

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:02):  I do not intend to tie us up on this matter all night, because the minister is clearly not enjoying himself very much. Could you just clarify for us: in terms of the law, as it appears that the bill will be amended by the opposition and by ourselves, it is entirely open to the board of IA to accept public transport proposals from the states and territories, to evaluate them and to provide that advice. Is it still possible under the government's new drafted amendments?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:02):  The board of IA is free to do that. It is free to apply the best methodological tools of analysis that they can, except that you have already decided that you will not be funding them under any circumstances. Is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:03):  Is it current Commonwealth government policy not to fund urban rail infrastructure?




Senator Conroy:
  It is just a coincidence they get nothing. You Greens are always into conspiracy theories.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I do not think it is a coincidence, I think this is policy. This is one of the few election commitments that the Prime Minister made that he has decided to uphold. Is it the case that the Australian government will not be funding urban rail infrastructure? That is a yes or no question.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:03):  What the government has done by saying that it will fund certain projects is to free up the states so that they can fund the projects of their choice. The rail projects that you are talking about are the sort of projects that the states are now more able to deal with themselves.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:03):  Senator Johnston, you are from Western Australia. You come from the same town as me. Are you aware that the Barnett government cancelled the Perth light rail project on the basis of the half a billion dollars' worth of funding that you took off the table?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:04):  For the record, can you just state this very clearly for us: you are not aware that that funding was cancelled on the basis of the Commonwealth taking that money off the table?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1

Senator Conroy interjecting—




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senator Conroy, when you have the call, please use it.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:04):  I am finding the interjections extremely helpful. I think the position here is fairly clear. I am sorry, Minister, that you have been lumbered with this dog and I recognise that this is not your portfolio. It is a shame—on behalf of everybody who believed the Barnett government when they said they were going to bring that project forward—that you ripped half a billion dollars out of it and the project collapsed.


That is why I am putting to you, in fact, that when you take that money off the table it does not free the states up to do other things at all. It means that these projects collapse. The Brisbane cross-city rail project has collapsed. Work on the Metro Rail project in Melbourne—and Senator Conroy will correct me if I am wrong—is dead in the water. Any extensions to Sydney's urban heavy-rail system is stuffed. In fact, what you have just told the Senate, which was that it would free up the states and territories to do that work, is actually directly the opposite of what is occurring. Will you undertake to advocate in your party room for a change of policy so that we can get these public transport projects back on the rails?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:05):  I know you have got an axe to grind on certain urban public transport projects, but the Western Australian government, the Victorian government and the New South Wales government have made very substantial contributions and provisions in their budgets—all recently announced—for such programs. This is in line with what I said to you about freeing up the funding for the states to have some flexibility to fund programs of their choice.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:06):  Can you name one urban rail project that is now going ahead in the absence of that Commonwealth funding, which I have just gone through in some detail? Just one?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:06):  I am told that in Brisbane there is an underground rail and bus infrastructure program underway.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:06):  They just got through the gate before you cancelled their funding. I might come back to that a bit later. I am not familiar with that project. I will come back to some general questions a bit later in the debate, but let's just get started on the running sheet. I bring forward the first Australian Greens amendment on the running sheet, which is schedule 1, item 8. I will put to the chamber what this amendment does, effectively, and seek opposition and government support. The current bill requires Infrastructure Australia to take into account forecast growth when it is conducting its audits to determine the adequacy, capacity and condition of nationally significant infrastructure. That is reasonable. The Greens simply seek to add 'consideration of economic, social, environmental sustainability' when Infrastructure Australia performs these audits. Infrastructure Australia is a small team. It is not a vast government department. It is a relatively small, very expertise based group of people. So, effectively, what they are doing is outsourcing to the states and territories the primary work. When projects are brought forward for consideration by IA, that work is being done in state planning and transport departments, energy departments or departments of water for that matter, depending on the project kind. 


Unless we embed these considerations in the process of conducting these audits to get a sense of where the major infrastructure gaps are, which is one of the most valuable functions that IA performs, unless we take into account the so-called triple bottom line of economic, social and environmental sustainability—conducted at the same time for the same piece of infrastructure and not done in separate silos—we are going to end up building the wrong stuff. In some parts of the country there has been a pretty sad history of doing exactly that. 


I commend the first Greens amendment on the running sheet that adds a second clause 'economic, social and environmental sustainability' when IA is conducting those audits. I commend that amendment to the chamber. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  I do not like to be terribly churlish here, but are you moving the amendments, Senator Ludlam?




Senator LUDLAM:
  Thank you for pulling me up on that, Chair. I seek some guidance and some commentary from the government and the opposition as to whether they will support this most worthwhile amendment. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (20:09):  Could I concur. It is a most worthwhile amendment, Senator Ludlam, and we will be supporting it. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:09):  The government is opposed to the amendments, because these considerations will be undertaken and will form part of the assessment, the cost-benefit analysis, by Infrastructure Australia. We see that they are not necessary and further legally complicate the legislation. They are logically and naturally part of the assessment. Why would we need to put them in the bill? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:09):  Minister, you might forgive the Greens for not taking you at your word when you say, 'Why would you omit economic, social and environmental sustainability when making infrastructure decisions?' You might not be too surprised that I do not take this government at its word that you would just automatically consider those things. The Prime Minister thinks climate change is absolute crap, and I will have a little bit more to say about that when we get to those specific clauses later in the evening. You do not have a very good record on this stuff—not you personally, Minister; but the government absolutely does not have a good record. In that case, I look forward to committing this amendment to the chamber. I move the amendment on sheet 7482 revised:


(1) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (lines 22 to 24), omit paragraph 5(a), substitute:


(a) to conduct audits to determine the adequacy, capacity and condition of nationally significant infrastructure, taking into account:


   (i) forecast growth; and


   (ii) economic, social and environmental sustainability;


I look forward to it passing to the House of Representatives, where the minister will be given a chance to have some second thoughts and hopefully come up with a better line of argument than you have, Senator Johnston, with great respect. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:10):  I appreciate this, but we have said that this bill is about independence. We are not going to prescribe to Infrastructure Australia the way in which they should go about doing their cost-benefit analysis. This is what the whole of this legislation is about—an independent, arm's length from government assessment. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  The question is that Australian Greens amendment to schedule 1, item 8, be agreed to: 


Question agreed to. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We will now move to the next Greens amendment. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:11):  As you have indicated, the second amendment on the running sheet is also an Australian Greens amendment. It is very similar to one that Senator Conroy will be moving shortly on behalf of the opposition—amendment (2). I will go through it, although I suspect Senator Conroy will prefer his own form of words. However, I will explain briefly what we are proposing, which is to insert into schedule 1, item 8, on page 5: 


… to review and provide advice on proposals to facilitate the harmonisation of policies, and laws, relating to development of, and investment in, infrastructure;


I presume that is reasonably straightforward. Again, I do not think we are teaching IA how to suck eggs here. We are creating some guidance and a framework for the kinds of things that need to be borne in mind so that we do not end up with a mish-mash, so that we do not end up, heaven forbid, with different rail gauges at the state and territory level. Heaven forbid that we could come up with something like that! I commend this amendment to the chamber. I will not be brutally offended if Senator Conroy believes that the opposition's form of words is better, but I believe in this instance that the Australian Greens have got it about right.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (20:12):  Could I take comfort from the fact, Senator Ludlam, that you have said that you would not be offended if we preferred our own amendment. I indicate that in this instance we are both driving to the very same place. We would probably prefer our words and so we will be supporting our words, but with very similar aims, as you have described.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:13):  I am more than happy to inform the chamber that this is not an amendment we would support, but we will not oppose it. Accordingly, if you ascertain that the opposition amendment is preferred, let us go that way. I will leave it up to you, Senator Ludlam, as to how you want to proceed. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:13):  Maybe for the purpose of simplicity I will withdraw the second Australian Greens amendment (2), schedule 1, item 8, and we can just move to the next one. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  As I understand it, Senator Ludlam, you had not actually formally moved it, so you do not need to withdraw it; it just lapses. 




Senator LUDLAM:
  As you wish, Chair. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator Conroy, we are now up to your amendment. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (20:13):  I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 7463 revised:


(2) Schedule 1, item 8, page 5 (after line 4), after paragraph 5(g), insert:


(ga) to review and provide advice on proposals to facilitate the harmonisation of policies, and laws, relating to development of, and investment in, infrastructure;


(gb) to review Commonwealth infrastructure funding programs and their alignment with Infrastructure Plans given to the Minister under section 5B;


This amendment to schedule 1, item 8, has the effect of retaining two functions that are already in the act. These functions are now to be exercised at the independent board's discretion. The first function relates to harmonisation of infrastructure laws, and this allows IA to look at ways of streamlining regulation around infrastructure investment. This provision is in the new bill but only at the minister's direction. This amendment makes exercise of this function a matter for IA itself. 


The second function relates to reviewing Commonwealth funding against IA infrastructure plans. This provision is in the current act. This amendment retains the function and makes exercise of this function a matter for IA itself. With these changes no functions under the act would require the minister's direction. This is consistent with the expert advisers on IA.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:15):  If (ga) and (gb) are together, we will have to oppose this amendment, because (gb) offends us. The Greens amendment was simply to (ga). If Senator Conroy would be pleased to move only (ga) there would be no problems, but both (ga) and (gb) would be an issue for us.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senator Johnson, can I clarify: you are opposed to opposition amendment (2) on sheet 7463 but you are not opposed to Greens amendment on sheet 7482?




Senator JOHNSTON:
  Chair, I will clarify. This amendment on sheet 7463 revised to schedule 1, item 8, is in two parts. Inserting (ga): 'to review and provide advice on proposals to facilitate the harmonisation of policies, and laws, relating to development of, and investment in, infrastructure', is not a problem. However, (gb), which is also part of that item, states: 'to review Commonwealth infrastructure funding programs and their alignment with Infrastructure Plans given to the Minister under section 5B'. We are opposed to (gb). If my learned friend Senator Conroy were to break them up and move (ga) only, we would not be opposed. But we are opposed to (gb).

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:17):  Madam Chair, I think Senator Johnson is entitled to have the two questions put separately. I would indicate on behalf of the Greens, for reasons that I put fairly clearly in relation to the amendment that I did not end up moving, that the Greens would support both (ga) and (gb). They are very similar and in alignment with what the Australian Greens were seeking to do. Again, it is not about tying Infrastructure Australia's hands. We are dealing with fairly talented people who know what they are doing. I think it provides guidance and a framework around getting more harmonised infrastructure investment at the assessment stage. I would be keen to know why Senator Johnson would want to pull (gb) out and oppose it in particular: 'to review Commonwealth infrastructure funding programs and their alignment with Infrastructure Plans'. If we are not doing that process of iteration and saying we produce these plans, then what was it that was chosen and funded? What happened when the politics intervened? Did we still basically get it right? I think that is a very important feedback process. I indicate now that the Greens will be supporting both (ga) and (gb), whether they are put together or separately.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:18):  As you can see, the wording of (gb) is to conduct a backwards-looking review. We do not want to do that. We want to look forward, creating infrastructure plans that will address future infrastructure needs. It is important to review funding programs, but we do not believe Infrastructure Australia is the relevant body for this particular function.

But, for the purposes of this discussion, we would prefer to stick with the amendment we have put forward.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:21):  The Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. I do not propose to rub Senator Johnson's nose in it. I think it is quite refreshing to have something like this come forward, based not only on the work done by the Senate standing committee but also I think fairly widespread and widely understood views in the community that this is the right way to go. If the opposition has thereby withdrawn its amendment to that effect, we can move through this reasonably quickly. 


Initially this was cause for us to vote against the bill in its entirety. I think Minister Truss has certainly recognised that this is about the independence. The last thing you want is for Infrastructure Australia to be told either, 'You have to evaluate this pet project that has fallen out of some political analysis about a marginal seat and someone wants to cut a ribbon before the next election,' or, 'You are precluded from evaluating an entire class of proposals.' That is what I was getting to before with a government's policy position that says that public transport no longer needs any kind of Commonwealth investment, even though these are very large—in some cases decades long and quite expensive—infrastructure projects that I think require a Commonwealth funding stream.


The government amendments also go to the fact that the minister would have been able to withhold the release of project evaluations that he did not like or that were politically inconvenient. Sometimes you are going to get inconvenient evidence from an independent body and you take the good with the bad; that is why we have these things. Keep in mind that Infrastructure Australia is not an executive body as such; rather, it is an advisory body. It provides to elected MPs—people who are accountable at least every couple of years—the benefit of its work. It is not actually a decision-making body so much as an advisory one. 


Nearly every submission to the Senate inquiry raised this section as a huge concern, including groups as diverse as the Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council, or ASBEC; the Urban Development Institute of Australia; the Committee for Melbourne; Consult Australia; and even the Business Council of Australia. As Senator Conroy pointed out before, if the Business Council is against coalition policy then you know you have got it very badly wrong. As I said, this would have allowed the minister to exclude classes of projects. I am not sure, and I do not think anybody is very sure, what the motive was for the coalition to attempt to introduce such radical powers to weaken—




Senator Conroy:
  I'm very sure. I smell pork.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Conroy, maybe you are just a little bit jaded. Maybe you are just a little more jaded than me; you have been here much longer than me, and my glass up here is still half full.




Senator Conroy:
  You've been elected twice.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Two and a half times.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Senators Conroy and Ludlam, please direct your remarks through the chair.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Nonetheless, as I said, these are sensible amendments that the government brought forward and the Greens will be happy to vote for them.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (20:25):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (6) on sheet 7463 together:


(1) Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 22), after item 6, insert:




6A


Section


3



   Insert:



   quarter means a period of 3 months beginning on 1 January, 1 April, 1 July or 1 October of a year.


(6) Schedule 1, item 8, page 5 (after line 19), at the end of section 5A, add:


(4) As soon as practicable after the end of each quarter, Infrastructure Australia must make a summary of each proposal evaluated during the quarter available on its website.


These amendments remove a further area of legislated ministerial interference from the bill. Item (1) defines 'quarter' within a year in a standard way. Item (6) uses that definition to require Infrastructure Australia to publish on its website summaries of proposals evaluated on a quarterly basis. These amendments are about transparency. Senator Ludlam, I saw the Senate seniority list recently and I am nearing the top, which is quite frightening really. But I have unfortunately witnessed many a National Party minister pork-barrel extensively. That is exactly why the minister sought to gut the independence of Infrastructure Australia. I smell pork. We should do everything we can to put the barbecue out.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:26):  We are opposed to both of these amendments. Firstly, with respect to 6A subsection 3, we do not think the definition is relevant and accordingly we are opposed to the insertion of 'quarter means a period of three months'. Secondly, we cannot support (6) either. The government considers that Infrastructure Australia should publish its evaluations in real time to assist industry and state governments address Infrastructure's findings in a timely manner. We do not want to restrict Infrastructure Australia in determining how and when it publishes such material.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:28):  The Australian Greens will be supporting both of these opposition amendments. It is just remarkable to hear Senator Johnston trying to justify opposing an amendment that would make a summary of evaluated projects live every quarter. What exactly is the problem with that? Infrastructure provision is not necessarily just best left to some kind of closed cabal of so-called experts. That is partly because this is taxpayers' money being expended and partly because people in regional and local communities have to live with the decisions that you make, such as dropping freeways over their backyards, putting coal rails past schools, choosing to extend an electricity grid to a particular region or choosing not to, or provision of clean water. People have to live with these decisions. I find it remarkable that the government would oppose much more frequent updating and publication of the progress of evaluations in some of these audits. I congratulate the opposition for bringing these forward. Again, they are similar to amendments that the Australian Greens had proposed. We are very happy to support them.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Boyce
):  The question is that opposition amendments (1) and (6) on sheet 7463 revised be agreed to.


Question agreed to.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  We now move to Australian Greens amendment (5) on sheet 7482.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I move Greens amendment (5) on sheet 7482:


(5) Schedule 1, item 8, page 5 (line 28), after ""productivity"", insert "", liveability and sustainability"".


This is a reasonably simple amendment that proposes to insert after 'productivity' the words 'liveability' and 'sustainability'. This is similar in intent to amendments that we moved before that were not supported by the government, but I am pleased to say they were supported by the opposition. If we imagine that infrastructure provision is best decided as though people live inside spreadsheets, that everything can be quantified and that really economic productivity is the only factor that you should pay attention to, then we will end up making very bad decisions. We have a history of doing exactly that. Yes, productivity is extremely important, although I wish the government would pay as much attention to energy and water productivity as they do to labour productivity. If they did that, it would lead to something of a revolution in the way infrastructure is designed and delivered. But, nonetheless, it is still an important factor that needs to be borne in mind. The Australian Greens would argue that so is liveability for host communities and the people who actually have to live with some of these decisions and sustainability, in the broadest sense of the word, whether we are building obsolete infrastructure or infrastructure that is fit for purpose in the 21st century. That is the intent of this amendment.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (20:32):  I move opposition amendments (7) and (8) on sheet 7463 together.


(7) Schedule 1, item 8, page 5 (after line 32), after paragraph 5B(1)(b), insert:


   (ba) includes a cost benefit analysis of each such proposal; and


(8) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (lines 7 to 12), omit subsections 5B(2) and (3), substitute:


(2) A plan must cover a period of 15 years from the time the plan is prepared, or such other period as the Board determines.


(3) A cost benefit analysis included in a plan as mentioned in paragraph (1)(ba) must be prepared using the method approved by Infrastructure Australia. The method must enable the proposals to be compared.


(4) A plan must be prepared under this section every 5 years, or at such other intervals as the Board determines.


(5) Within 14 days of a plan being given to the Minister, the plan must be made available on Infrastructure Australia's website.


These amendments relate to the proposed infrastructure plans which Labor supports; indeed, IA already has plans. Item (7) requires cost benefit ratios to be produced for proposals relating to IA's priorities alongside productivity gains and other newly prescribed matters. Item (8) gives the IA board the discretion to decide on planned horizons of longer or shorter duration—of up to 15 years at their discretion—and similar for revisions of more or less five years. This item also requires the publishing of IA plans as called for by many stakeholders, including the BCA. Our amendments provide meaning to cost benefit analysis by requiring IA to develop a process whereby published cost benefit analyses are capable of being compared. 


On item (20) we are giving precedence to Senator Ludlam's amendments, but I will detail ours briefly. Item (20) improves transparency by requiring IA to publish annually the method and weightings it uses in its standard cost benefit method. This allows interested parties to understand and constructively debate how IA arrives at its project rankings. This is a healthy reform that helps states, proponents and the public understand IA's approach to project recommendations. These amendments are consistent with both independence and transparency. As I indicated, we are deferring to the Greens' item (15). I withdraw amendment (20).

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:35):  We need to state that we are opposed to (7) and (8), because this is a mixing up of the purpose of the plan with project proposals. Cost benefit analysis should not be undertaken in the plan. The infrastructure plan is not about individual projects and therefore it would be ridiculous to do a cost benefit analysis on a broad plan, if you follow me. Similarly, the 15-year plan was an election commitment in (8). Infrastructure Australia needs to be tasked with it, and the board should not be in the position to determine whether or not it does this. We are opposed to those and I will foreshadow that we are opposed to the Greens' amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:35):  Even though the Greens' amendment is an absolute cracker, I indicate that we will support opposition amendments (7) and (8), and I will foreshadow that for that reason I will withdraw the forthcoming Australian Greens amendment (6) and (8) respectively, as they are again very similar in intent. I might speak to those when I get to speak to my other amendments, but in the meantime I am happy to support these two from Senator Conroy.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendments (7) and (8) be agreed to.


Question agreed to.




Senator LUDLAM:
  I withdraw Greens amendments (6) and (8), as amendments to that effect were just carried by the Senate on behalf of the opposition. Amendments (9) and (15) are very different amendments and I am happy for the questions to be put separately, even though I understand I have opposition support for both of them. I move Greens amendments (9) and (15) on sheet 7482 together:


(9) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (after line 12), at the end of section 5B, add:


(6) Infrastructure Australia must cause the method approved under subsection (3) to be reviewed:


   (a) no later than 6 months after the commencement of this section; and


   (b) every 24 months after that first review.


(15) Schedule 1, item 39, page 17 (line 15), at the end of section 39C, add:


   ; (d) details of each method of preparing cost benefit analyses approval of which was in force under subsection 5B(3) at any time during the year, including the weight required to be assigned to each factor the method required to be taken into account.


These are both very important amendments. The first one, amendment (9), goes to the method of cost-benefit analysis that is undertaken, and this, really, is what the decisions that get made hinge upon—or at least the decisions that get published by way of advice from Infrastructure Australia to the minister.


What we think needs to be addressed—and these two amendments give effect to this—is firstly, that the cost-benefit analysis methodology that is used, not by IA but by proponents who are bringing some of these plans and proposals forward, is grievously flawed. We see this time after time, for example, in justifying urban freeway projects, and you might wonder how it is that, against the catastrophic cost of installing multi-lane urban freeways through existing communities and urban fabric, somehow a cost-benefit analysis can come back—if you are cooking the numbers—and say, 'The benefits of this freeway can amount to billions and billions of dollars.' You might wonder how on earth those benefits are calculated. It is relatively easy—and we ran into this problem with the National Broadband Network—to calculate the costs of an infrastructure project, because we have been doing it for decades. But how on earth do you calculate the benefits? You can add up the costs—the cost of materials, the cost of labour, the cost of planning—but calculating the benefits of these things is inordinately difficult. And if project planners want the foregone conclusion to be that the urban freeway takes precedence over the urban rail, they just fudge figures and make numbers up, and effectively say, 'All that time that you will be spending zooming along the open road—now that we have decongested the freeway—adds up to billions of dollars in time saved because you got to work quicker.' These numbers are just pure hallucination. They mean nothing. What the Australian Greens want, as the amendment says, 'no later than six months after the commencement of this section' and then every 24 months after that first review, is to look at whether the cost-benefit analyses are actually performing for us—against social, environmental and economic costs and benefits—not simply performing an accounting trick that, in fact, you could get to deliver whatever result you wanted. A couple of years back, a Professor Henry Ergas—



Senator Conroy interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  who Senator Conroy has some familiarity with, frustrated that the Australian government, with the support of the Greens, had not undertaken a CBA of the National Broadband Network, undertook to do it himself. Again—




Senator Conroy:
  In three days!




Senator LUDLAM:
  In three days; indeed. Again, you can calculate the cost of an infrastructure project because it is mostly hardware, and you can come up with an idea of the cost. To calculate the benefits of network infrastructure, you just need to make things up—and the results you get are entirely sensitive to your input assumptions and to how you weight them. We have no idea how Professor Ergas weighted his, but he came back with an imaginary number that said: 'Actually, don't bother: the costs of building the NBN exceed the benefits, so just don't bother.' And that is the kind of cooking of the books that we want to try and avoid. Because these numbers carry such weight—they carry political weight, they carry economic weight; they carry enormous weight inside Treasury where decisions are made as to whether things will get funded or not—it means that the method of evaluation must be as transparent as possible, it must be reviewed, and it must take advantage of best practice elsewhere. Australian authorities and communities are not the only ones grappling with these very questions. The amendment proposes that that report—six months in, and then every 24 months after that—be placed on Infrastructure Australia's website, unredacted, within 14 days.


Amendment (15) is equally important. It proposes that the details of each method of preparing the CBA approval which was in force, including the weight required to be assigned to each factor, be taken into account. We want to see that published. That is the purpose of this amendment. How did you weight it? How big was your imaginary number—derived from the magic of being able to drive very rapidly down a new eight-lane freeway that has no traffic on it? It is fine that you have to come up with monetised factors to be able to weigh the scales of costs and benefits, but at least let us know what were hard data and what was pure fantasy. This is a very important amendment. I am very glad, I believe, that we have opposition support for it. I hope Senator Johnston has been persuaded, by the clarity of my argument, that probably one of the more important things we will do tonight is to provide a bit of a spotlight on the way that CBAs are undertaken in this country, so that we might actually get a little bit more honesty into the process. We have created that rolling review process precisely so that our methodology stays up-to-date as practice around the world improves. I commend these two amendments to the chamber.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:42):  I would like to say that we are opposed to each of these amendments. The folly here is that we are linking a cost-benefit analysis to the plan; it is the project proposal that is subject to the analysis, and that methodology and that system are set out clearly on the website. I should remind senators that this system has been in place and working successfully, to some greater or lesser extent, for the past six years. I find it a little ironic that we are going to make these sorts of amendments. The government is opposed to these amendments.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:43):  I move Australian Greens amendment (7) on sheet 7482:


(7) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (after line 4), after subparagraph 5B(1)(c)(ii), insert:


   (iia) deliberative engagement and consultation with local communities; and


   (iib) principles of integrated design; and


This is an important amendment; in fact, it goes to the heart of the Australian Greens' wish and our vision to democratise infrastructure. If there was one single thing that we could do to improve legislation like this, and to improve what gets delivered to communities and to people who have to live in areas that these decisions impact, it would be to democratise the way that infrastructure is done. At the moment we have state planning and transport departments, with very uneven records of delivery, putting forward pet projects, sometimes in a bit of a rush, which Infrastructure Australia then has to basically just make the best of, as best it can. And when these projects hit the table, whether the projects be transport, electricity, water or telecommunications, IA has almost no visibility at all of whether there is community consent; whether there is social licence; whether there are huge mobilisations—like hundreds and hundreds of people turning up to commit to stopping the Roe Highway extension through the Beeliar wetlands. That is one example that is very close to home; I hope that part of the world is as precious to you, Senator Johnston, as it is to me.


If you were to embed—not at the IA level but upstream, at the level where state and territory authorities are working out what kinds of processes to bring forward—not just some kind of brief obligation to consult at people, to tick boxes, to hold poorly advertised meetings late at night in faraway places that no-one turns up to and then take that as evidence that people do not care, but deliberative engagement with people, bottom-up planning processes where you actually go into the communities and say: 'What do we need? What kind of infrastructure is in demand here?' then you get a smarter answer. You get the wisdom of the crowd, and you get better proposals that come forward.


The second subclause here, (iib), speaks of the principles of integrated design. For the benefit of the record, I just want to go into a brief amount of detail as to what we mean by that. This was a Labor Party idea. The model I am most familiar with was brought in by Premier Mike Rann in South Australia—the introduction of an integrated design commissioner within the office of the Premier, who went precisely to these issues that I am talking about: deliberative engagement and planning, an integrated infrastructure provision to improve communities. They did extraordinary work before they were closed down and their expertise was distributed through the Public Service and some very good people moved on. I want to acknowledge Tim Horton as the integrated design commissioner in SA. This is a model that I think we would be very wise to adopt around the country. I would love to see something like this in Western Australia. If those principles are adopted, you do not get the community action groups waving placards; you get consent, you get social licence, you get better projects up. So I commend this Australian Greens amendment (7) to the chamber.

(10) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (after line 22), after paragraph 5C(b), insert:

   ; (g) the delivery of infrastructure projects.


(12) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (after line 29), at the end of section 5C, add:


(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(g), Infrastructure Australia may evaluate the delivery of an infrastructure project, including evaluating:


   (a) the delivery against any targets set before or during delivery; and


   (b) any relevant assumptions made before or during delivery.


(3) Infrastructure Australia also has the function of promoting public awareness of the matters mentioned in subsections (1) and (2), including by publishing information on its website.


These amendments relate to the existing areas of general infrastructure provided by IA. Item (10) retains policy issues arising from climate change. The government has tried to take this out. Labor proposes to retain it and leave it to IA to determine how to provide that advice. Item (11) adds a new area of advice sought by several stakeholders, the ability to conduct ex post analyses of projects to compare assumptions at the start with the actual process of delivery—what went right, what went wrong—so that all interested parties can learn and improve project delivery. Item (12) provides greater detail on these reviews and adds a role for IA to provide public education on part 5C advice matters via its website. IA effectively plays this role currently. Item (9) is a consequential renumbering. Once again, these amendments enhance independence and transparency.

'We cannot support the direction that the opposition'—and I should say the crossbench—'wants to take the bill in'—in the direction of greater transparency and climate literacy. Senator Johnston, climate change actually is a thing. It really actually is a thing. It does exist. I know it is hard to believe, but it actually really does. And I will indicate at the outset that the Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments. I do not think the Labor Party goes nearly far enough, so I will have a bit more to say about climate change, as, I suspect, will Senator Milne, when we come to move the next Greens amendment. My understanding is that what the Labor Party has sought to do here is simply reinsert the existing language from the existing act and put it back in where it belonged—that is, up to date, to this time—and that it has had climate change as one of the material factors it needs to evaluate when it is seeing projects roll in. That washes back through the states and territories so that they know that this is something that Infrastructure Australia cares about even if they do not and that they need to make an effort to justify it—not simply mitigation, but adaptation as well. Is this project going to survive the age of climate change? Does it massively increase greenhouse gas emission? It is not perfect. I do not think it has worked particularly well, which is why the Australian Greens amendments go so much further. But it is extraordinary that the coalition sought to remove it as a material fact. What is it about this government that has washed out the Public Service, the experts, everyone from CSIRO to the Bureau of Meteorology and bowled over ARENA, smashed up the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, changed the renewable energy target. What are you doing? And, more to the point, Senator Johnston, why are you doing it?

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (20:50):  Obviously Senator Ludlam does not understand what is currently going on, because climate change can only be considered upon ministerial request now. That is a pretty important difference to where we want to take the legislation. We have said that the function under our disposition can be undertaken under section 5C—that specific reference to climate change is not necessary as it is already covered in 5C(b) of the bill. What we have said is that this is an improvement, so that Infrastructure Australia, of its own motion, can proceed. But obviously we are going to agree to disagree on this, and we must oppose these amendments.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:59):  I move Greens amendment (10):


(10) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (after line 22), after paragraph 5C(b), insert:


   (ba) climate change, as it relates to infrastructure, including the following:


      (i) the economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change;


      (ii) prioritising infrastructure that would assist with adapting to, or mitigating, climate change;


      (iii) the role of infrastructure in decarbonising the economy;


      (iv) the impact of infrastructure decisions on the achievement of national and international targets to limit global warming;


As I acknowledged before, the opposition amendment that the Greens just supported in part reinserts the language that the government had in its infinite wisdom around climate-related matters chosen to delete. We have put that back in. It is the Australian Greens view that the legislation does not go nearly far enough, and that climate change has to be front and centre in all relevant aspects of government policy, including, crucially, infrastructure provision, which has a life span if you are considering road-rail projects, water infrastructure projects or power projects well into the 2030s, 2040s or 2050s. We are basically living in a different kind of world and potentially in a different geological age. That is the reason we propose much stronger language in this bill around the way that Infrastructure Australia evaluates the advice that it gets on climate change and that it then in turn provides to the government. 


The amendment we have proposed goes further than where for some reason the Labor Party has seen fit to land by saying, first, that climate change as it relates to infrastructure includes the economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change; and, second, prioritising infrastructure that would assist with adapting to or mitigating climate change—in other words, moving it up the merit order because it is going to be so important in protecting communities and protecting the economy and protecting the environment as it attempts to adapt. Third, there is the role of infrastructure in decarbonising the economy. I am probably as guilty in this respect as anybody. We have spoken at length about public transport but infrastructure is, among other things, the electricity grid that keeps everything moving. As I said in my second reading contribution, the role of infrastructure in urgently decarbonising the economy is a massive principle—you could say it is primary. That has to be front of mind for those assessors in Infrastructure Australia when they are considering which projects should be granted billions of dollars of funding and which should not. Finally, there is the impact of infrastructure decisions on the achievement of national and international targets to limit global warming. As everybody in this chamber is aware, except those who have chosen to simply blindfold themselves to what is going on, the infrastructure decisions that we make are locked into very long lead times. For example, if you build a coal-fired power plant today its investors will be assuming it will still be operating in the 2040s or 2050s, long after this technology will need to have been phased out if we are to have any chance at all of coming to grips with what is occurring all around us.


If on the one hand we have climate negotiators at international conferences arguing that Australia is doing its bit, as the rest of the world is now starting to do, and adopting very stringent targets around carbon reduction, eliminating the sources of emissions that are doing so much damage, we cannot at the same time have an industry portfolio and an infrastructure portfolio making long lead time capital investment decisions over 40 or 50 or more years that make it completely impossible to meet those targets. That is something that Infrastructure Australia needs to be very aware of when it is prioritising and choosing what to recommend and put forward. I hope Senator Conroy will have had a profound change of heart. I know he has been concentrating intently on my contribution, as I am sure Senator Johnston has. This amendment should be passed into law tonight.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (21:04):  At the time the first infrastructure bill was put through the parliament the Australian Greens were part of the consultation and the original language about addressing climate change was part of what was determined at the time. Many years have gone by since then, and the Australian experience has demonstrated that the failure to take climate change into account in infrastructure proposals that are either coming forward or in Infrastructure Australia's assessment suggests we need to go to something much more significant. Let me go to the first point in the amendment—the economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change. Let me take Roma as an example. We have had the shocking flooding in Queensland and we have had terrible storm damage as well. If the levee issue had been addressed in Roma in 2005, the estimated cost at the time would have been $20 million. Subsequent to that, since 2008, $100 million has been paid out in insurance claims in Roma and since 2005 over $500 million has been paid out by the public and the private sector for the repair bill. That is just one example where, if we had taken the climate predictions and scenarios seriously and moved in and built the infrastructure we needed to build when it was needed, we would have saved not only incredible distress in that community caused by the flooding; we would have saved an enormous amount in terms of infrastructure costs and replacement.


Over that period of time, we have seen: in January 2009, the Far North Queensland floods; February 2009, Victoria's Black Saturday; April 2009, Northern New South Wales flooding; May 2009, the Queensland storm damage; December 2009, bushfires in WA; March 2010, Western Queensland floods; March 2010, storm event in Melbourne; March 2010, storm event in Perth; December 2010, Queensland floods; January 2011, Victoria floods; February 2011, Cyclone Yasi in Queensland; February 2011, storm event in Melbourne; February 2011, Perth bushfires; November 2011, Margaret River bushfires; December 2011, storm event Melbourne; January 2012, floods in South-West Queensland; February 2012, floods in New South Wales and Victoria; January 2013, Tasmanian bushfires; January 2013, New South Wales bushfires; January 2013, storm event in Queensland; January 2013, storm event in Northern New South Wales; October 2013, New South Wales bushfires; January 2014, Perth bushfires; April 2014, Queensland cyclone.


That is what we are now seeing with extreme weather events, and with their intensity and cost. That cost goes to billions in terms of the infrastructure repairs, not to mention the insurance costs and the fact that several people in those communities have subsequently not been able to get insurance for their homes and businesses. When this goes to further infrastructure, we have had railway lines buckle in extreme heat; we have had roads wash away; we have had energy systems brought down and real risks of mega-blackouts and brownouts because of loss of energy infrastructure in the course of those extreme weather events.


The question has to be asked: at what point is Australia going to recognise that for Infrastructure Australia, assessment of projects has to include the worst-case scenarios for climate adaptation? A moment ago my colleague Senator Ludlam spoke about decarbonising the economy, which is essential. Let me give you the example of the bushfires in Victoria—sparking from overhead powerlines was one of the main causes of huge loss of life. Significant recommendations have come from the royal commission that in order to remove those risks, powerlines need to be undergrounded or, alternatively in some places, to cease and to not have the infrastructure going out there. Instead have renewable energy systems that are decentralised, so you are actually protecting the communities but stopping the potential for sparking in between. That is the kind of anticipatory action that the Victorian government, together with the power companies—the distribution and transmission companies—should have been bringing forward to Infrastructure Australia to look at reducing fire risk and cost in the longer term in Victoria. Those actions give you competitiveness in terms of power supply, more safety in terms of fire, and less in infrastructure costs. They are the sorts of things you need to be considering. 


The other point with infrastructure was made very strongly by CEDA in a recent report: that there is a very real risk that Australia will be bypassed for the foreign capital that is necessary to fund infrastructure in this country, because the international capital flow is going to go to countries that are dealing with the real risks associated with climate change, that are decarbonising the economy, and that are building the kinds of infrastructure that will serve a decarbonised economy into the future. By going in the wrong direction and not putting these climate considerations at front and centre, Australia stands to be effectively bypassed by international capital, because that capital will assess climate risk in any project. It is not just the climate risk in terms of the loss of that infrastructure; it is climate risk in terms of whether that infrastructure becomes a stranded asset—sunk and dead capital into the future. There is no doubt in my mind that there are plenty of ports up for proposal in Queensland that will end up as stranded assets if they are built, not to mention the coal railway lines and the mines that are being considered.


In recent times there have been several cancellations with regard to major infrastructure projects in Queensland—not least of which is a big port—because international capital has been withdrawn from the projects on the basis that it is likely to be a stranded asset. Given that the Chinese are going to cap their climate emissions and their use of coal, anyone who invests in a coal port in Queensland is sinking their money into a dead hole and an asset divested from major pension funds and other funds around the world. If there is one thing Infrastructure Australia really needs to be looking at, it is those two essential elements—the costs to infrastructure into the future of a changing climate and the frequency and intensity of weather events; and, secondly, how Australia is going to fund the infrastructure that will lead to the decarbonisation of the economy and to attracting foreign capital into that infrastructure assessment. That is where I feel Australia is going to get further and further behind unless we actually deal with this. That is why I argued at the time that the one-off flood levy was a bad mistake—we should have a permanent fund which looks at doing preventive investment in infrastructure so we can minimise risks to people and property, minimise costs into the future and bring down and control insurance premiums.


Our failure to have done so has left us exposed very badly. I know the coalition does not care about this and is prepared to keep on seeing people end up with their houses devalued—there are places on the New South Wales coast now where if you are on the flat and subject to storm surge, your insurance premiums are so high that the value of your property is now really diminished compared with properties on the same street that are much higher up. It is becoming pretty obvious to people everywhere that failure to take this seriously is something that every Australian is going to be confronted with. The government could move to get some futuristic scenario planning and serious risk assessment done, rather than to pretend it is not happening, to pretend it is a one-off and to pretend that every time it happens we will somehow find the money to deal with it.


I strongly recommend this amendment to the Senate. It makes absolute sense to protect this country as best we can from damage, and to anticipate where we need to spend money and how we need to spend money (a) to create more jobs and investment; and (b) to protect communities from the ravages that are coming.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that amendment (10) on sheet 7482 be agreed to.


Question negatived.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (21:15):  I move Greens amendment (11) on sheet 7482:


   (11) Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (line 29), at the end of section 5C, add:


   ; (h) the impact of infrastructure on local ecological services and ecosystems;


(i) peak oil and resource depletion, as they relate to infrastructure;


   (j) the contribution of infrastructure to the liveability, productivity and sustainability of Australia's cities and regions;


(k) the impact of infrastructure on the social amenity of local communities;


   (l) social license from local communities for infrastructure projects.


We have dealt, I think, rather casually with climate change, given that neither the government nor the Labor Party supported the Greens amendment that would have given that clause some teeth. Nonetheless, climate considerations aside, there are a significant number of other issues that we think have had insufficient evaluation by Infrastructure Australia when it is considering projects. Again, this is not laying it all at IA's door, but this amendment would send the signal out to the planning community and to the state and territory governments and departments that, when they are pulling their projects together for a priority listing, if they want a favourable response from IA, these are the things they need to include and incorporate. It should not be too much to ask.


Senators are free to see Greens amendment (11). We have circulated it. What it puts in place is, firstly, the impact on local ecological services and ecosystems. This can be as simple as, for example, new sea walls or as important as modifying coastal environments, which can have catastrophic and largely unforeseen effects. 


The amendment also requires coverage of peak oil and resource depletion. This is one of the areas where I had—although I respect him greatly for his independence and his intellect—dust-ups over a period of six years with Mr Michael Deegan, the Infrastructure Coordinator. The dust-ups were over Infrastructure Australia's methodology for working out what the future price of oil was going to be. Working in a carbon constrained future does not simply mean dealing with the pollution impacts of carbon emissions from the coal, oil and gas sectors; it also means dealing with the depletion aspect. This idea that we are just going to continually double up freeway infrastructure, for example, as though there is an infinite amount of oil on the planet, is mad. That kind of calculation needs to be factored into the way IA contemplates its prioritisation of infrastructure projects.


The item on 'the contribution of liveability, productivity and sustainability' is starting to feel a little on the doomed side—because that language has already been rejected by Labor and by the government. The impact on social amenity and the social licence from local communities for infrastructure projects—some of that is often forgotten. Is Prime Minister Abbott proposing to simply send bulldozers down people's streets? In the cases of the WestConnex project in New South Wales, the east-west tunnel in Victoria and the so-called Perth Freight Link—which proposes to smash tarmac through the Beeliar Wetlands and disrupt communities from one end of the City of Perth to another—these projects have no social licence. At one end of the spectrum, that simply means that these projects end up being significantly delayed or much more expensive than they should have been in the first place. At the other end of the spectrum, you end up with effective community opposition to projects that end up being stopped—a lot of planning resources and expertise and a lot of money wasted, and communities being forced on the defensive to fight repetitive acts of stupidity that they simply should not have to. That is what is going on right now in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth—around Commonwealth infrastructure projects that were not on the priority list, projects out of nowhere that have been brought forward and funded. For projects like the Roe 8, the Perth Freight Link, the bureaucrats at the table during estimates week did not know where the project went, what its alignment was, whether it was an elevated freeway or whether it was going to simply dump vast amounts of container traffic into the approach roads to the Port of Fremantle in North Freo. 


I strongly commend these amendments to the chamber. Infrastructure is not just about spreadsheets and concrete pours; it is about people and it is about the landscapes and the host communities in which these projects are built.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (21:20):  I advise that we will be withdrawing Greens amendment (12) on sheet 7482. This is one of the ones, as we discussed at the outset, where we think the government has substantially addressed the concern we sought to raise with our amendment. So I might let Senator Johnston run the argument for me when he, shortly, stands up and moves government amendment (3). That amendment is not entirely satisfactory, but there is substantial overlap between Greens amendment (12) and government amendment (3), which effectively talks about transparency and accountability. Rather than detaining us longer than necessary, therefore, we will not proceed with Greens amendment (12).

(6) Schedule 1, item 41, page 19 (line 6), omit ""paragraph 5D(1)(c) or"".


I note that our amendments oppose section 5D and item 8 of schedule 1. Through government amendment (3), we will be seeking that 5D, as amended, in item 8 of schedule 1 stand as printed. Government amendments (5) and (6) are consequential to that. The background, which Senator Ludlam invited me to comment upon, is that government amendment (3) deletes section 5D, which provided for functions to be performed only when directed by the minister. This has the effect of removing the minister's authority to direct Infrastructure Australia on the publication of materials and to confer additional functions, such as provisions for advice on the harmonisation of policies and laws relating to the development of and investment in infrastructure. The original intent of this section was to provide a positive power which allowed the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia to publish its findings, while striking the right balance with commercial-in-confidence matters. This will now be the responsibility of Infrastructure Australia, in accordance with general law principles, and those principles were set out in my summation to the second reading speeches.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2014-06-23,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (21:22):  As I foreshadowed, it is good that the government has had a change of heart by seeking to withdraw its own amendment. Section 5D(1)(b) would have removed the requirement for IA to publish project evaluations and material used in those evaluations—the plans, audits and ancillary advice—other than at the direction of the minister. It is remarkable that that is something the government sought to do to this piece of legislation. We strongly believe, for reasons I have outlined at length, that transparency and independence should be enhanced and not curtailed. The Moving People 2030 Taskforce provided a particularly compelling submission during the inquiry process into the bill. On this amendment in particular they said:


… this will completely undermine the credibility of Infrastructure Australia and its value to the nation. It runs counter to the principles of consultation and transparency which any attempt to obtain consensus on a national infrastructure plan must accept.


IA should publish draft and final evaluations and reports immediately and without the need for one by one approval by a minister.


We are particularly encouraged that the government has withdrawn amendment 5D, because it was also proposing really outrageous discretions in relation to material that it could deem commercial-in-confidence. I am not one of those people who believes that commercial-in-confidence considerations trump everything else—trump the public interest and trump the public's right to know. Commercial-in-confidence is used almost as widely as 'national security' as a proxy for simply closing debate down and precluding the release of material that belongs in the public domain. We believe that material, including commercial-in-confidence material, should be published where it is necessary to assess the public benefit of a proposal or an evaluation paid for by taxpayers dollars.


Prime Minister Abbott signed a $900 million cheque to the Barnett government to build the railway white elephant, while claiming a cost-benefit ratio of 5:1 and refusing to publish the supporting material. They are saying that you just have to trust them. This absurd freeway—this affront to the local community, the ecosystems and to the Aboriginal heritage—has a 5:1 cost-benefit ratio, and you cannot know how that figure was arrived at. You just have to trust the government. Well, guess what? We do not.


This is a positive amendment that the government has put forward. My understanding is that Senator Johnston is moving amendments (5) and (6) together and then will separately put the question that we will collectively oppose clause 3. If that is the way you run it, the Greens will be supporting these amendments.

We believe our amendment is better worded and we note the government has agreed to withdraw this change. We prefer our resulting wording as being more comprehensive than the government's, so we prefer our amendment. It retains the existing general power of the minister to direct IA in its functions, but subject now to relating to content of its output. This is a narrower power that restricts the minister's input to not affecting outputs. The proposal is to retain the existing power. This amendment preserves the independence of IA. Without it, IA ceases to be independent at all. So we consider this to be a very fundamental position.

This once again adds local communities as a group that it should consult with in performing its functions. I just hope that Senator Conroy has run into a little bit of an administrative error at about this point and that they do not propose to oppose a Greens amendment that says that local communities are a group that should also be consulted with in performing its functions. This is something that goes to the heart of the way that infrastructure is done. They cannot sit in an office on the other side of the country, dropping infrastructure projects in from Google Earth. These things affect people. They actually affect local communities.


If you travel out, there are instances where this has been done. The best example that I know of was a project that Alannah MacTiernan ran when she was Minister for Planning in Perth. That was a process that went deliberatively into the city of Perth, surrounded a random sample of residents from all quarters of the community with experts and ran an extraordinary process, which came out with a blueprint that was actually very green. You get the right answers if you ask good questions. We are not asking for a great deal more than that. I hope that Senator Conroy now leaps to his feet and says that it has all been a terrible mistake and that local communities are actually materially important when it comes to assessing infrastructure projects.

   Infrastructure CEO

means the Chief Executive Officer of Infrastructure Australia appointed under section 29 of the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008.


(22) Schedule 2, item 8, page 33 (lines 13 to 15), omit paragraphs (2)(b) and (c), substitute:


   (b) the CEO.


(23) Schedule 2, item 12, page 37 (lines 13 and 14), omit ""responsible person under section 415‑95 of that Act"", substitute ""CEO"".

(25) Schedule 2, item 12, page 37 (line 32) to page 38 (line 5), omit subitem (4), substitute:


(4) The Minister may, by writing, determine that subitem (1) does not apply in relation to a specified thing done by, or in relation to, the Infrastructure Coordinator. The determination has effect accordingly.


(26) Schedule 2, item 13, page 38 (lines 12 and 13), omit ""responsible person for the purposes of the provision under section 415‑95 of that Act"", substitute ""CEO"".


Given that government amendment (5) has been passed, we withdraw item (19). The final amendments (21) to (26) amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to retain the existing IA role in approval of income tax offsets for designated infrastructure projects. The bill seeks to allocate this role to a public servant, potentially outside IA. This change vests that role in the CEO, just as it sits now with the Infrastructure Coordinator. This is an important Labor reform, which was introduced in the 2013 budget, aimed at encouraging greater private sector involvement in public infrastructure projects. It is appropriate that the infrastructure experts in IA retain this role to cement its role.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:45):  Before I was interrupted for question time and other business I mentioned that the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 went through 20 drafts but that there was no consultation by government with Infrastructure Australia. I still find it quite unbelievable that there were 20 drafts but that Infrastructure Australia were not consulted at all. It is quite unbelievable. I have spoken about this government's inability to consult before making policy, but this certainly takes the cake. Not only did it fail to consult Infrastructure Australia; it did not consult any of the relevant parties outside government. To propose such major changes to Infrastructure Australia without consulting anyone outside government shows an absolute arrogance and lack of forethought, which the Australian people are very rapidly becoming annoyed about. At the very least, the government should have undergone an exposure draft process. But the Abbott government has a history of failing to consult, which unfortunately I do not think is likely to change.


Infrastructure Australia's evidence is more damning than just a failure to consult. Mr Deegan's submission states:


The Deputy Prime Minister's objectives and principles concerning the organisation's independence and transparency in decision-making deserve wide support.


Some of the provisions in the Bill are consistent with these objectives and principles. Others unfortunately are not - indeed, some proposed new provisions appear diametrically opposed to those objectives and principles.


I repeat: '… some proposed new positions appear diametrically opposed to those objectives and principles'. Is that why the government did not ask Infrastructure Australia for advice on reform of its own governance structure, or is it because they might have pointed out exactly what Mr Deegan pointed out in this submission—that the new provisions in this bill appear to be diametrically opposed to the stated aims of this bill, that this bill does not do what the explanatory memorandum says it will do but the exact opposite? As we on this side know, the government have a history of saying one thing but doing another. But to say the stated aims of the bill do one thing while the provisions of the bill do the exact opposite is an extraordinary act of hypocrisy, even from those opposite. Didn't they expect anyone to look at the bill?


The bill that was presented to the House and passed by the House sought to gag Infrastructure Australia through the now deleted section 5D. This section was to provide, and I quote from Mr Deegan's submission again:


… that Infrastructure Australia is not permitted to publish, unless it has a written direction from the Minister:


 its evaluation of project proposals under proposed section 5A, 


any evidence relied on in the preparation of any output, including national infrastructure plans,


the reasoning by which it reached its conclusions in any evaluation of any proposal, or in deciding the Infrastructure Priority List or preparing a national infrastructure plans, or even 


its conclusions.


The submission goes on to state:


lt is possible that the Minister will give a carte blanche direction to Infrastructure Australia to publish all this material. But even if the Minister does so, the provision makes any claimed independence or transparency an illusion.


The submission states that section 5D(1)(b): 


… makes whatever Infrastructure Australia does secret unless the Minister directs otherwise. 


Well, we are getting pretty used to secrets from those opposite. This section would have prevented Infrastructure Australia from giving the Australian people advice on the infrastructure needs of this country without the express permission of the minister. Infrastructure Australia would have been able to inform public debate on the infrastructure needs of this country only if their research and recommendations were ideologically consistent with the views of the minister. It is despicable that those opposite would seek to gag a body like Infrastructure Australia in such a way, and I am glad that Minister Truss has come to his senses and has at least deleted this section.


The government talk about making Infrastructure Australia more independent, but their actions conflict with their statements. The minister has already sought to move aside the Infrastructure Coordinator, Mr Michael Deegan, putting him on 'gardening leave', for the evidence he gave the Senate inquiry into this bill and for other criticisms of the government's infrastructure announcements. He has replaced him with an acting infrastructure coordinator, Mr John Fitzgerald. Unfortunately, Mr Fitzgerald may not be the best replacement. With regard to the East West Link in Victoria, Mr Fitzgerald put out a release on 29 April saying that it was a 'meritorious project'. In Senate estimates he indicated that, as a Victorian official of Treasury but also as a private consultant for KPMG doing work on this project, he advocated for the project. Unfortunately, in my book you cannot be both independent and a paid consultant at the same time. Mr Rod Eddington, the former Chair of Infrastructure Australia, has been replaced by a former Liberal minister, the Hon. Mark Birrell. This is just a case of jobs for the boys and a clear example of the Abbott government politicising Infrastructure Australia. The Australian people deserve much better than that—much, much better.


The bill that passed the House of Representatives sought to prevent Infrastructure Australia from performing its fundamental role of investigating projects and future infrastructure needs through the now deleted section 5A(2). Again I would like to quote Mr Deegan's submission to the Senate committee:


The proposed section 5A(2) empowers the Minister to determine by legislative instrument a class of proposals that Infrastructure Australia must not evaluate.


The rationale and policy intent behind this provision has not been explained. 


…      …   …


Use of proposed section 5A(2) is likely to be interpreted as minimising scrutiny of the business case for certain projects - or perhaps a wide class of projects such as proposals for the Commonwealth to fund public transport.


Section 5A(2) was put in there to ensure that the minister could prevent Infrastructure Australia from scrutinising projects that the government wants to approve—unwarranted infrastructure projects in Liberal-National marginal seats, for example—or to prevent proper investigation into projects that would be beneficial to the nation but that the government is ideologically opposed to. As with other expert bodies that provide advice which this government finds inconvenient, the coalition once again tried to limit what could be researched in order to minimise their own embarrassment and protect their own ideology. I am glad the minister has also deleted this provision from the bill that has come to the Senate. I am pleased that in the bill we are debating today we are returning to the provisions under the current act which permit ministerial directions of a general nature only. 


Labor is also putting forward amendments which will ensure that Infrastructure Australia retains the power to approve tax concessions for private sector co-investment in nationally significant infrastructure projects. This reform, brought in by the Labor government in the 2012-13 budget, aims to increase private sector involvement in major projects. The government proposed that this role be undertaken by a delegate of the minister, potentially outside Infrastructure Australia. Labor's amendment leaves this to the infrastructure experts within Infrastructure Australia.


We know those opposite are climate change deniers. That is why they have decided to delete the existing function to provide advice on infrastructure policy issues arising from climate under the government's changes. We on this side feel that this is a mistake and are opposed to this move. We know that the effects of climate change will have a significant impact on our future infrastructure needs. I was having a chat to my Tasmanian colleague Senator Polley, who is in the chamber and who has a bit of a background in shipping and transport. She was saying climate change is especially relevant, for example, when giving advice on ports and bridge heights. Labor's amendments will allow Infrastructure Australia to retain this important function.


The government proposes to remove the current function for Infrastructure Australia to review alignment of government funding decisions with Infrastructure Australia's advice. In the interests of transparency once again, Labor's amendment will retain this function. We on this side of the chamber want to know, and want the Australian people to know, that spending on infrastructure actually meets the nation's needs. I am glad that the government has made the changes that they have, but I call upon them to also agree to these sensible amendments. 


Having world class infrastructure in the most appropriate places is the key to Australia's future prosperity and it is too important for our nation for those opposite to politicise Infrastructure Australia for short-term political gain. Since its creation in 2008, Infrastructure Australia has overhauled, and has driven lasting improvements to, the way Australia plans, assesses, finances, builds and uses the infrastructure it needs to compete in the 21st century. Its achievements include: (a) completing the first ever infrastructure audit; (b) putting in place a national priority list to guide investment into nationally significant projects which offer the highest economic and social returns, with the former Labor government committing funding to all 15 projects identified as ready to proceed; (c) developing national public-private partnership, or PPP, guidelines to make it easier and cheaper for private investors to partner with governments to build new infrastructure; (d) finalising long-term blueprints for a truly national, integrated and multimodal transport system capable of moving goods around as well as into and out of Australia quickly, reliably and efficiently, including the National Port Strategy, the National Freight Strategy and more recently the Urban Transport Strategy; and (e) conducting pilot work on improving governance and developing rigour around evidence-based road funding. 


This bill fails to deliver on the coalition's promise to ensure better infrastructure planning and more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects. This is because the government do not want rigorous and transparent assessment of taxpayer-funded projects, because it is not in their own political interests. Unfortunately, the coalition government has a bit of form on politicising infrastructure projects. I quote from the Australian National Audit Office's performance audit of the Regional Partnership Program:


ANAO analysis revealed that ministers were more likely to approve funding for 'not recommended' projects that had been submitted by applicants in electorates held by the Liberal and National parties …and more likely to not approve funding for 'recommended' projects that had been submitted by applicants in electorates held by the Labor party.


Unfortunately, we have already seen from this government, which has been in power for less than a year, a similar willingness to skew projects towards their own electorates while cancelling projects in Labor-held electorates. A recent article in The Age highlighted that in the Abbott government's 2013-14 budget, of the new projects announced and funded, just under three-quarters were in coalition electorates. Monash University Professor of Transport Graham Currie was quoted in the article: 


Professor Currie said Australia's independent body for infrastructure decisions, Infrastructure Australia, was not being used by the current government to decide which projects to fund.


""The question is whether they want to be a professional government or they want to pork barrel, and whether we'll forge the idea of trying to be professional about how we manage resources or just do it on a political basis. 


""I don't think that's how a country should be run.""


I have to say that I agree with Professor Currie: I do not think that is how a country should be run either. 


The article also looks at the existing projects which have received more funding in the budget, including the— (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:57):  I rise to make a contribution in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 second reading debate. By way of starting, I followed the Infrastructure Australia debate through the Senate estimates process over a couple of years and noted with particular interest how much attention Infrastructure Australia received. In particular, its CEO, Mr Deegan, received a great deal of attention. I can concur with Senator Macdonald on at least one issue, and that is that Infrastructure Australia was well represented by Mr Deegan. He attended Senate estimates without a platoon or squadron of advisers and, in my view, was very forthcoming and forthright in his answers. So, for me, a rare moment of agreement with Senator Macdonald. 


I think it is worthwhile to go over the history of infrastructure and in particular Labor's history of infrastructure. I think that it was around 2005 that the Australian Labor Party announced it would establish Infrastructure Australia if elected. On 2 August 2007 the then leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd, detailed his plans for Infrastructure Australia, stating that it would have three divisions: one division to deal with policy and regulatory issues and drive reform on legal, tax planning and infrastructure finance matters; a division to audit the adequacy of the nation’s infrastructure, identify weaknesses and prioritise projects; and another division to evaluate the business cases of projects, project financing options, including private public partnerships, and to manage the probity process. So a reasonable person would conclude that that is not particularly skewed in any way; it seems like basic common sense. When you look at the Prime Minister's avowed intention to be the infrastructure PM, you would probably think that it was not a bad starting point, even though it was said by Kevin Rudd or set up by the then opposition. The average taxpayer and voter would expect there to be a business case, probity, an evaluation of projects and financing options. 


In Australia the responsibility for infrastructure is spread across the three tiers of government and the private sector, and so the burden of both funding and physical provision of infrastructure lies overwhelmingly with the states. The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and local government to fund infrastructure, but the states and local government are responsible for the physical provision. Now we have the private sector becoming increasingly involved in financing construction and operations. In that environment, surely you would start with a sound, logical and well-thought-out base—probity, evaluation, business case and those sorts of things. 


We know that Infrastructure Australia did an audit of all of Australia's infrastructure needs; that it did business cases and identified projects as ready to go. That would seem to be an eminently reasonable use of taxpayers' money and the use of good intelligence, good planning, good skills, good input from all sectors. I would have thought that was a reasonable basis for any government to go forward. But look at the coalition's policy of 5 September, where they claimed that only the coalition would deliver the infrastructure of the future. They deliver their claim:


If you vote for the Coalition, you know what we will deliver. We deliver infrastructure projects across Australia, including:


$6.7 billion to fix the Bruce Highway;


$5.6 billion to complete the duplication of the Pacific Highway from Newcastle to the Queensland border;


$1.5 billion to get Melbourne's East West Link underway;


$1.5 billion for Sydney’s WestConnex;


$1 billion for the Gateway Motorway upgrade in Brisbane;


$615 million to build the Swan Valley Bypass;


$686 million to finish the Perth Gateway without a mining tax;


$500 million for the upgrade of Adelaide's North-South Road Corridor;


$405 million for the F3 to M2 missing link;


$400 million to upgrade the Midland Highway in Tasmania; and


$300 million for the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail freight line.


Some of those projects may have gone through the Infrastructure Australia process with no problem at all and some may well be among those projects earmarked ready to go.


There was a very clear, precise, well-thought-out base in Infrastructure Australia from which any government, whether we continued or the incoming Liberal government, could have simply gone forward using taxpayers' money in an eminently reasonable way by getting a business case up, getting the approval through, doing the necessary arrangements with state, local and private partnerships, if they were part of the equation. But we did not get that. During estimates I detected a great degree of antipathy for Infrastructure Australia, particularly from those senators from the National Party. I did not really understand at the time why they were asking about the view from the boardroom or how much the boardroom cost or how much was spent on lunch. All of these questions were designed to impugn or disparage the way Infrastructure Australia was conducting itself. If we delved into it a bit deeper, we may well come to the conclusion that politicians, being what they are—and I am one as well—would like the authority to spend money where they wanted them to. What Infrastructure Australia did was to put in some discipline: there had to be a business case, key performance indicators and it had to stack up in the national interest. The project had to be something very productive. 


One of the most productive outcomes for Infrastructure Australia is the Western Ring Road in Melbourne. The Keating government put about $550 million into it. It transformed the ease of access in Melbourne by freeing up congestion and helping people get around easier, but, more importantly, it put up the business case for someone in West Melbourne in an old site which constrained their efficiency being able to move when the ring road was in place. The value of the land in West Melbourne compared with the land around the Western Ring Road meant they could move for no cost. So they became more efficient, but they still could get to the port and their customers, and they had new premises. That is real productivity. Mr Abbott says in this document: 


I want Australians to spend less time in traffic gridlock on our roads and more time with their families.


That is fine; everybody wants that. These infrastructure projects cannot be assessed on the basis of traffic gridlock. They have to be assessed on the genuine economic prosperity they bring or open up. Very clearly, infrastructure projects like the Western Ring Road have demonstrably done that. That project took a long time to get off the ground and it is the subject of massive funding now—something like $2 billion is being spent on upgrading it. The ring road was built on a proper economic footing 


That is what this debate really should be about in this space—it should not be about pork-barrelling, or about allowing the Nationals to have more say on infrastructure. Why have we changed the way that Infrastructure Australia has operated? Has anybody been able to point to any startling failing in the way that it has completed its business? In the report by the Standing Committee for Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, the comments of Senator Sterle in his dissenting report are very pertinent:


In a short period, Infrastructure Australia has overhauled and driven lasting improvements to the way Australia plans, assesses, finances, builds and uses the infrastructure it needs to compete in the 21st century. To date its achievements include:


(a) completed the first ever infrastructure audit;


(b) put in place a National Priority List to guide investment into nationally significant projects which offer the highest economic—


most importantly—


and social returns – and the former government committed funding to all 15 projects identified as ‘ready-to-proceed’;


(c) developed national Public Private Partnership (PPP) guidelines to make it easier and cheaper for private investors to partner with governments to build new infrastructure;


(d) finalised long term blueprints for a truly national, integrated and multimodal transport system capable of moving goods around as well as into and out of Australia quickly, reliably and efficiently: the National Port Strategy, the National Freight Strategy and more recently the Urban Transport Strategy; and


(e) conducted pilot work on improving governance and developing rigour around evidence-based road funding.


So here we had an Infrastructure Australia that was doing a good job, and along came a new government and a new minister and—according to our Prime Minister, Hon. Tony Abbott—a prime minister who wanted to become known as the infrastructure Prime Minister—and the first thing he did was set aside, ironically, all of the infrastructure that was set up to deliver what he wanted, which is true economic and social outcomes worthy of this great nation in which we live.


The reality is that we have probably got down to a bit of pork-barrelling. Basically—and it is unfortunate—this decision seems to herald a return to decisions being made on the basis of politics rather than on the basis of true value for money for the taxpayer in Australia, or the true national interest. This might be dismissed as an idle concern, but I do not believe it is. Minister Truss was a minister in the former Howard government's Regional Partnerships Programme. That program was heavily criticised by the Audit Office—not by me and not by people on this side so much, but it was heavily criticised by the Audit Office and, clearly, it poorly prioritised road funding decisions. However, the projects involved here are much larger, and this minister will have new power to nominate projects for evaluation—perhaps not now that we have had some consideration of the Labor-inspired amendments. But will there be a less independent, less transparent Infrastructure Australia? I think that is clear. The model that was there was clear and transparent, and it was supported by the bus industry council and a number of other major contributors in this space. What we now see is less clarity, and less certainty about projects and about how they get up—will they really have the transparent tests applied to them? Will it all be published? Or will it be, basically, on the whim of the minister or his department?


What we thought were the strengths of Infrastructure Australia were its transparency, its independence, and its clarity. There was quite an interesting exchange between Senator Conroy and the new Acting Australian Government Infrastructure Coordinator, where the definition of a conflict of interest was brought into play. But with the departure of Mr Deegan, Infrastructure Australia has very clearly lost a bit of its mettle. It has lost a bit of its transparency. It has lost a bit of its strength—because Mr Deegan was not one for telling people what they wanted to hear. I am not saying that the person who has replaced him while he is on alleged gardening leave is saying what people want to hear. But aspersions were cast on the chain of employment that that person had, and on the fact that he may well go back to his previous job—which had people wondering a little whether he could really give truly impartial advice to the minister.


We do not want to say that the Deputy Prime Minister is out there to pork-barrel for his electorate; I do not want to say that anyway. And I do not really mind where the investments are in Australia, as long as they are based on the prudent guidelines that have been in existence for testing projects as to their propriety, their transparency, their economic worth to the nation, and the things that they bring to all of the population. Whether the project is in a National Party seat, a Labor seat or a Liberal seat, I think that if it has gone through the best possible process and can stand up in the cold, hard light of day as an independently arrived at decision, then that is where the investment should be. The Business Council supports the passage of this bill, subject to the amendments being made, or to the withdrawing of positions that give effect to ministerial powers to direct IA not to evaluate certain classes of projects. That clearly should not be in the minister's purview to say, 'Don't evaluate that', because you remove the transparency argument I have just put forward. On the requirement that IA can publish project evaluations and other information only when it is directed to: well, it should be publishing those things anyway; this is taxpayers' money. We pay tax, and we should be able to look, at the end of the day, at where those dollars are going. That should be transparent. And project evaluations should be openly available to all who want to see it.


These are the sorts of issues that had been fleshed out in the debate, and it is good to see that the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable Mr Truss, will agree to some amendments that put a little bit better case on the situation. But we cannot ever walk away from the fact that there is a significant amount of need for infrastructure in Australia, that there are significant taxpayers' funds invested in infrastructure in Australia, and that the federal government has the guiding role. One of the really disappointing things is this refusal to invest in urban transport. I have been a transport person all my life, and it was always road and rail. There is always a case for rail, and there is always a case for road, there is always a case for freeways and there is always a case for light rail and buses and the like. So, the fact that you steer all of your infrastructure dollars in one particular way may have the effect of skewing away from really good infrastructure in our cities. If a state government, local government or public-private partnership knows that the federal government will not involve itself or invest in urban public transport, then I think that is a bad move, which probably does not meet the transparency test, the real business case test.


We do need to look at roads—most particularly, around our major cities, to free up gridlock. If you look at the South Road redevelopment, it many save only six minutes per vehicle, but if that is 3,000 trucks that are saving six minutes every 24 hours then that is a huge boost in productivity. So, I fully understand that roads are very, very important. But I think it is equally important to recognise the whole transport network and that this government should build on the good foundations left to it by the previous government and have a clear, transparent Infrastructure Australia that has a degree of independence and transparency and delivers for Australia the productivity this country so richly deserves.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (18:17):  It is a great pleasure for me to rise and speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. I have known many trainspotters who have a fascination for rail and care about it, and I am thinking of a great friend of our family—my parents were Irish immigrants—Neville Wootton, who would be very pleased to know that his name is being recorded in this place today. He was a fan of the trains and did not live far from Toongabbie station.


An investment in rail and urban infrastructure in terms of rail is an absolutely vital part of our nation's mix moving forward. I second the comments of my colleague here in the chamber, Senator Alex Gallacher, who just made some points about the critical nature of Infrastructure Australia in making sure that that complex and important mix of different types of infrastructure build is constantly considered in a way that advances the entire nation.


But despite Uncle Nev's best efforts to interest me in rail, I have to put on the record that I am the daughter of a road builder; I am the sister of many road builders. And at this time of the evening—it is mid-winter—the lights will be off. Unless there is some emergency on a job and they have gone out and hired lights, probably from Camden Hire or some other agency that they use—another small business industry—they will be on their way home now, having participated in building the roads that will be a vital part of how our community moves around here in this state of New South Wales.


I grew up to be very proud of being a part of something that is national. I cannot tell you the pride that my father felt as an Irish immigrant with a very limited education but a great heart for work and a great interest in machinery. He shared with us his vision for what Australia could be when he spoke about his work on building the Bradfield Highway when he worked for Abignano. These sorts of things—this connection with building this country—is a powerful part of our sense of ourselves. Anyone who looks at the Harbour Bridge, whether it is celebrating Australia Day or celebrating New Year's Eve, anywhere around the world, can see that this is a country that had a vision for something powerful in terms of what infrastructure could deliver in advancing our nation.


What concerns me about the legislation that was put forward and is in such need of amendment is that it reveals a government that is backward-looking and miserly in its vision for this country, that is willing to carve out an entire sector of rail and that simply has not understood the way in which infrastructure captures the imagination of Australian people. The Prime Minister is playing at the edges, trying to claim the title of infrastructure Prime Minister. That is only authentic if you are actually going to outdeliver, outspend and outvision anybody who has done it before, and that is certainly not the case in what this Prime Minister is attempting to do, as revealed in this piece of legislation.


What concerns me particularly at this point in time is that infrastructure, under the piece of legislation that the government has put forward, is at risk of becoming a political plaything once again should this bill pass in its current form. Labor de-linked the infrastructure cycle from the electoral cycle. That was a very significant change. Right now we run the risk of the Abbott government returning us to the bad old days of pork barrelling, with Australians in Labor seats or Liberal seats or Nationals seats being left behind. But I fear that the whole construction of this piece of legislation is really to advantage the Liberal seats, even at the cost of the Nats. We are seeing that over and over in piece after piece of legislation coming through the Senate here in terms of education and health, as well now as infrastructure. Infrastructure decisions should not bend to political expediency. Infrastructure decisions should be blind to the electorate they fall in. If done correctly, good infrastructure decision making and investment will benefit every single Australian and not just those in the electorates in which they are funded and located.


It can be difficult for governments to overlook the benefits that may flow from such large expenditure, and we have seen that failure to have a vision for what infrastructure spending can do. We need to preserve this system that was instituted in the last parliament that clearly broke with former bad habits and established a transparent process to create a body which would auspice and determine in the national interest what is best for infrastructure—that body being Infrastructure Australia.


The hallmark of the previous Labor government was delivering nation-building infrastructure. We delivered what the Howard Liberal government refused to build for 11 years. I am just going to refer to the shadow minister's comments on Tuesday, 10 December, when he went through a list of some of the places that were the beneficiaries of the recommendations of Infrastructure Australia. I note many of my colleagues have made comments about the benefits for the electorate of the Leader of the Nationals in the other place, Warren Truss. He has benefited from many of these decisions. This is what the shadow minister, Anthony Albanese, said:


Thanks to the recommendations of Infrastructure Australia, here are some of the projects that the previous Labor government delivered: the Hunter Expressway … major upgrading of the Pacific Highway, worth $7.9 billion, through works including the Bulahdelah Bypass, the Kempsey Bypass and the Ballina Bypass, all opened by Labor; and the Bruce Highway, with funding of $5.7 billion, including work on what the now transport minister describes as the worst road in Australia, the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway.


He went on to say:


Minister Truss would know that because it is in his electorate. He just did not fix it during the 12 years in which he was part of the government.


That is the sad reality of a failure to have looked at the projects that needed funding and to have funded them during that period of great mining benefit to the country when we had money coming in. The Howard government simply lacked the vision and it certainly lacked to the structures to make powerful recommendations about the infrastructure that should have moved forward at that time in the national interest.


We came into government and removed the bottlenecks that the infrastructure-averse Liberal government would not. We did it to secure the productivity gains that drive jobs growth and we did it because we know that you have to invest in roads, ports, railways and airports. When in government it seems the Liberal Party just do not get this. They have an indelible belief that it should just happen and the private sector will make it happen, no questions asked. Or there is the alternative of grabbing the dollars and stuffing them into seats for sheer electoral advantage—the most disgraceful and uncompromising abuse of the power of government.


On this side of the chamber we know that the federal government needs to take a lead in making sure we have a unified and strategic vision about how we build our nation. To do that, Labor created Infrastructure Australia, which is the agency that is being debated at the heart of this piece of legislation. To be the holder of this vision, to remove the politics from these decisions and to do what is in the best interests of the nation is exactly what Infrastructure Australia was created to do and it is exactly what it has done. Let me just restate that: Infrastructure Australia was created to do exactly what we wanted in terms of having a region-blind and electorate-blind vision for advancing Australia's interests. It delivered exactly that.


But within a heartbeat of returning to government the coalition got on those Treasury benches and immediately wanted to take the reins and ride this horse of advantage into its own electorates. It seems that the coalition just cannot help itself except to see dollars in infrastructure as a place from which it can pork barrel. It wants to get rid of an independent body that provides expert advice and overturn a body, Infrastructure Australia, that was especially established to deliver an holistic approach. Instead the coalition just wants to dismantle it and feel free to cherry-pick projects that suit its political will. It is back to the bad old days when infrastructure was not an integrated process but simply a recipe for pork-barrelling.


This bill, without amendment, gives the government complete power and zero transparency. That is not even just on the big decisions. They also in this bill seek to micromanage time frames and the scope of audits and evaluations. The Labor Party will absolutely oppose this shift from transparency to a rule of darkness, hiddenness and uncertainty that smacks of self-interest and distortion of the national interest.


Infrastructure Australia deals with matters that should be open to scrutiny so that the people of Australia can see how the board works and see the projects of merit that it supports and advocates for. It is clear from the legislation it put forward that the coalition wants to weaken Infrastructure Australia by increasing the power of the minister to interfere in Infrastructure Australia's own evaluation processes. This government wants to be able to order Infrastructure Australia to evaluate particular projects nominated by the minister. Where is the transparency in that? The independent body of Infrastructure Australia should remain independent in the national interest. That is why we will oppose a piece of legislation that seeks to change that unless we have significant amendments to deal with the issues that I have raised.


Along with many of the other very positive aspects of Infrastructure Australia, the government proposes to scrap the tax loss concessions introduced by the Labor government in the 2012 budget. Labor's amendments to these bills will ensure that Infrastructure Australia retains the power to approve tax concessions for private sector co-investment in nationally significant infrastructure projects. This reform aims to increase private sector involvement in major projects. The government proposed that this role be undertaken by a delegate of the minister. Once again, instead of keeping it open and transparent, the government is pulling it back into the minister's realm so that, from on high, some lord, knight or elevated person of the realm can direct the traffic of Australia's infrastructure spending to their own gain and advantage. We cannot go back to that kind of a world.



Sitting suspended from 
18:30 to 19:30





Senator O'NEILL:
  Before the break I was speaking to the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 and pointing out some of the major problems of the coalition's approach to Infrastructure Australia—including the reduction in transparency with a return to the days where ministers can skew the process towards their own pet projects—and the concerns I have about undoing the fantastic transparency gains and the practical and genuine gains for the country of having a vision for infrastructure that extends beyond the boundaries of the immediate and the foreseeable future and beyond the boundaries that can be constructed around individual seats and people's particular interests. I put on the record a little earlier my particular interest in roads, but it is rail that matters, and ports. All forms of infrastructure, and their integration, are vital to the developers of the Australian nation. 


I am very concerned that this is a government that seems to have constructed for itself a very poorly defined set of rights around Infrastructure Australia, and such a poorly defined set of rights makes it very easy to sack people. They are giving themselves the power to dispose of advisers whose advice does not suit their political line. In addition to a failure to have transparency, they have constructed a model where they can get rid of advice that does not suit pork-barrelling of the kind that we saw the last time John Howard was in office. I am deeply concerned about the bill's provisions for allowing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to order Infrastructure Australia not to consider classes of infrastructure when it assesses the relative merits of infrastructure projects. The changes the coalition is seeking to what Infrastructure Australia was doing very well under the former Labor government will reduce transparency and take us a long way backwards. 


The federal government has explicitly ruled out funding for urban public transport projects such as the Melbourne Metro, Brisbane Cross River Rail, Perth light rail and Airport Link, and the Tonsley Park rail upgrade in Adelaide. To overtly signal that you are going to cut an entire section out of the development of Australia's infrastructure, to allow these changes to public transport to be excluded from Infrastructure Australia's scope, can only be seen as a negative and destructive view of the way complex and sophisticated infrastructure and infrastructure in the 21st century needs to be considered in order to advance the nation's interests.


For the coalition government to sit there and give themselves powers to exclude, for no good reason, an entire class of infrastructure can only lead to one thing—gaping holes, massive gaps, in the infrastructure that Australia will need in the future. We have seen the legacy of that from the Howard era, when we had a failure to invest in infrastructure that Labor had to make up for when we got back in. Under the coalition's proposal, expensive projects will be excluded, inconvenient projects will be excluded and projects against Liberal priorities will be excluded. This is not how any good governance model should operate, and it is certainly not the way to build a nation.


Labor's amendments to this bill are very important because they will allow infrastructure experts in Infrastructure Australia to be free to be the experts that they are—they will not have to take advice from a minister who may or may not have some family association with road-building, to which I have already owned up earlier in my speech. The reality is that the independence of Infrastructure Australia is critical to its success and our success as a nation. The problem is further exacerbated by the type of legislation this government have put before us because in the development of their legislation they did not listen to experts. In contrast, we have listened to very important stakeholders like the Business Council of Australia. They might know a few things about building infrastructure for the nation. There was also the Tourism & Transport Forum, the Urban Development Institute, public transport organisations such as the Moving People 2030 coalition—and Infrastructure Australia itself. All have called for enhancements to Infrastructure Australia, but not with additional powers for the minister to shape and interfere with the advice the government and the community will receive.


The explanatory notes for this bill state that the bill will strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia as an independent, transparent and expert advisory body through a change in its governance structure and through better clarification of its functions. The reality is that the minister opposed the creation of Infrastructure Australia and in this bill he now seeks to control it if it has bolted too far and he cannot completely get rid of it. He is attempting to weaken its independence by reducing scrutiny and independent advice—a backward move. This bill in its current form does exactly the opposite of what the minister is claiming it will do. Why would we be surprised to see that this is a government making an art form of saying one thing and doing another? I am hoping he is doing this because he does not understand the bill rather than because he is being purposefully deceptive, but people will have to make up their own minds about what is going on with this government that is hiding more and more from the Australian people.


Infrastructure planning is about the future—it is about the nation, it is about the community, and we want to build it. For that aim to be realised, a government needs a vision. Cutting, limiting, controlling and removing independent advice is not the sort of policy that is going to deliver a vision of anything good for this country. Under Labor, Infrastructure Australia conducted the first ever national audit of infrastructure needs. Anthony Albanese was, surprisingly and remarkably, the first minister for infrastructure in Australia. Can you believe we had been so unable to see the need for these measures? Since then we have seen an incredible delivery of investment in Australia and so much of our country has changed. We restored national leadership, we established Infrastructure Australia and we got on with funding the vital projects that changed this nation. Compared with the last full year of the Howard government in 2006-07, annual infrastructure spending under Labor in real terms was up by 50 per cent in the year 2011-12. Total public and private infrastructure spending over federal Labor's first five years in office was almost $250 billion—almost 70 per cent greater in real terms than the $150 billion spent during the last five years of the Howard government. 


There is a massive contrast with a limited, miserly and contained version of Australia that those opposite are seeking to force on this country, and the legislation as put by the government needs massive change. Labor believe in the vision of Australia—one that is brought about by transparency and openness. The coalition do not know that. They need to pay attention to our amendments and get on with doing a better job for this country. (Time expired)

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (19:38):  It is an absolute pleasure to follow on from my colleague and friend Senator O'Neill, particularly after that passionate speech. I too want to make my contribution to the Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2013, and I think it is very, very important that we give a little bit of a history lesson to those who may be out there hanging on every word that is mentioned about this bill. Let's look at infrastructure.


Infrastructure can be a myriad of things, but it is about building this great nation. I come from a different angle, because infrastructure mainly is opening up our ports, our rail lines, it is talking about our roads, about public transport—about all sorts of things. As the deputy chair of the Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee, who undertook this inquiry, I do not want us to lose track of how infrastructure in Australia is funded. It is funded predominantly through the three tiers of government, being local—which in my opinion do a heck of a lot of the heavy lifting—state and federal. Up until the last few years, the funding of a lot of the infrastructure has predominantly been carried by the state governments. But what we did see in the six years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government was massive injections of cash from the Commonwealth into numerous infrastructure projects throughout this great land.


I can give a quick history lesson on some of the nation-building stuff that was done in Western Australia when Minister Albanese had the carriage of the infrastructure and transport portfolio. It gives me grief that in this current government we do not even have a minister per se who is responsible for transport, or even for the word 'transport'. I do not know how seriously we can take that side of the chamber, and certainly Mr Abbott and his cabinet, if they cannot even appoint a transport minister. Fortunately we did have one, and we did very, very well. Some of the massive spends in Western Australia have delivered productivity gains that will last for generations to come, none more so than the Gateway project around Western Australia. For those who have not had the privilege of visiting Western Australia lately, there is construction equipment everywhere around the airport, and in the suburb of Kewdale/Belmont, where our domestic and international airports, our freight hub, our rail head, our warehouse and distribution centres are. This is where the bleeding heart of Western Australia's transport and logistics industry is situated. Finally we West Aussies are being dragged into the 21st century with some wonderful infrastructure initiatives implemented by the previous Labor government.


Let's have a look at how it all started. To do that we will have to go back to about May 2005, when the Australian Labor Party determined it was going to have this body called Infrastructure Australia. Then on 2 August 2007 the then leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd, detailed his plans for Infrastructure Australia. He said it would have three divisions, and I want to share with the chamber what these three divisions were. The first would deal with policy and regulatory issues, and drive and reform legal, tax planning and infrastructure finance matters. The second would audit the adequacy of the nation's infrastructure, identify weaknesses and prioritise projects. The third division would evaluate the business cases—a very important two words—of project financing, with options including private-public partnerships, and they would manage the probity process.


Unfortunately the clock is against me tonight. I reckon I could talk with a gobful of marbles under water about this for half an hour, but I am not allowed to, and I notice the shadow minister is in the chamber, so I will summarise my contribution very quickly. The last thing we would need, and which was the plan of this government, is to take away the opportunity for Infrastructure Australia to vet these projects. The danger is that allowing the minister the final say on any infrastructure programs could lead us to that shocking situation we were confronted with in the dying days of the Howard government. I cannot remember what the program was called—I think it was called Regional something, but it was commonly referred to as 'Regional Rorts'. 


I am not suggesting for one minute that Minister Truss would ever lower his standards to be in the same mould as the previous National Party minister at the time, Mr Anderson. I would make this very clear—Mr Truss is a man of integrity. He must be, because he has seen the common sense here. With Mr Anderson, we got to a stage in the dying days of the Howard government where a certain project worth quite a few million dollars was rushed through so it could deliver an ethanol project somewhere in his seat, I believe, or a Nationals seat—a $1.2 million grant which never ever delivered one single litre of ethanol. In fact, in that dark time of the regional rorting that was going on with National Party seats and some Liberal seats, some 16 grants worth a total of $3.5 million were approved in no more than 51 minutes. That is 51 minutes to approve $3.5 million. In the notes it says 'from 3.25 pm to 4.16 pm—by then Parliamentary Secretary—

Senator STERLE:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, through you—is that Senator Fierravanti-Wells endorsing rorting? Are you endorsing it? Are you endorsing rorting? Have you lowered yourself so far in the New South Wales Liberal right that you endorse rorting?

):  Order! Senator Sterle, ignore the interjections and direct your remarks to the chair.




Senator STERLE:
  I will, and thank you for that protection, Madam Acting Deputy President. I feel safer when you are in the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am glad you feel that, Senator Sterle.




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I think Senator Sterle should withdraw that. The point I was making was that, when Senator Lundy was the Minister for Multicultural Affairs, she took less time to sign off $14 million. That is the point I was making.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator STERLE:
  How embarrassing! Because it is getting late, I will just say that I do not support this bill. I am going to wrap it up there because there are other speakers who want to make a contribution. As I said, I challenge anyone on that side to have a public debate with me on infrastructure spending in this great country—how what was done under the Labor Party compares with the cloak-and-dagger stuff that is now being presented by Mr Truss and the Abbott government. Thank you very much.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-06-23,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:45):  Like many others, I have a number of concerns about the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 as it stands. The original intention of the bill was to provide Infrastructure Australia with greater autonomy, but the impact of the bill as drafted gives the minister far more control over the organisation's operations and reporting requirements than is appropriate. 


I think it is important to acknowledge that the government appears to have taken these concerns on board and has circulated amendments to address them. In particular, the amendments will remove that part of the bill which would have given the minister the power to declare certain types of projects off limits for consideration by Infrastructure Australia—and I think it was quite outrageous that that was ever in the bill in the first place. The amendments will also remove that part of the bill which would have given the minister the power to direct Infrastructure Australia in relation to the publication of information. While I acknowledge that this was intended as a positive power to allow the minister to require information to be published, I believe it is too open to abuse. I welcome the government's decision to remove this provision and I will be supporting the government's amendment in that regard. I think it improves the bill. 


However, I also believe that the amendments proposed by the opposition and the Australian Greens would improve the bill much further. In particular, I believe the requirement for the publication of cost-benefit analyses is very important. We have a duty to the Australian public to ensure that taxpayer funds are used efficiently and to the greatest benefit of the public. This amendment adds an extra layer of transparency and accountability. I will also support the opposition's amendment on 'nationally significant infrastructure'. I believe this is an important consideration when funding projects at a Commonwealth level and I support its inclusion in the bill. I also support the Australian Greens amendments on sustainability factors and public consultation. Both of these are vitally important considerations in the use of taxpayer funds and the quality and type of projects to be approved.


In addition, I will also be supporting the Australian Greens amendment on Infrastructure Australia providing advice on climate change issues that impact on infrastructure projects. There is no harm in doing so and I think it is particularly important in the context of Australia reaching its greenhouse gas abatement targets. Climate change is a very significant challenge. We need comprehensive strategies to address it across all portfolios of government. Taking into account carbon emissions, renewable energy and resource conservation must become part of policy on all levels. 


I support the government's aim to increase infrastructure funding through changes to Infrastructure Australia. These projects are vitally important for Australian jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Without support, and with the added burden of the closure of Holden, Ford and Toyota as automotive manufacturers in Australia, we are at real risk of causing a huge chasm in Australian manufacturing. The former Prime Minister's Taskforce on Manufacturing, in its August 2012 report, estimated that 950,000 people were employed in the sector and that it contributed eight per cent of GDP directly. That did not include the significant amount it contributes indirectly through flow-on effects to other businesses. It also contributed 29 per cent of Australia's exports, despite the high dollar. 


But the report also stated that, over the four years prior, over 100,000 jobs had disappeared from manufacturing. The report also estimated that another 85,600 jobs, at a minimum, would be lost in the five years following the publication of the report. That figure could well be significantly higher now, given that Ford, Holden and Toyota are planning to exit Australia by no later than the end of 2017—in Ford's case, they are planning to leave in 2016. If we lose our manufacturing sector, we will be at a global disadvantage. We will lose not only tens of thousands of jobs but also our self-sufficiency. That is why government supported infrastructure projects will need to play a vital role in supporting Australian manufacturing jobs and building the productive capacity of the nation. Unless it can operate independently and appropriately, Infrastructure Australia will not be able to play the role we so desperately need it to play. 


In summary, I support the bill—provided a number of amendments are passed to improve it significantly. In the absence of those amendments, the bill is fundamentally flawed. The amendments proposed by the opposition and the Greens are also, I think, worthy of support. I look forward to these amendments being debated further in the committee stage.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2014-06-23,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (19:50):  I propose to sum up for the government on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013. The government fully supports Infrastructure Australia and its role as a key adviser to government on infrastructure projects and policy reforms. The government sees Infrastructure Australia's role as pivotal in its strategy to lift Australia's productivity. For this reason, the government has sought to strengthen Infrastructure Australia by establishing it as a more independent, transparent and expert advisory body through a change in its governance structure and better clarification of its functions. 


The Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill passed through the House of Representatives on 10 December 2013 and was introduced into the Senate the very next day. Since then, the bill has been subject to robust scrutiny through a Senate inquiry, the report of which was tabled in parliament on 17 March this year. That report recommended that the bill be passed in its original form. 


The business community indicated strong support for the bill. It did, however, suggest that Infrastructure Australia be provided with greater flexibility in three key areas: firstly, in the evaluation of infrastructure proposals; secondly, in publishing material appropriately; and, thirdly, in performing its function independently. The government has listened and responded to the business community's suggestions and has made three amendments to the bill. The amendments firstly remove the ministerial powers to determine a class of proposal that Infrastructure Australia must not evaluate. The opposition tried to make much out of this from the perspective of saying that it was all about public transport. Let me advise the Senate that the original intent of referring to a class of proposals was to exclude defence projects and projects seeking Commonwealth funding that was below the $100 million figure.


Secondly, the amendments remove the specific functions to be performed only when directed by the minister. The original intent of allowing for publication requests was to increase transparency to the public while striking the right balance with commercial confidentiality issues. By removing this reference it remains the responsibility of Infrastructure Australia to determine what it will and will not publish, in accordance with general law principles, including breach of confidentiality, the Privacy Act, and other common law principles, and of course the Freedom of Information Act.


Thirdly, our amendments remove the ministerial power to specify requirements related to the timeframe, scope and manner in which Infrastructure Australia must perform a function. Again, the original intent was to ensure that Infrastructure Australia would perform its functions in a timely manner and provide advice to the government on key policy issues of high priority. We know that Infrastructure Australia previously engaged in activities that were not part of their core functions. By removing this reference, the minister can provide directions of a general nature only.


These changes in part also address the opposition's key concerns. However, the opposition's amendments effectively keep the existing legislation as it is, and therefore do not empower Infrastructure Australia with the same level of independence as that proposed by the government.


Together with the new governance arrangements that set up Infrastructure Australia as an independent board, and abolish the role of the Infrastructure Coordinator, we are trusting Infrastructure Australia's judgment, as an independent body, to carry out its function suitably and according to the provisions the parliament has set.


I would like to emphasise that these changes do not affect the government's original commitments firstly to enhancing Infrastructure Australia's status as an independent statutory authority governed by a board; secondly, to abolishing the role of the Infrastructure Coordinator; thirdly, to establishing the role of a chief executive officer to be appointed to and report to the board; and, fourthly, to reforming Infrastructure Australia's key functions and asking it to undertake an audit of nationally significant infrastructure, and developing a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities. The bill still increases Infrastructure Australia's independence through its new governance structure, which will provide for an independent governing entity that is both legally and financially separate from the Commonwealth.


The bill still provides Infrastructure Australia with the remit to evaluate nationally significant infrastructure proposals and provide policy advice relating to the development of or investment in infrastructure, without waiting for a request from this government. The bill still better defines Infrastructure Australia's functions and deliverables so that infrastructure planning and prioritisation is improved on a national basis, providing a robust evidence based approach to allocating public funds to projects with the highest productivity returns. We are still holding Infrastructure Australia to account and ensuring that they assess projects seeking Commonwealth funding of $100 million or more, including those announced in the Infrastructure Growth Package.


In closing I would like to reiterate that through this bill the government is delivering on its commitment to broader infrastructure reforms. The reforms to Infrastructure Australia will help the government remain focused on delivering critical infrastructure, ensuring we are getting value for money, maximising productivity and building the infrastructure of the 21st century. These reforms are rightly provided for in this bill.


I thank senators for their contributions and I commend the bill to the Senate.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.


Question agreed to.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland) (21:47):  Good policy does not live in a vacuum and it is not an 'operational matter'. Under Mr Abbott's government, policy has become a descriptor for repeated slaps in the face to the Australian people. The days of sensible government decision making went with the election of the Abbott government. Government policy announcements are more akin to an ambush or a hit-and-run. The days of working up detailed policies, consulting on them, bringing in the community and building consensus are long gone under Mr Abbott's team of misfits. Good policy might well start in-house, but ultimately it must be owned by the community. 


Let us remember what they said they would be like when they got into government just nine short months ago. On 18 September 2013, Paul Kelly, in The Australian, wrote:


Tony Abbott has signalled a new style of Coalition government based on collaborative ties with business, a clearer set of priorities, less frenetic, more predictable and geared to stability, not fashion.


With the exception of being out of fashion, it is hard to see much else that has held true. In his own words, the Prime Minister, on 16 September 2013, said:


The Australian people expect a government that is upfront, speaks plainly and does the essentials well.


That is Mr Tony Abbott's own yardstick. He has, in fact, failed to meet that measure time and time again.


So let us look at the record of failures under this government: the triple backfiip over Better Schools funding; the botched Qantas support plan; pushing Holden off a cliff and daring Toyota to leave Australia too, throwing manufacturing jobs under a bus; handing billions of dollars to the Reserve bank without prompting; doubling the deficit; an uncapped increase on the nation's credit card; the radical proposed changes to the Racial Discrimination Act; the unwinding of Freedom of Information laws; the repeated clampdown on secrecy and a lack of transparency on our borders and to our government; and—this is current—giving us a new foreign affairs policy, for the Middle East, courtesy of Senator Brandis. On each and every occasion the government failed to consult the Australian people, they failed to explain their plans or their policies and they failed their own measure of responsible, adult government. 


Then they start just plain misleading, which brings me to the federal budget—the budget of broken promises and mistruths to the Australian people. It started with a scare and ended with horrors. The National Commission of Audit was always going to be ugly. When you put Dracula in charge of the blood bank you get some scary results, and that is what the IPA, the Business Council and Tony Shepherd delivered. The report in essence recommended the wholesale removal of the federal government from the Australian society and way of life.


I challenge any Liberal and National Party member to point to what three-word slogan suggested they would all but wind up the federal government and tell the sickest, the most vulnerable, people with a disability, seniors, job seekers, university students and lower and middle Australia that they were going to be on their own under an Abbott government. Which three-word slogan covered that promise? Which glossy flyer included that betrayal to the Australian way of life? That is what the Commission of Audit did. We assumed that it would be a scare campaign to soften up the expectations of the federal budget. What we did not appreciate was that it would be an actual blueprint for their actions in government.


On budget night the Treasurer danced in his office to the song Best Day of My Life and then he went into the chamber and danced on the grave of the Liberal Party's election promises. By the time the Treasurer sat down at 8.01 pm there could be no doubt that this was not the government that the Australian people had been promised. Curiously, the budget nasties were not hidden in the back pages, hoping that no-one would find them. They were the centrepiece of the budget. There was not a constituency that had not been betrayed, there was not a promise left unbroken and there was not a group of Australians that had not been misled.


You will remember these phrases from before the election: 'no cuts to education'—broken; 'no cuts to health'—broken; 'no changes to pensions'—broken; 'less taxes, not more'—broken. The dismantling of Medicare, leaving lower and middle income households worse off, punishing young job seekers, adding greater debt to students, and doing away with transparency and accountability reforms are all attacks on the Australian way of life and all part of the coalition's budget of broken promises. When Senator Williams told the ABC that he could not find a single person in the community that supported the government's paid parental leave scheme he could well have been referring to the entire budget.


The Labor Party stands strongly against this budget and against the hurt being inflicted on lower- and middle-income families by Mr Tony Abbott and Mr Joe Hockey. We oppose the attacks and we also oppose the methods that have been used by what used to call itself 'an adult and responsible' government. They have certainly dropped that phrase in recent times. 


Let us look at the yardstick again that this government set. 'A new style of coalition government'—nope, this is the Liberal-National playbook used by Mr Campbell Newman in Queensland. 'Collaborative ties with business' was the phrase they used—just ask Qantas, Holden and SPC what they think about that. They said, 'A clearer set of priorities'—this one might just sneak through, because they aim consistently and negatively at lower and middle Australia. 'Less frenetic' was their version—not one but two backflips on Better Schools funding. They claimed, 'More predictable'—who could have seen Knights and Dames coming? 'Geared to stability'—I think that went out the door as Mr Turnbull left the Wild Duck restaurant, quite frankly. A fail mark on every score.


There is another way to develop, consider and implement policy in Australia. The Better Schools, or Gonksi, and NDIS conversations were two high points in policy development. Integrating solid values by government, community ownership of an idea, social media buy-in and a national wave of support, they are two detailed nation-changing policies which are now reality. They both followed similar processes: they started with a set of values expressed clearly by government, followed by detailed consultation and subsequent reports by experts in the field, all released and shared with community. A national debate flowed from those proposals and government listened and moved with the community. Along the way, a national debate and two strong grassroots movements emerged, completely independent of government's own media campaign. They struck a nerve because they treated the Australian people like adults. 


The reason that the 'Every Australian Counts' and 'I give a Gonski' campaigns were able to form and support a government policy was because the policy development was conducted incrementally, carefully and in full public gaze. Labor brought the community in and we are all the stronger for it. Both policies were floated and allowed the space to percolate, connect and resonate with the community. Government was confident enough in itself to let the ideas grow outside of its grasp. It showed maturity and the nation was rewarded with policy outcomes.


Labor's policy processes have begun again and we are again showing maturity in our policy processes. The national policy forum is full steam ahead, with local forums being held regularly. New members to the Labor caucus are not being sidelined, like in the coalition, but are actively driving change. Our newest crop of Labor politicians contains serious policy and political grunt. Dr Jim Chalmers, my own local member, sits comfortably in this cohort and is holding regular policy forums across regional Queensland, and I look forward to hosting a few with him.


Bob Hawke used to say, 'If you can't ride two horses at the same time you should get out of the circus.' The two horses that any modern political party needs to ride are day-to-day politics and long-term policy development. Working together and riding in the same direction is something Labor is doing now as we take the fight up to the government and develop long-term strategies for the party and the nation's future. While we are riding two horses, Tony Abbott is looking more like a failed rodeo clown.
