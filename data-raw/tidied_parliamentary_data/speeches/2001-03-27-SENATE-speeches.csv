"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-27,"—My question is directed to Minister Hill, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I ask the minister whether he can confirm that a month ago he wrote to the United States government offering himself as a bridge between the United States and the EU when greenhouse negotiations resume at COP6. Did the minister also write to the Prime Minister advising him of this action and seeking the Prime Minister's approval? Is it further true that the Prime Minister referred the matter to the ministerial council on greenhouse, where it was vetoed?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>COP6: Greenhouse Gas Negotiations</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-27,"—I ask a supplementary question and I note that the minister has skirted the issue raised in the question. I ask the minister: how does he explain writing to the US government about his negotiating strategy, offering himself, without the prior approval of either the Prime Minister or cabinet?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-03-27,"—I read that in a newspaper. It is basically untrue. I am certainly interested in facilitating progress on implementation of the Kyoto protocol. That protocol is the first attempt by developed countries to agree to an actual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It would be some five per cent of 1990 levels by the year 2010—that is, of the group as a whole. It is therefore very important in terms of being about a changed culture on greenhouse emissions across the globe. The implementation of the Kyoto protocol has been stalled whilst parties have addressed matters of details that were unresolved at Kyoto, in particular matters relating to the flexibility mechanisms, the detail of emissions trading, the clean development mechanism and the like, and matters concerning the definition of sinks and whether they would apply in the CDM, and the participation of developing countries.
As Senator Bolkus knows, at The Hague last year at COP6, the international community was unable to reach resolution on these matters. That particular conference of the parties has now been adjourned until July of this year, and Australia is keen to make progress in the meantime—in other words, keen to facilitate dialogue that could reduce the outstanding differences, in particular the differences between the European Union countries and the umbrella group countries, which basically means the other countries of the developed world, and also differences between the developing countries and the developed world. I certainly wrote to the new US minister saying that Australia was keen to progress the issue in the terms that I have just explained to the Senate, and that remains our position. I will be hosting a meeting of greenhouse ministers in New York in a couple of weeks time. I will be attending an extended bureau meeting—
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. The minister is having a fairly wide ramble on the issue of greenhouse, but the question was quite direct, and it went to the minister offering himself as a negotiator between the EU and the US. He has not answered that question. I ask you to direct him to the question. He is irrelevant, at the moment.
—There is no point of order.
—We have been chairing the umbrella group and, in that capacity, we will look to advance the negotiations. We have been facilitating a dialogue between the umbrella group and the EU, and we will be continuing that. We hosted the first meeting between the umbrella group and the developed world at The Hague, and we will be continuing that, as I said. I have a series of such meetings lined up in New York in about a fortnight's time, including a meeting of the extended bureau of the COP, under Dutch Minister Pronk. I hope that out of these interim meetings progress will be made towards a situation where I can be more confident that the meeting in July will achieve the objectives that I said were so important. I am keen, and the Australian government is keen, to get the Kyoto protocol implemented. We are therefore keen to get the unresolved issues settled as soon as possible.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-03-27,"—On 26 February I was asked a question without notice by Senator Evans in relation to the goods and services tax. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Evans asked the Minister for Family and Community Services on 26 February 2001:
Can the Minister explain how much of the $485 million of taxpayers' money spent by the Howard Government on prime TV ads and glossy brochures to publicise the new tax system was actually spent on alerting Australia's 2.6 million pensioners to the fact that half of the GST compensation would be clawed back nine months after the GST impacted on their purchasing power?
Supplementary question 
Of the $480 million of taxpayers' money you spent selling the package, how much of it did you use to explain to pensioners that you were going to claw back half the compensation that they were entitled to receive in March?
Response
FaCS spent $4,708,081 on advertising tax reform elements that were the responsibility of my portfolio. This is the overall figure and it is not possible to specify how much was spent on tax reform advertising that was specific to pensioners.
This was on top of the extensive information that the ATO provided to the public through its media campaign, the Essentials magazine, facts sheets and other PR products.
Age Pension News has been a key source of information for pensioners. The Age Pension News is produced quarterly, and is sent to 2.2 million recipients, including community groups and self-funded retirees. Explanations of the GST compensation package for pensioners were included in the June/July 1999 edition, the September/October 1999 edition, the December 1999/January 2000 edition, and were repeated again in the March/April 2000 edition.
The cost of producing the Age Pension News is not included in the $4.7 million spent by FaCS on advertising tax reform elements specific to the portfolio. It is not possible to separately identify the proportion of the cost of producing Age Pension News associated with promoting the tax reform changes.
FaCS undertook community briefing via printed products and seminars for peak bodies, which were another source of information on tax reform compensation and the indexation process for pensions.
The Council on the Ageing has confirmed that it relied for factual information on FaCS community briefing kits, Government facts sheets, the Age Pension News, and other government sources.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Pensions</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,speech

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2001-03-27,"—I seek leave to make some brief remarks in relation to a return to order passed by the Senate on 26 February this year.
Leave granted.
—On 26 February, the Senate called for some documents to be laid on the table. Pursuant to standing order 164, the Clerk of the Senate notified Senator Hill of the details of the motion. Basically, the motion related to the listing of the drugs Celebrex and Vioxx and the appointment of new Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee members. I regret to advise the Senate that I will not be in a position to comply with that order by 4 o'clock today. I have a letter from Dr Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, in which he says that he regrets that a final response will not be available today. The reason he offers is that a large number of documents within the scope of the request were prepared by third parties and there are necessary negotiations with them. He indicates that the progress on that matter is very well advanced but not yet complete. He concludes by saying that a detailed response will be made available to the Senate as soon as possible.  
`As soon as possible' is not, I assume, what senators would be happy with as an indication of when this order will be complied with. I had hoped to get further and better particulars from Dr Wooldridge by now, but the House of Representatives question time does go on and there are other commitments. I give an undertaking to the Senate that I will come back tomorrow, before the close of business, and give such further and better particulars as I can from Dr Wooldridge as to the completion of the task of complying with this order. Then, of course, if the Senate is not happy with that answer there will be a debate. If the Senate is happy with that answer, there will not be. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard Dr Wooldridge's letter to me of 27 March.
Leave granted.
The letter read as follows—
The Hon Dr Michael Wooldridge
Minister for Health and Aged Care
27 March 2001
Senator the Hon. Amanda Vanstone
Minister for Family and Community Services
Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the motion passed by the Senate on 26 February 2001 seeking the tabling, no later than 4pm on 27 March 2001, of documents relating to:
·	The listing of the drugs celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and
·	The appointment of the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
I regret that a final response to the Motion is not available today. A large number of documents within the scope of the request were prepared by third parties. Because many of these documents potentially raise issues related to commercially sensitive information and personal privacy issues, you will appreciate that it was necessary for all third parties to be consulted before any release of material could be made.
Whilst very well advanced, this consultation process is not yet complete and this means that unfortunately it will not be possible to table the documents in the Senate by 4:00pm 27 March as requested. Please let me assure you that all efforts are being made to keep the delay in tabling of the documents as short as possible.
A detailed response to the Motion will be presented to the Senate as soon as possible.
Yours sincerely

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-03-27,"—A lot of people are finally climbing out of the woodwork to oppose this competition policy, a creation of Labor supported by the coalition. In 1995, the Australian Democrats were not supportive of the design of the national competition policy. The Democrats believed that the policy would result in substantial gains for big business and the cities at the expense of small business and the regions.
Unfortunately, the evidence confirms Democrat fears. I was a member, together with Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, who is now sitting before us, of the Senate Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy which reported in February last year. The evidence that that committee received by and large vindicated the view of the Democrats of benefits to the cities and detriments to many rural and regional parts of this country.
It is time to scrap this national competition policy. In the five years that it has been in place, overall it has not proved itself to be capable of providing enough national benefits to outweigh its many local and regional costs. Even on big picture issues such as electricity, its failure to cost in externalities has left us with long-term environmental problems and industry structure problems. The National Competition Council should be abolished. Its members consider the cultivation of the almighty dollar a superior objective to the objectives of healthy environments and healthy communities. National competition policy is premised on deregulation unless it can be shown that there is public benefit in retaining the regulation. It should be the other way around.  
Put simply, competition policy is dominated by economic assessment ahead of a consideration of the less tangible effects of the policy in social and environmental areas. It is much easier to count dollars and cents than it is to measure the flows of people from small towns to regional centres and cities or to measure the effects on the local society or the local environment. We need to evaluate the consequences that has for those who remain in small towns in terms of the withdrawal of services and people, employment, education and so on.
Back in 1995, when the parliament was debating the Competition Policy Reform Bill—which was the bill that legislated the introduction of the national competition policy—the Australian Democrats criticised the bill for its failure to include in pricing the negative social and environmental effects of a particular decision. The Democrats are still trying to convey that message. 
Whilst I am pleased that the Prime Minister is now taking a renewed interest in the impact of the national competition policy, I must admit that I am cynical about his motives and about how late in the process he has become concerned. Let me explain why. The Senate select committee into NCP reported in February last year, over 12 months ago. The government's response to the select committee's report was tabled in August 2000. You will find that in the 14 pages of that response the government commits to doing absolutely nothing in response to the recommendations of the committee. Sorry—change that to `nearly nothing'. The report does state that the Prime Minister will write to premiers and chief ministers and ask them to give consideration to the issues in the report, but the government commits to doing nothing else.
In the last few months, the government has suffered a battering in the polls and has been defeated in Ryan, and the National Party have suffered an identity crisis of extreme proportions, particularly in Queensland. The government's new-found concerns in relation to national competition policy therefore seem more about politics than principle. Only seven months ago, it responded to the committee's report, a report that identified many of the very problems that the Prime Minister says he wants to address. But only seven months ago the government was not prepared to do anything about those problems.
One of the reforms being postulated is to try to form some sort of definition of the expression `public interest'. The Democrats have two problems with this approach. The first is that we cannot see that just penning a definition of `public interest' is going to help all that much. `Public interest' is a far-reaching term that allows for consideration of almost anything. It is a term that has been considered by courts and is used in a number of pieces of legislation. By trying to redefine the term, you may end up limiting the matters that are considered rather than broadening them. Our second problem with a new definition of `public interest' is that, quite simply, it is too little too late. The problem with national competition policy is not the absence of a definition of `public interest'; it is the underpinning philosophy which says that deregulation and free market forces always result in a better allocation of resources and better outcomes for society.
What is needed is a different attitude—one that balances economic, social and environmental considerations, and one that values small business of itself and the regions of themselves. Only by ridding the National Competition Council of free market ideologues, however pleasant they may be as individuals, can such an attitude start to be inculcated. Small business has a value of itself. The regions have value of themselves, not just as measures in the GDP ratios or as economic elements. They have value as components of our society. It is time to let go of that thinking, scrap the lot and start afresh. The NCP has had five years, has cost thousands of jobs and has, in our view, mostly benefited a minority of big businesses in the cities. Its economic successes are outweighed by its social failures, and we are witnessing the consequence of those social failures in the backlash in the community. 
I accept that, at the time, the Labor Party, who introduced it, and the coalition may have had great hopes for its virtues, but the practice of the NCP has proven to be fatally flawed. When we think of competition policy, we should also be thinking about legislation that protects key small business sectors and regulates the market power of big business. Provisions like section 46, which is the misuse of market power provision, and section 51AC, which is the unconscionable conduct provision of the Trade Practices Act 1974, are a good start, but more can be done and more must be done. Australians urgently need and want a competition policy which includes the safeguarding of key small business sectors. This need is real and is represented in numerous letters from ordinary Australians. Deregulating pharmacies, taxis, liquor stores and retail hours, as recommended by the National Competition Council, hurts small business sectors in regional Australia and benefits only big business. These are not national or global issues that need big brother attention; they are state or local issues and should not be subject to this policy.
We need a totally different approach to competition that reduces the opportunities for big business to engage in unfair trading practices against small business. Competition policy is not just about efficiency; it is also about society. It must be about laws that regulate the power of the powerful, not about removing laws that protect the bargaining position of the weak. The first thing the government can do is stop sitting on its hands in relation to the Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. That 17-page bill contains a number of very positive competition measures for small business. It was first introduced into the House of Representatives nine months ago. We are still waiting for the government to decide its position in relation to some minor amendments made by the Senate. The government and the Labor Party both rejected my amendment to that bill, which would have given the ACCC the power to break up ownership situations which substantially lessen competition. I will be proposing that that amendment be sent to a committee for further consideration. The government and the Labor Party have fortunately indicated their support for a reference of that issue.
Both the coalition and the Labor Party supported competition policy in its current form back in 1995. To use a current phrase, it is time for a roll-back on this issue from both of them. Given that I expect that we will be going to a general election in about seven months time, my request is for a complete consideration of the underpinnings of the policy by both sides of politics. The fact is that the effects of that policy are now known and the weakness of the policy is that it lacks balance and is driven by a particular ideological passion which is not the right answer for our society. I look forward to seeing the reforms that the Prime Minister has foreshadowed in his recent comments. However, I do fear that it may still be the case that they are analogous, to use the old phrase, to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>National Competition Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2001-03-27,"—Senator Murray makes a lot of considered contributions to the Senate. There are often times when I am in agreement with him, but I must tell you that today Senator Murray has got it totally wrong. This matter before the Senate, which talks about `the rejection by the Australian public of the current national competition policy', is a rather broad, sweeping statement. The proposal that the Australian public have rejected the national competition policy simply cannot be supported by fact. There may be some members of the Australian public who do not like competition policy, but in fact it is not true to say that the Australian public in general are against competition policy. Half of them probably do not even know that it exists, because it is part of their everyday lives and something that has been signed on to by all state governments and by the federal government, and of course it was signed on to by the Labor federal government when they were in office. 
I am looking forward to hearing Senator Cook's contribution to this debate for a variety of reasons. Senator Cook's views seem to be changing as time goes by. Until today, we were of the belief that the Labor Party were so supportive of a GST that they wanted to keep it. Now we know that all of the Labor Party want to keep it except Senator Cook. This is a bit of a break. We now have one person in the Labor Party who does not want to keep the GST; he wants to get rid of the GST. It will be very interesting to see whether Senator Cook succeeds in persuading his own party to get rid of the GST in order to come to his point of view.
Senator Murray also mentioned in his speech that the Prime Minister's recent interest in the national competition policy was brought about by falling polls. I had not noticed that the polls were showing support for the Democrats rising all that much in recent times. As a matter of fact, in percentage terms you could probably say they had close to a 50 per cent reduction in support in some areas. I can promise you that while the polls show that support for the government has dropped, certainly there is nowhere near a 50 per cent reduction in support for the government in the polls. I do not think it is a test of our attitude towards the national competition policy that is having any effect on that situation.
When we are talking about the competition policy I think it is important that we understand exactly what we mean by the competition policy that was introduced by the Labor Party and supported by the coalition. Right at the very beginning the policy states that it extends competition into areas of the economy which have been dominated by government monopolies or where competition has been restricted by legislation. That is why we in opposition supported the introduction of a competition policy at that time. We do not believe that areas of competition should be dominated by government monopolies. I understand that the Labor Party have now changed their views, particularly regarding the privatisation of many former government monopolies. 
As you will well remember, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, the Labor Party were at the forefront when it came to privatising what were previously existing government monopolies. As a coalition government we have continued in that vein. But it seems that the Labor Party have had a `road to Damascus' conversion: they now no longer support the policies they had prior to 1996 when they sought to get rid of government monopolies. That has been evidenced by their opposition, since 1996, to many of the privatisation arrangements that this government has attempted to put into place in order to improve competition and improve the services that Australians get. The competition policy reflects the view that competitive markets maximise productivity and economic growth opportunities, increase employment and improve services to consumers and business.
A number of issues were brought to the fore when the subject was discussed and agreed to at the COAG meeting in November 2000. The public interest test has been enhanced. The public interest test uses a broad benefits cost ratio approach and considers all relevant matters. I particularly draw to Senator Murray's attention matters such as economic, social and environmental impacts and a consideration of the interests of all of the parties affected are included. It is a matter of judgment whether you think the national competition policy has fulfilled all of those things to the fullest. In fact, they are part of the policy, so it is no good blaming the policy for anything that might not eventuate. The policy is right, so the execution must be right—and it must be made right—as well.
Various media have recently displayed a significant misunderstanding of the national competition policy. I believe the media have deliberately in many ways misinterpreted and misunderstood what the policy stands for. For instance, in spite of what the media might say, the national competition policy does not ignore social, regional or environmental considerations. It is part of the policy that they must be taken into account. It does not require asset sales, privatisation, compulsory tendering, contracting out or deregulation. They are not part of the competition policy. It does not require that those things be done. It does not require the removal of monopolistic practices, and I instance single desk marketing. It does not require that those things must be got rid of. It does not allow unelected officials to set the national competition policy reform agenda. That is not part of the national competition policy. Nor does it reduce services or remove community service obligations. There is no greater benefit of that than in the area of telecommunications, one of the greatest areas of community service obligation in Australia. Whenever there has been any privatisation regarding Telstra, legislation that has been enacted has always ensured that community service obligations which were in place prior to any privatisation taking place have been maintained. 
The telecommunications industry was opened up to full competition in July 1997, and a third party access regime was created in 1997. At present there are 68 licensed carriers. I can think of no greater example of the success of this national competition policy than what it has done for telecommunications in Australia. All consumers are benefiting from lower prices and from considerably greater choice. Let me give some examples. For instance, consumers can make substantial savings in the area of international calls compared with pre-deregulation prices. Look how far we have come. In 1965 I remember being overseas when it cost about $3 for a three-minute telephone call. Imagine how long $3 will give you today if you were spending that amount to make a telephone call. 
Savings in excess of 80 per cent can be made on calls to some countries. For example, if you made a call to Canada in June 1997, the off-peak price was 91c per minute. Currently with the cheapest carrier the price is 15c per minute from Canberra. Would we have achieved that without some competition? Would we have achieved that if we still had a government monopoly or a single monopoly in the telecommunications industry? I think not. In June 1997 it cost $1.09 to make a call to Germany. With the cheapest carrier it now costs 21c. The benefits to consumers of introducing competition policy in the telecommunications industry can be highlighted, and I could give you a whole range of other examples. For instance, even within Australia, national long-distance call prices have fallen substantially since there was market liberalisation in 1997. For example, the cost of a 15-minute off-peak intercapital call has fallen from $2.67 with Telstra in June 1997 to $1.55 on 1 February this year with the cheapest carrier—a saving of over 40 per cent. 
Instead of the price of local calls going up, the price of untimed local calls has now fallen to below 20c. Compare that with what it was five or six years ago in real dollar terms. I could go through a whole range of other areas where competition policy has delivered benefits to consumers which are tangible, which are significant and which highlight the fact that, if we get rid of government monopolies and allow some competition into many of these industries, it provides tremendous benefits to consumers. Senator Murray's motion today is based on a very false premise, because there is a benefit to the Australian consumers of the national competition policy.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-03-27,"—We are debating a matter of public importance proposed by the Democrats about national competition policy. In a moment I want to come to some of the details on which this matter of public importance is based. First, I think it is appropriate to set out what the Labor Party's view is when we are dealing with matters of such importance to the basic economy. 
We take the view in the Labor Party that the issue is not that we live in an economy but that we live in a community. The purpose of economic reform is to serve the interests of the community. We do not exist to serve the interests of doctrinaire theory in economics; we exist for the purpose of making sure economics improves the living standards of ordinary Australians. The test is: does it do that or does it not? In the case of national competition policy, we would find a number of quite significant flaws in the way in which this federal government has gone about its implementation, and the consideration of the human interest—what is the value to ordinary Australians—has been lost in a helter-skelter headlong pursuit for doctrinaire goals and for placing of economic theory above the interests of ordinary people.  
Having said that, all governments in this country are faced with a significant challenge when it comes to reform. The political problem for all governments—and we were in government just five years ago; we know what the problem was for us—is this: usually, and universally, the benefits of economic reform are spread thinly across the entire economy, when the pain of economic reform is felt sharply and often deeply by a particular sector of the economy. Therefore, governments get no good marks for the benefits spread thinly for everybody, but they get a lot of brickbats—and understandably—as the cries of pain reach through the electoral process to undermine government authority.
Going back to this question of what is primary, community or economics, the fundamental concern is that when governments undertake reform—and reform is necessary to keep the economy modern and competitive—they must have in place adjustment mechanisms to help people adjust. It is no good, as the government these days says, that there is some sort of trickle-down effect. You make massive reforms at the top, the benefits trickle down and eventually everyone achieves some sort of positive outcome. They may trickle down. But what happens in the meantime—people are thrown out of work, put on the breadline or have their companies cut from under them—while people are waiting for the so-called benefits of trickle-down economics? We are not fans of trickle-down economics; we are fans of putting in place the necessary adjustment mechanisms—the sort of support that is necessary—to help transition, because reform to an economy like Australia is important if we are going to be a competitive nation in the modern world.
I thought that the government may have woken up when, in 1999, John Anderson, the Leader of the National Party and the Deputy Prime Minister in the Howard government, said to the Queensland Nationals 64th annual state conference in Rockhampton: 
Quite simply, competition policy must be the servant of the people, not their master. We must use it wisely to advance the public interest; not diminish the public interest by trenchant adherence to economic theory and ideology.
That is a very fine sentiment. But, as so often happens in a government controlled by spin doctors and trying to massage the message to mislead people, when that fine sentiment is held against the actual test of `do their actions conform with their words?' we find that their actions are desperately wanting.
The problem has been that the Howard government has sat back and watched while pain has been inflicted through the implementation of national competition policy. It has, in effect, vacated the field. It has not been willing to convene meetings of the Council of Australian Governments to oversee the implementation of national competition policy and to discuss its impact and how you manage it. As a result, national competition policy has been implemented, in our view, without adequate supervision by the community's elected representatives.
Last November's meeting of COAG—the Council of Australian Governments—discussed competition policy for the first time in years. That was, in our view, a welcome development. This body, which has the state premiers and the federal government present, is, in its collective personality, the body responsible for making this policy work—and for the first time, last November, it discussed it. Well, good. But while the changes in the national competition policy agreed to at that meeting were intended to hand back control of the implementation of national competition policy to the elected representatives, the National Competition Council's third tranche assessment framework report, released on 5 February this year, provides—in our view—absolutely no evidence that things have improved. Therefore, the Howard government—and that is where the buck stops—has failed to keep its hands on the wheel for national competition policy. 
Matters of important national policy are being handled by unelected bureaucrats, with the government at arm's length saying, `Don't blame me; it's their fault.' But the supreme power here, the authority that is given to those bureaucrats to implement what they do, comes from the government. It is about time—and we say this again with some force—that process was taken back by elected representatives. 
That brings me to what we in the Labor Party think should be the ruling policy direction here. The Labor Party, of course, has a lot of its policies announced and out in the public domain, and it put this in the public domain some time ago. The fact that some elements of the media do not wish to report it, and then lambast us as having no policy, is a commentary on the ineffective way in which the media provide a journal of record of what happens. Labor believes that it is simply not good enough to leave the implementation of national competition policy to the unelected officials of the National Competition Council. Labor will ensure that the implementation of national competition policy is overseen by elected governments. Labor will revitalise the COAG process, with more frequent and more active meetings. Labor will ensure—and here's the rub—that a strong public interest test is applied in every application of national competition policy: each application should not simply measure the direct economic impact of reform; it should have regard to other community factors.
Labor's balanced approach will consider the effect on issues such as jobs and job security, regional development, social welfare and equity considerations, health and safety, ecologically sustainable development and the interests of the consumer. We are fundamentally committed to ensuring that the strong public interest test be applied clearly and transparently so that people can see what is happening, who is responsible and why decisions are made. We think that is fundamental for proper government administration; and in an area such as this, where there are sensitive adjustment processes, it is absolutely vital. That is where we stand and that is what we will do. That is not to back away from reform principles at all. But it is reform with the human dimension, with the human face, and the necessary management of the dislocative processes that sometimes come in train with reform.
We heard a moment ago from Senator Ferguson, who, in a somewhat offhanded way, criticised the Labor Party for introducing national competition policy and blamed us for the bad effects where there has been dislocation, blithely passing over the fact that he has been in government for five years and has responsibility for these effects, and claiming proprietary rights and pride of authorship for the good outcomes of national competition policy. The example he cited was telecommunications. I do not necessarily want to join with Senator Ferguson in what would be, at the end of the day, a fairly pointless debate. But I just make one point in passing with respect to what he has said: competition in telecommunications was introduced by the Labor Party. His speech eulogised the effect of competition in telecommunications in reducing prices and costs for distance telecommunications. Thank you, Senator Ferguson. But, please, be historically accurate. Who introduced that competition in the first place? We did.
—It predates national competition policy.
—That is a fair comment, too, Senator Murray. The other issue that is referred to in Senator Murray's matter of public importance today on national competition policy is:
... particularly in view of its failure to balance economic with social and environmental considerations ...
The theme of what I have said is about balancing social and environmental considerations. But we cannot just stop at national competition policy when we talk about that; that has to be a guiding light, an organising philosophy, for what we do in all areas of government. I would find far more credibility in the Democrats' position if they had rigorously applied that view to all that they have done. I am referring, of course, to the GST.
I recall vividly when last year Senator Lees said that in 13 hours of negotiations with the Howard government she had achieved more than she had achieved in 13 years of negotiating with Labor. What she had achieved in those 13 hours was a package of measures that implemented the GST and inflicted on the Australian economy what has given rise, in the last quarter of ABS statistics, to negative economic growth for the December quarter. The economy actually shrunk in the December quarter by 0.6 per cent. And many believe—60 per cent, according to a survey I have just seen of business leaders—that there will be two consecutive quarters of negative growth, meaning a technical recession. We do not want to see the economy shrink; we do not want to see the social and economic impacts of a shrinking economy. But we do believe that, having regard to social factors—as this motion calls upon us to do—and having regard to community factors, one cannot end the debate simply by talking about national competition policy. Clearly, as the Reserve Bank has now said through its deputy chief executive in a recent address in Tokyo, the so-called transitional effects of the GST, led by a massive downturn in the building industry in Australia, along with other impacts of the GST, have pushed Australia into negative economic growth. There is no justification for this. 
When I go back to when the GST was not yet born as a new tax that would afflict Australians, I go back to the Australian Democrats' promises to the Australian community—promises they said they would stand up and negotiate for in the new tax package. They made 31 undertakings, none of which have been delivered. They were trampled over by the government in those negotiations. The Democrats backed away from the firm and sober undertakings that they had made. I do not have time in the few moments remaining to me to go through all 31. One of them—I refer to it because it is of considerable interest to the community—was on petrol, where they wanted to remove, and made a commitment to remove, the reductions in petrol taxes in a trade-off by reducing payroll tax. Of course, they never insisted on that. Another one in the case of petrol was where they wanted to remove the GST from petrol. But of course the GST is on petrol.
—Are you going to remove it?
—Because some of the elements of competition policy relate to regional and rural Australia, let me conclude my remarks about the GST on petrol by making this observation: this is a tax on country Australia. The further you live from an oil refinery, the more you pay for your petrol and, because the GST is a percentage tax on the final price, the price in country Australia is higher than in city Australia. One of the great so-called `reforms' this government—aided by the Democrats—have delivered is higher petrol prices and more tax paid by country Australians than by city Australians. That is not fair, that is not equitable and that imposes a huge cost on country residents.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-03-27,"—It is interesting to note that Senator Cook had 15 minutes to make a contribution on national competition policy and ran out of puff only about seven minutes into it. He then had to rail against the government and the Democrats about the goods and services tax and finished off by talking about the goods and services tax on petrol. It had absolutely nothing to do with the debate before the chamber at the moment. When asked by me by way of interjection whether the Labor Party would actually take away the goods and services tax on petrol he refused to answer.
—You were out of order.
—It does not stop Senator Cook interjecting when he says that I was out of order. But the interesting thing is that he does not talk about removing it: he simply says that it is just a dreadful thing. Let him go back to the states and renegotiate the policy. Senator Cook is now strutting out of the chamber because he does not want to deal with this issue. The fact of the matter is that all of the goods and services tax goes back to the states. Senator Cook's contribution, quite frankly, was totally and utterly irrelevant so I will now move back to the issue before the chamber, that is, Senator Murray's matter of public importance:
The rejection by the Australian public of the current National Competition Policy, particularly in view of its failure to balance economic with social and environmental considerations, and the need to scrap Competition Policy and abolish the National Competition Council. 
On many things I concur with Senator Murray but on this I fail to be able to do so, purely and simply because in Senator Murray's matter of public importance, he states—as Senator Ferguson said—that there is a rejection by the Australian public and that it fails `to balance economic with social and environmental considerations'. I am at a loss to understand exactly what Senator Murray means by that because the benefits that have accrued from the national competition policy do not sit well with those words.
I want to go through some of the benefits that the Australian public have gained from the national competition policy in areas such as aviation, shipping, rail, water reform, telecommunications, electricity and gas, to name but a few. It is interesting when one looks at, for example, electricity because we look at this on top of the benefits that Senator Ferguson mentioned in telecommunications: the decrease in costs that people have incurred as a result of national competition policy.
For example, in electricity the benefits to consumers include the fact that from 1993 to 1997 electricity prices fell by over six per cent. A survey of international electricity prices as at January 2000 found that Australia has the second lowest priced electricity for both residential and industrial consumers. Australian electricity prices are about half those in the United States. I cannot understand why the Labor Party would be against that. After all, this was their policy. Obviously, Senator Cook is now throwing that out along with the goods and services tax—he is the only one to do so, I might add. I cannot understand why the Democrats would be concerned about something that has delivered to Australia the world's second lowest prices for electricity.
Tariffs around Australian businesses have fallen by up to 50 per cent since the 1980s and I would have thought that that has a good flow-on effect, so that businesses have actually got more money to invest, more money to pay staff and more money to advance and progress. Since May 1995, electricity consumers in New South Wales, for example, have received savings of around $930 million in real terms in their power bills.
—Bob Carr is responsible for that—that is right.
—Senator Forshaw is over there flapping his gums incessantly—about what, I do not know. He is from New South Wales. I would have thought that he would actually quite relish the fact that it was his government that brought in the national competition policy. I would have thought that he would be quite proud—instead of sitting there mindlessly interjecting—of the fact that his state has received such a huge benefit. Also, since March 1997, Queensland customers can choose their own electricity supplier and they have achieved savings of around $90 million per year.
Moving on to gas—and it is interesting because both Senator Murray and I come from Western Australia—I just happened to note that, with regular frequency, Western Australia in the gas area has yet again been able to provide some very big savings since the introduction and implementation of a national gas code. Following gas deregulation in the Pilbara in Western Australia, for example—and that happened at the same time as national competition policy, in 1995—charges for large industrial users typically fell by more than 50 per cent. We know that there are huge costs associated with living in remote Australia. There are huge costs associated with a whole range of things, whether they be run on gas or electricity. That type of reduction is most substantial. As a result of further competition, prices for gas from the Goldfields gas pipeline in Western Australia have fallen by 25 per cent. Queensland Alumina Ltd has reported a 25 per cent reduction in gas tariffs from one of its pipelines.
Moving to aviation—real domestic economy air fares were 18.7 per cent lower in June 1999 than in September 1990. Over the same period passenger numbers rose by 36.8 per cent. We have more and more people across this country wanting to travel by air, and since the introduction of Impulse and Virgin Blue we have seen more improvements in the quality of service and the frequency of service. Service frequency increased by about 21 per cent between September 1991 and June 1999, and the number of non-stop services has increased as well. That is a very important factor because, without national competition policy, many of those things would just simply fall flat on their faces, including Australia's open skies agreement for international air services. The first one of those was made with New Zealand at the end of last year, and that will allow Australian and New Zealand international airlines to operate across the Tasman and then beyond to third countries without restriction. That means with competition there is the benefit of lower prices, and that is the most important aspect for people. They really want to know: `Is there a benefit for me?' 
Moving on to water costs—water reform has seen real prices for Victorian household consumers fall by 18 per cent, and water costs for an average medium-sized business in WA have fallen by almost 50 per cent. Around 57 per cent of Western Australian customers are expected to experience a decrease in sewerage charges, as a result of tariff reform. Many of us would know that those very people who have benefited from this policy were those who, quite justifiably, screamed loudest and longest at the high costs of running their businesses and also at the high costs of their domestic usage.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-27,"—I have been listening to the debate, particularly to the contributions of Liberal Senators Ferguson and Knowles. I note their hardline support of the economic rationalist theory of competition and, in particular, competition policy. I note that Senator McGauran is to follow me in the debate, and I will be interested to see if he, as a member of the coalition between the National Party and the Liberal Party, adopts such an approach.
I will touch firstly on the theory of competition policy. I think it is important to emphasise that it is an economic theory that, when implemented in practice, does have some substantial side-effects for people in particular communities. Competition policy is concerned with all facets of government policy which influence the competitive behaviour and the competitive environment of firms, individuals and government agencies engaged in the supply of traded goods and services in the Australian economy. Australia has a consistent national economic regulatory framework directed at maintaining and promoting competition in all forms of business activity. As I said earlier, it is based on an economist's doctrinaire economic theory of competition. There are a number of assumptions made by doctrinaire economists about competition. They include equal access to goods and services, perfect knowledge of goods and services and their quality and their pricing, and also the availability of sufficient suppliers and producers of goods and services within an economic market to ensure effective competition. That is the doctrinaire economic theory, but in reality the doctrinaire economic theory of competition does not work out quite as easily.
Even when competition is measured at a national level and you can identify positive economic gains, there are still problems. I refer to the example given by Senator Knowles in respect of the operation of the electricity market in this country. You can certainly measure nationally economic gains to the nation as a whole. However, when you examine the impact of that at a local level, particularly in rural and regional communities and in areas where substantial numbers of workers were involved in the production and distribution of power in this country, I do not believe that they would give quite the same glowing report or accolade about competition policy in the electricity market.
As my colleague Senator Cook outlined earlier, there is a critical difference between the Liberal-National Party, which is in coalition, and the Labor Party in the way in which competition policy should apply in this country. The Liberal-National Party subscribes to the view that, where there is a positive economic gain nationally, `She will be right, Jack, it will trickle down to everyone in the community at some point in time.' That is clearly not the case. There are many people in our community, particularly in rural and regional areas, where the only trickle down they see is the trickle down through the occasional flood. They are not going to be the beneficiaries of national competition policy. 
It is important, particularly in a country with such massive distances and such a small economy, that we have an active industry and regional policy. It is important that we have decent safety net protections in place, such as collective negotiations. When I say collective negotiations and bargaining, I do not just refer here to employees; I also refer to farmers. Farmers are price takers and I have always been a believer that farmers as price takers and as individual producers struggle to obtain a decent price beyond the farm gate; and I do not see collective agreements between farmers, in whatever form those may take, as necessarily being invalid. It is important to take into account health and safety considerations and, overwhelmingly, the most important issue is jobs, particularly jobs in rural and regional centres. It is also important to maintain a decent level of services in rural and regional communities. In any theory of economic competition, there is no doubt that in some areas, if you applied strict competition theory, there would be no suppliers of goods and services in many areas of rural and regional Australia, no suppliers at all.
—For example?
—Well, Telstra is a prime example. You could have so-called perfect competition in telecommunications, Senator McGauran—and we notice your pledge to sell off the remaining 51 per cent of Telstra—but there are times when it is necessary for government to provide those services, either directly or indirectly, through publicly owned business enterprises.
—And Australia Post.
—Exactly, Senator Murray. Australia Post is another classic example. I do note again the policy trend by the Liberal-National Party—we will come to you again shortly, Senator McGauran—to want to deregulate Australia Post, to bring about the reduction, the slow strangulation, of postal services in rural and regional Australia. So it is important when applying any economic theory to ensure that it serves the interests of the community. And I do not just mean the community in the big cities of Australia, nor big business; I mean the communities right throughout Australia and particularly communities in rural and regional areas. We do know that the Liberal Party does represent the major urban cities of Australia. It is a hardline economic rationalist party. It does not shy away from that. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, boast that they are radical economic reformers. Indeed, that is one of their overriding ideologies. They worship this approach.
The same could not have been said about the National Party, certainly some years ago. What strikes you about the National Party, up until recent times anyway, is that in representing rural and regional areas they did have concern about the economic and social consequences of competition in rural and regional communities. Indeed, the National Party's basic philosophy was one of socialism in the bush. So long as socialism existed 100 kilometres from the GPO in each capital city, the National Party was pleased to subscribe to socialism. That was one of their major ideologies. That was in the past. Take their past leaders—Mr Anthony, Mr Sinclair, Mr McEwen. Mr McEwen would roll over in his grave at the National Party today. The National Party, which supposedly is there to represent the interests of Australians living in rural and regional communities, is a total captive of the Liberal Party. It is the total doormat of the Liberal Party, and Senator McGauran knows this himself. The National Party in Victoria receives four per cent of the vote and, in order to survive, it has done a deal with the Liberal Party to ensure that whoever is the National Party candidate is No. 2 on the Senate ticket. That is why the National Party exists today: it is only to survive; it is not about representing people in rural and regional Australia.
I should conclude my remarks by saying that Senator Murray said that competition policy is good for big business and the cities at the expense of small business and the regions. I only wish, Senator Murray, that you had thought more about that fundamental before you signed up to the goods and services tax. I only wish that you had thought long and hard about the impact on small business and rural and regional areas in particular. We have heard a lot from the Democrats about competition policy in recent times, but I am struggling to recall the Democrats asking a question, proposing a matter of public importance, or raising in debate the horrendous impact of the goods and services tax—which you have inflicted, together with the Liberal-National Party, on the Australian community.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2001-03-27,"—Like my colleagues before me, I welcome this debate on a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Murray. From the outset, I would like to reject Senator Sherry's provocative words that the National Party has supported or does support socialism in the bush. I utterly reject that proposition. It has never been true, least of all today. We support services in the bush. That is the difference, Senator Sherry. You may have made a Freudian slip about yourself, but we support services to the bush. Senator Murray's motion today, as it has been read out by previous speakers, calls for the rejection by the Australian public of the current national competition policy, the scrapping of competition policy, and the abolition of national competition policy. 
I am sure that Senator Murray has been disappointed by the contributions thus far by the opposition. Whatever he expected to get out of this debate, he will be very disappointed. Senator Sherry and Senator Cook made the only two contributions, and they spoke down completely the positives of competition. They did not recognise any benefits at all in regard to competition. Senator Sherry even qualified the most obvious benefit of competition, in the area of electricity reform. You even qualified that there were benefits in that particular area. So I am sure that the lack of the intellectual debate and rigour that Senator Murray thought he would get on this particular motion has been a great disappointment to him.
I would say two things to Senator Murray. I am surprised now that you have come to this conclusion, because that is not the conclusion that you came to when the Senate Select Committee on Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy inquired into this matter. You were a member of that committee, as I was. You came to a far more qualified conclusion than you have today, Senator Murray. You never told us, in your most esoteric contribution here today, why you suddenly changed from supporting the recommendations of that committee inquiry and are now calling for the absolute abolition of national competition policy.
The Senate committee inquiry was a good one, a perfectly balanced one. It recognised the full benefits of competition and where they have worked. And I understand that, quite rightly, the committee made recommendations as to where improvements can be made and recognised where the policy has been greatly misunderstood. I notice that Senator Mackay was on that committee too. She has not come in and made her contribution on this, which surprises me greatly; instead, the opposition have wheeled in the two finance experts, Senator Sherry and Senator Cook. So I ask you that question—perhaps you can answer it in the corridors of the parliament.
The second proposition I would put to you, Senator Murray, is: if you are calling for the scrapping of competition policy, then no doubt you are calling for the scrapping of the ACCC. For heavens sake, what has been more successful than Allan Fels's ACCC? He is a household name, a crusader for the consumer. He has a proven record. Professor Fels, under the powers that we have given him—only during the last parliamentary week we strengthened the Trade Practices Act to give him even more powers and strengthened section 50 of the mergers and takeover act in relation to unconscionable conduct—has the resources to take on the big end of town, which he has done, in the name of consumers, in the name of competition, and brought about the benefits that competition can bring. I would extrapolate that you are calling for the abolition of the ACCC.
I think Senator Ferguson put it very well in his contribution when he said that really the Australian public do not know what we are all talking about in here when we debate the formalities of competition policy, public benefit and all that; that it is just an intellectual debate. Senator Murray is a Rhodes scholar; he loves to bring intellectual debate to this chamber. But the general public do not really know what we are talking about. As Senator Ferguson said, this is a matter of everyday life to the Australian public. They are not into the intellectualism that Senator Murray brings, and Senator Sherry tries to bring, to this debate. The essence of the matter is that competition policy is to break up monopolies, in particular government utilities. Who could deny over the years, until the introduction of the formality of this competition policy, the inefficiencies and the overpricing of government monopolies and government utilities? Householders now have choice. 
—You didn't mention one rural industry.
—No, I am thinking particularly of the state electricity authority of Victoria. There was no greater milking cow for a state government than the state electricity authority of Victoria. They milked the tariffs as a tax to go into their coffers and, therefore, the authority became more inefficient as time went on. The state electricity authority of Victoria and the union movement—you could almost check it by your watch—ensured that around Christmas time each year there was a blackout across the state. Since the authority was privatised and broken up for competition prices have come down and we have not had a blackout in the state of Victoria. That is particularly what I am thinking of. The consumers now are being given choices: they have a choice as to what phone line they will pick up, what tap they will turn on and what light they will switch on.
My point is that, in regard to competition policy, yes, of course, we all agree there has to be an underpinning of public interest that takes in not only economic considerations but also social considerations in regard to employment. But the only fault there is that that has not been properly understood; there has been confusion. It is up to governments—past, present and future—to better sell that so that they can better sell competition policy.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-03-27,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Excise Arrangements) Bill 2000 ensures that excise administration is transferred from the customs office to the Australian Taxation Office. The transfer actually took place many months ago, and this bill simply regularises what has been an administrative reality. The Labor Party does not, of course, oppose the transfer. Once again, though, this bill represents another example of the Assistant Treasurer's continuing incompetence in the administration of his portfolio. Once again, this chamber is being asked to give legislative effect to a government administrative change that was made some time back. Is it any wonder that we have the level of community revolt against the GST and against this government more generally, when it has ministers that act like this? 
Continued bungling and incompetence are the order of the day here; so we are now being asked to clean up the mess. Senator Kemp should be thankful that the opposition is so cooperative and helpful and ready to assist him. What we are witnessing, though, is a government that has not got its eye on the ball, a government that is not prepared to understand the detail of its own tax administration system so as to address it in a way that plugs the leakage of the revenue base. We have already seen how this government is soft on tax cheats in the top end of town, as witnessed by the dumping of the bill that would tax trusts as companies. Does this really come as any surprise, given that the discretionary trust is the tax avoidance vehicle of choice for most of the Howard government front bench, led by none other than Senator Heffernan, the Prime Minister's personal selection for Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet?
Only last week we saw another government backdown on key measures seeking to shore up the revenue base. But because they would have impacted on the big end of town they were dumped. This is a government that claws back GST compensation from pensioners but lets its Liberal mates pillage and plunder the tax system. Let us get this clear: pensioners pay the GST and watch their compensation getting clawed back while the government does nothing to ensure that its mates at the top end of town pay their fair share of tax.
This is a government that has allowed general tax administration to suffer because of its ideological fixation with the GST. Excise is simply one area where this has occurred. Labor forced the government to lift its game in the excise administration area specifically on the question of fuel substitution and in clamping down on the illicit tobacco market. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Kelvin Thomson, has been particularly vigilant in exposing the government in these areas and he rightly deserves much of the credit for the tightening of the law in this area which occurred last year.
This is not the only area of law where the government and Senator Kemp have been asleep at the wheel. In the last sitting, we had the farce of the aircraft noise levy exposed where the government has unlawfully been collecting a tax to the value of almost $200 million. He had to introduce a bill to retrospectively fix up the mistake. Labor, as a responsible opposition, supported that legislation. But what do we find from the Howard government and all its ministers? We find blame shifting again. It is not the government accepting responsibility for this but the Treasury. We have seen the Prime Minister accepting credit for cuts in interest rates but blaming the Reserve Bank when they put them up. This is a Prime Minister who claims credit when everything is going well but finds everyone else to blame when things are going wrong. I will now discuss the issues raised in the opposition's second reading amendment, which has been circularised.
 (Senator Knowles)—Would you care to move that amendment, Senator Cook?
—I think that is probably a necessary precondition before I discuss it! I move the opposition amendment on sheet 2157:
At the end of the motion, add:
		""but the Senate condemns the Government for:
	(a)	failing to listen to the community concerning the GST impact on excise levels;
	(b)	opposing Labor's private member's bill giving a fuel excise cut to motorists yet condoning a Government backbencher's private member's bill that would tear up the Intergovernmental Agreement signed with the States;
	(c)	belatedly reducing only a portion of its GST fuel excise windfall merely because it is in a state of panic; and 
	(d)	its poor administration of the excise regime"". 
Firstly, for months now, since the introduction of the GST, the Australian motoring public have been calling for relief from excessively high petrol prices. It is true that part of the reason for higher fuel prices was what happened to the international price of oil. But what is also undeniable is that the other reason petrol prices were forced up more than they needed to be was that this government broke a promise in relation to the GST. The promise was simple and it was unequivocal: the GST will not put up the price of petrol. Further, the Treasurer said that the government would ensure that the excise on petrol fell by an amount equivalent to the amount the GST would go up by. But what happened when the government implemented its so-called policy? Bear in mind that this was the policy they enunciated during the election campaign: `The petrol price will not go up due to the GST and we will reduce the excise by an equivalent amount.' What did they do, though? Through sleight of hand the Prime Minister imposed a GST that put the price of petrol up 8.2c per litre but reduced the excise by only 6.7c a litre. This out of touch Prime Minister pocketed 1.5c on every litre of petrol sold. He implemented a non-core promise but just failed to tell the Australian motoring public about it. That was a huge deceit of the Australian motoring public.
Interestingly, the Treasurer went missing in action when this announcement was made. He flew to Paris and left it to the hapless Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Fahey, to make the announcement. Mr Costello knew he had broken his promise and he fled the country; he fled the country as he was slugging Australian motorists on every litre of petrol and breaking a promise that he swore hand on heart during the election campaign he would honour. This Prime Minister and Treasurer cannot go to the electorate and promise unequivocally that the price of petrol will not go up as a result of the GST, dud them when it comes to the implementation and be allowed to get away with it, so the ALP mounted a campaign on this issue—as did the motoring organisations, as did outraged people in the public—seeking to have the government honour its promise. If, in the lead-up to the campaign, the government was telling Treasury of its policy and Treasury was looking at the government's promise, which was to reduce excise by an equivalent amount when it reduced it by only 6.7c per litre, then there had to be a windfall for the government, a windfall that was not budgeted for. Our argument always was that relief could be given on petrol without affecting the budget because it was a figure never budgeted for. It could not have been, if the Treasury was taking notice of what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister promised. We were saying that this was not a hit to the budget; that it was a windfall that should be given back to Australian motorists.
But the windfall did not stop there. The first of the windfalls was the 1.5c per litre. Remember that the price of petrol at which the government struck the decision about excise was a strike price which the government said was 90c a litre. Subsequent to that decision, the price of petrol was consistently around the $1 mark, so there was a further windfall by virtue of the fact that the strike rate was higher again than would have been budgeted for. In addition to that, for every cent that the price of petrol goes up the government pockets one-eleventh of it, because of the GST—the GST being a retail tax. The excise tax is a flat rate tax but the GST is a retail tax. So, if the price goes up and if it goes up above what the government was projecting it would go up, there is another windfall. That is not to mention the other windfall: what the government gets from petroleum resource rent tax. The government was telling motorists that it could not afford to give them petrol price relief but was pocketing not just one windfall but several.
This government has not come clean on the extent of the fuel tax windfall and to this day refuses to do so. It is a disgrace that it has not, because it promised budget honesty. We have been asking for the assumptions on which Treasury and the government based their projections and forecasts on petrol and we still do not have them. Why? Because we know they are hiding something. We know there is a windfall; what we do not know is the exact amount of the windfall. It is for this reason that Labor introduced a bill into the parliament through the Leader of the Opposition to get the government, as the first instalment of returning the windfall, to freeze the February adjustment on petrol excise. 
—What about abolishing indexation?
—We also established an inquiry into what is going on in the industry and how the government is ripping off Australian motorists. I have been interjected upon: what about the indexation increases? I understand that a bill is coming before the chamber later this week, probably Thursday, in which we will vote for the abolition of those indexation steps. But I do point out to the interjector that our private member's bill—a bill I personally introduced in this chamber on 1 February to abolish the first indexation step—well preceded the backflip by the Prime Minister on petrol. This chamber could have voted for it but we were faced with the odd occasion on the last sitting Thursday that we convened of the Prime Minister announcing his backflip on petrol and government senators speaking against our bill. If they had voted on it, that would have removed the indexation for 1 February immediately and we would have had the relief of that from several weeks ago and not be waiting for the legislation this Thursday. But I do digress because of the interjection. Let me return to what I was saying.
We have also established an inquiry into what is occurring in the industry and how the government is ripping off Australian motorists. We tried to get the Democrats to agree to that inquiry and to do it through the Senate. They would not do that, so Labor established its own inquiry. That inquiry has visited now over 30 locations around the country and taken formal submissions. It was that inquiry that recommended to the parliamentary Labor Party the basis for the bill I talked about before—and that is why the inquiry will now continue. We also want the inquiry to address a number of other issues. First of all, we want to know the full extent of the windfall because, as the second instalment, our commitment was to establish the extent of the windfall, the precise amount, and to look at options for returning that windfall, in addition to the freeze last February.
We also want to look at the city-country divide, which is widening under the GST. We now have a situation where people in regional Australia pay more tax on their petrol than do people in city Australia. This is because the GST is on the retail price. So, where the margin is wider, the GST compounds the cost—and it is worse in rural and regional Australia than in the cities. Everyone knows that people in rural and regional Australia pay bigger margins, not just on petrol but on many goods and services. Under the old system everyone paid the same amount of tax, regardless of where they lived. Remember the Prime Minister's Nyngan declaration? When the Prime Minister went on tour in January last year and started to see the anguish in regional Australia, he said that nothing the government did would see services taken from the regions and that they would not seek to widen the city-country divide. Yet six months later they introduced, by deceit through their broken GST promise, a mechanism that—in addition to that deceit—widened the gap in tax now paid in regional Australia versus in the city.
It is also important to note that nothing in the Prime Minister's announcement regarding his backflip on petrol addressed the very important issue of LPG, which is used a lot in regional Australia and will be used increasingly, with the onset of winter, for heating in the colder states of Australia. It is encouraged as an environmentally sound substitute for petrol; but now we are seeing a situation where the price of LPG has skyrocketed as well. LPG took the whole hit with the GST. There was no reduction: there was a total increase as a result of the GST. Yet nothing has been announced on that by the government in its petrol backflip.
When we proposed the establishment of an inquiry, what was the Prime Minister's response? He said that petrol had been `inquired into to death' and that we do not need another inquiry. He said that there had been something like 40 inquiries. He was totally dismissive. Yet, when he did his backflip, what did he announce? Apart from the backflip, apart from adopting Labor's strategy, he announced another inquiry. How can you take this Prime Minister seriously? That is the question that has to be asked. This is a Prime Minister who said that you could not give increased funding to roads as well as give a cut in petrol excise, because that would wreck the budget. This is a Prime Minister who said that we do not need another inquiry into petrol—a Prime Minister who is out of touch and not listening to the Australian public when they are saying, `Please, Prime Minister, do something about petrol.' 
We have had some of the Prime Minister's backbench in revolt. They were heroes at home in their electorates, calling for relief on petrol prices, but when they came back here to Canberra they were cowards. They were running around their constituencies saying, `Isn't the price of petrol terrible? We're going to Canberra to tell the Prime Minister that he has to do something,' and then they wimped out when they got here. When Labor sought to introduce legislation to give relief, which was the freeze on excise that they were telling their constituents they supported, they would not vote for the Labor proposal. We made sure, though, that their constituents knew that. In every circumstance where a member of the coalition had been urging petrol price relief at home but had voted against it in Canberra, we made sure that their constituents knew about it—and we believe that those constituents will remember that when they come to vote at the next election.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2001-03-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak on the ARPANSA quarterly report, the report of the chief executive officer of ARPANSA, for the period 1 October to 31 December 2000. This report covers a number of operations in relation to Australian radiation protection and nuclear safety issues. Covering performance, it obviously deals with everything from uniformity of radiation protection frameworks through to regulation and international liaison.
My particular interest relates to page 8 of this report in relation to the replacement reactor site licence. I prefer to refer to that as the new nuclear reactor, given that it is a new nuclear reactor that is being proposed and will be developed as a consequence of this government's decision—the tender, of course, has already been granted for that. But the report states that ARPANSA reviewed ANSTO's compliance with the site licence, based on the quarterly reporting requirement. I also note that ARPANSA has assessed that all licence conditions continue to be met by ANSTO. However, I think we are all entitled to ask whether ARPANSA has copies of all the contracts—which goes to the broader question of how effective ARPANSA can be in assessing ANSTO's performance if contracts are in doubt and there is no public disclosure of new contracts. This, of course, relates to some of the issues that I raised in question time today and to certain issues that cast doubt on the legitimacy of government contracts in relation to nuclear waste, and the shipment of spent fuel in particular.
In recent days we have heard the decision of the French court which saw the imposition of a ban on the unloading of Australian nuclear waste. The Cherbourg court ruled the storage of waste on French soil was illegal under the French radioactive waste management act of 1991. We were expecting that there would be a decision overnight as to whether or not an appeal of that decision would be upheld. I believe it has been upheld and that a final decision has been deferred until 3 April. No doubt that casts serious doubts over the legitimacy of contracts that have been signed between ANSTO and Cogema.
Senator Minchin, on behalf of government, should be a little more concerned than he was indicating today. In my questions to the minister today on nuclear and radiation issues in Australia, I asked the government about the so-called two-minute treaty that has been initialled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and the government. Senator Minchin was unable to answer some of the questions I asked him, such as the following. How long had this process of discussion of a treaty been going on? What preparations had been made by our government relating to the sensitive matter of nuclear waste? For example, does the treaty actually include issues other than nuclear waste? What are they? Was the ANSTO proposal, the poorly planned nuclear reactor proposal, driving the acquisition of that particular treaty? Why was the process of the treaty done so hastily? 
—Nonsense. It wasn't poorly planned.
—I think even Senator Tierney has to acknowledge the comments in relation to international matters that were made on this issue to a Senate committee by the first assistant secretary of the International Security Division from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He was saying that treaties of this nature take up to six months to debate and discuss and be resolved. On 22 February the minister claimed publicly that it had not even been started. What do we see now? A month later we actually have a treaty under way. Those unanswered questions are still unanswered. However, I note that I did prompt Minister Downer to get a press release out this afternoon, so at least the Democrats have forced the hand of the government on this issue. 
The government has actually responded now, a little wary of criticisms that it is being a little secretive and that the processes have been anything but open and accountable. Certainly the people in the Sutherland Shire, which I am sure Senator Forshaw will talk about shortly, had no knowledge of the treaty and its contents and have good reason to be concerned, given that the new nuclear reactor will be in their region. I welcome the ARPANSA quarterly report. It highlights some issues but certainly there are more. I cannot wait to hear explanations from government as to the legitimacy of those contracts—not just between ANSTO and Cogema but also the INVAP contract with Australia.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency</title>,Documents,21,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-03-27,"—I rise to make some comments on the quarterly report of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. I follow on from the comments of Senator Stott Despoja. For a number of years the government now has treated with disdain any requests for information for public accountability with respect to these important issues regarding the Lucas Heights reactor and the proposed new reactor. The government continues to bury its head in the sand and ignore an increasing array of problems that are arising.
In this ARPANSA report there is reference to the replacement reactor site licence. It has become clear, particularly through the processes of the Senate select committee looking into this issue, that before a licence to construct a new reactor is issued the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency will be requiring very strict undertakings that issues of waste disposal have been resolved. It has also become clear that there is no strategy in place for the long-term treatment and disposal of the nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights. Minister Minchin and other spokespersons for the government and for ANSTO have said, `We have a system in place. The system is that we take the spent fuel rods from Lucas Heights and we ship them to France. They will be reprocessed there under the contract with Cogema and then in 10 or 15 years time they will be brought back to Australia and will be stored in some waste facility.' That strategy is in tatters. 
I remind the Senate that it was only a couple of years ago that ANSTO and the government were saying we had a strategy in place, but at that time they were not being sent to France; they were being sent to Dounreay in Scotland. That was the plan then. What happened? The government in the United Kingdom decided to close down the reprocessing plant at Dounreay and said, `We will not take any more of Australia's spent fuel rods. We will not process them.' ANSTO said, `Oh, well, we will go and talk to the French.' They entered into a contract with Cogema. The problem now is that a court in France has upheld an action by Greenpeace and said that there is no provision to reprocess that waste in France and that it is, at the moment, illegal. So those spent fuel rods are sitting on a boat, off the coast of France presumably, with no home to go to—nowhere to be reprocessed. 
Similarly, this government has entered into a contract with INVAP, the Argentinian company, for waste from the new reactor potentially to be reprocessed or conditioned in Argentina, but serious questions have been raised as to whether or not that country can accept nuclear waste from Australia. Minister Minchin says, `Yes, I have been told by the Argentinian government that there are no problems.' Having seen what happened with Dounreay in Scotland and having now seen what has happened with Cogema in France, you have to seriously question whether the strategy for the new reactor will stand up or whether, more likely, it will fail as it has failed in the past.
The government has taken absolutely no notice of early reports which have said that the issue of waste disposal has to be resolved before any new reactor should be built. Again, Minister Minchin bowed to public pressure and to pressure from his own state colleagues in the coalition in South Australia and said, `We will not put the waste facility in South Australia.' The problem you now have is that no other state wants that nuclear waste facility either and the likelihood is that it will continue to be stored for the long term at Lucas Heights. That is a situation that the people of the Sutherland Shire will simply not accept. I seek leave to continue my remarks. 
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency</title>,Documents,21,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-03-27,"—On the 8 March here in an adjournment debate Senator Mason gave a very idolising speech on President Reagan reaching his ninetieth birthday. As I listened to Senator Mason, it struck me once again—as it has on many occasions in my political career—how few heroes the Australian conservatives have. The fact that we hear Senator Mason from Queensland talking about President Ronald Reagan in an admiring and idolising way just confirmed for me how much they lack heroes.
But I will come back to that shortly because it would be wrong not to make comments on Ronald Reagan's presidency. As a number of people may be aware, particularly in America, one of the things that does stand out about Ronald Reagan and his administration was the despicable involvement of his administration—even though he denied it himself—in that terrible Iran-Contra deal. To remind people about the deal I have here an excerpt from the Independent Counsel's summary on the Contra deal where he says that one of the surviving crew members of the plane that was shot down or fell out of the sky, an American called Eugene Hasenfus, when taken into captivity stated that he was employed by the CIA. In 1986, not more than six years after the Americans were publicly humiliated by the forces that took over their embassy in Tehran, that administration or people connected to it were selling arms to Iran and from the deal that was made there they were giving money back to the Contras in Nicaragua so that they could conduct an illegal war against the government of that day.
—They were not exactly democratic.
—They were not. I would not say they were democratic, Senator McGauran, but the Congress of the United States had said that there should be no assistance given to them and that should have been enough for their elected administration. However, because of what Ronald Reagan had started up, they were involved in this diversion. This diversion was against the will of the Congress and obviously of the people of United States. And the senior levels of the Reagan administration were connected to that grubby deal. I cannot imagine how any American would have allowed their government to even entertain the idea of selling any arms to Iran after what Iran had done to their American personnel in the Tehran embassy in 1979. However, they let that happen, and I suppose that is something that will be commented on later.  
Senator Mason said that President Ronald Reagan had promoted the `cause of human rights, freedom and democracy'. This was the same administration that was supplying money and arms to the Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan, and we are seeing the results of that today. This was the same administration that was supplying assistance to the corrupt and discredited Marcos regime in the Philippines. This was the same administration that was supplying assistance and support to the repressive regime in Chile under President Pinochet. I wonder how Senator Mason can come into this place and say that former President Ronald Reagan was indeed a supporter of these basic human rights and freedoms. Clearly, he was not and he demonstrated that. 
President Reagan in one of his speeches misquoted a fellow 90-year-old former president, John Quincy Adams. He misquoted him when he said, `Facts are stupid things.' In fact, John Quincy Adams said, `Facts are stubborn things,' and that is exactly what we have seen with President Reagan and this eulogising of him by Senator Mason. I come back to this point, and I am pretty sure that you will agree with me. When you look at the conservatives you see the lack of heroes that they have. When I was growing up in the 1960s my heroes were on Disneyland—Swamp Fox and Adventureland—and we were taught at school about Old Shep and the Man from Snowy River. I wonder what the conservatives were brought up on. You look at what they look at now. They have to look to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Look at what they do to Malcolm Fraser. Look what they have done to that leader. Irrespective of what we might think about him, what do they do for Malcolm Fraser? They vilify him. They terrorise him. They put him down. Not once do they look after their leaders. Where do you go to find one political leader on the conservative side that has done anything that they can look up to?
The National Party might have someone like Sir Earl Page or Sir Arthur Fadden. But what about the other non-Labor side of politics? Where are their heroes? Where are their Curtins? Where are their Chifleys? Where are their Whitlams? Where are their Hawkes? Where are their Keatings? They were the men I followed, those last prime ministers. They were our heroes, and we treat them as heroes. What do you do to your former leaders? You vilify Malcolm Fraser. I remember quite clearly the way they used to snicker about Billy McMahon and about Billy Snedden. What did they say about Gorton? What did they do about him?
—Who?
—Exactly. Senator McGauran, you may recall Sir John Gorton was a Prime Minister of this country and head of the Liberal Party. How do they look after their leadership? They do not, because they are petty-minded, little-minded and narrow-minded people. They have no respect for history. You only have to look at the way the Prime Minister is treating his former leaders who are still alive now. I hope he gets to see the way he will be treated. You only have to see the gaping divisions within the Liberal Party now to see how John Howard is going to be remembered when they get the opportunity to write his history.
Look at someone like Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan pursued supply-side economics—something which you may say that the Prime Minister has indeed pursued himself. His government cut taxes and reduced inflation, but at the same time they never cut spending. If you look at the 13 March edition of the Bulletin, Max Walsh's article quotes the independent Institute of Public Affairs. The Institute of Public Affairs says that the government have increased foreign debt by over $100 billion since they got into power. They are spending more and they are taxing more than any government in the history of this country, and that is the legacy John Howard will leave. That is the legacy that some of the people over there will try to defend. But I can tell you—as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy—that as soon as John Howard is kicked out of office you will have a lot of ragtag rabble people over there trying to bring him down.
I disagree with John Howard on almost everything, but at least I will respect my leader and respect the Prime Minister. The coalition will not. They will go after him. They will take him down peg by peg. You could list now the number of members and senators who will go after him. It goes back to my original point: they have no heroes. They will never have any heroes because of the way they are inward looking. It is only us in the Labor Party who have been able to provide heroes. As flawed as some of them may have been, at least we have our heroes. At least we can look back and say that these men and women made a contribution to our nation. The coalition cannot. They even take apart their most recent leader, Malcolm Fraser. He was almost shown the prime ministerial door. Senator McGauran did not even know who Sir John Gorton was, and then you go back to the rest of them. We are lucky that we can look to heroes in this country. We are lucky that we have our own political heroes in the Labor movement. They have none in the coalition or on the conservative side. They have to look to people overseas, like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. ",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Political Heroes</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
