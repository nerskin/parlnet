"PRESIDENT, The",,2016-10-11,"



The PRESIDENT
 (12:31):  Yesterday I informed the Senate that I had received letters from Senator Griff and Senator Hanson seeking appointment to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network. There are two nominations for one position on the committee, the position to be nominated by any minority group or independent senators. In accordance with standing orders, a ballot will now be held to determine which of the two senators who have nominated is to be appointed. Before proceeding to the ballot, we will ring the bells for four minutes.




The bells having 
be
en rung––




The PRESIDENT:  The Senate will now proceed to ballot. Ballot papers will be distributed to each senator, and you are asked to write the name of the senator that you prefer for the committee position, being either Senator Griff or Senator Hanson. I invite Senator Kakoschke-Moore and Senator Burston to act as scrutineers.




A ballot having been taken—




The PRESIDENT:  The result of the ballot being 35 votes for Senator Griff and 30 votes for Senator Hanson, Senator Griff is therefore elected as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network, nominated by a minority group or independent senators.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:47):  I rise to speak in support of this bill. This bill amends the thresholds so that the rate of tax payable on taxable incomes from $80,001 to $87,000 for individuals is 32.5 per cent. The government announced this measure in the 2016-17 budget and Labor supported it. It means that individuals with taxable incomes from $80,001 and up to $87,000 will now be subject to the lower rate of tax of 32.5 per cent rather than the rate of tax of 37 per cent which currently applies to taxable income over $80,000. It will provide a maximum tax cut of $315 per annum on incomes of $87,000 and above. 


With this bill, Labor is pleased to be supporting modest, sustainable tax relief for up to 3.1 million Australians and their families. However, despite bipartisan agreement, the Turnbull government has still managed to make a mess of its implementation. As David Crowe reported in The Australian on 2 September, millions of workers will have to wait until the middle of next year to receive all of the benefits. This is despite the government's assurances in May that workers would receive the gains far earlier. Mr Crowe reported that:


Workers will not see the lower rates applied to their salaries for at least another month, which means they will not collect the cut due to them for the first quarter of the financial year until they lodge their tax returns after July 2017.


Yet, on budget night, Mr Morrison proudly boasted he would deliver income tax cuts from 1 July this year. He said:


From 1 July this year, we will increase the upper limit for the middle income tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000 per year.


Yet the government did not introduce legislation to ensure that the tax cuts would start from 1 July this year before the election.


When asked on ABC Radio how the how the tax cuts would be introduced by 1 July, given that the government was unlikely to be able to legislate them before prior to the election, the Prime Minister said that:


That is really up to the Labor Party whether it's legislated, but certainly it will be covered administratively after the election, we expect the Parliament to come back and ensure that all of the legislation supporting the Budget measures is passed.


Yet in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, prepared by the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Finance, it became clear that the tax cuts could not be delivered from 1 July as promised. Instead it said: 


(T)he Commissioner has indicated that the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan — targeted personal income tax relief measure requires the relevant legislation to be passed before the change will be incorporated into the income tax withholding schedules.


We now have confirmation from the ATO that the income tax cuts scheduled for 1 July 2016 have only come into effect on October 1, and Australian taxpayers will have to wait until they lodge their tax return after 1 July 2017 for the extra tax they have paid for three months to be credited back to them. Labor immediately gave bipartisan support to these income tax cuts, so there was no excuse for the government not to legislate these straight after the budget in May this year. It took five months from when the Treasurer promised these income tax cuts in the budget for him to actually introduce the required legislation into the parliament.


 This government is so incompetent that, even with clear and unambiguous Labor support on budget night for these tax cuts, the Prime Minister and Treasurer still manage to fail in the basic task of introducing and passing legislation through the parliament required for them to take effect before the election. The Tax Commissioner confirmed in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, that these tax cuts would not be delivered from 1 July as promised by the Treasurer, but instead would only be implemented when the relevant legislation had passed the parliament. 


Scott Morrison must outline when this same advice from the ATO was received by the Prime Minister, himself or his office. This advice goes to the very basis on which the Prime Minister and Treasurer continued to publicly argue, including throughout the election campaign that the income tax cuts would flow 'from 1 July'.


Instances of ineptness by this Treasurer and this government in undertaking their core responsibilities have regrettably not been rare. Other recent examples of the Treasurer's mishandling of policy include: presenting a bill to the parliament that miscounted the savings in the omnibus legislation after weeks of telling us it would be $6.5 billion in savings when in fact the savings were less than $6 billion; recent media reports exposing how he and the Prime Minister got rolled in cabinet by the conservatives in their own party on their desire to pursue reform of negative gearing; being forced to further delay the introduction of savings attached to the government's super package following an embarrassing stalemate, again, with his own backbenchers, and despite the government making an 'iron-clad' commitment to the electorate during the election.


We also need to remember the context in which these tax cuts are being prosecuted by the government. Scott Morrison has offered up this modest tax cut for those on incomes over $80,000 as a crude cover for his cuts that have affected the cost of living of every single low- and middle-income Australian. The government's double dealing in the budget cannot go unremarked upon. Yes, the government is seeking to provide some limited relief to Australian taxpayers, but this in no way makes up for the sustained assault of the Abbott-Turnbull government through its budgets on services Australian people rely upon. The government can try as it likes to provide a fig leaf for its regressive agenda—which has been consistent, irrespective of who happened to be Prime Minister at the time—but no sleight-of-hand tricks can conceal the essential truth of that broader agenda. The 2016 budget was merely the last confirmation of an approach unchanged since 2014. It contained the same $80 billion of cuts to schools and hospitals, the same cuts to working- and middle-class families, the same cuts to Medicare, to child care, to aged care, to universities, to paid parental leave, to pensioners and to carers.


Labor does support the tax cut contained in this bill, but we acknowledge that three-quarters of Australian workers will receive no tax relief from the 2016 budget and that those same Australian workers who miss out will disproportionately bear the brunt of this government's cuts to schools, hospitals and Medicare and to the family supports they rely upon. It is a simple truth that you do not create the jobs of the future by cutting education, making health care inaccessible and unaffordable, underinvesting in infrastructure and making broadband slower.


Labor does believe in delivering a fair and sustainable tax system. We understand that this should provide incentives for all Australians to work and engage in productive enterprise. But it must also guarantee adequate revenue to fund the proper role of government, including quality public services that all Australians deserve.


Maintaining public confidence in Australia's tax system is critical and depends on simplicity, transparency and everyone paying their fair share—something this Treasurer and government have manifestly failed to grasp or deliver. In its recent publication Choosing opportunity, the McKell Institute outlines in a comprehensive fashion why, as policymakers, we must be concerned with the impact of tax and budgetary policy and what it can achieve. As the Choosing opportunity report makes clear, there are issues that demand our urgent attention. In Australia, inequality is on the rise. The middle class is being squeezed. Dignity in retirement is uncertain. The gender pay gap remains effectively unaltered since 1979. And, for a generation of young Australians, the dream of home ownership is simply way beyond reach.


Labor wants Australia to succeed. We want a tax system for a growing, job-creating, wealth-creating economy. As Bill Shorten said in his recent speech on inequality to the McKell Institute, Labor is concerned with issues such as reforming negative gearing, needs based funding for schools, affordable university and equality for women not just as totemic indicators but as economic levers. Used correctly, they are creators of growth, not programs paid for by forgoing growth. They are about investing in lifting people into work and in supporting their full participation in our society and our economy.


Labor supports tax relief for working Australians, but we will never walk away from properly funding schools or Medicare. Labor will never slash Australia's safety net in a misguided effort to provide tax cuts for big multinationals or fight tooth and nail to keep tax loopholes open. We are genuinely forced to ponder what could be achieved if Malcolm Turnbull stood up for everyday Australians instead of trying to implement reckless and unsustainable tax cuts for big business.


In saying that, Labor has and will work cooperatively with the government when what it proposes is reasonable. We have proven that with our principled negotiations on the omnibus savings bill, and we have taken the sensible approach of supporting other budget measures which merit support. This includes supporting the very welcome restoration of Labor's low-income superannuation contribution, an initiative to support low-income earners but particularly women, which the government has renamed but restored in the 2016 budget, three years after announcing its abolition.


Although I canvassed this at some time in the chamber during the last sitting, we are similarly pleased that the government has seen the light on our reforms to tobacco excise to combat the serious health and economic impact tobacco addiction has on the Australian community. With a significant fiscal challenge ahead of us, I invite the government to continue in this vein—to adopt more of our positive initiatives that deliver for ordinary Australians while fairly and sustainably improving the budget bottom line. I can even helpfully direct senators opposite to some other measures that they ought to be considering.


The government should take another look at and reconsider its position on our proposed reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The careful, calibrated reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax that we took to the election recognised that far too many working- and middle-class families are increasingly being priced out of the housing market. The negative impacts this circumstance has on intergenerational equity, economic growth and the Commonwealth's fiscal position require the urgent attention of this government. Labor's proposal ends what are poorly targeted and clearly unsustainable tax subsidies. By limiting negative gearing to new dwellings, we would help put the Australian dream of home ownership back within reach and simultaneously provide significant improvement, over the forward estimates and beyond, to the budget.


The other key measure that most evidently deserves the government's consideration is the package of superannuation reforms Labor took to the election. When the government's own Financial System Inquiry finds that 10 per cent of Australians receive 38 per cent of Australia's super tax concession, more than the combined benefit of the bottom 70 per cent of Australians, it is patently clear that the system is unbalanced and unviable. This is particularly evidenced when the same inquiry concedes that these tax concessions are unlikely to reduce future age pension expenditure significantly. Without action, the cost to the taxpayer of superannuation earnings tax concessions or forgone budget revenue will almost double over the next four years, from $11.8 billion in '14-15 to $22.4 billion in '17-18 and will continue to grow at a rate that is unsustainable. Labor has proposed a package of superannuation reforms which are fair. They deliver more budget repair than the government's current mess on superannuation and will go a long way towards stemming the ballooning cost to the budget of the existing concessions over the longer term.


In conclusion, I reconfirm to the government: you will have a willing and cooperative partner if you bring into the parliament proposals which meet the test of contributing to budget improvement while making our country a fairer place, and we are pleased to support this bill today.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-10-11,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:59):  Every time we get up to speak in this place it is a privilege because our words and our actions can actually make a difference. They can make a difference on the issues that matter to us and to all Australians. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016, from my personal perspective, is one of the most important pieces of legislation that is going to come to the Senate this year. It is important because it symbolises something that is deeply meaningful to all Australians and in fact to many in the community around the world. It is deeply important because we are now voting on this bill today to sign over $4 billion of Australians' money to the wealthiest Australians in a tax cut.


If you earn over $80,000 in this country, which is 20 per cent of Australians, you are about to be given a tax cut. So 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will not get the benefit of a tax cut. It is important because inequality and tackling inequality are the true moral challenges of our time. I remind senators that our actions, our voices and our vote in the Senate is what matters. Today it shames me that the Labor Party have joined with the Liberal Party to give a tax cut to the most wealthy Australians—Australians like myself who earn over $80,000 and who do not need $6 a week or $315 a year in a tax cut. That money is needed by less wealthy Australians, many of whom are on the breadline and are struggling.


I cannot fathom that Labor has only put up one speaker on this bill today—one speaker who did not even speak out her time. That equates to an allocation of $200 million a minute. How cavalier of Labor to take this issue so casually. We have had no inquiry through the Economics Committee and we have had a rushed process to get a report and a recommendation to pass this bill because Mr Bill Shorten and Mr Chris Bowen decided to side with the Liberal government during the election campaign.


So here we are at the beginning of the 45th Parliament and we have had two pieces of important legislation. Three weeks ago this Senate passed $5 billion in savings because this Prime Minister said that he believed the moral challenge of our time was budget repair and paying down debt. So Labor teamed up with the Liberal Party to take money off single parents, off students, off Newstart recipients and, sadly, off clean energy action in this country to raise $5 billion because they believed the government and they joined with the government in this bid to pay down debt. What are they doing today? Out of the $5 billion that they ripped off ordinary Australians, they are now giving $4 billion back to wealthy Australians. Out of the $5 billion of savings that we delivered three weeks ago we are now giving back $4 billion to the wealthiest Australians.


In the 1890s US economists first offered up what was called the horse and sparrow theory. It went along the lines: if you give a horse more oats then there will be more to pass through for the sparrows to enjoy. Give the horse more oats and there will be more to pass through for the sparrows to enjoy. Does that sound familiar? With different waves of enthusiasm across generations since, policymakers have been fed the same foodstuffs as the sparrows. Tax cuts to the wealthiest will trickle down to the benefit of the masses. Apparently, we all win if the richest have even more money to play with. But the evidence tells a different story and it leaves trickle-down economics exposed as a naked claim used to shore up the position of those already enjoying wealth and social position. History shows that the wealthiest do not tend to direct their newfound tax cuts into more consumption. Instead, they either increase savings or plough it into tax advantage investment vehicles like superannuation or negatively-geared investment properties. There is an active and growing consensus around the world that the trickle-down theory should be expunged and never again exhumed. Yet that is exactly what we are doing here today. Not only are we standing up to fight inequality, we are actually adding to it by voting for this bill here today.


Let's look at the political winds that are blowing across this globe, including in this country. For those who saw the US presidential debate yesterday, all the commentary in the mainstream media and social media was about Donald Trump and the rise of the Trump phenomenon in the US. We have talked about the Brexit movement in the UK, and of course there has been a lot of speculation on the rise of my colleagues over here on the other side of the chamber, One Nation. Let me tell you what the thread is that ties all these things together: that thread is inequality. People are feeling like they have been left behind. They are feeling that they have been ignored by their political system and their politicians because the gains and spoils of our economic system across decades of globalisation have not been shared evenly. That is why we are seeing such radical political movements around the world and that is actually what we need to act on. Our entire political system is now under a challenge because of rising inequality and our inability in a place like this to tackle this.


Martin Parkinson recently came out publicly and said that he believed one thing this government needed to do was to look at redistributive policies that help share the spoils of globalisation, especially trade deals. A first-year economic student will tell you about this. It is called the compensatory principles. In theory, the winners should compensate the losers, but that has not happened. In no world that I know have the winners—the big multinational corporations—compensated those workers you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, talked about in this place who have been left behind. That does not happen. It is our role in government to make sure that it does happen. Professor Thomas Piketty, one of the world's most famous economists, is in Sydney this week to talk about inequality, which he sees as a severe challenge for Australia, and the need for new policies to tackle inequality. It is the true moral challenge of our time, and this consensus that we need to do something about it is lapping upon our political shores. The last few months have seen Labor MPs join with the Greens, at least in their public speeches, attacking trickle-down theory with gusto. I have heard this issue talked about during Senate debates in this chamber. We have seen economics spokespeople shifting from being past advocates of tax cuts to staying silent on who benefits from cutting taxes. It even culminated in the opposition leader, Mr Bill Shorten, claiming on the eve of the election that the Turnbull government:


… want Australians to embark upon a radical, expensive experiment in trickle-down economics.


We know how this story ends.


Reagan tried it. Thatcher tried it.


A generation later we got Trump and we got Brexit.


Correct. I totally agree with Mr Shorten. So why is Labor giving a tax cut to the most wealthy Australians today? Anyone who earns over $80,000 gets a measly $6 in their pocket per week—$315. What economic benefit is that going to have in terms of increased consumption? It would be a lot more valuable for those on the breadline—$6 a week would matter. But we are not giving them money. We are giving it to the most wealthy people in this country.


It is not just Mr Shorten who has had strong words on the subject. Mr Chris Bowen has recently given a number of speeches on the need to tackle inequality and trickle-down economics. Words are cheap if they are not backed up with actions. Senators from my home state of Tasmania have spoken about this. Senator Polley told the Senate on 4 May:


I rise to speak about the Turnbull government's budget that puts high-income earners and big business before families, students, patients, pensioners and low-income earners. This morning in my home state of Tasmania, four out of five workers who make less than $80,000 woke up to find out that they were getting nothing from Turnbull's government's budget. Eighty-two per cent of the working population in Bass have been left off the map and will not get a tax cut.


That is exactly what Senator Polley is going to vote for today. On the same day, Senator Singh said:


'Let's protect the higher income earners'—that is the mantra of the Turnbull Liberal government—'and let's do it at the expense of families …


…   …   …


Those who earn more than $80,000 may look forward to this tax cut, but if you look at Tasmania 80 per cent of its workforce earns less than $80,000. That is how out of touch the Turnbull government is with the states that it is supposed to be thinking about and providing for, as it was last night in its budget. Four out of five Tasmanians earn less than $80,000. They are the people who are going to be affected.


I know that Senator Singh is not here, but, if she were, either she would abstain from the vote in the chamber, as she often does on controversial votes, or she would also vote for this. On 9 May, Senator Carol Brown tweeted, 'More than 230,000 Tasmanians will not benefit from the government's tax cuts. This shows Turnbull is out of touch.' I have here a whole list of other MPs who have gone out in a similar vein.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Cameron, let me finish with your leader, Mr Bill Shorten: 'This is a budget that favours millionaires over battlers, high-income earners over families.'



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Well, Senator Cameron, guess who is going to get a tax cut today out of nurses, clerks, store people, aged and disability carers and millionaires. Millionaires—you are correct. Millionaires are going to get the tax cut today. Congratulations, Labor, and congratulations, Liberal Party.


I want to deal with a couple of specific issues that have gone unnoticed about this bill in terms of increasing inequality, gender inequality. Under this bill, women are half as likely to receive the benefits of a tax cut than male workers. Twenty-eight per cent of male workers in this country will receive a tax cut, but only 13 per cent of women will receive a tax cut. The Australia Institute did some fantastic work on whose electorates benefit from this tax cut. I do not know whether it is just a coincidence, but the first electorate in the top 10 electorates to benefit from this was Wentworth, the Prime Minister's electorate, where 34 per cent of people earn above the threshold. Sadly, the electorate of Lyons in my state of Tasmania is in the bottom 10 electorates, with only six per cent of people in Lyons earning above $80,000.


We can put these two measures side by side—the omnibus bill that was before us in the parliamentary sitting three weeks ago and the bill before us today, which will give $4 billion in tax cuts to Australia's highest income earners. It is going to cost us $4 billion in lost revenue. This paints a very dire picture for those of us in this place who care about tackling income inequality. The income tax cuts will put $315 into the pockets of each of us as members of parliament, and into the pockets of banking executives—I would have loved to have been involved with the banking inquiry last week, but it was only members of the other place. I would have dearly liked to have asked each CEO how they plan to spend the extra $6 a week they are going to be given by this government. 


If this measure is truly targeted at bracket creep, we should be recouping revenue from those earning above $180,000. According to a number of submissions to the Senate Economics Committee, those in the tax bracket below $80,000 are the ones that most suffer from bracket creep. That is not part of this bill. I have written to Mr Chris Bowen, the shadow Treasurer, asking him—if he is going to vote for this bill today—to at least consider maintaining the so-called deficit repair levy for high-income earners that was introduced in the 2014 budget. The Greens have always wanted to make that permanent so that high-income earners do not get their tax back from that measure.


These issues do not often get covered by the mainstream media if Labor or the government do not want them to be covered. But let us address the issue of this being a tax cut for middle-income earners or middle-income Australians. That is absolute claptrap. This is an income tax cut for the wealthiest Australians—the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians.


The Australia Institute has looked at what constitutes middle-income earners. It is true that the average income in this country is around $80,000, but that is dragged up because it includes the multimillionaires and the CEOs who were at the banking inquiry last week, who are earning $8 to $10 million a year. That average income of $80,000 deals with full-time workers. If you include part-time and casual labour then that figure drops considerably.


The true measurement would be the median income earnings. According to the ABS, the median income in this country for 2014 was $69,000, while the average wage—average versus median—was nearly $80,000. Again, that is only for full-time workers. When we include all kinds of workers the average wage falls to $62,000 but the median income in this country falls to $52,000. So middle-income Australia, according to all the experts who use median income, is $52,000, which is way below the threshold of those who are going to get this tax cut above $80,000.


Whichever way you look at it this is a tax cut for high-income Australians. I think we in here can all agree that, on a personal level, we do not need the extra $6 a week. I do not think the economy is going to benefit from that either. But those who do need it are not going to get it. The savings that we booked three or four weeks ago—which we took off clean energy, which we took off tertiary education students and which we took of single parents—are nearly gone. Now we are there is another bill about to hit the Senate that will give businesses tax cuts. It will give big businesses tax cuts. This is ramping up trickle-down economics and it will make inequality worse.


We have an opportunity in our limited time—and in the scheme of things we all have limited time in this place—to make a difference, to make our vote count and make our words mean something, and that means voting against this bill today.


I do agree with some of the things Senator Gallagher said today. The big things we do need to tackle in this parliament, like concessions of negative gearing, capital gains tax and proper superannuation concessions, are things we should work at together with Labor and with the Liberals to get some real economic reform done in this country. That is what is going to raise revenue and tackle inequality. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.


Why is Labor going along with this neo-Liberal agenda of trickle-down economics? I do not understand. I genuinely do not understand it. Senator Cameron, because I always enjoy hearing you speak—that is the truth—I wish you were on the speakers list today so you could explain that to me—




Senator Cameron:
  I will see if I can get on.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Please do. Through you, Acting Deputy President, I would very much enjoy your contribution. I move:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""this bill be withdrawn and redrafted so that bracket creep is addressed without further propagating income inequality in Australia on the flawed theory of trickle-down economics by providing a tax cut to the top 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers.""


Now is not the time for tax cuts. Now is the time for the Labor opposition to match its media releases with its actions and stand against the expansion of income inequality and gender income inequality in Australia. Now is the time for our parliament to give momentum to the global discrediting of the horse and sparrow theory, which started nearly 100 years ago and continues to be propagated, which by any other name smells just as bad as the vision of that theory. I say to Labor: this is your last chance on this bill to make a difference. Please vote this down and work with the Greens and the crossbench on policies that tackle inequality.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-10-11,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:19):  Today I vote for $4 billion of tax cuts over the next four years. I can do this and look the next generation in the eye because, in the previous sitting week, I voted to cut government spending by $5.9 billion over the next four years.


My position is clear and responsible: to reduce the tax burden, to reduce government spending by even more and to ease the burden of debt on future generations. There will be some who take a different position. Some, like the Greens, oppose both cuts to government spending and cuts to tax. Taking this position reveals a misguided faith in big government—dare I say 'social ownership, comrade'—but at least it would not be burying future generations in debt.


But there is another completely indefensible position. This is to oppose spending cuts, but to let tax cuts sail through without a whiff of opposition. Any party that takes this position has a lot of explaining to do, not just to the parliament and the people but to future generations. Those who voted against spending cuts in the previous sitting week were the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team, Senator Lambie, and Senator Culleton, of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I expect each of them to express their opposition to today's tax cuts. If they do not, then their position of opposing spending cuts but supporting tax cuts would represent a failure to have any regard for future generations—that spending by today's generation can be paid for by future generations.


Today's bill will reduce the income tax burden by up to $315 for Australians earning more than $80,000 a year. This is justified, given how huge the tax burden is for these Australians and how much more these Australians pay in tax compared with other Australians—for instance, even after the passage of this bill, Australians earning $87,000 a year will still pay $21,562 in income tax, including the Medicare levy. That is a quarter of their income. Even with the passage of this bill, middle- and upper-income Australians will still lose a much greater share of their income through taxation than lower-income Australians. 


This is called progressive taxation, but it is really just gross discrimination against people who earn money. Even a flat tax would have high-income earners paying well in excess of the benefits they get from government spending, so I welcome this bill's slight reduction in the extent of discrimination. 


We need to go further than this, by flattening our tax rates and winding back the welfare state. The combination of our welfare system and progressive income tax rates means 48 per cent of households pay no net tax. This cannot continue. It is unjust for high-income earners and promotes dependency for low-income earners.


Australia's tax burden is high, no matter how you look at it. It is high by historical standards—for instance, 50 years ago taxes averaged $5,000 per person in current dollar terms, in other words, after adjusting for inflation. This tax burden has grown consistently from decade to decade so that it now averages more than $18,000 per person, with middle- and upper-income Australians paying much more than this average, which, as I said, is in real terms.


Australia's tax burden is also high by international standards. Once you account for Australia's system of compulsory superannuation contributions and the system of social security contributions prevalent in Europe, our tax burden is higher than the weighted average for the OECD. 


When we look outside the OECD, each country that is richer than us has a markedly lower tax burden than Australia—for instance, the tax burden in Hong Kong is around 15 per cent of GDP, which is around half the tax burden in Australia, and the tax burden in Singapore is even lower.


My position is clear. I commend the tax cuts in the bill we are currently debating, just as I commend the spending cuts that made them possible. I urge other senators to come in here and put their position on tax and spending cuts on the record.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-10-11,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:26):  I rise today to speak against the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016. Our political debate is often defined by where the parties stand when they oppose each other, when they have competing views on different pieces of legislation. But, actually, you get a lot more insight into Australian politics when the two parties that form the government and opposition in this place agree. 


What we see are the Liberal Party and the Labor Party always agreeing to give tax cuts to the wealthy. We see them agreeing on areas of public policy like the brutal treatment of asylum seekers; the overreach in the approach to counterterrorism; going to war without parliament approving the committing of Australian troops; and, of course, on donations reform, where they both get a huge benefit. 


Now, it is no surprise that the Liberal government are keen to give a tax cut to the wealthy. They represent themselves as the party of big business—as the party for the big end of town. So it is hardly surprising that the Liberal party, who have for many years now decried the state of revenue within the budget, would put a lie to their claim that we have a budget emergency and argue for a huge tax cut to the wealthy. We expect that from the Liberal Party.


But what makes this united support more interesting is that we have the Labor Party supporting it. When you consider the words of the shadow Treasurer, who has, indeed, begun to make a big deal out of the issue of rising inequality and the failure of trickle-down economics, it makes their support for this legislation much more interesting. 


What it does is indicate that those words are just hollow words—that they are used in some political positioning opportunity to position the ALP as a party that is committed to fairness. Instead, the actions of the Labor Party now in supporting this government legislation prove that they are just hollow words.


You need to look at this piece of legislation against the recent omnibus bill from the last sitting weeks to show the bipartisan consensus between the Coles and Woolies of politics—the Labor and the Liberal parties—to support the big end of town and people on high incomes at the cost of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. So let us remember that the omnibus bill that this party approved only a few weeks ago—indeed, during our last sitting week—cut billions of dollars from renewable energy, from families and from carers. It was a real attack on some of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community.


The impact of this bill is that 383,000 families with a household income of $80,000 lose around $730 per child. With the passage of this legislation, if you are a family earning $200,000 to $300,000 a year you will get a boost of about $630 each year. So just consider that. The omnibus legislation that took the knife to a whole lot of really critical family support payments and, indeed, other social supports and that passed in last week of parliament with the support of the Labor and Liberal parties means that families earning $80,000 are going to be worse off—383,000 families worse off to the tune of $730. With the passage of this legislation, if you are earning $200,000 or $300,000—that is, those of us in this chamber; many of us are earning well above the average wage—you will get a boost of $630 a year. We do not need it. Those families that are struggling and on the margins need the support more than we do.


So this is the government and the opposition—the Coles and Woolies of politics—working together over the last few weeks to grow the gap between the rich and poor at a time when rising inequality is something that the shadow Treasurer espouses is one of the great challenges before us as a nation. I simply do not understand the point of $6 billion of spending cuts on renewables and on carers when, in the next week, you wipe out those savings with $4 billion of tax cuts for the top 20 per cent. These are cuts to the people who need it most and a huge pay cheque for those of us who do not.


Shadow Treasurer Bowen made a speech recently. I will quote him because I agree with him. I think he was absolutely right. The case for the middle class was the speech. The sentiment was this:


… middle income earners are facing increased job insecurity as a result of the rise of technology and automation.


And together with increasing income inequality they are deciding that the system is no longer working for them.


Well, of course it is not when you have the two parties in this place ensuring that we provide tax cuts for the wealthy and cut services for those at the bottom. Of course, Labor will claim that this is targeted at everyday income earners. Let us actually have a look at that claim in more detail. Last week, the RBA released data that the average salary is $60,372. That is about $20,000 away from where this tax cut is targeted. The average wage is just over 60 grand. This tax cut kicks in for people earning over $80,000. So the tax data shows us that these tax cuts will go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. Let us again make that really clear: 80 per cent of people miss out; the top 20 per cent of income earners will benefit from this tax cut. Every single one of those banking executives that the Labor Party stood before the recent banking committee—those executives on multimillion dollar pays—are going to get a tax cut from this. Every one of us in this chamber will get a tax cut from this. Those top 20 per cent of income earners will get a tax cut, while real middle-class, ordinary, average Australians will miss out. That is the impact of this legislation that has the support of both the Labor Party and the government.


The ostensible reason for the bill that has been given is that we have to assist people who are approaching $80,000 a year not to be in the second highest tax bracket—addressing so-called bracket creep. Yes, it is true: bracket creep can be a problem. We do not dispute that it needs to be mitigated where necessary. But, as Deloitte said in its submission, the group most adversely affected by bracket creep are people approaching $37,000 a year. Where is a solution for them? Rather than providing a solution, we saw the parliament a couple weeks ago make life harder for them. The government is looking in the wrong place. We expect this from the coalition; we expect this from the Liberal Party. But given the recent words of the shadow Treasurer, to have bipartisan support for tax cuts that go to the top 20 per cent of income earners is most disappointing.


So it does mean nothing for the average worker. This is a tax cut that provides little or no relief for the average worker. Based on the RBA's average income, what we do know is that the everyday worker—people on that average wage—will not be eligible for these tax cuts for the next 15 years. If you assume that wages growth hovers at about two per cent, it will be 2031 when the average worker starts to enjoy a small benefit from this legislation that we are passing today. For the richest 20 per cent of workers, who already earn over that 80k, the tax benefit is pretty instantaneous. This is bad policy because it drives the gap between the rich and poor faster and harder. At a time when we are looking to cut vital social services, what we should be doing is ensuring that our revenue base increases rather than shrinks.


One opportunity that was open to both the government and the opposition, if they were serious about addressing bracket creep and if they saw that this was the only option available to them, was to ensure that the $4 billion cost of this bill—let's remember this is $4 billion in lost revenue at a time when we are being told that we cannot afford to fund healthcare, we cannot afford to fund our schools and we cannot afford to fund vital social services—would not add to inequality. But this is $4 billion at a time when our budget is facing so-called structural challenges. 


Rather than taking money out of the pockets of the most vulnerable and giving it to those people on high incomes, there are other solutions. If both the government and the opposition are intent on addressing bracket creep through this measure, why not recoup the $4 billion from the top three per cent of income earners in the top marginal rate by making the temporary two per cent levy on incomes over $180,000 permanent? Why not make it permanent and at least offset the $4 billion price tag that comes with this tax cut for the people who need it least? That is a policy that we Greens took to the election and one that Labor adopted. Here is an opportunity to take a stand and say to the government: if you want this, you have to make that two per cent levy on people with incomes of over $180,000 permanent. My colleague here Senator Whish-Wilson wrote to the shadow Treasurer seeking cooperation on this matter, but he refused. He was all the time citing increasing income inequality as a problem for the Australian community while refusing to work with the Greens on a measure that we know would address the issue of income inequality in a much fairer and more sustainable way. 


So we Greens will not support this Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill. We do not support it because it makes income inequality worse at a time when it is one of the great challenges that lies before us as a nation. We will not support it because that $4 billion could be spent on making Medicare more sustainable over the long term. That $4 billion could make a contribution to Gonski funding so that we can provide an education on the basis of need rather than who can afford to send their child to a wealthy private school. We will not support it because we believe that carers and people on single incomes, particularly sole parents, need support rather than having it stripped away. It is the Greens in this chamber who will continue to advocate for a much fairer and more caring agenda. This bill works in precisely the opposite direction to that agenda.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2016-10-11,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (13:39):  This is not my first speech. When Treasurer Scott Morrison appeared at the National Press Club to sell the federal government's plan to reduce the tax burden on Australians earning $80,000 or more he told the country it was about tax relief. Hardworking Australians in the middle-income bracket would be better off under the plan, the Treasurer said, and the move would help prevent bracket creep for those moving into higher income brackets. I respect the Treasurer, and NXT has had a constructive working relationship with him, but on this point we do disagree. 


What the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill represents is a misguided initiative from a government that has its priorities wrong and, while we must stress that those who are benefiting from this tax cut are not undeserving of tax relief, our opposition to this bill does not come from a place of hostility or antagonism but one of concern about how this money could be better spent. All told, the measures proposed would cut almost $4 billion in future revenue over the course of the next four years and, in turn, would only deliver a total benefit of $315 a year to the top 20 per cent of income earners. I will say it again: the total saving from this measure would equate to $315 a year or $6 a week for those among the top 20 per cent of income earners. In point of fact, those who are going to benefit do not represent middle income earners. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as of May 2016 the average income of the working Australian was $1,160 a week before tax. This equates to $60,000 a year. Under the proposed change, those who fall into this category will see no relief. Another study published by the Australia Institute counted those who did not file a tax return and found that just 14 per cent of Australians earned $80,000 or more—the bulk of whom are men. As the Age reported yesterday, the proposed cuts will help 28 per cent of male taxpayers but only 13 per cent of female taxpayers—a point which my colleague Senator Peter Whish-Wilson has discussed and with which the Nick Xenophon Team agrees. That same article also broke down who would benefit from the proposed tax cut. One in nine surgeons will benefit, so will eight in 10 mining engineers and seven out of every 10 psychiatrists. Among those who will miss out are 78 per cent of truck drivers and 70 per cent of manufacturing workers. Of those who make our food, some 95 per cent of chefs will not benefit from this tax cut, and 98 per cent of aged care and disabled workers, those who care for our elderly and our vulnerable, will get nothing. 


Earlier this year the Evatt Foundation examined wealth distribution across the country and found that the top 10 per cent of Australian households have watched their earnings grow at the expense of the middle 50 per cent of Australian households. That same report also found that the bottom 40 per cent have either no or negative wealth due to high levels of personal debt. The gap between Australians is growing, and it is against this backdrop that the proposed tax cut to the top 20 per cent of income earners is proposed. 


If Australia is to be considered a nation that pulls together, that chips in and that cooperates in the pursuit of a better tomorrow, offering this tax cut is going in the wrong direction. I am reminded of something former Treasurer Joe Hockey said once in talking about the Medicare co-payment when he described the $6 federal government plan to charge people to get Medicare advice as 'just the price of two middies of beer'. For those earning over $80,000 or more, the $315 a year they may save on their tax bills is just the cost of a pizza delivered to their home once a month. For the bulk of Australians who fall outside of this income bracket, that money represents a lot more. 


This tax cut is not the right priority for the government or the opposition, and the NXT is surprised that the Australian Labor Party has agreed to this measure given what could be done for the most vulnerable Australians or for our manufacturers, given all the other uses to which $4 billion could be put to use. It is not just that this money is not being spent better; the $4 billion that would be lost with this measure could be put to better use helping save Arrium from collapse—an event that would, as Professor John Spoehr has described, constitute a Detroit level economic event. This money could help manufacturing communities across southern Australia facing the spectre of 200,000 job losses with the end of the Australian car industry in 2017 transition to a better future and save tens of thousands of jobs. It is money that could be better spent in our aged-care industry, which has endured $1.8 billion in savage cuts and which supports some of our most vulnerable Australians with complex healthcare needs.


This money could help alleviate the cuts made to parents living in the country's poorest households. These are the parents, as ACOSS described in its submission to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, who are facing cuts to social security. The cuts mean a sole parent with two children and no private income is now $50 a week worse off. But they do not have to be. We could put this money to work where it is most needed. We, as responsible, elected representatives of the Australian people, should put this money to work where it is most needed, and that is why the Nick Xenophon Team opposes this legislation.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (12:47):  I rise to speak in support of this bill. This bill amends the thresholds so that the rate of tax payable on taxable incomes from $80,001 to $87,000 for individuals is 32.5 per cent. The government announced this measure in the 2016-17 budget and Labor supported it. It means that individuals with taxable incomes from $80,001 and up to $87,000 will now be subject to the lower rate of tax of 32.5 per cent rather than the rate of tax of 37 per cent which currently applies to taxable income over $80,000. It will provide a maximum tax cut of $315 per annum on incomes of $87,000 and above. 


With this bill, Labor is pleased to be supporting modest, sustainable tax relief for up to 3.1 million Australians and their families. However, despite bipartisan agreement, the Turnbull government has still managed to make a mess of its implementation. As David Crowe reported in The Australian on 2 September, millions of workers will have to wait until the middle of next year to receive all of the benefits. This is despite the government's assurances in May that workers would receive the gains far earlier. Mr Crowe reported that:


Workers will not see the lower rates applied to their salaries for at least another month, which means they will not collect the cut due to them for the first quarter of the financial year until they lodge their tax returns after July 2017.


Yet, on budget night, Mr Morrison proudly boasted he would deliver income tax cuts from 1 July this year. He said:


From 1 July this year, we will increase the upper limit for the middle income tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000 per year.


Yet the government did not introduce legislation to ensure that the tax cuts would start from 1 July this year before the election.


When asked on ABC Radio how the how the tax cuts would be introduced by 1 July, given that the government was unlikely to be able to legislate them before prior to the election, the Prime Minister said that:


That is really up to the Labor Party whether it's legislated, but certainly it will be covered administratively after the election, we expect the Parliament to come back and ensure that all of the legislation supporting the Budget measures is passed.


Yet in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, prepared by the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Finance, it became clear that the tax cuts could not be delivered from 1 July as promised. Instead it said: 


(T)he Commissioner has indicated that the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan — targeted personal income tax relief measure requires the relevant legislation to be passed before the change will be incorporated into the income tax withholding schedules.


We now have confirmation from the ATO that the income tax cuts scheduled for 1 July 2016 have only come into effect on October 1, and Australian taxpayers will have to wait until they lodge their tax return after 1 July 2017 for the extra tax they have paid for three months to be credited back to them. Labor immediately gave bipartisan support to these income tax cuts, so there was no excuse for the government not to legislate these straight after the budget in May this year. It took five months from when the Treasurer promised these income tax cuts in the budget for him to actually introduce the required legislation into the parliament.


 This government is so incompetent that, even with clear and unambiguous Labor support on budget night for these tax cuts, the Prime Minister and Treasurer still manage to fail in the basic task of introducing and passing legislation through the parliament required for them to take effect before the election. The Tax Commissioner confirmed in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, that these tax cuts would not be delivered from 1 July as promised by the Treasurer, but instead would only be implemented when the relevant legislation had passed the parliament. 


Scott Morrison must outline when this same advice from the ATO was received by the Prime Minister, himself or his office. This advice goes to the very basis on which the Prime Minister and Treasurer continued to publicly argue, including throughout the election campaign that the income tax cuts would flow 'from 1 July'.


Instances of ineptness by this Treasurer and this government in undertaking their core responsibilities have regrettably not been rare. Other recent examples of the Treasurer's mishandling of policy include: presenting a bill to the parliament that miscounted the savings in the omnibus legislation after weeks of telling us it would be $6.5 billion in savings when in fact the savings were less than $6 billion; recent media reports exposing how he and the Prime Minister got rolled in cabinet by the conservatives in their own party on their desire to pursue reform of negative gearing; being forced to further delay the introduction of savings attached to the government's super package following an embarrassing stalemate, again, with his own backbenchers, and despite the government making an 'iron-clad' commitment to the electorate during the election.


We also need to remember the context in which these tax cuts are being prosecuted by the government. Scott Morrison has offered up this modest tax cut for those on incomes over $80,000 as a crude cover for his cuts that have affected the cost of living of every single low- and middle-income Australian. The government's double dealing in the budget cannot go unremarked upon. Yes, the government is seeking to provide some limited relief to Australian taxpayers, but this in no way makes up for the sustained assault of the Abbott-Turnbull government through its budgets on services Australian people rely upon. The government can try as it likes to provide a fig leaf for its regressive agenda—which has been consistent, irrespective of who happened to be Prime Minister at the time—but no sleight-of-hand tricks can conceal the essential truth of that broader agenda. The 2016 budget was merely the last confirmation of an approach unchanged since 2014. It contained the same $80 billion of cuts to schools and hospitals, the same cuts to working- and middle-class families, the same cuts to Medicare, to child care, to aged care, to universities, to paid parental leave, to pensioners and to carers.


Labor does support the tax cut contained in this bill, but we acknowledge that three-quarters of Australian workers will receive no tax relief from the 2016 budget and that those same Australian workers who miss out will disproportionately bear the brunt of this government's cuts to schools, hospitals and Medicare and to the family supports they rely upon. It is a simple truth that you do not create the jobs of the future by cutting education, making health care inaccessible and unaffordable, underinvesting in infrastructure and making broadband slower.


Labor does believe in delivering a fair and sustainable tax system. We understand that this should provide incentives for all Australians to work and engage in productive enterprise. But it must also guarantee adequate revenue to fund the proper role of government, including quality public services that all Australians deserve.


Maintaining public confidence in Australia's tax system is critical and depends on simplicity, transparency and everyone paying their fair share—something this Treasurer and government have manifestly failed to grasp or deliver. In its recent publication Choosing opportunity, the McKell Institute outlines in a comprehensive fashion why, as policymakers, we must be concerned with the impact of tax and budgetary policy and what it can achieve. As the Choosing opportunity report makes clear, there are issues that demand our urgent attention. In Australia, inequality is on the rise. The middle class is being squeezed. Dignity in retirement is uncertain. The gender pay gap remains effectively unaltered since 1979. And, for a generation of young Australians, the dream of home ownership is simply way beyond reach.


Labor wants Australia to succeed. We want a tax system for a growing, job-creating, wealth-creating economy. As Bill Shorten said in his recent speech on inequality to the McKell Institute, Labor is concerned with issues such as reforming negative gearing, needs based funding for schools, affordable university and equality for women not just as totemic indicators but as economic levers. Used correctly, they are creators of growth, not programs paid for by forgoing growth. They are about investing in lifting people into work and in supporting their full participation in our society and our economy.


Labor supports tax relief for working Australians, but we will never walk away from properly funding schools or Medicare. Labor will never slash Australia's safety net in a misguided effort to provide tax cuts for big multinationals or fight tooth and nail to keep tax loopholes open. We are genuinely forced to ponder what could be achieved if Malcolm Turnbull stood up for everyday Australians instead of trying to implement reckless and unsustainable tax cuts for big business.


In saying that, Labor has and will work cooperatively with the government when what it proposes is reasonable. We have proven that with our principled negotiations on the omnibus savings bill, and we have taken the sensible approach of supporting other budget measures which merit support. This includes supporting the very welcome restoration of Labor's low-income superannuation contribution, an initiative to support low-income earners but particularly women, which the government has renamed but restored in the 2016 budget, three years after announcing its abolition.


Although I canvassed this at some time in the chamber during the last sitting, we are similarly pleased that the government has seen the light on our reforms to tobacco excise to combat the serious health and economic impact tobacco addiction has on the Australian community. With a significant fiscal challenge ahead of us, I invite the government to continue in this vein—to adopt more of our positive initiatives that deliver for ordinary Australians while fairly and sustainably improving the budget bottom line. I can even helpfully direct senators opposite to some other measures that they ought to be considering.


The government should take another look at and reconsider its position on our proposed reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax. The careful, calibrated reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax that we took to the election recognised that far too many working- and middle-class families are increasingly being priced out of the housing market. The negative impacts this circumstance has on intergenerational equity, economic growth and the Commonwealth's fiscal position require the urgent attention of this government. Labor's proposal ends what are poorly targeted and clearly unsustainable tax subsidies. By limiting negative gearing to new dwellings, we would help put the Australian dream of home ownership back within reach and simultaneously provide significant improvement, over the forward estimates and beyond, to the budget.


The other key measure that most evidently deserves the government's consideration is the package of superannuation reforms Labor took to the election. When the government's own Financial System Inquiry finds that 10 per cent of Australians receive 38 per cent of Australia's super tax concession, more than the combined benefit of the bottom 70 per cent of Australians, it is patently clear that the system is unbalanced and unviable. This is particularly evidenced when the same inquiry concedes that these tax concessions are unlikely to reduce future age pension expenditure significantly. Without action, the cost to the taxpayer of superannuation earnings tax concessions or forgone budget revenue will almost double over the next four years, from $11.8 billion in '14-15 to $22.4 billion in '17-18 and will continue to grow at a rate that is unsustainable. Labor has proposed a package of superannuation reforms which are fair. They deliver more budget repair than the government's current mess on superannuation and will go a long way towards stemming the ballooning cost to the budget of the existing concessions over the longer term.


In conclusion, I reconfirm to the government: you will have a willing and cooperative partner if you bring into the parliament proposals which meet the test of contributing to budget improvement while making our country a fairer place, and we are pleased to support this bill today.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-10-11,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (12:59):  Every time we get up to speak in this place it is a privilege because our words and our actions can actually make a difference. They can make a difference on the issues that matter to us and to all Australians. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016, from my personal perspective, is one of the most important pieces of legislation that is going to come to the Senate this year. It is important because it symbolises something that is deeply meaningful to all Australians and in fact to many in the community around the world. It is deeply important because we are now voting on this bill today to sign over $4 billion of Australians' money to the wealthiest Australians in a tax cut.


If you earn over $80,000 in this country, which is 20 per cent of Australians, you are about to be given a tax cut. So 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will not get the benefit of a tax cut. It is important because inequality and tackling inequality are the true moral challenges of our time. I remind senators that our actions, our voices and our vote in the Senate is what matters. Today it shames me that the Labor Party have joined with the Liberal Party to give a tax cut to the most wealthy Australians—Australians like myself who earn over $80,000 and who do not need $6 a week or $315 a year in a tax cut. That money is needed by less wealthy Australians, many of whom are on the breadline and are struggling.


I cannot fathom that Labor has only put up one speaker on this bill today—one speaker who did not even speak out her time. That equates to an allocation of $200 million a minute. How cavalier of Labor to take this issue so casually. We have had no inquiry through the Economics Committee and we have had a rushed process to get a report and a recommendation to pass this bill because Mr Bill Shorten and Mr Chris Bowen decided to side with the Liberal government during the election campaign.


So here we are at the beginning of the 45th Parliament and we have had two pieces of important legislation. Three weeks ago this Senate passed $5 billion in savings because this Prime Minister said that he believed the moral challenge of our time was budget repair and paying down debt. So Labor teamed up with the Liberal Party to take money off single parents, off students, off Newstart recipients and, sadly, off clean energy action in this country to raise $5 billion because they believed the government and they joined with the government in this bid to pay down debt. What are they doing today? Out of the $5 billion that they ripped off ordinary Australians, they are now giving $4 billion back to wealthy Australians. Out of the $5 billion of savings that we delivered three weeks ago we are now giving back $4 billion to the wealthiest Australians.


In the 1890s US economists first offered up what was called the horse and sparrow theory. It went along the lines: if you give a horse more oats then there will be more to pass through for the sparrows to enjoy. Give the horse more oats and there will be more to pass through for the sparrows to enjoy. Does that sound familiar? With different waves of enthusiasm across generations since, policymakers have been fed the same foodstuffs as the sparrows. Tax cuts to the wealthiest will trickle down to the benefit of the masses. Apparently, we all win if the richest have even more money to play with. But the evidence tells a different story and it leaves trickle-down economics exposed as a naked claim used to shore up the position of those already enjoying wealth and social position. History shows that the wealthiest do not tend to direct their newfound tax cuts into more consumption. Instead, they either increase savings or plough it into tax advantage investment vehicles like superannuation or negatively-geared investment properties. There is an active and growing consensus around the world that the trickle-down theory should be expunged and never again exhumed. Yet that is exactly what we are doing here today. Not only are we standing up to fight inequality, we are actually adding to it by voting for this bill here today.


Let's look at the political winds that are blowing across this globe, including in this country. For those who saw the US presidential debate yesterday, all the commentary in the mainstream media and social media was about Donald Trump and the rise of the Trump phenomenon in the US. We have talked about the Brexit movement in the UK, and of course there has been a lot of speculation on the rise of my colleagues over here on the other side of the chamber, One Nation. Let me tell you what the thread is that ties all these things together: that thread is inequality. People are feeling like they have been left behind. They are feeling that they have been ignored by their political system and their politicians because the gains and spoils of our economic system across decades of globalisation have not been shared evenly. That is why we are seeing such radical political movements around the world and that is actually what we need to act on. Our entire political system is now under a challenge because of rising inequality and our inability in a place like this to tackle this.


Martin Parkinson recently came out publicly and said that he believed one thing this government needed to do was to look at redistributive policies that help share the spoils of globalisation, especially trade deals. A first-year economic student will tell you about this. It is called the compensatory principles. In theory, the winners should compensate the losers, but that has not happened. In no world that I know have the winners—the big multinational corporations—compensated those workers you, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, talked about in this place who have been left behind. That does not happen. It is our role in government to make sure that it does happen. Professor Thomas Piketty, one of the world's most famous economists, is in Sydney this week to talk about inequality, which he sees as a severe challenge for Australia, and the need for new policies to tackle inequality. It is the true moral challenge of our time, and this consensus that we need to do something about it is lapping upon our political shores. The last few months have seen Labor MPs join with the Greens, at least in their public speeches, attacking trickle-down theory with gusto. I have heard this issue talked about during Senate debates in this chamber. We have seen economics spokespeople shifting from being past advocates of tax cuts to staying silent on who benefits from cutting taxes. It even culminated in the opposition leader, Mr Bill Shorten, claiming on the eve of the election that the Turnbull government:


… want Australians to embark upon a radical, expensive experiment in trickle-down economics.


We know how this story ends.


Reagan tried it. Thatcher tried it.


A generation later we got Trump and we got Brexit.


Correct. I totally agree with Mr Shorten. So why is Labor giving a tax cut to the most wealthy Australians today? Anyone who earns over $80,000 gets a measly $6 in their pocket per week—$315. What economic benefit is that going to have in terms of increased consumption? It would be a lot more valuable for those on the breadline—$6 a week would matter. But we are not giving them money. We are giving it to the most wealthy people in this country.


It is not just Mr Shorten who has had strong words on the subject. Mr Chris Bowen has recently given a number of speeches on the need to tackle inequality and trickle-down economics. Words are cheap if they are not backed up with actions. Senators from my home state of Tasmania have spoken about this. Senator Polley told the Senate on 4 May:


I rise to speak about the Turnbull government's budget that puts high-income earners and big business before families, students, patients, pensioners and low-income earners. This morning in my home state of Tasmania, four out of five workers who make less than $80,000 woke up to find out that they were getting nothing from Turnbull's government's budget. Eighty-two per cent of the working population in Bass have been left off the map and will not get a tax cut.


That is exactly what Senator Polley is going to vote for today. On the same day, Senator Singh said:


'Let's protect the higher income earners'—that is the mantra of the Turnbull Liberal government—'and let's do it at the expense of families …


…   …   …


Those who earn more than $80,000 may look forward to this tax cut, but if you look at Tasmania 80 per cent of its workforce earns less than $80,000. That is how out of touch the Turnbull government is with the states that it is supposed to be thinking about and providing for, as it was last night in its budget. Four out of five Tasmanians earn less than $80,000. They are the people who are going to be affected.


I know that Senator Singh is not here, but, if she were, either she would abstain from the vote in the chamber, as she often does on controversial votes, or she would also vote for this. On 9 May, Senator Carol Brown tweeted, 'More than 230,000 Tasmanians will not benefit from the government's tax cuts. This shows Turnbull is out of touch.' I have here a whole list of other MPs who have gone out in a similar vein.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Senator Cameron, let me finish with your leader, Mr Bill Shorten: 'This is a budget that favours millionaires over battlers, high-income earners over families.'



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Well, Senator Cameron, guess who is going to get a tax cut today out of nurses, clerks, store people, aged and disability carers and millionaires. Millionaires—you are correct. Millionaires are going to get the tax cut today. Congratulations, Labor, and congratulations, Liberal Party.


I want to deal with a couple of specific issues that have gone unnoticed about this bill in terms of increasing inequality, gender inequality. Under this bill, women are half as likely to receive the benefits of a tax cut than male workers. Twenty-eight per cent of male workers in this country will receive a tax cut, but only 13 per cent of women will receive a tax cut. The Australia Institute did some fantastic work on whose electorates benefit from this tax cut. I do not know whether it is just a coincidence, but the first electorate in the top 10 electorates to benefit from this was Wentworth, the Prime Minister's electorate, where 34 per cent of people earn above the threshold. Sadly, the electorate of Lyons in my state of Tasmania is in the bottom 10 electorates, with only six per cent of people in Lyons earning above $80,000.


We can put these two measures side by side—the omnibus bill that was before us in the parliamentary sitting three weeks ago and the bill before us today, which will give $4 billion in tax cuts to Australia's highest income earners. It is going to cost us $4 billion in lost revenue. This paints a very dire picture for those of us in this place who care about tackling income inequality. The income tax cuts will put $315 into the pockets of each of us as members of parliament, and into the pockets of banking executives—I would have loved to have been involved with the banking inquiry last week, but it was only members of the other place. I would have dearly liked to have asked each CEO how they plan to spend the extra $6 a week they are going to be given by this government. 


If this measure is truly targeted at bracket creep, we should be recouping revenue from those earning above $180,000. According to a number of submissions to the Senate Economics Committee, those in the tax bracket below $80,000 are the ones that most suffer from bracket creep. That is not part of this bill. I have written to Mr Chris Bowen, the shadow Treasurer, asking him—if he is going to vote for this bill today—to at least consider maintaining the so-called deficit repair levy for high-income earners that was introduced in the 2014 budget. The Greens have always wanted to make that permanent so that high-income earners do not get their tax back from that measure.


These issues do not often get covered by the mainstream media if Labor or the government do not want them to be covered. But let us address the issue of this being a tax cut for middle-income earners or middle-income Australians. That is absolute claptrap. This is an income tax cut for the wealthiest Australians—the wealthiest 20 per cent of Australians.


The Australia Institute has looked at what constitutes middle-income earners. It is true that the average income in this country is around $80,000, but that is dragged up because it includes the multimillionaires and the CEOs who were at the banking inquiry last week, who are earning $8 to $10 million a year. That average income of $80,000 deals with full-time workers. If you include part-time and casual labour then that figure drops considerably.


The true measurement would be the median income earnings. According to the ABS, the median income in this country for 2014 was $69,000, while the average wage—average versus median—was nearly $80,000. Again, that is only for full-time workers. When we include all kinds of workers the average wage falls to $62,000 but the median income in this country falls to $52,000. So middle-income Australia, according to all the experts who use median income, is $52,000, which is way below the threshold of those who are going to get this tax cut above $80,000.


Whichever way you look at it this is a tax cut for high-income Australians. I think we in here can all agree that, on a personal level, we do not need the extra $6 a week. I do not think the economy is going to benefit from that either. But those who do need it are not going to get it. The savings that we booked three or four weeks ago—which we took off clean energy, which we took off tertiary education students and which we took of single parents—are nearly gone. Now we are there is another bill about to hit the Senate that will give businesses tax cuts. It will give big businesses tax cuts. This is ramping up trickle-down economics and it will make inequality worse.


We have an opportunity in our limited time—and in the scheme of things we all have limited time in this place—to make a difference, to make our vote count and make our words mean something, and that means voting against this bill today.


I do agree with some of the things Senator Gallagher said today. The big things we do need to tackle in this parliament, like concessions of negative gearing, capital gains tax and proper superannuation concessions, are things we should work at together with Labor and with the Liberals to get some real economic reform done in this country. That is what is going to raise revenue and tackle inequality. We can walk and chew gum at the same time.


Why is Labor going along with this neo-Liberal agenda of trickle-down economics? I do not understand. I genuinely do not understand it. Senator Cameron, because I always enjoy hearing you speak—that is the truth—I wish you were on the speakers list today so you could explain that to me—




Senator Cameron:
  I will see if I can get on.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Please do. Through you, Acting Deputy President, I would very much enjoy your contribution. I move:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""this bill be withdrawn and redrafted so that bracket creep is addressed without further propagating income inequality in Australia on the flawed theory of trickle-down economics by providing a tax cut to the top 20 per cent of Australian taxpayers.""


Now is not the time for tax cuts. Now is the time for the Labor opposition to match its media releases with its actions and stand against the expansion of income inequality and gender income inequality in Australia. Now is the time for our parliament to give momentum to the global discrediting of the horse and sparrow theory, which started nearly 100 years ago and continues to be propagated, which by any other name smells just as bad as the vision of that theory. I say to Labor: this is your last chance on this bill to make a difference. Please vote this down and work with the Greens and the crossbench on policies that tackle inequality.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2016-10-11,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:19):  Today I vote for $4 billion of tax cuts over the next four years. I can do this and look the next generation in the eye because, in the previous sitting week, I voted to cut government spending by $5.9 billion over the next four years.


My position is clear and responsible: to reduce the tax burden, to reduce government spending by even more and to ease the burden of debt on future generations. There will be some who take a different position. Some, like the Greens, oppose both cuts to government spending and cuts to tax. Taking this position reveals a misguided faith in big government—dare I say 'social ownership, comrade'—but at least it would not be burying future generations in debt.


But there is another completely indefensible position. This is to oppose spending cuts, but to let tax cuts sail through without a whiff of opposition. Any party that takes this position has a lot of explaining to do, not just to the parliament and the people but to future generations. Those who voted against spending cuts in the previous sitting week were the Greens, the Nick Xenophon Team, Senator Lambie, and Senator Culleton, of Pauline Hanson's One Nation. I expect each of them to express their opposition to today's tax cuts. If they do not, then their position of opposing spending cuts but supporting tax cuts would represent a failure to have any regard for future generations—that spending by today's generation can be paid for by future generations.


Today's bill will reduce the income tax burden by up to $315 for Australians earning more than $80,000 a year. This is justified, given how huge the tax burden is for these Australians and how much more these Australians pay in tax compared with other Australians—for instance, even after the passage of this bill, Australians earning $87,000 a year will still pay $21,562 in income tax, including the Medicare levy. That is a quarter of their income. Even with the passage of this bill, middle- and upper-income Australians will still lose a much greater share of their income through taxation than lower-income Australians. 


This is called progressive taxation, but it is really just gross discrimination against people who earn money. Even a flat tax would have high-income earners paying well in excess of the benefits they get from government spending, so I welcome this bill's slight reduction in the extent of discrimination. 


We need to go further than this, by flattening our tax rates and winding back the welfare state. The combination of our welfare system and progressive income tax rates means 48 per cent of households pay no net tax. This cannot continue. It is unjust for high-income earners and promotes dependency for low-income earners.


Australia's tax burden is high, no matter how you look at it. It is high by historical standards—for instance, 50 years ago taxes averaged $5,000 per person in current dollar terms, in other words, after adjusting for inflation. This tax burden has grown consistently from decade to decade so that it now averages more than $18,000 per person, with middle- and upper-income Australians paying much more than this average, which, as I said, is in real terms.


Australia's tax burden is also high by international standards. Once you account for Australia's system of compulsory superannuation contributions and the system of social security contributions prevalent in Europe, our tax burden is higher than the weighted average for the OECD. 


When we look outside the OECD, each country that is richer than us has a markedly lower tax burden than Australia—for instance, the tax burden in Hong Kong is around 15 per cent of GDP, which is around half the tax burden in Australia, and the tax burden in Singapore is even lower.


My position is clear. I commend the tax cuts in the bill we are currently debating, just as I commend the spending cuts that made them possible. I urge other senators to come in here and put their position on tax and spending cuts on the record.



(Quorum formed)


",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2016-10-11,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:26):  I rise today to speak against the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill 2016. Our political debate is often defined by where the parties stand when they oppose each other, when they have competing views on different pieces of legislation. But, actually, you get a lot more insight into Australian politics when the two parties that form the government and opposition in this place agree. 


What we see are the Liberal Party and the Labor Party always agreeing to give tax cuts to the wealthy. We see them agreeing on areas of public policy like the brutal treatment of asylum seekers; the overreach in the approach to counterterrorism; going to war without parliament approving the committing of Australian troops; and, of course, on donations reform, where they both get a huge benefit. 


Now, it is no surprise that the Liberal government are keen to give a tax cut to the wealthy. They represent themselves as the party of big business—as the party for the big end of town. So it is hardly surprising that the Liberal party, who have for many years now decried the state of revenue within the budget, would put a lie to their claim that we have a budget emergency and argue for a huge tax cut to the wealthy. We expect that from the Liberal Party.


But what makes this united support more interesting is that we have the Labor Party supporting it. When you consider the words of the shadow Treasurer, who has, indeed, begun to make a big deal out of the issue of rising inequality and the failure of trickle-down economics, it makes their support for this legislation much more interesting. 


What it does is indicate that those words are just hollow words—that they are used in some political positioning opportunity to position the ALP as a party that is committed to fairness. Instead, the actions of the Labor Party now in supporting this government legislation prove that they are just hollow words.


You need to look at this piece of legislation against the recent omnibus bill from the last sitting weeks to show the bipartisan consensus between the Coles and Woolies of politics—the Labor and the Liberal parties—to support the big end of town and people on high incomes at the cost of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community. So let us remember that the omnibus bill that this party approved only a few weeks ago—indeed, during our last sitting week—cut billions of dollars from renewable energy, from families and from carers. It was a real attack on some of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community.


The impact of this bill is that 383,000 families with a household income of $80,000 lose around $730 per child. With the passage of this legislation, if you are a family earning $200,000 to $300,000 a year you will get a boost of about $630 each year. So just consider that. The omnibus legislation that took the knife to a whole lot of really critical family support payments and, indeed, other social supports and that passed in last week of parliament with the support of the Labor and Liberal parties means that families earning $80,000 are going to be worse off—383,000 families worse off to the tune of $730. With the passage of this legislation, if you are earning $200,000 or $300,000—that is, those of us in this chamber; many of us are earning well above the average wage—you will get a boost of $630 a year. We do not need it. Those families that are struggling and on the margins need the support more than we do.


So this is the government and the opposition—the Coles and Woolies of politics—working together over the last few weeks to grow the gap between the rich and poor at a time when rising inequality is something that the shadow Treasurer espouses is one of the great challenges before us as a nation. I simply do not understand the point of $6 billion of spending cuts on renewables and on carers when, in the next week, you wipe out those savings with $4 billion of tax cuts for the top 20 per cent. These are cuts to the people who need it most and a huge pay cheque for those of us who do not.


Shadow Treasurer Bowen made a speech recently. I will quote him because I agree with him. I think he was absolutely right. The case for the middle class was the speech. The sentiment was this:


… middle income earners are facing increased job insecurity as a result of the rise of technology and automation.


And together with increasing income inequality they are deciding that the system is no longer working for them.


Well, of course it is not when you have the two parties in this place ensuring that we provide tax cuts for the wealthy and cut services for those at the bottom. Of course, Labor will claim that this is targeted at everyday income earners. Let us actually have a look at that claim in more detail. Last week, the RBA released data that the average salary is $60,372. That is about $20,000 away from where this tax cut is targeted. The average wage is just over 60 grand. This tax cut kicks in for people earning over $80,000. So the tax data shows us that these tax cuts will go to the top 20 per cent of income earners. Let us again make that really clear: 80 per cent of people miss out; the top 20 per cent of income earners will benefit from this tax cut. Every single one of those banking executives that the Labor Party stood before the recent banking committee—those executives on multimillion dollar pays—are going to get a tax cut from this. Every one of us in this chamber will get a tax cut from this. Those top 20 per cent of income earners will get a tax cut, while real middle-class, ordinary, average Australians will miss out. That is the impact of this legislation that has the support of both the Labor Party and the government.


The ostensible reason for the bill that has been given is that we have to assist people who are approaching $80,000 a year not to be in the second highest tax bracket—addressing so-called bracket creep. Yes, it is true: bracket creep can be a problem. We do not dispute that it needs to be mitigated where necessary. But, as Deloitte said in its submission, the group most adversely affected by bracket creep are people approaching $37,000 a year. Where is a solution for them? Rather than providing a solution, we saw the parliament a couple weeks ago make life harder for them. The government is looking in the wrong place. We expect this from the coalition; we expect this from the Liberal Party. But given the recent words of the shadow Treasurer, to have bipartisan support for tax cuts that go to the top 20 per cent of income earners is most disappointing.


So it does mean nothing for the average worker. This is a tax cut that provides little or no relief for the average worker. Based on the RBA's average income, what we do know is that the everyday worker—people on that average wage—will not be eligible for these tax cuts for the next 15 years. If you assume that wages growth hovers at about two per cent, it will be 2031 when the average worker starts to enjoy a small benefit from this legislation that we are passing today. For the richest 20 per cent of workers, who already earn over that 80k, the tax benefit is pretty instantaneous. This is bad policy because it drives the gap between the rich and poor faster and harder. At a time when we are looking to cut vital social services, what we should be doing is ensuring that our revenue base increases rather than shrinks.


One opportunity that was open to both the government and the opposition, if they were serious about addressing bracket creep and if they saw that this was the only option available to them, was to ensure that the $4 billion cost of this bill—let's remember this is $4 billion in lost revenue at a time when we are being told that we cannot afford to fund healthcare, we cannot afford to fund our schools and we cannot afford to fund vital social services—would not add to inequality. But this is $4 billion at a time when our budget is facing so-called structural challenges. 


Rather than taking money out of the pockets of the most vulnerable and giving it to those people on high incomes, there are other solutions. If both the government and the opposition are intent on addressing bracket creep through this measure, why not recoup the $4 billion from the top three per cent of income earners in the top marginal rate by making the temporary two per cent levy on incomes over $180,000 permanent? Why not make it permanent and at least offset the $4 billion price tag that comes with this tax cut for the people who need it least? That is a policy that we Greens took to the election and one that Labor adopted. Here is an opportunity to take a stand and say to the government: if you want this, you have to make that two per cent levy on people with incomes of over $180,000 permanent. My colleague here Senator Whish-Wilson wrote to the shadow Treasurer seeking cooperation on this matter, but he refused. He was all the time citing increasing income inequality as a problem for the Australian community while refusing to work with the Greens on a measure that we know would address the issue of income inequality in a much fairer and more sustainable way. 


So we Greens will not support this Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill. We do not support it because it makes income inequality worse at a time when it is one of the great challenges that lies before us as a nation. We will not support it because that $4 billion could be spent on making Medicare more sustainable over the long term. That $4 billion could make a contribution to Gonski funding so that we can provide an education on the basis of need rather than who can afford to send their child to a wealthy private school. We will not support it because we believe that carers and people on single incomes, particularly sole parents, need support rather than having it stripped away. It is the Greens in this chamber who will continue to advocate for a much fairer and more caring agenda. This bill works in precisely the opposite direction to that agenda.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2016-10-11,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (13:39):  This is not my first speech. When Treasurer Scott Morrison appeared at the National Press Club to sell the federal government's plan to reduce the tax burden on Australians earning $80,000 or more he told the country it was about tax relief. Hardworking Australians in the middle-income bracket would be better off under the plan, the Treasurer said, and the move would help prevent bracket creep for those moving into higher income brackets. I respect the Treasurer, and NXT has had a constructive working relationship with him, but on this point we do disagree. 


What the Treasury Laws Amendment (Income Tax Relief) Bill represents is a misguided initiative from a government that has its priorities wrong and, while we must stress that those who are benefiting from this tax cut are not undeserving of tax relief, our opposition to this bill does not come from a place of hostility or antagonism but one of concern about how this money could be better spent. All told, the measures proposed would cut almost $4 billion in future revenue over the course of the next four years and, in turn, would only deliver a total benefit of $315 a year to the top 20 per cent of income earners. I will say it again: the total saving from this measure would equate to $315 a year or $6 a week for those among the top 20 per cent of income earners. In point of fact, those who are going to benefit do not represent middle income earners. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as of May 2016 the average income of the working Australian was $1,160 a week before tax. This equates to $60,000 a year. Under the proposed change, those who fall into this category will see no relief. Another study published by the Australia Institute counted those who did not file a tax return and found that just 14 per cent of Australians earned $80,000 or more—the bulk of whom are men. As the Age reported yesterday, the proposed cuts will help 28 per cent of male taxpayers but only 13 per cent of female taxpayers—a point which my colleague Senator Peter Whish-Wilson has discussed and with which the Nick Xenophon Team agrees. That same article also broke down who would benefit from the proposed tax cut. One in nine surgeons will benefit, so will eight in 10 mining engineers and seven out of every 10 psychiatrists. Among those who will miss out are 78 per cent of truck drivers and 70 per cent of manufacturing workers. Of those who make our food, some 95 per cent of chefs will not benefit from this tax cut, and 98 per cent of aged care and disabled workers, those who care for our elderly and our vulnerable, will get nothing. 


Earlier this year the Evatt Foundation examined wealth distribution across the country and found that the top 10 per cent of Australian households have watched their earnings grow at the expense of the middle 50 per cent of Australian households. That same report also found that the bottom 40 per cent have either no or negative wealth due to high levels of personal debt. The gap between Australians is growing, and it is against this backdrop that the proposed tax cut to the top 20 per cent of income earners is proposed. 


If Australia is to be considered a nation that pulls together, that chips in and that cooperates in the pursuit of a better tomorrow, offering this tax cut is going in the wrong direction. I am reminded of something former Treasurer Joe Hockey said once in talking about the Medicare co-payment when he described the $6 federal government plan to charge people to get Medicare advice as 'just the price of two middies of beer'. For those earning over $80,000 or more, the $315 a year they may save on their tax bills is just the cost of a pizza delivered to their home once a month. For the bulk of Australians who fall outside of this income bracket, that money represents a lot more. 


This tax cut is not the right priority for the government or the opposition, and the NXT is surprised that the Australian Labor Party has agreed to this measure given what could be done for the most vulnerable Australians or for our manufacturers, given all the other uses to which $4 billion could be put to use. It is not just that this money is not being spent better; the $4 billion that would be lost with this measure could be put to better use helping save Arrium from collapse—an event that would, as Professor John Spoehr has described, constitute a Detroit level economic event. This money could help manufacturing communities across southern Australia facing the spectre of 200,000 job losses with the end of the Australian car industry in 2017 transition to a better future and save tens of thousands of jobs. It is money that could be better spent in our aged-care industry, which has endured $1.8 billion in savage cuts and which supports some of our most vulnerable Australians with complex healthcare needs.


This money could help alleviate the cuts made to parents living in the country's poorest households. These are the parents, as ACOSS described in its submission to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, who are facing cuts to social security. The cuts mean a sole parent with two children and no private income is now $50 a week worse off. But they do not have to be. We could put this money to work where it is most needed. We, as responsible, elected representatives of the Australian people, should put this money to work where it is most needed, and that is why the Nick Xenophon Team opposes this legislation.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:01):  by leave—On behalf of the government, I wish to congratulate Senator Farrell on his election as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. As would have been very apparent from the reaction of government senators, Senator Farrell, you are a very, very popular senator, at least on my side of the chamber!


I know that former Prime Minister the great John Howard had something of a monopoly on Lazarus references in his career, but your comeback really would have to be the greatest since Lazarus. Government senators look forward to working with you, and we wish you well.


While I am on my feet, I advise that Senator Scullion will be absent from question time today due to official business. In his absence, I will represent the Indigenous affairs portfolio.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (14:03):  Thank you, Senator Brandis, for those kind words. I am not sure how long it is going last—I will put the next question! I am pleased to say that, not only do I have friends on that side, I also have an awful lot of friends on this side. 


My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's statement in the Senate on 1 December 2015, during the debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill 2015, in which he said:


These changes have been reviewed by the Solicitor-General and he has now advised that they have a good prospect of being upheld by the High Court.


Does the Attorney-General agree that the assurance from him led senators in this place to believe that the bill, as introduced, has been reviewed by the Solicitor-General?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (14:04):  Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Solicitor-General's letter to the Attorney-General dated 12 November 2015, in which he said that the bill in question 'reflected new changes that were made without seeking my further advice' and, further, that the statements about the Solicitor-General having advised on the bill were inaccurate. How does the Attorney-General reconcile his unqualified assurance to the Senate with the written advice from the Solicitor-General 19 days earlier?

As you will recall, the bill went through many iterations. The Solicitor-General provided advice, both written and orally, at various times throughout and his views informed the drafting of the bill. As you know, the government does not release its legal advice. I did make the statement to the Senate that you have quoted and I stand by it.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:04):  As I said in answer to your primary question, this bill evolved through many iterations. The Solicitor-General was involved. From time to time during the course of those iterations, I was asked questions in relation to the Solicitor-General's involvement and I acquainted those who inquired of me what it was. That includes the statement that you have quoted, which I stand by.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:06):  I thank Senator Hume for her question. I am pleased to say that, last night, the government delivered on its election commitment to protect the volunteers in the Country Fire Authority from a hostile union takeover instigated by the Andrews Labor government in Victoria. This is a victory for the thousands and thousands of men and women who have fought tirelessly to defend the integrity, the autonomy and the authority of their CFA. 


I would like to thank the Senate crossbench, including One Nation, the Nick Xenophon Team, the Liberal Democrats, Derryn Hinch's Justice Party and Family First, who all supported the CFA volunteers. Together we have ensured that this vital organisation will be autonomous and strong and will continue to keep Victorians safe. This has been a very long and a very sorry saga. The Country Fire Authority is one of the largest and the most effective volunteer based organisations in the world. It is something that Australians and in particular the Victorians in this place should be so very proud of.


As you know, Mr President, in particular over the past few months a dark cloud has been cast over the 60,000 volunteers. The proposed enterprise agreement, despite—



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator CASH:
  the lack of respect being shown by Senator Cameron. This is how members of the Australian Labor Party under Bill Shorten treat volunteers. They show a complete lack of respect for them. On this side of the chamber we will continue to put volunteers first every day of the week.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:08):  Despite the interjections from those opposite, perhaps they would like to listen to former minister Jane Garrett and what she had to say about the proposed enterprise agreement. The last time I checked, she did not sit on this side of the chamber in Victoria. She did not sit on the Liberal government's side; she sat with the Labor government, those who are in power. She was so disgusted by what Daniel Andrews and Bill Shorten are endorsing in Victoria that she stepped aside. A senior minister was so disgusted with what she was being asked to do that she put her principles first, unlike those on the other side, who are prepared to trample all over the 60,000 volunteer firefighters in Victoria. Quite frankly, shame on Mr Shorten. Mr Shorten is allegedly a member from Victoria. If I was a constituent in Victoria, I would be ashamed to have him as one of our members. (Time expired)

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (14:10):  Unfortunately, I can. What we have seen over the past few months in particular is a shameless power grab by the United Firefighters Union wholly endorsed by the Daniel Andrews Labor government. And, of course, last night we saw it on full display in the Senate when those opposite refused to support the 60,000 volunteers and instead were prepared to defend the actions of the United Firefighters Union every step of the way. You are talking about tens of thousands of Victorian men and women who selflessly put their lives on the line because they believe in their Victorian communities. The Labor Party have shown they do not care for volunteers and they will not show them respect, and shame on them.

 (South Australia) (14:15):  My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Senator Birmingham. Senator, BP today announced that they will not pursue their plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park. Will you now join with the Greens and others in congratulating the South Australian community for standing up to this big oil company and making it clear that BP are not welcome in our spectacular marine environment?

I recognise that BP have said that they have pulled out of the bight because of financial reasons—they cannot make this project viable—but of course they were putting at risk the fishing and tourism industries. When will the government stand up for our tourism industry and our fishing industry and protect this area from big oil?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2016-10-11,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:16):  I cannot believe that a senator for South Australia would stand in this place and cheer the loss of investment and jobs in South Australia, as Senator Hanson-Young just did. I cannot believe that the invitation has been made for me to join her in congratulating people for deterring this investment and this creation of jobs in South Australia. This is a disappointing decision by BP. It is a disappointing decision that reduces the employment prospects for South Australians in the future. It is particularly disappointing for the communities of the west coast of South Australia who will loose out the most from investment that BP were planning to undertake as part of their continued exploration activities. I have been continually disappointed in this place by the fact that the Greens, in cooperation with other political parties, have sought to politicise BP's activities in relation to exploration and have sought to, indeed, create an environment where it is less attractive for somebody to actually proceed with a good, strong investment into the state of SA.


Of course, all of the usual environmental standards and procedures were being applied and NOPSEMA was doing its job in putting BP through all of the right assessments and conditions before final permits and approvals could be granted. But I cannot believe that we have a circumstance yet again where the Australian Greens seem to think it is appropriate to be a cheer squad for the loss of jobs and the loss of investment rather than actually recognising that this is another disappointing act in relation to investment in South Australia, which I am pleased that our government is working hard to try to rectify through programs like, of course, our record levels of defence industry investment. But also, as we have discussed previously, we need to continue to work— (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:19):  There is barely a question in that rant, but, nonetheless, in case Senator Hanson-Young missed it, NOPSEMA, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management. Authority, was going through a very rigorous process in relation to BP—very rigorous. On 16 November 2015 and again on 16 May 2016, when the BP announced environmental plan for the proposed petroleum exploration was declared, it had not yet met the criteria under environmental regulations. It was completely appropriate for NOPSEMA to do so. BP went through the process of submitting a new environmental plan for NOPSEMA's assessment. That was on 12 August 2016. On 28 September 2016, NOPSEMA requested further information from BP, and on 11 October 2016—that is, of course, today—BP took the commercial decision and announced it would not proceed. But NOPSEMA and environmental approvals did exactly their job, and to denigrate them or anybody else in this process is ridiculous from Senator Hanson-Young while she cheers the loss of jobs.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:20):  There remain outstanding licences that the minister for resources, Senator Canavan, would be better to speak of, in terms of exploration licences that exist in the Great Australian Bight. The Commonwealth believes that we can effectively protect our marine parks and marine sanctuaries while also enabling economic activity to occur, that we can get the balance right from the Turnbull government to protect our environment through the high standards applied by agencies such as NOPSEMA while encouraging exploration and investment activity that can, of course, lead to the creation of greater wealth and further job opportunities. We will not be taking a backward step in relation to encouraging firms and others to undertake exploration activities that can lead to job creation, as long as they meet the tough environmental standards that are already in place, that BP was being held to and that any other investor or licence holder in this area will be equally held to in the future.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (15:03):  This is the first time I have had the opportunity to congratulate you in your new role, Madam Deputy President.


I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the Solicitor-General.


As you may well have noted, all of the questions from the opposition were to Senator Brandis. One of those questions, of course, was a question that I, in fact, asked. Because of the way we have to ask questions in this place, I did not get the opportunity to put both the statements of Senator Brandis about one particular matter directly with those of the Solicitor-General. But I would like to do that in the course of taking note.


I would like to go back to the quote that I made regarding Senator Brandis's comments on 1 December in respect of a citizenship bill that was passed in this parliament. He said: 


These changes have been reviewed by the Solicitor-General and he has now advised that they have a good prospect of being upheld by the High Court.


I would like to juxtapose that to the advice that was given by the Solicitor-General 19 days earlier. He said: 'The bill in question reflected new changes that were made without seeking my further advice.' Putting those two statements together, both of them cannot, of course, be right. Both of those statements cannot be right. One of them has to be wrong.


In this place, it is true that we all have an obligation to tell the truth. That is the first obligation. Ministers, I would submit, have an even higher obligation to tell the truth and make sure that nothing they say seeks to mislead or is incorrect. The highest obligation, I would submit to you, Madam Deputy President, is on the Attorney-General—the first law officer of this country. Attorneys-general have special obligations as a result of their training. They have special obligations to this parliament and to the people of Australia. The reality is: both of those statements that I read out a moment ago cannot be correct. One of them has to be wrong. I think what this parliament and what this Senate wants to know is: who is not telling the truth about this matter? It is a very fundamental issue. We have, on the one hand, the first law officer of this country saying one thing about a set of events and, on the other hand, we have the No. 2 law officer, the Solicitor-General, saying something quite fundamentally different. Both of them cannot be right.


What this parliament needs an answer to—I would submit to you, Madam Acting Deputy President—is the answer to the question: who is telling the truth? In one of his answers Senator Brandis said: this is all semantics. It was not an answer to my question. He is saying it is all semantics. I would submit to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, this is not an argument about semantics. There is quite a fundamental difference here. I will just repeat what Senator Brandis said. He said: these changes have been reviewed by the Solicitor-General and he is now advised that they have a good prospect of being upheld by the High Court. 




Senator Brandis:
  Identify the changes you are referring to.




Senator FARRELL:
  I have referred to it already. 




Senator Brandis:
  Identify the changes. 




Senator Cameron:
  You can't question him.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2016-10-11,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:09):  Can I add the congratulations of my fellow government senators to the new Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Farrell. He is an inspiration to us all. If anyone can come back in the way that he has there is hope yet for all of us. I will note that I hope that his contribution to the chamber today was just a reflection of his day one nerves and that his contributions will improve in quality and consistency from this day forward, as I am sure they will. 


Before I address the direct point raised in questions today and take note of the answers given, I would just like to make a general observation, with the Senate's indulgence, on the topic chosen by those opposite to focus on yet again today in question time, as they did yesterday in question time, and that they have chosen to focus on yet again in their motions to take note of answers today, as they did yesterday. This is a parliament which deals with weighty issues. This is a parliament which deals with important issues. This may be an important issue but it is by no means the only important issue that we have been talking about today or that we will deal with this week. I note for the record that the opposition has asked no questions today on the government's legislation to protect volunteers, with the CFA bill that passed the Senate last night. They have obviously lost interest in that issue. I note that they have asked no questions at all about the government's announcement today of the structural separation of the Australian Submarine Corporation. The government announced reforms in that area today. I note that they have asked no questions about the important reforms that Senator Birmingham, the education minister, has announced to VET to ensure that taxpayers' money is being used as it was intended to be used, and that the best value for money is being sought. I note that they have a particular and special interest in this issue. They are entitled to follow it, and I realise it is not my role as a senator to give them tactical advice. But, I tell you, you are flogging a dead horse on this one, and it is becoming increasingly clear that you are. 


One other general observation I would like to make about this issue is on the understanding of consultation. Even in my short time in the Senate, I am coming to realise that people in this place have a very different idea of what constitutes consultation. I will give one example without identifying the parties involved, because it is not fair to them. Last week in a Senate committee hearing, we had a lobby group come and give evidence about a change in the law which they had an interest in. They stated to the committee that they had participated in no consultation at all and that this was a great disappointment to them. They were probed with a few questions about this issue of consultation and they more or less came back to us and assured us that there had been no material consultation. Later on, the department itself appeared before the committee. We obviously sought to clarify this with them, because it would be a bad thing if the department had not done any consultation. The department—and I am paraphrasing; I do not have the exact details in front of me—was able to inform the committee that they had in fact sent a letter to the group in question, that they had a direct meeting with the group in question about the issue in question and that one of the members of that group was on an advisory council that the government regularly seeks advice from on this issue. So they clarified for the committee that there was in fact consultation, even though the group in question did not feel that there had been sufficient the consultation. It is possible in this world that we have differing interpretations of what was said at a meeting and what exactly constitutes consultation, but from where I sit I am completely satisfied that the appropriate process was followed in this instance and that the Solicitor-General was appropriately consulted, as he is required to be. 


As the Attorney-General has noted in his answers today and yesterday when this question has been raised, as well as in the media, the exact appropriate process was followed in this instance. The law does require that the Attorney-General consult the Solicitor-General in this instance, and he did so. Let me spell out some of the details of that in the remaining minute that I have. Over the years, a practice has developed contrary to the Law Officers Act that the Solicitor-General had been receiving briefs directly across government rather than through the Attorney-General, as it was intended when the office was established in 1916 for the purpose of assisting the Attorney-General in the performance of his duties. The new direction establishes a whole-of-government procedure that gives effect to section 12(b) of the Law Officers Act 1964. The guidance note is simply the document that is circulated within the Public Service to give effect to the legal services direction. These arrangements do not limit the independence of the Solicitor-General. They do nothing to change the effect of the Law Officers Act.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:14):  I thank Senator Paterson for his contribution and his advice and, in some sense, the permission that he has given us to pursue this issue. I am not sure we were seeking it, but it was given. It is no wonder that government members want this issue to go away and pretend that there is nothing to see here. I can see attempts to diminish this as an insignificant matter and that there are many more important matters—and, to some degree, that argument holds. There are many, many other important matters that the Senate will continue to discuss over this sitting week. But let's not pretend that the open disagreement and potential misleading of this chamber is not a significant matter that every senator in this place should be concerned about and should be wanting to pursue.


We know that on 4 May this year the Attorney-General issued a direction known as the Legal Services Amendment (Solicitor-General Opinions) Direction 2016. The substance of the actual direction is for a debate on another day. The issue that we have been pursuing and will continue to pursue is whether the statement by the Attorney-General that he consulted the Solicitor-General on this legal instrument is true. It is about whether the explanatory statement to that direction—which specifically confirms that the Attorney-General had consulted the Solicitor-General on the individual legal direction itself—issued in the name of the Attorney-General, signed off personally by him and tabled in this chamber, is actually correct. It is about whether information tabled in this chamber, the Australian Senate, by the Attorney-General of Australia can actually be believed.


What we have learnt in this extraordinary episode, which sees the first and second law officers of the country in open disagreement, is that we have a new standard being set by this Attorney-General. For one, there is a brand-new legal definition of 'consultation.' Under the new 'Brandis standard', consultation is now defined as having a meeting about one subject and then trying to pass that meeting off six months later as consultation as defined by relevant legislation on a completely different subject altogether. What a ridiculous proposition to argue. No-one believes it, because it is simply unbelievable. Perhaps the only people that do believe it are the Attorney-General, himself, and those who occupy the parallel universe that he clearly exists in.


What we know is that the Solicitor-General sought a meeting with the Attorney-General to ensure that his advice was sought on matters of importance, to ensure that requests for advice were made in a timely fashion, to ensure that advice was sought in the case of legislation where further amendments were being made and to ensure that the Solicitor-General's advice was represented accurately in public. These are the issues that the Solicitor-General sought to prosecute in the November meeting. For the Attorney-General to pass off the November meeting as a consultation on the content of the legal direction, which was tabled in this place and which sought to significantly constrain the ability of the Solicitor-General as an independent officeholder, as being something that was discussed at that meeting is clearly incorrect. Indeed, the staff notes that have been released by the Attorney-General confirm that at that meeting no mention whatsoever was made of a legally binding direction which concerned the performance of the functions of the Solicitor-General or the requirement that the Attorney-General's advance approval must be granted before advice from the Solicitor-General could be sought.


It is very clear the direction was never mentioned, neither in the November meeting nor, indeed, in the meeting held on 23 March on other matters that were raised. There was no discussion of the direction. There was no discussion of the content of the direction. The Attorney-General's own letter on 4 May acknowledges this by mentioning the direction with the words, 'I have also issued an amendment to the Legal Services Direction 2005 and enclose a copy of the document.' It is clear from the letter that this is the very first time the Solicitor-General was made aware of it.


I asked that question in question time today. The Attorney-General has undertaken to come back with an answer, but, if you go on the facts as outlined in the submission from the Solicitor-General to the committee, it is very clear that the first time he was made aware of the legal direction was on 4 May—after it was tabled in this place—in a letter from the Attorney-General advising him that was the case. That is central to the problem that we have here with what Senator Brandis has said. (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  Can I also add my congratulations to Senator Farrell on his election to the position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. Indeed, Senator Farrell has a huge job ahead of him. It is worth reminding ourselves that at the most recent federal election the Australian Labor Party recorded its second-worst primary vote in its history. So by any measure, Senator Farrell and indeed the whole Senate Labor team here in the Australian Senate have a massive job ahead of them. Senator Gallagher has made a very, very important contribution, and senators might have missed it. She conceded Senator Paterson's point that there are more important issues to be talking about.




Senator Gallagher:
  No, I did not.




Senator SMITH:
  Yes you did, Senator Gallagher. You conceded Senator Paterson's very, very good point that there are more important issues to be making and to be talking about in the Australian Senate today, this whole week and into the future. I just wish you had embellished that admission and nominated some of them. Interestingly, in the Australian Senate today we had Senator Lambie talking about a very important issue—that is, the affliction of ice on young people in our community. That is a question Labor could have asked the government today. Senator Hanson-Young talked about job losses and lost investment opportunities in South Australia, taking a very different position to the one I would have taken but nonetheless bringing to the Senate issues around job opportunities and lost investment in South Australia. Labor spent its precious time in the Australian Senate gilding the lily. I will just explain that point briefly before I bore the Senate with the dry details of why there is no case for Senator Brandis to answer.


I say that Senator Gallagher is gilding the lily, because she is trying to suggest there was a six-month delay in correspondence in delivering on the meeting that was held on 30 November. In actual fact it is closer to four months. Indeed, in that four-month time period there was a delay of 14 weeks, because the Solicitor-General took 14 weeks to respond to the substance of the consultation he had with the Attorney-General.


I do not need to remind those listening today and, indeed, my Senate colleagues that the temptation in politics to embellish the facts, to gild the lily, is tempting. But at a time in our country's history—and I just want to come to what I think are some of the more important issues at the moment—when there are very real challenges facing young people afflicted with drugs, people addressing issues of lost investment and job growth opportunities in their home states, the Australian Labor Party in the Senate wants to spend its time gilding the lily, prosecuting a case against the Attorney-General where there is no case to answer. There is no conspiracy in this: on the record exists already a 32-page document that Senator Brandis, as the Attorney-General, has made publicly available to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, which will spend Friday here in the Senate examining that evidence. There are no surprises, there is no conspiracy; but what we witnessed today was Labor's decision to spend its valuable time arguing issues where, to be frank, there is no case to answer and, to be more frank, are not the issues that are concerning Australians and Australian families at this important time.


Labor has cause for concern, because in that very prickly issue of industrial relations reform the coalition government achieved a sizeable victory last night in this Senate by securing the interests of volunteers in the country fire service in Victoria. Labor has a big challenge ahead of it in coming weeks as this Senate layers transparency and accountability over the trade union movement in a way that has not been done before, by debating the Australian— (Time expired)

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:24):  Once again we have on display by Senator Brandis ample demonstration of what we have known for so long on this side of the house: that he does an awful lot of slippery talking, says nothing clearly and that this is a pattern that is repeated day after day. I did note today, however, that he has got himself into such a mess this week he began his answers with some discipline and a little reading from notes. The problem is the slippery story is getting so slippery now that even the enormous brain of Senator Brandis is having trouble hanging onto the storytelling that he is undertaking. This slippery storytelling has now become a feature of what we expect from Senator Brandis every day.


He admits to absolutely never making a mistake. Even though he has actually been censured here by the Senate, no-one would know because we have this self-aggrandising persona: 'I am perfect. This is the truth. You should never question me. Just trust me; it'll all be fine.' People are over the hubris and arrogance that is embedded in the kinds of answers that are being given to the Senate by the first law officer of the land. The Attorney-General is contemptuous in the way he has responded to questions that were put to him today—we could not call them answers.


I do note that at one point today Senator Brandis said, 'I am very careful in my use of language'. I believe that was in response to a question that was asked by Senator Gallagher regarding the Don Dale matter. 'Very careful in my use of language.' We also had him claim, once again, 'I have been a barrister for 33 years'. This appeal to the superiority of having such a wonderful education is not something that should be trotted out as a veil between him and the truth that the Senate deserves. 'Don't question me. I'm a barrister; I'm beyond reproach.' The senator, by the quality—or lack of quality—of his responses to questions today reveals that he should not hide behind that sort of a defence in future, that he is bringing disrepute to that profession by the way he is contemptuously not responding to questions properly here in the Senate.


The only person, it seems to me, who is clearly communicating on the issue of advice and access is the person who has flatly rejected the claims of the Attorney-General—that is, the Solicitor-General. He has expressed concerns that are widely held now, and the level of these concerns continues to grow because of the sorts of answers we are getting from Senator Brandis. The Solicitor-General is very concerned that processes were not followed; that he was not consulted on what he has called 'matters of high legal importance'. Indeed the Attorney-General had a nonresponse to my question today where I cited Professor Gabrielle Appleby, who said is it possible that in not seeking the Solicitor-General's responses the Attorney-General is in fact:


… shopping around for politically convenient opinions and not accepting the opinion of the statutorily independent, apolitical Solicitor-General.


That is the concern that is alive and well right now amongst the legal fraternity, that this Attorney-General is changing legislation, which we have heard referred to by the new senator for the Liberal Party over on the other side, that parliament as long ago as 1916 set up, which, with some wisdom, allows people, senior ministers, to go and get advice from the Solicitor-General. But this Attorney-General has decided that he knows better, that he should put himself—his barrister's experience of 33 years, his hubris, arrogance and sense of ascendancy—between ministers of the Crown and the advice that, up until he decided to put this order in, they were entitled to have. That is what we are seeing on display every single day.


The Senate is told constantly by Senator Brandis: 'Leave it to me. There's no problem here.' But we are not getting detailed and proper answers. The Attorney-General's response to Senator Gallagher's question in particular was shameful: arrogant in tone, lacking in transparency and denying accountability. When he was simply asked for a date, he refused to give it. This Attorney-General— (Time expired)

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (15:29):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Lambie today relating to policies concerning illicit drugs.


Today I gave Attorney-General Brandis notice of my questions without notice regarding law changes to tackle ice addiction. I wanted to give him sufficient time to properly consider his answers and think about my argument for giving Australian parents, along with their family doctors, the right to involuntarily detox their children should those young people became addicted to ice. I am encouraged that he has given a commitment to consider my proposal carefully, and I will follow that up with a letter and a request for meetings. However, I am disappointed that, for the majority of his answers, he chose to read a prepared script which boasted about his government's so-called achievements. And I am very disappointed that, on my third question, he deliberately twisted his answer to give the impression that I was seeking his support to change the laws relating to drug dealers. While I am happy to talk about that issue as well, at a later date, all my questions clearly addressed the fact that Australian parents and their family doctors do not have the right, under existing state and federal laws, to involuntarily detox their children should they become addicted to ice.


As soon as a legally trained person hears the words 'involuntary treatment', an alarm bell goes off in their poor little head and they reach for a copy of the UN human rights charter. Lawyers have become so lost in their fight to protect the UN human rights charter that they forget the right of parents and medical professionals to protect children from the effects of a highly dangerous and addictive drug the likes of which we have never seen before. Indeed, very few lawyers will acknowledge that, under our existing state laws, there are provisions for involuntary medical treatment for patients suffering from severe mental health illnesses. They are called 'involuntary mental health orders'—people deemed by qualified medical professionals to be suffering from a mental health injury, and who are a danger to themselves and others, can be taken by the authorities to a medical facility for compulsory mental health treatment. This can all take place within the law and without breaching any fundamental UN human rights. 


So the point of my questioning to the Attorney-General this afternoon was to remind him, Labor, Greens and crossbench senators that an important legal precedent has already been established that allows involuntary medical treatment for people who are not in control of their actions and may be a danger to themselves, and certainly a danger to others. I think it is fair to compare the actions and symptoms of someone addicted to ice to the actions and symptoms of someone who may be subject to existing involuntary mental health orders. 


I have only my personal experiences and feedback from hundreds and thousands of concerned Australians to go by. I am not medically trained but I do know that, when someone is addicted to and under the influence of ice, they are certainly not themselves; they are not sane; I am not talking to a loved one anymore; all I am doing is talking to a drug. When you are trying to reason with an unreasonable, unpredictable, powerful and dangerous thing, you are trying to influence a person whose loving, caring self has gone missing; it is no longer there. They are replaced by a being who will do and say anything to feed an insatiable addiction the likes of which, I argue, we have never seen before. So if our laws allow medical professionals to order involuntary mental health treatment for patients who suffer from damaged mental health and are subject to dangerous, uncontrollable and unpredictable behaviour, why can't those same laws and medical process apply to our children, our most vulnerable and precious, who become addicted to ice?


Even with all the publicity, average Australians and politicians still do not understand how addictive ice really is. This failure to understand how addictive ice is has led to a situation where we do not have enough rehabilitation services or facilities and we do not have strong enough laws to allow for early intervention. So even if we could, by some miracle, deliver enough affordable rehab beds for all of Australia's ice-addicted children, under the current laws, if those ice-addicted children said they did not want to remain in rehab, they can just walk straight back out the front door. So the solution is to provide, firstly, affordable rehab beds; and, secondly, law changes which give parents the right to place their drug-addicted children in involuntary detox.

In fact some of the people named had never been banned, some had been banned on spurious grounds and some were under 18 and should never have been named irrespective. Some suffered material harm, particularly affecting employment. I acknowledge her contribution to journalism and promotion of women, but this was something nobody should be proud of.

Senator HINCH:
  Rebecca Wilson, who was Bec to her friends, was a trailblazer for female journalists—and not only sports journalists—where those early female reporters were regarded as interlopers in a predominantly male and often chauvinistic world. To Rebecca Wilson that just added another challenge. And it was fitting that her namesake, Caroline Wilson, another fearless female sports commentator, would pay tribute to her on radio 774 in Melbourne.


Rebecca Wilson came from a classy media family. You would watch her and her brother Jim, often in a war of words on Channel Seven, on the Sky News sports panel or on radio, and they gave sibling rivalry a new meaning. And their father, Bruce Wilson, was a renowned foreign correspondent for the Murdoch papers, especially the old Sun News-Pictorial in Melbourne. His kids, with ink in their veins, would lap up his war stories and big sports events like Wimbledon.


Now Bruce Wilson is gone and Rebecca has tragically gone at 54 years of age. Our thoughts are with her sons; her husband, John Hartigan—Harto, who is himself a legendary newspaper editor—and Jim, who lost his own little boy, Sam, to cancer. (Time expired)

  Given that what we are witnessing in the Philippines is unprecedented—we have seen now over 3,000 people killed as a result of extrajudicial killings authorised by the President of the Philippines—it is remarkable that a motion that does nothing other than call for the end to these extrajudicial killings would be denied formality by the government. If the government were true to its word in saying that it is calling for an end to these extrajudicial killings through the foreign minister, then why doesn't it support a motion that gives, effectively, force to those words? What we are witnessing in the Philippines, as I said, is unprecedented. These are people who are being killed with no trial—people who have not benefited from a fair trial—and are being killed for doing nothing other than, in the words of the President, potentially using illicit drugs. There are much more effective ways of dealing with this. (Time expired)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT
 (16:06):  The President has received the following letter from Senator Gallagher.


Dear Mr President


Pursuant to standing order 75, I propose that the following matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion: 


The Government's refusal to heed the lessons from the election and stand up for Medicare.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Is the proposal supported?




More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today’s debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:06):  Today's matter of public importance is 'the government's refusal to learn the lessons of the election and stand up for Medicare', and this is a really important issue. The Australian people have a right to be disappointed in this leaderless, directionless government. They have a right to feel betrayed. Mr Turnbull is looking after his big business mates and not the real concerns of the Australian people.


As demonstrated in the election, the health care that Australians and their loved ones receive is an issue of immense importance—possibly even the most important. During the election campaign, the government failed to convince the Australian people that they were committed to public health care—and, after the government delivered $50 billion in savage cuts to the health system, no wonder Australian voters were sceptical. The government hysterically claimed that Labor's campaign to protect Australia's healthcare system was a Mediscare campaign and that they, the Liberals and Nationals, were fully committed to the Australian healthcare system. At least 27 times during the election campaign, Mr Turnbull said that he would never outsource Medicare.


That is why, yesterday over in the House, Labor gave the government the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to a strong, public Australian healthcare system. But unfortunately the Liberal and National party members, including Mr Turnbull, voted against Labor's motion, which supported a guarantee to keep Medicare in public hands as a universal health insurance scheme for all Australians; to protect bulk-billing so that every Australian can see their doctor when they need to and not only when they can afford it; to reverse the government's harmful cuts to Medicare by unfreezing the indexation of the Medicare Benefits Schedule; to reverse the government's cuts to pathology that will mean Australians with cancer will pay more for blood tests; to reverse the government's cuts to breast screening, MRIs, X-rays and other diagnostic imaging which will mean Australians will pay more for vital scans; to abandon the plans to make all Australians, even pensioners, pay more for vital medicines; and to develop a long-term agreement to properly fund our public hospitals so Australians do not languish in our emergency departments or on long waiting lists for important surgery.


So it is absolutely obvious: Mr Turnbull and the government members have failed to stand up for Medicare in the parliament. In the days after the election Mr Turnbull said:


We have to do more to reaffirm the faith of the Australian people in our commitment to health and to Medicare.


He went on:


We will work harder, much harder … I would like Australians to believe that commitment to Medicare is completely bipartisan.


But, yesterday, only 100 days after the election, Labor gave him the opportunity and he failed—absolutely failed—to commit to protecting Medicare. It would appear Mr Turnbull just does not care about ensuring all Australians have access to health care.


Australians did not trust the Liberals with their health care before the election, and they sure do not trust them now. The Prime Minister has admitted he has a problem with Medicare, but he has shown no interest in fixing it, with not one change of policy and not a single dollar of cuts undone—not one in 100 days. He has backflipped on the backpacker tax and he has backflipped on his ironclad changes to superannuation but, when it comes to cutting Medicare, he knows which side he is on. What else would we expect from a Liberal Party that is ideologically opposed to universal health care? It has always championed a two-tier American style healthcare system. This is a government which, for three years, has done everything it can to push the price of health care back onto Australian families.


Australians are proud of their healthcare system and the idea at the core of Medicare: that every Australian can get the care that they need when they need it. Medicare speaks for our distinctive Australian character and our egalitarian tradition of the fair go. But if the Liberals have spent the last three years trying to hollow out Medicare, taxing it, cutting it, eating away at its very foundations, then we are in trouble. They have been seeking to tear Medicare down, brick by brick, piece by piece.


The government's record on Medicare speaks for itself: cutting bulk-billing so 14.5 million patients pay more to see a GP. That is 14.5 million Australians who will have to pay more to see a GP because of the Turnbull government. The College of GPs recently found one in three GPs are already revising their business models because they cannot stay viable under the Medicare freeze, with out-of-pocket health costs increasing by 19 per cent under this government. I am from Tasmania, as are two of my Senate colleagues here in the chamber, Senator Brown and Senator Polley, and we know and have met with a number of doctors in Tasmania who now no longer bulk-bill due to the cuts by this government. This government's cuts are directly hurting Tasmanians in need, and those opposite should be ashamed of supporting them, especially the Tasmanian senators opposite.


The cuts the government have made to health have cut across all parts of the sector: bulk-billing, hospitals, pathology, dental and palliative care, amongst many other areas. Just last night I spoke in this place about the government's unwillingness to fund Palliative Care Tasmania, and on 12 September I wrote to the Prime Minister explaining the importance of the work that Palliative Care Tasmania does, urging him to fully fund it into the future or at least provide interim funding to cover it until the review of the Better Access to Palliative Care program. But, of course, I do not hold out much hope for that, because I know that those opposite do not care about the health of Australians, and they certainly do not care about the dying of Australians and making sure that Australians can have a good death.


The government are happy to pretend that they care about the healthcare system, but they have failed to convince the Australian people, because their actions show that they do not really care. We know that the government established a 20-person $5 million Medicare privatisation task force, and we also know that this government told the Productivity Commission to investigate privatising all human services, including Medicare. And we know that the government's decision to award the contract for the National Cancer Screening Register to Telstra adds to a string of evidence that they cannot be trusted to keep Medicare in public hands.


We have seen government cuts to pathology as well. During the election, the Liberals engineered a short-term political stunt to hide their pathology cuts until the polls closed. But rest assured: Mr Turnbull is as committed as ever to making Australians pay more for their vital tests, with confirmation his massive cuts to pathology remain a ticking time bomb. It is just not good enough.


This government remains determined to make cancer patients, and others with chronic health conditions, pay more for their vital tests, and the cuts could come into effect in only a month or two. It is my view, and the view of those on this side, that Mr Turnbull needs to drop these cuts entirely.


The government's cuts to bulk-billing incentives will impact vital pathology tests—including blood tests, urine tests, swabs such as pap smears, and biopsies. Combined with his cuts to diagnostic imaging, patients could be left with hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars in up-front costs simply for vital scans and tests. Australians should be able to have the blood tests they need without being left hundreds of dollars out of pocket.


Mr Turnbull claimed to have learnt a lesson at the election, but the fact is he has not reversed a single one of his health cuts—not one. He has had 100 days; he has not reversed one. He will keep attacking bulk-billing and increasing out-of-pocket costs. It is about time that Mr Turnbull got his priorities right and started caring about the health of all Australians. He should stop making Australians feel that they were betrayed at the last election. He is so busy looking after his big business mates and not the real concerns of the Australian people. As I said, the health care that Australians and their loved ones receive is of immense importance—possibly even the most important thing we could be talking about.


During the election campaign the government failed miserably to convince Australian people that it was committed to public health care. Let's remember that it delivered $50 billion in savage cuts to the health system—no wonder most people are sceptical—and the government hysterically claimed that Labor's campaign to protect Australia's healthcare system was a 'Medicare' campaign. They went absolutely troppo—I presume it is parliamentary to use the word 'troppo'.



So many times during the election campaign did they point out how they are fully committed to the Australian healthcare system. They are committed to 'an' Australian healthcare system but, unfortunately, it is more like the American healthcare system. At least 27 times during the election campaign Mr Turnbull said he would 'never outsource Medicare'. But do not be mistaken, Mr Turnbull will outsource Medicare at the drop of a hat. At the drop of his top hat he will outsource Medicare. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-10-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:17):  I am absolutely amazed that the Labor Party would raise for debate the issue of Medicare, after the disgraceful lying campaign conducted by the Labor Party and their union mates at the last election when union thugs were standing at the pre-poll queues. They picked their mark—older people, frail ladies. They would rush up to them and say, 'The Liberals are going to abandon Medicare.' This continued on and on. It is an outright and complete and absolute lie that the Labor Party will forever stand condemned for.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I stood next to a CPSU lady who was doing this, after she had threatened an elderly person. When I said to the elderly person: 'Excuse me madam, what you've just heard is a complete fabrication. The government is not selling Medicare,' the CPSU lady said to me, 'You're bullying me.' I say this because of those opposite now. I said, 'Hang on, I'm bullying you? I am simply talking to this lady and telling her the truth.' The CPSU lady said, 'You're bullying me. You're standing in my space.' I assume that is the new union way. If someone challenges them, particularly if they happen to be a female, the retort is: 'You're bullying me.' In this case, the bullying was being done by this CPSU lady picking on vulnerable frail people and telling them abject and absolute lies.


In debates such as this it is always useful to have a little bit of fact. What you heard from the previous Labor Party speaker, Senator Bilyk, was a congregation of lies, mistruths and misinformation. Let me give you the real facts. The coalition government is investing $22 billion in Medicare, which is over a billion dollars more than last year. That will increase to nearly $26 billion additional in 2019-20. Again to put the lie to the comments made by the previous speaker, bulk-billing rates are the highest they have ever been ever. GP bulk-billing rates are at over 85 per cent compared to when Labor was in power—the people who proposed this MPI. When they were in power the average rate was 79 per cent. I will repeat those: under the coalition we have an GP bulk-billing rate of 85 per cent and under Labor it was 79 per cent.


In the last financial year, across Australia there were 17 million more bulk-billed GP attendances than in Labor's last year in office. I will repeat that because those listening to this broadcast might want to have the facts rather than the lies that were told by earlier speakers: there were 17 million more bulk-billed GP attendances compared to Labor's last full year in office. More people than ever are seeing a general practitioner, a doctor, without having to pay anything.


To continue with some factual input into this debate, I will talk about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which was mentioned by the previous speaker. I mention that because I am particularly proud of the way our government has listed new medicines for cancer, including melanoma, for cystic fibrosis and for a cure for hepatitis C. Many of these medicines would have cost people tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars a year, but we have been able to list them, so now they cost only $38, or $6 for a concession script.


I was particularly involved in the hepatitis C campaign, as was my colleague Senator Dean Smith, who took a lead in it. I have a relative who had hepatitis C who went through 48 weeks of sheer agony in an old form of possible treatment. For him, I am pleased to say, it did work. But he went through agony—he and his family and his children. The government has since allowed onto the PBS this new treatment, where you take one pill for 12 weeks, and it is almost a guaranteed cure. 


I was told, when the pharmaceutical companies were coming to me, lobbying to get this onto the PBS, that the treatment would have cost—they were a bit coy about the actual cost—somewhere between $70,000 and $100,000. That was the cost of this drug. You can now get it, thanks to the coalition government, for just $38, and for those with hepatitis C it is almost a cure.


In addition to that, in the coalition government's first three years, 1,000 new medicines were approved for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and that is worth some $4.4 billion. Can I just compare this—I remind you: 1,000 in three years under the coalition—with Labor's last three years, when there were 331 new medicines on the PBS. 


If you had taken any notice—and I am sure not many people did—of the previous speaker, you would think that the health system was in chaos. But, there we are: under Labor, 331 new medicines in three years on the PBS; under the coalition, three times that.


Not only are more medicines available; they are now cheaper. In an Australian first, the price of a large proportion of expensive combination medicines and patent-protected drugs on the PBS have reduced by as much as $20 under the coalition. On 1 October this year more than 2,000 medicine brands treating common conditions dropped in price for millions of Australians.


I have to say: the Liberal and National parties are the only political parties with a plan. Our economic plan will enable us to pay for Medicare, so that Australians can continue to receive the health care they do now and into the future. Can I just emphasise that. Labor will talk about these things. They will throw promises around, as they are good at doing, but they never have any concept of how they are going to pay for it. 


Under Labor—and this is a historic fact—the economy goes backwards. Taxes go upwards, and Australians suffer. You have to have a change of government every now and again to get the economy back on track. Why do we want the economy back on track? We want it back on track so that government can be in surplus and can spend money on what Australians want—and that is, a decent health system, which they never got under Labor. All congratulations go to the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Sussan Ley. She has done a wonderful job.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  These members of the Labor Party are arguing with me—1,000 new medicines under the coalition, 300 under Labor. Come on! Let me have the argument. There are 17 million more people getting GP services free under the coalition than under the last year of Labor. Argue with those facts, and see where they go.


Under this government we care about health. We care about Medicare. We will continue to invest in Medicare to the benefit of all Australians, and we will do that because we are getting the economy back on track and can afford it as a nation.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:26):  Well, let's really put some facts on the table. We know that the coalition government have a record that will never be beaten—as a government that historically have always made cuts to health. Going right back to the Howard era, one of Tony Abbott's last acts, when he was the Minister for Health, was to cut $1 billion out of health. 


What do we have now? We have the worst health minister that this country has ever seen—the worst health minister. We have a health minister who sits in cabinet with no authority. She is a minister for health and a minister for ageing, and what has she done? Absolutely nothing. They went to the last election with not one ounce of credible policy when it comes to ageing. But let's stick with the issues that are before us now.


We can look at Medicare. Yesterday marked 100 days—100 long days—since this government was elected, and they have neither stopped nor dropped any of their cuts to health and to Medicare, further highlighting their inability to have learnt anything at all from the federal election. 


The Liberals in my home state of Tasmania are still in shock because they lost the federal seat of Bass. It was won by Ross Hart, the new Labor member for Bass. Why did he win? He won because the Australian people, in particular the Tasmanian people, understood that Malcolm Turnbull and his government cannot be trusted when it comes to health. Ross Hart won that seat from a member who had continually voted against the interests of his constituents. 


We went out and campaigned on the issues that matter to the people of Bass and to the people of Tasmania. They know, first hand, that we have the oldest population, the quickest ageing population and, unfortunately, in Tasmania, some of the worst chronic illnesses affecting our people. So we value Medicare. 


But we know that those on that side of the chamber want to undermine Medicare. It is in their DNA. It is in their core belief system. They do not support a universal healthcare system. If they had their way, we would go down the same trail as the Americans, where only those who can afford it have access to good health care. Those on that side of the chamber have always had the view that your credit card should determine whether or not you get good health care in this country. 


We have seen, under this government, an increase in the cost of private health insurance. It is getting to the point where there are more people dropping out of private health care because they cannot afford it. Unfortunately, people need that care the most as they get older. The problem is: as you approach retirement age, if you are on the Australian pension you cannot afford to take out private health insurance. Those in this country who are most vulnerable deserve the protection of the Commonwealth government. That is the very least that they should be able to rely on this government for—to provide them with the best health care possible.


We know that those on that side cannot be trusted. They have learnt nothing at all from the results in Tasmania where we took three seats from the Liberals. The three amigos had to leave town, as I have spoken about many times before in this chamber. We have also seen that this is a government which refuses to listen to the community. We know that it is going to cost all Australians more money to have a pathology test. For those people who are living with and fighting cancer, it is going to cost them more to have their pathology tests. For myself and my colleagues Senators Brown, Urquhart and Bilyk, we know, coming from Tasmania, what Medicare means to our people. It is shameful that the Liberal senators in this chamber from Tasmania will not stand up, cross the floor and support the Tasmanian community to ensure that it has the health care that it deserves.


As Senator Bilyk said previously, why should somebody have to pay $300 up-front to have an MRI? This is someone who has already had brain tumours. That is a burden. We need to ensure that people get the best care that they can as soon as they can. A parent should not have to have a choice between whether a mother can go and have her Pap smears or put food on the table, or pay the school fees. These are fundamental rights of all Australians. We know on this side that Mr Turnbull has not been the Prime Minister that the Australian people thought they were voting for. In fact, I think he is best known in the community—from the conversations that I have on a regular basis—as the 'Prime Minister for thought bubbles'. If he sees an idea floating through the sky in a bubble, he will grab it and have a go at it. That is not the sort of leadership that we need in this country. Why should Australian pensioners and those who are most vulnerable have to pay more for vital medications?


We had Senator Macdonald here with his usual ramblings and babbling on that he does, accusing people of bullying people at polling booths. He ought to have a look at his own backyard first. He is one of the worst culprits in this chamber of bullying other senators, particularly women on this side of the chamber. We know, as I said before, that it is in the belief system of those opposite—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Senator Smith, on a point of order?




Senator Smith:
  I understand that it is the custom and the tradition to make—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Your point of order?




Senator Smith:
  Senator Polley should remove those remarks that she has made about Senator Macdonald bullying women. They are untrue.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, can I invite you to withdraw that comment and then continue your remarks.




Senator POLLEY:
  I will continue my remarks.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Would you withdraw that comment?




Senator POLLEY:
  I am not going to withdraw the remarks because he does come into this chamber and bully women.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, with respect, you did reflect on a colleague in the Senate.




Senator Carol Brown:
  Withdraw.




Senator POLLEY:
  I withdraw.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.




Senator POLLEY:
  Let us get back to the real issue before the chamber—that is, as the Australian people know, the Turnbull government cannot be trusted when it comes to our health system. We know that Medicare is fundamental to ensuring that all Australians have access to the best health care possible. We have been envied around the world for our health system. Whether you look at the United Kingdom, the United States or Canada, we have always been up there as the world leader. That is under threat because, as we know, the Turnbull government will do all that they can to undermine Medicare. We know their agenda is to privatise Medicare—we know that. That is why we will always stand up and protect Medicare. We know that those in the other place had the opportunity yesterday to support the position that Labor put before the House to ensure that Medicare could never ever be privatised. But what did we see? We saw the government members vote against that.


Senator Macdonald made a contribution that claimed that we were over here scaring people into believing that the health system was in crisis. Well, that is exactly what is happening in the Royal Hobart Hospital today. That is exactly what is facing the people at the Launceston General Hospital in my home state. They are in crisis. Leading into the federal election, we had numerous doctors at the Launceston General Hospital threatening to walk out. We had them reducing their hours. They are in crisis. We have an incompetent minister in the state parliament, Mr Ferguson, who has no idea how to resolve the health issues that are confronting the Tasmanian community.


So it is the responsibility of Minister Ley and Minister Ferguson to ensure that our hospitals are functioning and are provided with the resources that they need to deliver the best outcome for all Tasmanians. We should not have 92-year-old women dying in a storeroom. We should not have 91-year-old men on the floor because there are no beds. We should not have our elderly Australians not being treated with respect and not having access to the best health system that we can provide. It is an indictment on the Turnbull government. It is a disgrace for the Turnbull government. It is a disgrace that the minister responsible for this area, Minister Ley, does not have the capacity to deliver what they went to the election with to ensure that Australians have the health system that we can all be proud of. It is damning on this government.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2016-10-11,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (16:36):  I rise to speak to the matter of public importance and the government's refusal to heed the lessons from the election and stand up for Medicare. On 9 July one of the world's oldest and most respected current affairs and news magazines published an article which talked about the Turnbull government's performance and the mandate it had won at the last double dissolution election. Senators—especially government senators—may like to reflect on what the Economist had to say:


When Malcolm Turnbull sought a second term for his conservative Liberal-National coalition government by calling an early general election, he promised Australians a break from nearly a decade of dysfunctional politics and short-lived national leaders. The prime minister—Australia’s sixth in a decade—asked voters to deliver a mandate for “strong, stable majority government” so that he could take them to the “greatest years in our history”.


Instead, on July 2nd, they delivered a humiliating verdict.


As the Economist indicates, this government does not have a mandate for their policies from the Australian people, because this government was delivered a humiliating verdict by the Australian people on 2 July. And one of the main reasons why the government barely managed to maintain control of the treasury bench in the lower house after their majority melted from 15 to 1 is, as this MPI suggests, the government's refusal to heed the lessons from the election and stand up for Medicare.


How could we forget that the Turnbull Liberal government, over the 2015-16 Xmas-New Year holiday break, promised to make changes to Australia's Medicare bulk-billing rebate. The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia said at the time that the Liberal's changes to bulk-billing would result in an extra patient fee of at least $30 for women's pap smears alone. Our Medicare system, just like our public health system, is under terrible pressure. And, as we have already heard, in Tasmania, we are suffering from the effects of bad health management from not just the federal Liberal Party but also the state Liberal Party and the state minister in Tasmania. Our public hospital system is overloaded and failing patients because of underresourcing and pressure from the federal government on the Medicare bulk-billing system. Our public health system is in severe crisis, with Launceston and Hobart hospitals absolutely overflowing. They are 100 per cent choked up. Tasmanians are dying while waiting for life-saving surgery. There are 4,000 Tasmanians on a 12-month waiting list for a simple procedure like a colonoscopy, which can prevent cancer. Yet, over the next 10 years, Australia will borrow between $50 billion and $70 billion to give away in foreign aid. Both state and federal governments have clearly failed homeless and sick Tasmanians, yet the same politicians have said that, over and above our normal refugee intake, an extra 500 people will be housed, fed and cared for in Tasmania. Will those people go to the front of the queue for public housing and medical treatment? Before we take any more refugees, I am calling on the politicians who have created our public housing and health crises to prevent Tasmanians from becoming homeless and dying unnecessarily on public health waiting lists.


There is no long-term public health plan in place to look after residents of the North and North West of Tasmania. For North West patients to have equity of access and continuity of quality health care, the North West Coast should have one centralised regional hospital, based between Devonport and Burnie. This, of course, will not occur overnight; however, it would be visionary to commence planning for its construction now. We need to think long term for the betterment of our children and our region—not for one election cycle or from one election cycle to another.


There are of course many complexities involved in providing health services, especially in Tasmania, with its geographical disadvantages, weather and decentralised population. It is even more complex when you have two medium-sized, competing hospitals within 45 minutes of each other, with both suffering from being dependent on expensive professional locums. Having one centralised regional hospital would promote sustainability of health services on the North West Coast, increase the chance of recruiting and keeping specialists and staff; benefit from a critical mass of patients; and boost opportunity for funding. To avoid wasteful spending on infrastructure, planning on a new greenfield hospital site should commence as soon as possible, with the realisation that funding may not be available for 10 years or more.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:41):  It pains me to admit it, but there are days when I admire the Australian Labor Party in this Senate, certainly for their cheek and disregard for the evidence. Let's look at the wording of this motion from Senator Gallagher:


The Government's refusal to heed the lessons of the election and stand up for Medicare.


Well, let's take that accusation in two parts, because I think senators opposite will find that, if there is anyone in this building who is refusing to heed the lessons of the most recent federal election, it is not the coalition; it is indeed the Labor Party. I think it is important to get on the record very early, right here, right now, that, on 2 July this year at the federal election, the Australian Labor Party received the second-lowest primary vote in its history. The lessons of the election that was just held was that the Australian Labor Party received the second-lowest primary vote in its history. I would have thought that was something not to boast about. I wouldn't have thought that achieving the second-worst primary vote result your party has received was something to be proud of. That is doubly the case when your campaign ran the most cynical and dishonest campaign I have seen in what will next year be 30 years as a member of the Liberal Party. I have not seen a more dishonest campaign. 



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I was there in 1993 when you tried to do a similar exercise with regard to Medicare. In its desperation, the Australian Labor Party threw everything at its Medicare campaign—a campaign based on the completely false, illogical and utterly unsustainable charge that the government was planning to 'privatise' Medicare. 




Senator McKim:
  Children overboard.




Senator SMITH:
  If I get to the end of my contribution, Senator, I am going to put some facts on the table that Tasmanian senators—you, Senator Brown, Senator Polley, Senator Bilyk and Senator Lambie—will find most revealing about what has happened to bulk-billing rates in your state.



Senator Carol Brown interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  If you knew them, Senator Brown, you might have revisited your contribution. You will have a chance to adjust your contribution, because I am going to give you the evidence before you speak. I would have thought the lesson of this election was that, ultimately, the Australian public does not reward dishonesty. Whatever momentary political success, the sorts of tactics Labor deployed may bring you in the short term are, in the end, not the things that will be rewarded by voters.


If there are lessons to be drawn from the election campaign, I argue that one of them is that the opposition needs to spend more time developing serious, credible, economic policies instead of resorting to cheap and dishonest tactics to try and win the day. Looking at the state of Victoria, I would argue that one of the lessons of the election campaign is that, when Labor chose militant unions over community volunteers, voters did not reward Labor. The passage through the parliament just yesterday of the government's laws that protect Victoria's CFA volunteers was a seminal moment. It was a victory for volunteers and for integrity, in the face of a shameless union power grab that was supported by the Australian Labor Party.


I would also add that another of the lessons from the election is that the people of Australia want a restoration of integrity and the rule of law to our construction sector, which this government is seeking to achieve with its commitments to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and bring its registered organisations bill to the parliament.


If collapsing union membership was not enough of a lesson for the Australian Labor Party, then surely the fact that they, the party of trade unions, came out of the election with the second-lowest primary vote they have received is a clear sign that something is wrong with their approach. Something is wrong with Labor's approach. Of course, you do not have to take my word for it, not surprisingly. Let us defer to John Black, a former Labor Senator for Queensland, who wrote in The Australian at the end of August this year:


Poor little Bill Shorten. Like the preppies at my kids' school, he got a nice congratulatory encouragement sticker just for finishing the race and, like a few of the preppies, he thinks that means he won.


His point is well made. For all the bravado and carry-on we hear from Labor senators in this place, particularly from Tasmania, you would think that they had won the election outcome. They did not win the election, and the reason they did not is that voters correctly saw that what the Labor Party of 2016 represents is no different to what the Labor Party of 2013 represented: a political party still beholden to trade unions, a party that has no credible plan for the future of this country and a party that is more interested in the quick headline than in serious policy reform.


That brings me, neatly, to the issue of Medicare, which is also the other focus of the motion moved this afternoon by Senator Gallagher. It used to be said, by former Prime Minister John Howard, that his government was the best friend of Medicare. I think that that was something of a boast at the time. However, that has now been overtaken. Let's have a look at Medicare evidence. You will see that it is the current government which provides the best support and protection for Medicare.


Let me pepper the debate with some evidence—some statistics—that have been missing from the contributions of Labor senators. An additional 17 million GP services were bulk-billed last year under the Turnbull coalition government, when measured against Labor's last full year in office under Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd. Now, I would have thought that if you were trying to destroy Medicare, which is the claim Labor senators are trying to make this afternoon, providing an additional 17 million GP services is not what you would be doing. Last year, the Turnbull government—which the Labor Party says wants to destroy Medicare—invested around $21 billion in Medicare. That represents an investment of about $60 million every day—not the action of people who want to destroy Medicare. In fact, no government has invested more in Medicare than the present Turnbull-coalition government. To give you a point of comparison, Labor invested an average of $17.7 billion in Medicare during their six years in government. That is $3.3 billion less than the Turnbull government has invested in just the last year. It is a shame that the Hansard does not record silence, because I notice Labor senators have fallen silent.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:50):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance, submitted by Senator Gallagher, on the government's refusal to heed the lessons from the election and stand up for Medicare. We have had some contributions from government senators here today, and they certainly have supported Senator Gallagher's motion by the fact that they have failed to heed the lessons.


Before I go on to some of the substantive issues that have been raised—not so much by the previous speaker, Senator Smith, who ranged all over the place—let's have a look at what the federal government's record on health has been. Mr Turnbull's record includes extending the freeze on Medicare rebates to six years, which is forcing out-of-pocket costs up. In my home state of Tasmania, during the election campaign, if you went to any of the GP surgeries or any of the clinics that people came to see me and talk to me about—I went to a GP surgery as well—there you could see in black and white in the surgery's or clinic's reception area a letter advising their patients that their fees would be going up because of the freeze. That is what it said, in every GP clinic that my constituents came to talk to me about. That is fact. It is not made up but fact.


Another thing the Turnbull government tried to do was abolish the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. If it is abolished it would push five million children onto a very, very long public dental waiting list. And that is still on the books with this government. They tried it before, in the omnibus bill, and it had to be taken out after pressure from the Labor Party. That is another fact. That is what this government are trying to do.


They also ripped $650 million out of Medicare by slashing bulk-billing incentives for diagnostic imaging and pathology. Do not take my word for it that that is what they are doing; let us look at the facts. That is why the pathology companies were running a campaign during the election. That is why the radiology officers were running a campaign throughout the election. That is why Mr Turnbull, during the election, backed down on it, but he certainly has not taken it off the table—his actions in recent times tell us that it is well and truly coming back. We heard from Senator Polley and Senator Lambie about what that will do to costs for people who are seeking those services. Thirty extra dollars for a pap smear. That is what your government is pushing onto the Australian community.


By all means do not accept that people out there in the community are awake to what you are doing to Medicare and with the cuts to health—don't accept it; I know you have an inability to accept that—but you should go back and talk to your constituencies. In my home state of Tasmania we saw Medicare as one of the biggest issues that people were talking to us about in terms of how they were going to vote. It was based on the freeze and the extra charges, the out-of-pocket costs, that would be coming through GP clinics. It was about the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. It was about the slashing of bulk-billing incentives for diagnostic imaging and pathology. And it was also about the other cuts to health programs that this government has inflicted on the Australian community.


Senator Polley talked about the fact that in my home state of Tasmania voters in Lyons, Bass and Braddon elected three very, very good, outstanding members of the Labor Party as their new representatives. They did that, and one of the main reasons they did that was because they wanted to see Medicare protected. So what have we seen in the last few days? Only yesterday we saw Mr Turnbull vote against a guarantee to keep Medicare in public hands as the universal health insurance scheme for all Australians, vote against a guarantee to protect bulk-billing so that every Australian can see their doctor when they need to and not only when they can afford it, and also vote against reversing the harmful cuts to Medicare by unfreezing the indexation of the Medicare benefits scheme.


Senator Smith talked about scare campaigns. It is a 'give me'—I know you quite like me, Senator Smith, but it is a 'give me'. I will not even mention $100 legs of lamb. I will not even mention Whyalla. But I will mention this: just recently we had the power outage situation in South Australia—very sad to see that happen—and what did we see? Straight away Mr Turnbull was in there blaming renewables, trying to start a huge scare campaign on renewables. And what did we then have? Dr Hewson—do you remember him, Senator Smith; I am sure you do—who said, 'Australia needs more renewables, not less.' I do digress, but these people are the kings of scare campaigns.


The matter of health and the matter of Medicare are far too important to let this government get away with what they are doing: bit by bit stripping away measures to support people when they need medical assistance. In my home state of Tasmania just recently we had an emergency in the Royal Hobart Hospital. It was an emergency that was a level 3 red status, which is the highest that it can go. It basically meant that there was a lack of beds at Tasmania's main public hospital. This is because more and more people are turning up to emergency services because of the pressure that they are under regarding the cost of going to the doctor. This government should not be let off the hook. (Time expired)

Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:58):  I too rise to speak in relation to this matter of public importance with respect to the government's alleged 'refusal to heed the lessons from the election and stand up for Medicare'. In politics, if you tell a lie often enough and you tell it loudly enough, eventually it will be believed—particularly when it is designed to evoke fear in the most vulnerable of our society. Senator Gallagher in this chamber today stated that the Turnbull government has made Medicare inaccessible and unaffordable—a big fat demonstrable lie designed to scare and mislead.


In WA on 20 June this year, Bill Shorten stated, 'If you want to protect Medicare, you vote for Labor in this election'—a big fat lie told often enough and loud enough to eventually be believed by Australia's most vulnerable. These are two big fat lies, but they are actually more than that. Instead of campaigning, and still keeping the lie going forward, on their own 'positive policies' for this nation, Labor continue to rely on scaring and misleading the Australian public and scaring the most vulnerable in our society. Mr Shorten's Medicare lie was simply that; but it was a lie so big, and told so frequently to the most vulnerable, that it ended up being believed.

  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Reynolds knows that she cannot say that about the Leader of the Opposition. She needs to withdraw it.

Senator REYNOLDS:
  I withdraw. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Please continue, Senator Reynolds. 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  These comments were clearly untrue. This message from the Labor Party about Medicare was so untrue and told so frequently to the most vulnerable people— 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, please resume your seat. Senator Marshall. 




Senator Marshall:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the same point of order: Senator Reynolds cannot simply repackage the same message and pretend she is not saying the same unparliamentary words. She must withdraw.

Senator Smith interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Yes, they might not like to hear what I have to say, but I have plenty of facts. Those opposite have spent the last half an hour or so making egregious allegations about those on my side and about our policies. One thing we did not hear from those opposite were the facts. Senator Lambie asked: 'What has this government actually done?' Listening to you speak, I was reminded of Monty Python's Life of Brian—'What have the Romans ever done for us?' in health, education and everything else.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  You have not provided any facts and figures. Let me provide the facts and figures that you have steadfastly refused to provide to this chamber. 



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Through the chair, thank you, Senator Reynolds. 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Through the chair, let me provide some of the facts and figures for you. The Turnbull government will increase Medicare funding by a further $2 billion this financial year alone—from $21 billion this year to $26 billion in four years. This is more funding in real terms than the previous Labor government ever provided. That is a fact. Let those opposite come back into this chamber and deny that is a fact. We talked about GP clinic visits in Tasmania. Well, let me tell you that, under this government, bulk-billing rates are the highest they have ever been in this nation. GP bulk-billing is now at 85 per cent, compared to an average of 79 per cent under Labor. This means that now, across Australia, more people than ever are not paying anything to go to see their GP. In fact, there are 17 million more bulk-billed services than there were under Labor. We were asked what it was in Tasmania. In Tasmania alone there are now 150,000 more bulk-billed services under this government than there were under those opposite. 


This year, we are investing more than $22 billion in Medicare, which is $1 billion more than last year. More than that, we are the only party that is also increasing the PBS. Under this government, over 1,000 new medicines have been approved for subsidisation for all Australians, including those in Tasmania, Senator Lambie—through you, Chair. That compares to the 333 new drugs placed on the PBS under the entire six years of the previous Labor government. We are providing more of the newer drugs not only for average Australians but also for those with serious and chronic health conditions. We have also announced revolutionary reforms on how we deliver Medicare in the community. Our Health Care Homes policy gives GPs and their teams the flexibility to coordinate, manage and support patients with chronic illness with the aim of keeping them healthier at home and with the doctor of their choice. 


I challenge those opposite that they have not used any figures to challenge their assertion that we are spending less and doing less. The big difference is that we on this side know that, to spend it, we have to earn it. We are the only ones with the economic plan to actually deliver the expanded health services that we are delivering today. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for propagating big fat lies about Medicare not only in the campaign but also in here.


Medicare is a government service that is here to stay. We on this side have never suggested that Medicare would go. In fact, the facts show that we have done everything we can to strengthen it. During the campaign, in the eastern suburbs of Perth, rather than hearing the Labor Party' positive policies for the election I had old ladies in nursing homes scared out of their wits from phone call after phone call from 'Medicare' and other people telling them that they were going to lose their Medicare and be kicked out of their aged-care facilities. If you are proud of your record of propagating these big fat lies and scaring the bejeebers out of the most vulnerable in this society, you should hang your heads in shame. After scaring the most vulnerable in our society with this, as Senator Smith said, you got your lowest primary vote ever. If that does not give you pause to come out with positive policies to inspire the electorate and not scare them, I do not know what will. 




Senator Bilyk:
  What is the majority you have? 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  You want priorities? Senator Bilyk, would you like me to go through some more of the statistics, the actual facts? 




Senator Bilyk:
  You have a majority of one. 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  On 1 October this year more than 2,000 medicine brands, treating common conditions, dropped in price for all Australians. That is 2,000 different medicine brands dropped in price for all Australians. 



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  You want examples? I have plenty of examples for you. What else have we got? We have listed new medicines for melanoma, cancer and cystic fibrosis, and a cure for hepatitis C. 



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Bilyk, a point of order?




Senator Bilyk:
  Mr President, I have been misrepresented by the senator. 



The PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order. 




Senator Bilyk:
  I said 'majority', not 'priority'. 



The PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point. There is no point of order. I remind senators to address their comments to the chair. 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  This government has listed new medicines for melanoma, cancer and cystic fibrosis, and a cure for hepatitis C. Many of these medicines would have cost people tens of thousands of dollars and would only have been available to the most well off, but we have been able to list them so that they only cost around $38, or just over $6 for a concessional script. This government is spending more on health in real terms than ever before. No matter how much those opposite keep bringing out and peddling this big fat lie, it is simply not true. Given all of the statistics, facts and figures from me and those on my side, I challenge anybody on that side to actually tell us where our numbers are incorrect. We have not been spending more? We have not increased the PBS? We have not put more money into health, into hospitals, into GP services? If those opposite can come back and actually tell us where we are cutting Medicare or where we are cutting spending in real terms, in total terms, let them come back and challenge any of the figures we have provided. They have not so far in this debate because they simply cannot.


In relation to the Medicare payments system, which has been the subject of so much discussion and so much misinformation by those opposite, the government is looking at ways to take the health and aged-care payment system into the 21st century, making it better for both patients and clinicians. That is not scrapping Medicare; that is bringing it into the 21st century so we do not waste money on old, outdated systems which do not serve patients or the doctors. It is bringing it into the 21st century and saving taxpayer money so more money is available to put into the forefront of health services.


In conclusion, the Prime Minister and all on this side have stated time after time that every single aspect of Medicare which is currently operated by government, including the process of Medicare rebates, will continue to be operated by government. Medicare is and always will be a core government service. I think those opposite should hang their heads in shame at resorting to scaring the Australian public that somehow this side of the chamber will be getting rid of Medicare. You should be ashamed of scaring the most vulnerable in our society, because they were scared, and there is no excuse for doing that. I think Australians everywhere deserve much better than that.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (18:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Obviously the seeking of legal advice has been quite topical this week, and it will continue to be topical up until and beyond Friday this week. So it was quite striking when, on a very preliminary examination of the Annual report 2015-16 of the Attorney-General's Department, we found that the total of legal services expenditure in 2014-15 was $33 million. It has come down in 2015-16 to $26 million. They are totals. They are broken down into subtotals: of total external legal services expenditure—in 2014-15 that was just under $31 million, and in '15-16 was $24.3 million—and of total internal legal services expenditure, which was $2.15 million approximately in 2014-15 and just over $2.5 million in 2015-16. These figures, at least on my preliminary examination, have not been broken down by the Attorney-General's Department. But, boy, will it be a fertile avenue of questioning once we get into the estimates process because of course the total for internal legal services expenditure has increased reasonably significantly, from $2.1 million to $2.6 million, from 2014-15 to 2015-16.


What we know, thanks to the submission from the Solicitor-General to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, is actually that this Attorney-General is starting, more and more—or at least in certain circumstances—to work around the Solicitor-General, presumably because he thinks he is going to get advice from the Solicitor-General that he does not like, and instead is going to the Australian Government Solicitor.


The Australian Government Solicitor is housed within the Attorney-General's Department. Let us be clear: it is not the Australian Government Solicitor's job to give constitutional advice to the government. That is the job of the Solicitor-General, and it is one of the jobs of the Solicitor-General that this parliament had in mind when it created the office of the Solicitor-General.


So the question for the Attorney is this. That is a relatively significant increase—about 20 per cent in broad terms—in the amount of money expended on internal legal services. They are, presumably, services internal to the department. Is that increase a numerical reflection of his increasing habit of working around the Solicitor-General and actually going to the Australian Government Solicitor for legal advice that properly he should be getting from the Solicitor-General?


There is no problem with the Attorney-General deciding that the advice he gets from the Solicitor-General is not the advice he wants to present to government. There is no problem there at all. And there are also circumstances that we could all envisage where it would not be appropriate for the Attorney to seek advice from the Solicitor-General—for example, if he thought, reasonably, that the Solicitor-General was conflicted on a matter or there was a significant perception of a conflict of interest in relation to the Solicitor-General.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Or because he was wrong.




Senator McKIM:
  But not because, Senator Macdonald, he thinks he might not like the advice that he is going to get from the Solicitor-General. But I would bet my bottom dollar that that is why this Attorney is shopping around for legal advice, not only to the AGS but out to the private bar as well: because he thinks he is not going to like the advice he gets from the Solicitor-General. That is not good enough, from the first law officer of this country. It is not good enough by any stretch. And we will be prosecuting this matter at length next week in Senate estimates, to get to the bottom of whether this numerical increase—this increase in expenditure on total internal legal services in the Attorney-General's Department—is actually a reflection of a pattern of behaviour by this Attorney-General, who not only has, arguably, misled this Senate, but is presiding over a disturbing pattern of working around the Solicitor-General and shopping out requests for legal advice to try to find the advice that will be politically palatable to the government.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (18:15):  by leave—I am very proud as the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia to present this first report on our progress implementing the white paper on developing northern Australia: Our North, Our Future.


Our great nation is a country of contrasts and diversity, and this government is determined to ensure we reach the full potential inherent in all parts of Australia. Our northern development agenda is a nation-building agenda. Northern Australia is already an economic powerhouse for Australia. Our government believes that the North's proximity to world economic growth has created an unprecedented opportunity to invest in the North, and by doing so make returns for all Australians. That is why we have released the first ever white paper to develop northern Australia.


While I have the great honour of delivering this first update, I only have that honour thanks to the drive and determination of others. I especially want to credit Senator Ian Macdonald, who is here in the chamber at the moment, for his tireless and successful efforts to put northern development on the nation's agenda. Also to Mr Warren Entsch and the members of his parliamentary committee whose report, Pivot North, helped guide the policies in our white paper. 


Today I want to talk mainly about what we are doing because we have made significant achievements over the past year and the people of the North want action not just talk. Twenty-one of our policy initiatives are complete and much progress has been made on others. We are taking action and we are on track. 


I am pleased to report we are building roads and major economic infrastructure in the North. Our plan helps the North unlock its inherent advantages in land, water and people by building infrastructure and supporting business development. On launching the white paper last year we announced more than $6 billion worth of investment. Over the past year we have begun allocating that to specific projects that have begun. We have announced funding for projects worth more than $350 million as part of the Northern Australia Roads Program. This includes investments to better connect Kununurra to its closest port at Wyndham, which will help support the development of the Ord irrigation scheme and also help to facilitate more than $1 billion worth of proposed investments in aquaculture in the Northern Territory nearby. Other road projects include upgrading the Barkly, Flinders and Capricorn highways in Queensland—key freight routes linking important inland resources and agriculture areas with coastal ports; sealing the Hann Highway in Queensland to create a more reliable inland route from Cairns to Melbourne; realignment at Coongan Gorge on the Marble Bar Road in Western Australia; and flood immunity improvements at the Adelaide River Floodplain on the Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory. We have announced that we will continue the sealing of the Outback Way, which runs from Winton in Queensland to Laverton in Western Australia, to help establish another east-west link across our nation. We do need to begin thinking more 'east-west', not just 'north-south' when we develop our country.


We have been working hard to identify investment priorities to improve the northern beef industry's productivity and resilience through the $100 million Northern Australia Beef Roads Program, with three successful round table meetings of key representatives from the cattle and transport industries in Rockhampton, Kununurra and Darwin. Sixty per cent of Australia's rainfall falls on the 40 per cent of our land mass that represents northern Australia. Yet only around two per cent of that water is used at the moment. We have a great opportunity to expand food production in Australia and that opportunity will be concentrated in the North, given that many of the more fertile areas in southern Australia have already been developed. That is why we have committed $174 million already to specific water projects in the North. This includes $130 million to co-fund the Rookwood Weir on the Fitzroy River, a project that could kick-start an agricultural boom in Central Queensland in a water catchment that is the second largest in Australia, behind only the Murray-Darling. The CSIRO is leading work on foundational land and water resources assessments in the Mitchell River catchment in Queensland, in the Fitzroy River catchment in Western Australia, and in the Darwin region in the Northern Territory. This follows assessments completed on the North Queensland rivers Flinders and Gilbert in 2014.


This government's direct investments in infrastructure in the North will be complemented through the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I recently launched that facility in Cairns a couple of months ago. The board held its second meeting in Western Australia just last week. The NAIF is one of the white paper's long term initiatives and it is now open for business. The NAIF will offer up to $5 billion in concessional finance to encourage and complement private sector investment across northern Australia. The independent NAIF board is responsible for implementing the mandate that we have given them. The board is chaired by Ms Sharon Warburton, who is joined by six other directors with extensive experience across a range of sectors, including infrastructure, government, finance, construction and law. So far, the NAIF has received numerous applications, and of these, one project is already undertaking due diligence and another 13 are working towards a formal investment proposal. These projects already represent a total investment of over $10 billion. Earlier today I announced the appointment of Ms Laurie Walker as CEO of the NAIF. Ms Walker is highly experienced. She understands the challenges facing infrastructure investment in this country. She will relocate and live in the Cairns region for this role. She will be based at the NAIF headquarters in Cairns and we are brining a whole new industry to North Queensland by doing so.


Along with the NAIF we are working hard to attract interest in the North from major investors. Last year we held the first Northern Australian Economic Forum in Darwin. The forum opened a window on the scope and scale of opportunities for investment, particularly in agribusiness and food, resources and energy, infrastructure, tropical medicine and education. Since the forum, several international investors have made return on-site visits.


Northern Australia's unique position also gives it advantages when it comes to education and research. We are investing $75 million in a Cooperative Research Centre to conduct research and development with a focus on agriculture, food and tropical medicine. The government will provide $2 million over the next two years for the Tropical Disease Research Regional Collaboration Initiative. Just last Friday, we announced that Darwin's Menzies School of Health Research has been selected to advance research into the prevention, detection and treatment of multi-drug resistant malaria and TB.


The north will only truly achieve its true potential with the participation of all its people, including Indigenous Australians. Northern Australia is home to 30 per cent of Australia's Indigenous population. So any plan to develop the North must involve our first Australians. The government is supporting a number of land tenure pilots that broaden economic activity on land and demonstrate the benefits of reform to investors, Indigenous peoples and other stakeholders. Five pilot projects across the three northern jurisdictions have already been funded. We have also invested $12.4 million in an Indigenous ranger program for the North.


Tourism is a strong industry for northern Australia and it is experiencing a resurgence thanks to a lower dollar and more flights to Asia. We have established a $13.6 million Northern Australia Tourism Initiative to help small and medium businesses in the tourism sector take their next steps in their business development. 


With the release of the white paper, the government made a real commitment towards developing northern Australia, and since that time we have developed further our policies for the north. Our first ever City Deal will be in Townsville, the biggest city in northern Australia. We have announced $100 million for more research into exploration for minerals and resources in northern Australia. This is of special importance given that the economy of northern Australia is more than half made up by our resources sector. 


These investments we are making are building on an already successful, thriving and productive northern Australia. Too often people assume that northern development has failed in the past. That is bunkum. Cairns, Darwin, Townsville, Kununurra, Broome, Mackay, Rockhampton and the regions in between are all testament to the development we have already made in the north. As a nation, we should be proud of this progress, because we benefit from what we have already achieved there. Around five per cent of our population live in the north, but it generates nearly 12 per cent of our economic output. Our plan builds on this success and re-invests in a part of our nation that is already punching above its economic weight. 


More than in the past, northern Australia now has the proximity to economic growth that creates opportunity for even bigger things for our north. By 2030, more than two-thirds of the world's middle class will be in Asia. This growth in our region promises to deliver dividends for all Australians. More than half of our exports leave from ports in northern Australia. We all have a stake in seeing the successful development of the North. 


Our northern policy is an unashamedly regional development policy. Through developing the regions of our north, we can take pressure off the development of our major southern cities, while giving young Australians new opportunities for making a living and raising a family in northern Australia. The success of our policy will not be delivered by the government here in Canberra alone but by the people who live and work in northern Australia. Our policies aim to attract investment, invest in infrastructure and unlock the potential of the north's abundant land and water resources. It will be the dynamic people of northern Australia that create jobs, found businesses, start families and nurture their communities. As a government we can only create the foundation. It will be the more than one million people of northern Australia who build the house. 


That is our vision for northern Australia—that, through our focus and our policies, we provide the tools to our north to make it a magnet for the entire country. Our goal is that, in the future, people will be attracted to stay in northern Australia and to move to northern Australia because of the opportunity that it manifestly presents. If we are successful at that, it will benefit all Australians. 


We have made a good start, but there is much more to do. I thank the people of northern Australia for their continuing support and involvement in this nation-building endeavour. The white paper is the catalyst to help build the foundations to make the most of that hardworking, determined and optimistic outlook, which will ultimately enhance the north. All Australians will be more prosperous as a result.  


I table the ministerial statement and seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.


Leave granted.

Our great nation is a country of contrasts and diversity, and this Government is determined to ensure we reach the full potential inherent in all parts of Australia. Our northern development agenda is a nation building project. 


Northern Australia is already an economic powerhouse for Australia. Our Government believes that the north's proximity to world economic growth has created an unprecedented opportunity to invest in the north, and by doing so make returns for all Australians. That is why we have released the first ever White Paper to develop Northern Australia.


While I have the great honour of delivering this first update, I only have that honour thanks to the drive and determination of others. I especially want to credit Senator Ian Macdonald for his tireless and successful efforts to put northern development on the nation's agenda. Also to Warren Entsch and the members of his Parliamentary Committee whose report, Pivot North helped guide the policies in our White Paper. 


Today I want to talk mainly about what we are doing because we have made significant achievements and the people of the north want action not just talk. Twenty-one of our policy initiatives are complete and much progress has been made on many others. We are taking action and we are on track. 


I am pleased to report we are building roads and major economic infrastructure in the north. Our plan helps the north unlock its inherent advantages in land, water and people by building infrastructure and supporting business development. 


On launching the White Paper last year we announced more than $6 billion worth of investment. Over the past year we have begun allocating that to specific projects that have begun. 


We have announced funding for specific projects worth more than $350 million as part of the Northern Australia Roads Programme. This includes road investments to better connect Kununurra to its closest port at Wyndham, supporting the Ord irrigation scheme and helping to facilitate more than $1 billion worth of investments in aquaculture in the Northern Territory.


Other road projects include upgrading the Barkly, Flinders and Capricorn Highways in Queensland —key freight routes linking important inland resources and agriculture areas with coastal ports; sealing the Hann Highway in Queensland to create a more reliable inland route from Cairns to Melbourne; realignment at Coongan Gorge on the Marble Bar Road in Western Australia; and flood immunity improvements at the Adelaide River Floodplain on the Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory. 


We have announced that we will continue the sealing of the Outback Way which runs from Winton in Queensland to Laverton in Western Australia, establishing an east-west link across our nation. This decision is emblematic of our need to think more ""east-west"" while developing the north, not just ""north-south"". 


We've been working hard to identify investment priorities to improve the northern beef industry's productivity and resilience through the $100 million Northern Australia Beef Roads Programme, with three successful round table meetings of key representatives from the cattle and transport industries in Rockhampton, Kununurra and Darwin.


The CSIRO's innovative Transport Network Strategic Investment Tool, TraNSIT, has modelled more than 60 proposals submitted by stakeholders. I am looking forward to the announcement of successful projects very shortly.


Sixty per cent of Australia's rainfall falls on the 40 per cent of our land mass that represents northern Australia. Yet only around 2 per cent of that water is used at the moment. We have a great opportunity to expand food production in Australia and that opportunity will be concentrated in the north, given that many of the more fertile areas in southern Australia have already been developed. 


That is why we have committed $174 million to invest in specific water projects in the north. This includes our 2016 election commitment of $130 million to co-fund the building of the Rookwood Weir on the Fitzroy River, a project that could kick-start an agricultural boom in Central Queensland in a water catchment that is the second largest in Australia - behind only the Murray-Darling. 


We have committed other funding towards the planning that is needed to build more water investments. This includes the Lakelands Irrigation project, the Nullinga Dam near Cairns, the Hells Gate Dam and Burdekin Falls Dam wall raising near Townsville and Urannah Dam. It also covers funding to explore water development options in the Northern Territory and expansion of the Ord scheme through the raising of the Lake Argyle spillway and development of irrigated agriculture on the Keep River plain. 


The CSIRO is leading work on foundational land and water resources assessments in the Mitchell River catchment in Queensland, in the Fitzroy River catchment in Western Australia, and in the Darwin region using $15 million from the Australian Government. This follows assessments completed on North Queensland's Flinders and Gilbert Rivers in 2014.


This Government's direct investments in infrastructure in the north will be complemented through the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I recently had the pleasure of formally launching the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, or NAIF, in Cairns, coinciding with the first meeting of the NAIF Board. The Board held its second meeting in Western Australia just last week.


The NAIF is one of the White Paper's long term initiatives and it's now open for business. 


The NAIF will offer up to $5 billion in concessional finance to encourage and complement private sector investment in economic infrastructure that benefits northern Australia. Investment will be spread across the three jurisdictions in northern Australia. 


The independent NAIF Board is responsible for determining eligibility of projects under the NAIF, guided by an Investment Mandate. 


The board is chaired by Ms Sharon Warburton, who is joined by six other directors with extensive experience and expertise across a range of sectors, including infrastructure, government, finance, construction and law, and who are passionate about the development of northern Australia.


So far, the NAIF has received numerous enquiries about project funding, and of these, one project is undertaking due diligence and another 13 working towards a formal investment proposal. These projects represent a total investment of over $10 billion. 


Not all will receive assistance, so I encourage others to bring forward their ideas for vital Northern Australia infrastructure projects.


It was also my pleasure earlier today to announce the appointment of Ms Laurie Walker as CEO of the NAIF. Ms Walker is highly experienced, with key leadership experience in banking and finance organisations including ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank. 


Ms Walker understands the challenges facing infrastructure investment and is committed to supporting economic growth across northern Australia. She will relocate and live in the Cairns region for this role. She will be based at the NAIF headquarters in Cairns but will work with stakeholders across the north.


Along with the NAIF we are working to attract interest in the north from major investors. Last year we held the first Northern Australian Economic Forum in Darwin. The forum opened a window on the scope and scale of opportunities for investment, particularly in agribusiness and food, resources and energy, infrastructure, tropical medicine and education – all areas where Australia can excel. 


Since the forum, several international investors have made return on-site visits.


We have established a Major Projects Approval Agency in Darwin to create a 'single point of entry' for investors dealing with regulatory requirements. We have also shifted the Office of Northern Australia from Canberra to Darwin. 


The Australian Government is committed to advancing research and science in Australia and bolstering our health security. 


Northern Australia's unique position also gives it natural advantages when it comes to education and research. We are investing $75 million in a Cooperative Research Centre to conduct research and development with a focus on agriculture, food and tropical medicine. The CRC will be based in Townsville and further details about its governance will be released shortly. 


The Government will provide $2 million over two years for the Tropical Disease Research Regional Collaboration Initiative. Just last Friday, we announced that Darwin's Menzies School of Health Research has been selected to advance research into the prevention, detection and treatment of multi-drug resistant malaria and TB. The Menzies School will work with the Burnet Institute as well as partners in Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.


The north will only truly achieve its potential with the participation of all its people, including Indigenous Australians. Northern Australia is home to 30 per cent of Australia's Indigenous population. So any plan to develop the north must also create opportunities for Indigenous Australians. 


The Government is supporting a small number of land tenure pilots that broaden economic activity on land and demonstrate the benefits of reform to investors, Indigenous peoples and other stakeholders. Five pilot projects across the three northern jurisdictions have already been funded.


We have also invested $12.4 million in an Indigenous Ranger program for the north. 


Tourism is a strong industry for northern Australia and it is experiencing a resurgence thanks to a lower dollar and more flights to Asia. We have established a new $13.6 million Northern Australia Tourism Initiative under the Entrepreneurs' Programme to help small and medium businesses in the tourism sector take the next step in their business plans. 


Northern Australia is also important to the ongoing development of our defence partnerships. Military exchanges and postings between Singapore and Australia are important to both nations and to the local economies of the north.


In May 2016 the Government announced Australia and Singapore will jointly develop military training areas and facilities in Australia, enhancing Singapore's training opportunities.


The total outlay from Singapore is up to $2.25 billion, with approximately $1 billion to be invested at each Shoalwater Bay Training Area and the Townsville Field Training Area and environs.


Changes to Australia's Work and Holiday visas are also helping the tourism, hospitality and agriculture industries in northern Australia achieve greater access to work and holiday visa holders, thus reducing labour shortages and the cost of seasonal labour in northern Australia. 


With the release of the White Paper the Government made a real commitment towards developing northern Australia; and since that time we have developed further our policies for the north. 


The Government's first ever City Deal under its Smart Cities Plan has been announced with Townsville, the largest city in northern Australia.


We have also announced $100 million to increase exploration for minerals and resources in northern Australia. Geoscience Australia estimates that around 80 per cent of Australia remains under-explored for minerals and most of this in northern Australia. 


This is of special importance for the north given that more than 50 per cent of its economic output is thanks to the resources sector. We need a strong mining sector for a strong northern Australia. 


These investments we are making are building on an already successful, thriving and productive northern Australia. Too often people assume that northern development has failed in the past. That is bunkum. Cairns, Darwin, Townsville, Kununurra, Broome, Mackay, Rockhampton and the regions in between are all testament to what we have already built in the north. 


As a nation we should be proud of this progress because we benefit from what has already been achieved. The north is home to just over 5 per cent of our population but accounts for almost 12 per cent of our economic output. 


Our plan builds on this success, and re-invests in a part of our nation that is already punching above its economic weight. 


More than in the past, however, northern Australia now has the proximity to economic growth that creates opportunity for even bigger things for our north. 


By 2030 more than two-thirds of the world's middle class will be in Asia. And, even more relevant for the north, the percentage of the world's population living in the tropical region is expected to grow from 40 per cent today to 50 per cent by 2050. Northern Australia's time has come. 


This growth in our region promises to deliver dividends for all Australians. More than half of Australian exports leave from ports in northern Australia. We all own a stake in seeing the successful development of northern Australia. 


Our northern policy is an unashamedly regional development policy. Through developing the regions of our north, we can take pressure off the development of our major southern cities, while giving young Australians new opportunities for making a living and raising a family in northern Australia. 


The success of our policy will not be delivered by the Government in Canberra but by the people who live and work in northern Australia. Our policies aim to attract investment, invest in infrastructure and unlock the potential of the north's abundant land and water resources. 


It will be the dynamic people of northern Australia that create jobs, found businesses, start families and nurture communities. As a government we can only create the foundation. It will be the more than one million people of northern Australia who build the house. 


That is our vision for northern Australia - that through our focus and our policies we provide the tools to our north to make it a magnet for the entire country. Our goal is that in the future people will be attracted to stay in northern Australia and move to northern Australia because of the opportunity that it manifestly presents. 


If we are successful at that, it will benefit all Australians. 


We have made a good start, but there is much more to do. 


I thank the people of northern Australia for their continuing support and involvement in this nation-building endeavour. The White Paper is the catalyst to help build the foundations to make the most of that hard-working, determined and optimistic outlook, which will ultimately enhance the north.


All Australians will be more prosperous as a result. 

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Northern Australia</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,21,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-10-11,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:25):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I congratulate Senator Canavan on a wonderful statement and a wonderful job in advancing the interests of the development of northern Australia since he has been appointed the minister. It is not an easy portfolio, and there are a lot of people watching with keen interest. Senator Canavan, I have to say that you have done a wonderful job and made a wonderful start on the ongoing development of the North. I also pay tribute to Mr Andrew Robb, who was very much instrumental in the formulation of the white paper, and also the previous minister for northern Australia, Mr Josh Frydenberg, who took the white paper from its inception to a very good start.


As I have said for as long as I have been in this chamber, northern Australia has only five per cent of Australia's population, but it produces something like 50 per cent of its export earnings. As Senator Canavan has said, northern Australia has always punched well above its weight when it comes to the economic interests of Australia. The further development of northern Australia is not just about northern Australians; it is about all Australians and it is about making sure that the potential of the north is captured and turned into benefit for every single Australian. Senator Canavan mentioned at some length in his statement some of the advances that have been made. 


A small government committee which I chair, made up of all the northern Australia members and senators, has been part of an oversight committee which keeps an eye on what is proposed in the white paper and on what action happens. The oversight committee's assessment is that, of the over 102 significant commitments made in the white paper a year ago, some 19 have already been completed—and I understand from the minister that may now be 21. Further, 51 of the 102 commitments in the white paper are in progress or pending; 30 of them have not yet been actioned; and two of them, of a relatively minor nature, have been abandoned. That is a pretty good start, after just one year, on a major white paper on the development of the North. 


I want to pay tribute to all of the ministers and departments involved. While Senator Canavan is the Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, there are many other ministers and departments who have jobs to do in relation to the white paper. Indeed, there are 16 different federal government ministers who have a role and whose responsibilities are mentioned in the white paper. They and their departments have acted enthusiastically in conjunction to play their part in implementing the significant interests of the white paper. 


Senator Canavan rightly referred to the connection between northern Australia and Asia. We expect up to 50 per cent of the world's population will be living between the tropics in the not too distant future. Over a third of the world's middle classes are living in that tropical area. That gives great opportunity for Australia to be a world leader on what can be done in the tropics in so many areas, particularly in the area of health.


I am very proud that last Friday I, together with the Premier of Queensland, officially opened the Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine at James Cook University in Townsville. The universities will play a very big role in the development of northern Australia. JCU, who I have just mentioned, are even more advantaged in that they are the one Australian university, indeed the one foreign university, with an accredited university on the island nation of Singapore. With the Singapore defence deal to be, I hope and assume, announced tomorrow when the Prime Minister of Singapore is here, it will bring an even greater connection between northern Australia, and Townsville in particular, and Asia—and, so far as the defence deal is concerned, Singapore.


Senator Canavan also mentioned some other highlight achievements of the government in the white paper. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility is a wonderful facility which will provide cheap loans for those wishing to develop the north. It will be a wonderful initiative for further investment and further developments in the north.


Senator Canavan mentioned water, which is so very essential to the north. I am delighted that a number of the projects that were committed to have received funding. We only need the relevant state governments—who control rivers, streams and water—to get on board. We also need to make sure that the money that the Commonwealth has made available is able to be used to develop water storage facilities in northern Australia, which are so very essential.


The Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia—Mr Pyne's department—is underway with a $75 million non-competitive investment there. Even the Bruce Highway in the north is benefitting from the investment of the government there.


This white paper is not a one-year document. It is a five-, 10-, 30-year document, so it will be a long time in its full implementation. As I said, Senator Canavan and his fellow ministers have made a very good start in the implementation of those commitments, but this white paper is only the start of the further development of the north. All of us who live in the north, and those of us in parliament who come from the north, will be keen to work with the minister and with the government not only to implement the white paper but to look further beyond the white paper and always keep in mind the additional areas that have to be developed.


Senator Canavan mentioned the city deals project. To some in Townsville that would read 'stadium', but it is more than a stadium, it is a whole new concept of all levels of government working together to make particular cities better places to live. I am very pleased and excited about that.


Many of the commitments are underway and some have been completed. We have been a bit slow on some things and some things are very, very difficult. One of the real problems holding up development of the north is the land title situation—who owns what and what sort of tenure you have in land titles. The white paper had a lot of comment about Indigenous lands and Indigenous people. Some of the benefits for Indigenous people are underway and are being actioned, as the minister mentioned in his statement. The issue of land titles is a very, very complex one and certainly will not be fixed in a 20-minute speech nor in the immediate future. But it is something that, for everybody's benefit, really needs to be addressed. If we can address the issues of who owns what and what land is available then you will see a huge explosion, an even bigger explosion, in development projects in the north.


It is a wonderful start. Congratulations to the minister, to all of the ministers involved and to all of the departments involved in this white paper. It is a great initiative for Australia. It is something that will benefit all Australians.


I will conclude by saying that I look forward to the day when I say that it is not five per cent of Australia's population producing 50 per cent of its export earnings but something like 20 per cent of Australia's population producing something like 80 per cent of its export earnings. I think both figures are possible and doable, and I look forward to that day.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I note that you sought leave. I did not see Senator Moore. She popped up before you.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I want to seek leave to continue my remarks.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, I know you want to do that. I want to go to Senator Moore, with the indulgence of the Senate, seeing as I missed her when she stood.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Northern Australia</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,21,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2016-10-11,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:36):  I will seek leave to continue remarks at the end of my contribution, so we will not need to rely on Senator Macdonald.


I also seek to take note of the minister's statement. I thank the minister for his first update to the Senate on the current process of the northern Australia white paper. We know that the white paper is part of a compilation of existing government programs and initiatives sprinkled with new spending commitments.


The minister's statement highlights a number of important milestones. We are pleased to finally welcome the appointment of Ms Laurie Walker as the CEO of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. The Northern Australia Tourism Initiative, which provides $13.6 million for small and medium tourism businesses to get one-on-one business advice, combines the Entrepreneurs' Program—which was formerly known as the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program—with the Australian Small Business Advisory Services program. This is a welcome initiative, but we believe it does not go far enough.


The government has also committed $75 million over the next 10 years to establish a new cooperative research centre in Townsville, and we welcome that in the wonderful northern city of Townsville. The idea to establish a CRC responsible for developing northern Australia is not new. It was first flagged in the coalition's June 2013 election policy, The Coalition's 2030 Vision for Developing Northern Australia. It was apparently on Mr Ian Macfarlane's desk for sign-off before Mr Turnbull replaced Mr Abbott in September last year.


Then, in November last year, John Wharton was appointed to run consultations with stakeholders and participants again on the direction and research agenda for the CRC, and it was supposed to commence in the middle of this year. But like some of the initiatives—indeed, most of them—included in the white paper, we are still waiting.


It has also been more than a year since the Abbott-Turnbull government first announced the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility—NAIF—and still no funds have been allocated to projects in the region. In fact, only one formal application for funding has progressed to due-diligence stage. When asked last month whether funding would flow before the end of this year, the minister could offer no guarantee.


After rushing legislation through this parliament in the last sitting week before calling the election, Mr Turnbull spent the election campaign in northern Queensland promoting the NAIF. In May the Prime Minister said:


… the commitment to Northern Australia from our national economic plan is enormous. We have a $5 billion, Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund that will be providing loans across Northern Australia …


Then, in June 2016, he also said:


Well our focus is on jobs, jobs and growth and particularly in Northern Australia. As you know, we have massive investment in the Northern Australia infrastructure fund …


It was the same talk about jobs—jobs and investment in the north. Residents and businesses are tired of a Prime Minister who talks a lot about this but who has not delivered on it. With high unemployment across northern Australia, the Turnbull government must begin to invest and create the sustainable jobs that the locals need and have heard so much about.


The minister mentioned tourism in his statement. We all know that tourism is one of the biggest employers in northern Australia. But a lack of high-quality facilities and tourism infrastructure limit our ability to increase our share of the growing Asian tourism market. Tourism is our third biggest export in value terms behind iron ore and coal. It accounts for one in every twenty export dollars. But the World Economic Forum's latest travel and tourism competitiveness index ranked Australia seventh for overall competitiveness and 20th for tourism infrastructure.


We have some of the world's most amazing natural environment experiences, but we risk being dragged down by substandard tourism infrastructure. The government has a key role to play here in supporting investment in world-class infrastructure which underpins a world-class tourism experience.


By 2030 there will be more than three billion middle-class people in Asia looking for tourism opportunities in our region and beyond. We want them to choose Australia. Cruise tourism, also, is growing 20 per cent a year, creating more demand. Airports in the north are also seeking to expand to meet expected demand. Without world-class facilities, we are not going to be able to compete, sending our necessary jobs overseas.


At the last election we made the commitment to allocate $1 billion from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to a Northern Australia Tourism Infrastructure Fund to boost partnerships with the tourism sector and to provide incentives for investment in new and upgraded tourism infrastructure across the north. The government could do this, but they have not. They did not even take a tourism policy to the last federal election.


To make matters worse, since the coalition government announced its flawed review into the backpacker tax, both the number of backpacker visitors to northern Australia and the number of nights they stay have seriously declined. In fact, lodgements for working holiday visa applications have fallen 10 per cent under the coalition. There were 24,000 fewer backpackers present in Australia at the end of 2015 compared to the same time in 2013.


We know that the backpacker tax has been a mess from day one. In fact, in many ways the backpacker tax tells you everything that is wrong with the Turnbull government. After more than a year of unnecessary pain and uncertainty for agriculture and tourism, the Turnbull government has now finally backflipped after pressure from the northern Australian George Christensen and the right wing of the party, who are really running the government. Labor will carefully examine backpacker tax mark 2, but one thing is for sure: decisions like the backpacker tax show the government takes northern Australia for granted.


The government's plan to develop northern Australia also largely ignores its most important resource—its people, in particular its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We heard from the minister that there are programs in train into the future. We also know that 30 per cent of the population of northern Australia is made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A critical part of unlocking the potential of northern Australia is increasing the capacity of the Indigenous population to contribute to the development of the region.


This involves building more than just hard infrastructure. It also means building skills and tackling chronic problems related to housing and health. However, the white paper says very little about that. In fact, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community of northern Australia seems to have not been really consulted in the development of the white paper.


During the question and answer session at a recent CEDA event the minister told the audience that native title is one of the biggest barriers to growing agriculture and crops. Comments like this create the impression that the government sees Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander landowners and custodians as an obstacle to the development of the north, rather than, in fact, the key.


Native title is of particular importance to northern Australia, as the majority of determinations and current native title claimant applications are in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. Roughly 80 per cent of northern Australia is directly or indirectly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land. The government needs to stop viewing Indigenous land rights as an impediment to development and embrace native title and traditional land ownership as cultural, social and economic assets.


One of the Indigenous leaders who has been very critical of the white paper process and the lack of consultation is Peter Yu. In June of this year he spoke at the developing Northern Australia conference in Darwin and said there that there had been no formal engagement between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the government over the future development of northern Australia.


The Prime Minister has failed to reverse a single dollar of the $500 million in cuts that Mr Abbott, as leader, made to Indigenous programs and frontline services. Despite a promise that there would be no jobs or services lost, in fact, the opposite is true. At the last election Labor committed to doubling the number of Indigenous rangers employed under the working on country indigenous ranger program. The Turnbull government is refusing to give Indigenous rangers the long-term job certainty they deserve. Indigenous rangers are role models in their communities, with the program providing a pathway to work and a profession that has been shown to improve Indigenous health, incomes, crime rates and incarceration rates. That is how we can meaningfully close the gap: practically—one step at a time.


As the minister's report shows, there is still much work to do to, we hope, translate those big expectations into concrete, deliverable outcomes that will have a lasting impact. Labor looks forward to continuing to work with the government to actually achieve those outcomes, and we look forward to further reports to the Senate on progress towards implementing the northern Australia white paper. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:47):  I ask Senator Cormann, acting for the Treasurer, my first question: why did the Treasurer choose to use male full-time average earnings instead of total average earnings or even median income in the Bills Digest and, I suppose, more broadly, to advertise and promote that this is legislation for middle-income or middle-class Australians?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2016-10-11,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:48):  The government has used average Australian earnings because, in our judgement, that is the most appropriate measure for the purpose of estimating the relevant impact of this personal income tax cut. The government has used the average full-time wage as calculated using the average weekly ordinary time earnings determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This measures the average wage of a full-time worker. In 2014-15, it was $77,200 per annum and was forecast to exceed $80,000 in 2016-17. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies earnings as pre-tax earnings payable to award standard or agreed hours worked. It is calculated before deductions such as superannuation have been made. It does not include amounts that are salary sacrificed, overtime payments, bonuses not attributable to the reference period, government payments and reimbursements for travel and entertainment.


Conversely, the average wage measures both part-time and full-time average incomes. The average weekly earning in 2014-15 was $59,100 per annum. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies an employee as being full-time where they ordinarily work 35 hours or more per week. As I have indicated, in the government's judgement this is the most appropriate measure.

 (Tasmania) (18:49):  If you said $59,000, Senator Cormann—that includes, I understand, full-time and part-time earnings—how is that middle-class or middle-income Australia when your tax cut is $80,000, which is significantly above that number?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:50):  I suspect that the coalition government and the Greens would have to agree to disagree here as to what is good public policy. The whole purpose of this personal income tax cut for hardworking families is to encourage people to work more and to not get penalised by getting into the second highest income tax bracket by making additional effort. The reason it is appropriate for us to use the average earnings measure—the average full-time wage measure that we are using—is because the whole purpose is to provide an incentive for people to work more and earn more without getting penalised by a higher tax rate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:51):  I still do not understand, Senator Cormann, why you did not use median income—why the Treasurer did not use median incomes. I am sure you understand; you have a good grasp of numbers and finance, and you have some very good people working for you who are around you today. Most experts would agree that median income is actually a better representation of the middle class in terms of groupings. Averages can be distorted by very large numbers. Of course, there are a large number of high-income earners in this country—all who, I may say, are going to receive this tax cut—that distort the numbers. I am going, I must admit, on 2014-15 figures. So, if you have other numbers there, I would certainly be interested to see those. All that was available to me were the ABS numbers from 2014-15. You may not be aware, Senator Cormann, that the average income for a full-time wage was $80,000 and $69,000, including part-time, where the median income was significantly lower. Why wouldn't you use median income as a better indicator for middle-income Australians?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:52):  I do not agree it is a better indicator. I do believe that Senator Whish-Wilson well understands the reason why the government has chosen the measure that it has chosen. It is just that we have a difference of opinion here. The government has put forward these personal income tax cuts. It is there for all to see what the effects of this measure is, if the Senate passes it, and obviously we commend it to the Senate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:52):  Just to give you the quantum difference: the ABS median full-time income in Australia based on 2014-15 numbers was $69,000, while the average wage was $79,000. That is a $10,000 difference because that was skewered by high-income earners. I am still not convinced that you have provided an argument as to why median income would not be a better indicator of middle-class or middle-income earnings in this country. When you incorporate part-time earnings into those figures, they drop even lower. The median income in this country is $52,000—30-40 per cent below the bracket of tax that you are giving tax cuts to. Does the Treasurer agree that, even on your own numbers of $59,000, which includes full-time and part-time earnings, as your average income—$80,000 is significantly higher than that—you are actually giving a tax cut to high-income Australians, not to middle-income Australians?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:54):  Treasury modelled the long-term economic effect of the government's tax and superannuation plan announced in the 2016-17 budget, which included the personal income tax rate changes, as well as changes to superannuation. In the proposal to lower the company tax rate, Treasury also separately modelled the long-term economic effect of lowering the company tax rate to 25 per cent. The modelling suggests that the effect of our overall proposal would improve the growth friendliness of our tax system and it would increase the level of GDP by around one per cent over the long term, which of course will help generate better opportunities for people across Australia to get ahead, to get better jobs and better paying jobs. The modelling also suggested the overall tax and superannuation plan raises the long-term level of GDP by a similar amount. Treasury released results of this modelling exercise to the public on 3 May 2016 via its website. The economy-wide model examined how significant tax changes affect key income indicators, taking into account interactions between different taxes and second-round effects on incentives. The general point I would make is that, of course, all measures in the budget are modelled in terms of their fiscal impact, and that is reflected in the budget papers.

What is in front of the Senate is a proposal to increase the threshold for the relevant marginal tax rate from $80,000 to $87,000. The purpose here is to ensure that the average full-time wages of Australians will not move into the second-highest marginal tax rate. This is all part of an incentive for people to work harder and earn more, without being penalised by an increased overall tax burden. This is part of our broader tax reform agenda, which is designed to strengthen growth and create more jobs.

For us in here who earn significant salaries compared to your average Australian on a median income or an average income that is not a lot of money. I am very interested in what your modelling shows you. You are doing this for a reason. You are giving a tax cut to Australians earning over $80,000 for a reason, presumably. I do not quite understand what that reason is. You have given us some spin and rhetoric around the tax and superannuation plan—the government's plan to give hardworking Australians an incentive to work harder and save more. So the very logic of what you have told us here tonight is that a $6-a-week tax cut to the most wealthy Australians is going to make a difference to our economy. I do not understand what economic stimulus that is going to have on our economy. So, Senator Cormann, I am disappointed that you cannot at least confirm that number. Could I try again? Could you confirm that those numbers are correct or that we are in the basic ballpark?

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:59):  Continuing on this theme of tax cuts going to higher-income earners rather than to the people who would really benefit from an increase in their disposable income, we are in an era of increasing casualisation and increasing part-time work, so fewer and fewer people are in the range the tax cuts that you are offering. In particular, we are in an era where women, more so than men, tend to be in part-time or casualised work. Have you done any modelling on the different impacts on women compared to men? Does the government concede that, by using full-time average wages as its basis for these tax cuts, it is creating tax cuts that are going to benefit men more than women? Because it is women who are much more likely to be working part-time or in casual employment.

It seems like the Greens are interested in running a bit of a filibuster to keep income tax cuts away from hardworking families. So what I say to the Greens is to confirm again information that has previously been made public, so you are well aware of it. This bill will provide a tax cut to around 3.1 million hardworking Australians in 2016-17 and beyond. The Australian Taxation Office, of course, has already issued new withholding schedules giving effect to these tax cuts. The bill will keep 500,000 taxpayers out of the second-highest tax bracket in 2016-17, compared to current rates and thresholds, and all taxpayers with taxable incomes above $80,001 will receive yearly tax cuts. Those with taxable incomes above $87,000 will receive the maximum tax cut of $315 per annum, or $6 a week, compared to the current rates of thresholds which have previously been put on the public record.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:02):  We will just have to agree to disagree on the desirability of this measure. This is a measure that does not discriminate between men and women. It does not discriminate at all. It seeks to provide the same incentive to both men and women when it comes to working harder and earning more and not being penalised by a higher tax rate. This measure, which was announced in the 2016-17 budget, is specifically targeted, because without action the average full-time wage earner in Australia would face the 37 per cent marginal tax rate this year. As the government works to improve Australia's fiscal settings it will look for further opportunities to extend further tax relief to working Australians. The government, of course, has maintained the carbon tax compensation after the removal of the carbon tax, which means that the tax-free threshold increase from $6,000 to $18,200 has been maintained, providing a reduction in the average tax rate for taxpayers, but, most notably, for low-income earners. You have got look at all of this in context.

We cannot agree to disagree with you until you can provide some kind of confirmation to us about what we are asking you. Let me give you the figures that we got from the ATO. Our analysis based on recent tax office data finds that the cut will help 28 per cent of male taxpayers but only 13 per cent of female taxpayers. So less than half of female taxpayers, versus male taxpayers, in this country are going to benefit. Can you please confirm if that number is accurate or in the ballpark?

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:05):  That is very tricky, Senator Cormann. Nevertheless, the numbers as they stand now, based on the reported taxable incomes, suggest to us that this tax cut will significantly benefit male earnings over female earnings. Of course, apart from a broader economic inequality that is growing rapidly in Australia, as it is in many other countries around the world—which Professor Thomas Piketty is here to talk about this week—we know that gender pay, gender income equality, is a significant issue and one we need to deal with. So I presume that when the Treasury or the Treasurer—I am not exactly quite sure how the process goes—decides at election time to bring in a $4 billion tax cut, these issues are factored into your decision making. For $80,000 and above you raise a tax bracket threshold to $87,000 and that benefits anyone who earns over $80,000—$8 million, $10 million, $100,000. All I want you to do is confirm to us here tonight that these tax cuts that you are bringing in will benefit male earnings over female earnings. I will read it to you again: the tax office data finds that the cut will help 28 per cent of male taxpayers but only 13 per cent of female taxpayers. Is that number correct?


Another issue: could you tell me whether wages are growing faster for those in the $80,000-to-$87,000 range than those on lower incomes. I must say on record that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee did not have an inquiry into this. There was a very short submission period and then the committee wrote up the report. Even in the limited feedback the committee did receive, in the limited number of submissions that were put to us, it was suggested that if any income bracket needed a bracket creep adjustment, it was the bracket directly below $80,000. Could the Treasurer please answer that question?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:07):  We have not undertaken the sort of modelling that Senator Whish-Wilson is asking about. Let me just remind him though that every Australian earning up to $18,200 pays no tax on those earnings, and any earnings above $18,200 are taxed at 19 per cent. Obviously, as the saying goes, you cannot give a tax cut to somebody who pays low tax; that is somewhat difficult. Obviously a range of Australians go through the very low income ranges for a range of reasons, including during their studies, at the beginning of their career and working their way through their career. The whole purpose here is to target an income tax cut towards Australian workers on average full-time wages; the whole purpose here is to provide an incentive and to make sure they are protected from the increase to the 37 per cent marginal tax rate.


I know that the Greens hate tax cuts. I know the Greens are the high-taxing party of Australia. The Greens are worse than the Labor Party when it comes to the level of taxation. We can debate this for the next five weeks, and we will still need to agree to disagree. You are not pursuing these questions because you will genuinely change your mind at the end of the answers that you receive, you are trying to prosecute a political case because you are against tax cuts for hard-working Australian families. Let us not try and play a game here. Let us not try to pretend that you are genuinely seeking information so that you can then go to your leader, Senator Di Natale, and say: 'I got it all wrong. I never meant to recommend to you that we should oppose these tax cuts. I never meant to recommend that the Greens vote against lower taxes. I actually change my mind because the answers I've received have helped ensure that I see the light.' We all know that is not true, that is not the case. You are running through a political exercise. You are wasting the Senate's time. You know where this will end up, because there is no support in this chamber for your proposition.

  no modelling, no consultation, no committee hearing process and almost no time for submissions. It is ridiculous. We are here to hold you to account, so we are asking perfectly valid questions.

We are elected to this place to hold the executive and the government of the day to account, and that is exactly what my colleague Senator Rice and I are doing tonight.

You either do not know the answers or the answers will embarrass you. Let us be very clear: this is very serious. This is not just serious because it is $4 billion; this is serious because it is going against the grain of what we need to do in this place—that is, tackle rising inequality: economic inequality across the board and inequality in terms of gender pay. That is why this is a very important debate and a very important piece of legislation. With my next question, if you would please answer it, I would like to know: is it true that the decision to have the benefits of this tax cut flowing to high-income earners on 1 October, ahead of its passage through parliament, is unprecedented? Is it unprecedented that the tax office or the tax commissioner has allowed you to do this? When has this occurred before?

As you would be aware—again, it is a matter of public record—the Labor opposition, through their relevant spokespeople, indicated some time ago that Labor would support this tax cut for hardworking families. As such, it was evident that there was broad bipartisan support for this tax cut in this parliament—which meant that the tax commissioner had great confidence that the tax cut would pass the Senate, irrespective of the solitary filibuster that you are seeking to run here tonight. 


It is noted in the Treasurer's media release dated 2 September 2016 that the ATO confirmed it would issue a new PAYG withholding tax schedule in the week commencing 5 September 2016.

I completely reject that proposition. Secondly—and this just proves that we are going around and around in circles—the senator wrongly asserted again that no modelling had been done. That is wrong. I explicitly put on the record the modelling that had been done in terms of the economic impact of our tax reform package. The reason we pursue this particular tax cut for hardworking families—incidentally funded by a crackdown on, among other things, multinational tax avoidance—is we know that providing an incentive for Australians to work more, by ensuring that they are not penalised with higher marginal tax rates, will help growth.


An important way of repairing the budget is to increase the level of revenue that is generated by government and stronger growth. As we all know, stronger economic growth helps to deliver among other things stronger revenue flows to government. It gives people across Australia better opportunities to get ahead and it gives them opportunities to pursue better-paid jobs, which means that over time they will pay more tax. But, of course, you are the Greens—people often say that the Greens are really just the old communists in green cloaks—and we understand that you are the ultimate high-taxing party of Australia. We understand that you do not agree with tax cuts for hardworking families. We do. On this side of the chamber we are all in favour of giving hardworking Australians a fair go.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:48):  The government has used average Australian earnings because, in our judgement, that is the most appropriate measure for the purpose of estimating the relevant impact of this personal income tax cut. The government has used the average full-time wage as calculated using the average weekly ordinary time earnings determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This measures the average wage of a full-time worker. In 2014-15, it was $77,200 per annum and was forecast to exceed $80,000 in 2016-17. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies earnings as pre-tax earnings payable to award standard or agreed hours worked. It is calculated before deductions such as superannuation have been made. It does not include amounts that are salary sacrificed, overtime payments, bonuses not attributable to the reference period, government payments and reimbursements for travel and entertainment.


Conversely, the average wage measures both part-time and full-time average incomes. The average weekly earning in 2014-15 was $59,100 per annum. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies an employee as being full-time where they ordinarily work 35 hours or more per week. As I have indicated, in the government's judgement this is the most appropriate measure.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:50):  I suspect that the coalition government and the Greens would have to agree to disagree here as to what is good public policy. The whole purpose of this personal income tax cut for hardworking families is to encourage people to work more and to not get penalised by getting into the second highest income tax bracket by making additional effort. The reason it is appropriate for us to use the average earnings measure—the average full-time wage measure that we are using—is because the whole purpose is to provide an incentive for people to work more and earn more without getting penalised by a higher tax rate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:51):  I still do not understand, Senator Cormann, why you did not use median income—why the Treasurer did not use median incomes. I am sure you understand; you have a good grasp of numbers and finance, and you have some very good people working for you who are around you today. Most experts would agree that median income is actually a better representation of the middle class in terms of groupings. Averages can be distorted by very large numbers. Of course, there are a large number of high-income earners in this country—all who, I may say, are going to receive this tax cut—that distort the numbers. I am going, I must admit, on 2014-15 figures. So, if you have other numbers there, I would certainly be interested to see those. All that was available to me were the ABS numbers from 2014-15. You may not be aware, Senator Cormann, that the average income for a full-time wage was $80,000 and $69,000, including part-time, where the median income was significantly lower. Why wouldn't you use median income as a better indicator for middle-income Australians?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:52):  I do not agree it is a better indicator. I do believe that Senator Whish-Wilson well understands the reason why the government has chosen the measure that it has chosen. It is just that we have a difference of opinion here. The government has put forward these personal income tax cuts. It is there for all to see what the effects of this measure is, if the Senate passes it, and obviously we commend it to the Senate.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:52):  Just to give you the quantum difference: the ABS median full-time income in Australia based on 2014-15 numbers was $69,000, while the average wage was $79,000. That is a $10,000 difference because that was skewered by high-income earners. I am still not convinced that you have provided an argument as to why median income would not be a better indicator of middle-class or middle-income earnings in this country. When you incorporate part-time earnings into those figures, they drop even lower. The median income in this country is $52,000—30-40 per cent below the bracket of tax that you are giving tax cuts to. Does the Treasurer agree that, even on your own numbers of $59,000, which includes full-time and part-time earnings, as your average income—$80,000 is significantly higher than that—you are actually giving a tax cut to high-income Australians, not to middle-income Australians?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:54):  Treasury modelled the long-term economic effect of the government's tax and superannuation plan announced in the 2016-17 budget, which included the personal income tax rate changes, as well as changes to superannuation. In the proposal to lower the company tax rate, Treasury also separately modelled the long-term economic effect of lowering the company tax rate to 25 per cent. The modelling suggests that the effect of our overall proposal would improve the growth friendliness of our tax system and it would increase the level of GDP by around one per cent over the long term, which of course will help generate better opportunities for people across Australia to get ahead, to get better jobs and better paying jobs. The modelling also suggested the overall tax and superannuation plan raises the long-term level of GDP by a similar amount. Treasury released results of this modelling exercise to the public on 3 May 2016 via its website. The economy-wide model examined how significant tax changes affect key income indicators, taking into account interactions between different taxes and second-round effects on incentives. The general point I would make is that, of course, all measures in the budget are modelled in terms of their fiscal impact, and that is reflected in the budget papers.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:56):  I do not agree with your characterisation of our measures. What is in front of the Senate is a proposal to increase the threshold for the relevant marginal tax rate from $80,000 to $87,000. The purpose here is to ensure that the average full-time wages of Australians will not move into the second-highest marginal tax rate. This is all part of an incentive for people to work harder and earn more, without being penalised by an increased overall tax burden. This is part of our broader tax reform agenda, which is designed to strengthen growth and create more jobs.

Six dollars a week is enough for a takeaway coffee and maybe a bite out of a muffin. For us in here who earn significant salaries compared to your average Australian on a median income or an average income that is not a lot of money. I am very interested in what your modelling shows you. You are doing this for a reason. You are giving a tax cut to Australians earning over $80,000 for a reason, presumably. I do not quite understand what that reason is. You have given us some spin and rhetoric around the tax and superannuation plan—the government's plan to give hardworking Australians an incentive to work harder and save more. So the very logic of what you have told us here tonight is that a $6-a-week tax cut to the most wealthy Australians is going to make a difference to our economy. I do not understand what economic stimulus that is going to have on our economy. So, Senator Cormann, I am disappointed that you cannot at least confirm that number. Could I try again? Could you confirm that those numbers are correct or that we are in the basic ballpark?

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (18:59):  Continuing on this theme of tax cuts going to higher-income earners rather than to the people who would really benefit from an increase in their disposable income, we are in an era of increasing casualisation and increasing part-time work, so fewer and fewer people are in the range the tax cuts that you are offering. In particular, we are in an era where women, more so than men, tend to be in part-time or casualised work. Have you done any modelling on the different impacts on women compared to men? Does the government concede that, by using full-time average wages as its basis for these tax cuts, it is creating tax cuts that are going to benefit men more than women? Because it is women who are much more likely to be working part-time or in casual employment.

It seems like the Greens are interested in running a bit of a filibuster to keep income tax cuts away from hardworking families. So what I say to the Greens is to confirm again information that has previously been made public, so you are well aware of it. This bill will provide a tax cut to around 3.1 million hardworking Australians in 2016-17 and beyond. The Australian Taxation Office, of course, has already issued new withholding schedules giving effect to these tax cuts. The bill will keep 500,000 taxpayers out of the second-highest tax bracket in 2016-17, compared to current rates and thresholds, and all taxpayers with taxable incomes above $80,001 will receive yearly tax cuts. Those with taxable incomes above $87,000 will receive the maximum tax cut of $315 per annum, or $6 a week, compared to the current rates of thresholds which have previously been put on the public record.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:02):  We will just have to agree to disagree on the desirability of this measure. This is a measure that does not discriminate between men and women. It does not discriminate at all. It seeks to provide the same incentive to both men and women when it comes to working harder and earning more and not being penalised by a higher tax rate. This measure, which was announced in the 2016-17 budget, is specifically targeted, because without action the average full-time wage earner in Australia would face the 37 per cent marginal tax rate this year. As the government works to improve Australia's fiscal settings it will look for further opportunities to extend further tax relief to working Australians. The government, of course, has maintained the carbon tax compensation after the removal of the carbon tax, which means that the tax-free threshold increase from $6,000 to $18,200 has been maintained, providing a reduction in the average tax rate for taxpayers, but, most notably, for low-income earners. You have got look at all of this in context.

We cannot agree to disagree with you until you can provide some kind of confirmation to us about what we are asking you. Let me give you the figures that we got from the ATO. Our analysis based on recent tax office data finds that the cut will help 28 per cent of male taxpayers but only 13 per cent of female taxpayers. So less than half of female taxpayers, versus male taxpayers, in this country are going to benefit. Can you please confirm if that number is accurate or in the ballpark?

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2016-10-11,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:05):  That is very tricky, Senator Cormann. Nevertheless, the numbers as they stand now, based on the reported taxable incomes, suggest to us that this tax cut will significantly benefit male earnings over female earnings. Of course, apart from a broader economic inequality that is growing rapidly in Australia, as it is in many other countries around the world—which Professor Thomas Piketty is here to talk about this week—we know that gender pay, gender income equality, is a significant issue and one we need to deal with. So I presume that when the Treasury or the Treasurer—I am not exactly quite sure how the process goes—decides at election time to bring in a $4 billion tax cut, these issues are factored into your decision making. For $80,000 and above you raise a tax bracket threshold to $87,000 and that benefits anyone who earns over $80,000—$8 million, $10 million, $100,000. All I want you to do is confirm to us here tonight that these tax cuts that you are bringing in will benefit male earnings over female earnings. I will read it to you again: the tax office data finds that the cut will help 28 per cent of male taxpayers but only 13 per cent of female taxpayers. Is that number correct?


Another issue: could you tell me whether wages are growing faster for those in the $80,000-to-$87,000 range than those on lower incomes. I must say on record that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee did not have an inquiry into this. There was a very short submission period and then the committee wrote up the report. Even in the limited feedback the committee did receive, in the limited number of submissions that were put to us, it was suggested that if any income bracket needed a bracket creep adjustment, it was the bracket directly below $80,000. Could the Treasurer please answer that question?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:07):  We have not undertaken the sort of modelling that Senator Whish-Wilson is asking about. Let me just remind him though that every Australian earning up to $18,200 pays no tax on those earnings, and any earnings above $18,200 are taxed at 19 per cent. Obviously, as the saying goes, you cannot give a tax cut to somebody who pays low tax; that is somewhat difficult. Obviously a range of Australians go through the very low income ranges for a range of reasons, including during their studies, at the beginning of their career and working their way through their career. The whole purpose here is to target an income tax cut towards Australian workers on average full-time wages; the whole purpose here is to provide an incentive and to make sure they are protected from the increase to the 37 per cent marginal tax rate.


I know that the Greens hate tax cuts. I know the Greens are the high-taxing party of Australia. The Greens are worse than the Labor Party when it comes to the level of taxation. We can debate this for the next five weeks, and we will still need to agree to disagree. You are not pursuing these questions because you will genuinely change your mind at the end of the answers that you receive, you are trying to prosecute a political case because you are against tax cuts for hard-working Australian families. Let us not try and play a game here. Let us not try to pretend that you are genuinely seeking information so that you can then go to your leader, Senator Di Natale, and say: 'I got it all wrong. I never meant to recommend to you that we should oppose these tax cuts. I never meant to recommend that the Greens vote against lower taxes. I actually change my mind because the answers I've received have helped ensure that I see the light.' We all know that is not true, that is not the case. You are running through a political exercise. You are wasting the Senate's time. You know where this will end up, because there is no support in this chamber for your proposition.

  no modelling, no consultation, no committee hearing process and almost no time for submissions. It is ridiculous. We are here to hold you to account, so we are asking perfectly valid questions.

You either do not know the answers or the answers will embarrass you. Let us be very clear: this is very serious. This is not just serious because it is $4 billion; this is serious because it is going against the grain of what we need to do in this place—that is, tackle rising inequality: economic inequality across the board and inequality in terms of gender pay. That is why this is a very important debate and a very important piece of legislation. With my next question, if you would please answer it, I would like to know: is it true that the decision to have the benefits of this tax cut flowing to high-income earners on 1 October, ahead of its passage through parliament, is unprecedented? Is it unprecedented that the tax office or the tax commissioner has allowed you to do this? When has this occurred before?

Mr Jordan indicated that he would be able to make relevant adjustments to the tax scales once he had sufficient confidence that the law would pass. As you would be aware—again, it is a matter of public record—the Labor opposition, through their relevant spokespeople, indicated some time ago that Labor would support this tax cut for hardworking families. As such, it was evident that there was broad bipartisan support for this tax cut in this parliament—which meant that the tax commissioner had great confidence that the tax cut would pass the Senate, irrespective of the solitary filibuster that you are seeking to run here tonight. 


It is noted in the Treasurer's media release dated 2 September 2016 that the ATO confirmed it would issue a new PAYG withholding tax schedule in the week commencing 5 September 2016. Taxpayers have started to receive the benefits of this measure in their pay packets from 1 October 2016. Any tax overpaid beforehand will be refunded by the ATO on assessment.

I suppose we are not going to have time to finish this tonight, Senator Cormann, but it was only three weeks ago, in here, when the omnibus bill passed with the support of Labor, that we talked about budget repair and the budget deficit. That was only two weeks after the Prime Minister had said in the papers that budget repair and debt reduction were 'a moral challenge of our generation'.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:18):  Firstly, I completely reject the Greens proposition that hardworking Australians earning between $80,000 and $87,000 a year are high-income earners. I completely reject that proposition. Secondly—and this just proves that we are going around and around in circles—the senator wrongly asserted again that no modelling had been done. That is wrong. I explicitly put on the record the modelling that had been done in terms of the economic impact of our tax reform package. The reason we pursue this particular tax cut for hardworking families—incidentally funded by a crackdown on, among other things, multinational tax avoidance—is we know that providing an incentive for Australians to work more, by ensuring that they are not penalised with higher marginal tax rates, will help growth.


An important way of repairing the budget is to increase the level of revenue that is generated by government and stronger growth. As we all know, stronger economic growth helps to deliver among other things stronger revenue flows to government. It gives people across Australia better opportunities to get ahead and it gives them opportunities to pursue better-paid jobs, which means that over time they will pay more tax. But, of course, you are the Greens—people often say that the Greens are really just the old communists in green cloaks—and we understand that you are the ultimate high-taxing party of Australia. We understand that you do not agree with tax cuts for hardworking families. We do. On this side of the chamber we are all in favour of giving hardworking Australians a fair go.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  Those of us who are fortunate enough to have involvement with, and represent, regional communities in this place understand that there is something very special about them. Of course, each local community has particular defining characteristics be they in the city or in regional areas. But regional communities face particular challenges that often flow from the tyranny of distance—and this is doubly the case in Western Australia, which encompasses such a vast physical distance. 


In order to thrive, our regional communities need strong, dedicated and energetic local leaders who will go above and beyond the call of duty, consistently putting the needs of their community first. Tonight, I rise to pay tribute to one such leader, Mrs Annette Knight AM of Albany, Western Australia, who sadly passed away in late August this year. The word 'stalwart' is much used in our public life, but if anyone ever earned the right to be referred to as a stalwart in relation their own local community it was Annette Knight. She was also an embodiment of the tried and tested rule that if you want to get something done you ask a busy person. Annette developed a special bond with the people of Albany and surrounding regions during a distinguished 27-year career as a broadcaster with ABC regional radio. She was, in fact, the first female ABC newsreader in regional Western Australia. 


As Australians living in regional centres will understand, the local radio station plays a vital role as a community hub and source of news and information. And those who read the news and host programmes on these stations have a very important and powerful way of becoming part of the family for many in regional communities. The fond rapport that Annette Knight established with local people during her time in radio, coupled with her dedication to improving economic and cultural opportunities in the Albany region, meant that service in local government was a logical place for her to apply her talents.


Ultimately, Annette served three terms as Mayor of Albany, from 1988 until her retirement from that role in 1998. Her time as mayor is still fondly recalled by many residents and council employees alike as a time of both significant change and excitement in the City of Albany.


In fact, it was during her time as mayor in 1996 that Annette Knight was made a Member of the Order of Australia for her services to local government and to her local community. Much later, in 2012, she received the highest honour the City of Albany could bestow when she was made a Freeman of the City—one of only three people ever to receive this accolade. She was also recognised as a WA Citizen of the Year in 1997, when she was awarded the Governor's Award for Regional Development. This award recognises the recipient's outstanding contribution to the growth, development and prosperity of regional Western Australia.


Of course, Annette's contribution was not limited to her own region. She was in fact a delegate to the constitutional convention held here in Canberra in 1998, at which she reflected eloquently on the important role the Governor-General plays, saying that the term Governor-General itself 'reflects the position of guardian of the Constitution and of people's rights'.


Annette Knight was made a commissioner of the WA tourism commission in 1995 and was appointed as deputy chairperson of the commission's board in 1998. In 2001 she was awarded the Centenary Medal—awarded on the centenary of the Federation of Australia—for her service to the community of Albany and in March of this year was inducted into the WA Women's Hall of Fame. Speaking about that latter honour this year, Annette was typically practical, saying: 'If you wanted to do something, it didn't matter whether you were a male or female, you just got on with the job and did it. We all worked together because we all had a common cause … if they want to do something, well get in there and darn well do it.'


Annette Knight recognised very early on that Albany's ongoing success and contribution to WA would depend heavily on being able to provide quality educational opportunities locally. Thus, she worked tirelessly with other local families to establish the Great Sothern Grammar school and was also instrumental in the setting up of the University of Western Australia's Albany Centre.


My sincere condolences go to Annette's husband, the Hon. Tom Knight, and her family and friends. (Time expired)
