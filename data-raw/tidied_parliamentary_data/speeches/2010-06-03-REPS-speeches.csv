"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: HMAS Penguin and Pittwater Annex Redevelopment, Mosman and Clareville, New South Wales.
HMAS Penguin is the home of the Royal Australian Navy diving school, the Army dive wing, the recompression chamber facility and the Submarine and Underwater Medicine Unit. The proposed works will provide to the Navy upgraded operational and training facilities at HMAS Penguin and the Pittwater Annex to enable the Navy to meet its training commitments. The proposed works, estimated to cost $63.34 million plus GST, will include redevelopment of the waterfront site, civil works and the upgrade of base services infrastructure at HMAS Penguin, along with an internal refurbishment of the Pittwater Annex. Refurbishment of two historic waterfront buildings at HMAS Penguin will preserve them for future generations. Traffic management will be improved on Middle Head Road with proposed changes to the base entry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in early 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2013. I commend the motion to the House.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and to talk about the achievements of this Labor government in the area of child care, and early childhood development and education more broadly. They are achievements that we are very proud of, and they are built on an unprecedented level of investment by any federal government in child care and early childhood education. Overall, the Rudd government is providing more than $17.1 billion over the next four years for early childhood development and support for child care.
Ensuring that children and their families have access to high-quality, affordable child care is a key part of the government’s objective of building a stronger, fairer and more productive Australia. Access to affordable child care is important so that families can maximise their employment and training opportunities. And the national focus on early child development and education in all settings, including childcare centres, family day care, kindergartens and schools, is vital if our children are to get the start in life they deserve and a chance to participate fully in the future success of Australia.
So first to the bill, which makes some changes to the childcare rebate. The first thing to remember is the change, the great improvement that this government made to the affordability of child care for working families across Australia. The previous government gave families a childcare rebate equal to 30 per cent of their out-of-pocket childcare expenses. Families could claim that rebate up to an amount of $4,354 per year. In 2007 we promised, and introduced on coming to government, a substantial increase in the childcare rebate. Families using child care are now able to claim a childcare rebate of 50 per cent of their out-of-pocket childcare expenses and, consequently, we increased the maximum amount of rebate claimable for each child in care to $7,500 a year. That is a big jump in assistance to families for a vital service that can really put pressure on their budget. In fact the maximum limit is 72 per cent higher than it was under the Howard government.
The Labor government also took steps early in its term to make the payment of the childcare rebate back to families more frequently than had been the case under the Howard government. In our first budget in 2008 we honoured our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate and also made it possible for families to receive the rebate payment quarterly rather than annually as it had been under the previous government.
Of course we all remember the situation under Peter Costello when the rebate was first introduced by the Howard government and families were told that they would be waiting 18 months to receive their first payment back from the government. We acted quickly in government to address that and the rebate is now more generous and paid to families when they need it every quarter. That is a big jump in the assistance the government gives to families to help them meet the costs of the child care that they rely on so much to make their family life and their family finances work. We understand the pressures that families are under and have acted to make child care more affordable for them through these measures: the increase in the childcare rebate and the move to pay the rebate quarterly.
It was good to see those changes reflected in the most recent data on childcare availability and affordability. The report released on 22 April this year—the State of child care in Australia—showed that out-of-pocket costs to families have fallen across all income levels. For example, in 2004 families earning $55,000 spent 13 per cent of their disposable income on child care. This has fallen to seven per cent in 2009.
This bill before the House implements a budget measure that will make a change to the childcare rebate affecting a small number of families. From 1 July 2010 the childcare rebate annual cap will be set at $7,500 per child per year. There is no change to that cap, but there is a change to the indexation arrangements. Indexation of the maximum rate of childcare rebate will not occur for four years and therefore the annual cap of $7,500 will continue unchanged until 30 June 2014.
The change in this bill needs to be understood in the context of our overall approach to the budget this year. This measure to keep the childcare rebate annual cap at $7,500 for the next four years delivers $86.3 million in savings. At the time the government put in place the package of stimulus spending and projects to protect our economy from recession in 2009, we made a commitment to fiscal discipline and a budget framework to ensure a return to surplus when normal growth recovered. This budget required the government to stick to those rules we set for ourselves, and that meant finding savings to offset new spending measures. In this instance, the projected savings of $86 million from this measure will go towards some important new initiatives also announced in the budget. First of all, there is $59.4 million to improve the quality of 142 budget-based funded early childhood services in rural and remote Australia. This funding will help those centres to improve infrastructure and staff qualifications and will benefit some of our most isolated and disadvantaged children.
In addition we have announced $81.9 million to implement the new national quality standards. This includes the first national ratings system for child care and early education services so parents have the information they need to make those important decisions about the best care for their child. There is also $1.9 million to support new regulatory measures to help achieve ongoing stability in the childcare sector in the wake of the ABC Learning crisis. This includes developing measures that require large childcare providers in the market to prove their financial viability—something that no-one would argue against after we saw what happened with ABC Learning not so long ago. Since taking government we have taken steps to improve the affordability of child care through assistance to families. Now we also need to continue our work with the sector on standards and quality. These three budget initiatives progress that quality agenda.
It is fair to ask what effect the change in this bill to hold the annual cap to $7,500 until 2014 will have on the affordability of child care. The vast majority of families receiving childcare rebate—an estimated 760,000 or around 97 per cent of families—will not be impacted by this change in the year following its introduction. On average, families use only 26 hours of care per child per week. This measure will mostly impact on the small number of families who use care for much longer periods, such as 50 hours per week, or those who use more expensive child care. Those families who are affected by this change will on average have a reduction in childcare benefit of an estimated $5 per week, or $266 per year. Compared to that very small proportion of families who will be minimally affected by this change all families are benefiting, and will continue to benefit, from the significant lift in the childcare rebate cap introduced by the government. As an example, a family earning $80,000 with one child in full-time care would have received a childcare rebate of $3,359 under the Howard government. Under this government that same family receives $5,598 in childcare rebate. They are better off by $2,239 under our more generous system.
We came to government with substantial commitments to improve the affordability of child care and we have delivered on that commitment. Not long after coming into office we were also faced with a crisis of viability in the sector. The collapse of ABC Learning at the end of 2008 threatened the closure of hundreds of centres across Australia. There was a very real prospect of families losing access to care for their children and thousands of childcare workers losing their jobs and entitlements. The collapse of ABC Learning was very much the product of the company’s unsustainable business model but it can also be attributed to the Howard government’s hands-off, let the market rip approach to the childcare sector.
The Howard government did not care that child care was effectively an essential service for the families that relied on their childcare centre. It did nothing to ensure the ongoing viability of the whole sector, preferring to leave it to the market and those who sought to exploit opportunities while the going was good. It was left to the Rudd government to clean up the mess when ABC Learning fell over. We worked with the receivers and provided funding to ensure that the doors of ABC Learning centres stayed open, giving families assurance that their children could continue to receive care. Had we not acted quickly, over 62,000 families would have had to find alternative care or potentially give up work.
There was good news for many of those ABC Learning families and childcare workers this week with the formal transfer of 570 childcare centres from ABC Learning to GoodStart, the not-for-profit company set up by Mission Australia, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Benevolent Society and Social Ventures Australia. Three of the GoodStart centres are in my electorate, at Rockhampton, Walkerston and Gracemere. Parents and staff can now be confident that these centres are in safe hands and their future is assured with their new owners. I am particularly happy to know that Mary and her team at the Campbell Street centre in Rockhampton can rest easy and get on with the great job they do for the kids in their care. They look after my daughter one day each week and I know she loves the time she spends with them. I am sure that is the case for the children at all three of these centres. I am pleased that the government has been able to play such a positive role in steering this potentially disastrous collapse of ABC Learning to a conclusion that gives assurance to parents and strengthens the sector by creating a better balance between private and not-for-profit providers.
The recent report about the state of child care in Australia shows that, two years into office, child care is more accessible and affordable under this government. The other aspect of child care that is just as important, and which this Labor government has really put on the agenda, is quality. Quality in child care—whether that is achieved through better staff to child ratios, improved staff qualifications or the early years learning framework—is part of our drive for improved developmental and educational outcomes for children.
Despite all the evidence that tells us how important the first five years of a child’s life are in their overall development, for many years the federal government has not been seriously involved in policy or funding in this crucial area. This neglect was showing up in all kinds of indicators telling us that young children in Australia were being short-changed—that not enough attention was being given to their needs and there was not enough investment in quality child care and educational opportunities for children under five. Too many children were starting school, and are still starting school, without having a chance to participate in activities that promote their development and get them ready to learn. We want to turn that around and the government has put massive funding towards improving the opportunities for children and in turn their educational and developmental outcomes. Our total investment in early childhood education and child care will be $17 billion over the next four years.
One of our priorities has been to work with the states and territories to achieve universal access to early childhood education. Our commitment is that by 2013 every child will be able to access a quality early childhood education program in the year before they begin formal schooling. This will be a play based learning and development program for 15 hours a week, taught by four-year university qualified early childhood teachers. It will be available across a range of settings, including childcare centres and family day care so that it fits in with parents’ arrangements. I am pleased to say that the Queensland government has already responded by promising to build over 200 new kindergartens across the state because we have a lot of catching up to do in this area of early childhood education.
For too long the federal government has had a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ attitude to early childhood education and development. The previous government did not see it as their responsibility at all. They were content to just take pot shots at the states whenever it suited them to blame the states for any perceived shortcomings. It was never anything to do with the federal government, of course. We have a different approach. We want to know exactly what is going on with our children—the good and the bad—so that we know where extra support and investment is needed. We are doing that through the Australian Early Development Index, which asks teachers to answer a series of questions about the children in their class in their first year of school. The data that is compiled is broken down region by region and will help communities to better understand how their children are doing by the time they start formal schooling. The data shows that there is a lot of work to do in my electorate to bridge the gap that exists in children’s experience of preschool education. While children in Central Queensland scored around the average for things like their wellbeing and readiness to be at school, the measures that rely on some formal educational experience showed the lack of access to preschool education for many children in the area.
I welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth a few weeks ago that the government is going to fund local champions in the places where the Australian Early Development Index data indicated a higher than average number of children were developmentally vulnerable. I believe that there are certainly places in my electorate where that is the case and I will be urging the minister to allocate a number of those local champions to communities in Central Queensland. The local champions program will support nominated people or organisations with local experience and expertise to work with communities to make the best use of their AEDI results and ensure that children in those places can start school as happy and confident learners.
The need is certainly there in Central Queensland for this extra assistance. That has already been identified by the federal government through its investment in the HIPPY program in Mount Morgan. HIPPY stands for Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters. It is a home based program that provides home tutors, books and other educational resources to help parents prepare their child for school. By helping parents to improve their child’s readiness for school, the program offers preschool students a better start in life. The program only started in Mount Morgan this year. It is great to know that parents are being given this support to get actively involved in their child’s education. The town of Mount Morgan has had many setbacks over the years and that can lead to a sense of disadvantage and loss of motivation, but these kids should not have to carry that burden. Instead, this kind of program, with the right support from parents, can have kids starting school and being ready to make the most of their educational opportunities.
These investments in child care and early childhood education and development are necessary and urgent if we are to achieve our goals of a fair and prosperous country. They increase the value of investments in other parts of our education and training system, because we know that every dollar spent on a child before the age of five has a cascading effect throughout the rest of their education and beyond. I am proud to be part of a government that places such value on children through these measures. We also realise that valuing children means supporting their parents. Our time in government has seen child care become more affordable and accessible and we will continue to support families by giving them the assurances they need about quality and the means to make reliable decisions about the best child care for their children. The changes proposed in this bill will create funding to go towards those measures and it has my support.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 is extremely important legislation. It is a timely reminder of the Rudd government’s commitment to child care and to working families across Australia, particularly in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland. We have many fine childcare centres in my electorate—wonderful community centres such as Cribb Street Child Care Centre at Sadliers Crossing, which has been there for a long time; the childcare centre in inner-city Ipswich, which I know is struggling for numbers because of the demographic changes in the area; and the One Mile Community Child Care Centre in Leichhardt, which is staffed by very strong communitarian people and is devoted to the children in that community.
There are for-profit childcare centres such as Bush Kidz. Why do I mention Bush Kidz, which runs the childcare centre at Brassall? Because Bush Kidz took over the ABC Learning centre at Brassall in the electorate of Blair. Brassall is the largest suburb in Ipswich in the electorate of Blair and, as a result of the debacle of the ABC Learning collapse under the watch of the previous government and the let-the-market-rip attitude that was permitted,  ABC Learning centres across Ipswich were in dire need of support and assistance. Hundreds of young people were in a position where child care was at risk, which meant pressure on families across Ipswich. The reality is that the coalition government took little opportunity to provide for child care for working families. The truth is that, when it comes to child care, they saw no responsibility on the part of the federal government. Their attitude was: ‘It’s not our responsibility. We should take no action. We should let the market operate.’ That allowed one particular company to develop into an oligopolistic position in the market. When that company fell into receivership and liquidation then the consequences to about 62,000 families across the country was dire, including in the electorate of Blair—in Ipswich and the rural areas outside.
The truth is that the coalition has never been a friend of the childcare sector. The truth is that the coalition harks back to some sort of 1950s mythical, nostalgic moment when women had no choice—or by economic necessity did not have to work. It was a sort of ‘leave it to Beaver’ attitude that infests and operates on those opposite. The truth is that, because of the economic circumstances of families across my electorate and across the country and by reason of women wanting to fulfil their potential in life, women actually engage in the workforce. Those opposite, for nearly 12 years, let this sector down. That is the truth. In 2006 Australia was one of the worst ranking countries in terms of public expenditure on early childhood education—13th out of 14 in the OECD.
The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Curtin, the then education minister, had this to say. She admitted it was:
… unacceptable in a country with Australia’s relatively small population to have a fractured and inconsistent system that can change dramatically between States.
What a disgrace, what a failure, what a fiasco. The attitude of the coalition when it came to child care was: do nothing, say nothing, let it go, and blame others—claim child care was the responsibility of the states and territories and claim there was no national responsibility. We know adequate, accessible, affordable child care does not just benefit families, particularly those with young children, but it helps business. It is good for business. It is particularly good for small business and the nearly four million people who work in 2.4 million small businesses across the country. The coalition do not get it when it comes to child care. They claim they support small business, but if they did they would support child care and would have done so for nearly 12 years. Instead, they did very little indeed.
I heard the member for Murray talking about this matter yesterday. It was 30 minutes of hyperbole, hysteria and hypocrisy on this topic. This is the mob that refused to bring in paid parental leave. Their current leader said in 2002 it would be brought in over his dead body. They have this mythical, fictional policy at the moment that they are never sure when they can do it. At some stage in the dim, distant future they might do it. That is their policy. I have read it. I have read the transcripts of what their leader has said and their spokesperson, the member for Murray, has said. It is esoteric, it is obtuse, and it is vague—it is just nonsense. No-one could possibly believe they would ever be committed to this stuff. They certainly never in 12 years brought in paid parental leave in this country—not understanding how important the link was with child care; not understanding at all.
That is the legacy of the coalition government. They thought perhaps when it comes to child care a nanny might do, a babysitter might do. That is their attitude—without realising how important education is to the development of a child. We were spending one-fifth of what our OECD partners were on early childhood education. That is the legacy of the coalition government. That is why we have invested massively when it comes to early childhood education. Giving a young person a chance in life in those very young developmental years is so crucial to educational attainment in primary school, high school and tertiary education. They did not understand that. It is not just about equality of opportunity; they also did not get the link with business, and they claim they are the party that supports business. They did not understand that as well. That is the legacy of those opposite.
The new reports which the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth, who I see is at the table, welcomed on 22 April this year, the Child care vacancies quarterly snapshot and the State of child care in Australia, demonstrate that we are making progress. We are catching up after the failures of the coalition government. We are dealing with the apathy and the inaction of those opposite. We are seeing more affordable, accessible, stable and high-quality child care in the Australian community. It is good for business and good for families.
The State of child care in Australia report makes it very clear. It undertook a statistical analysis of the Australian childcare market over the past five years. We have been in power for 2½ of those years, so it is a snapshot of us and them. What did it find? Amongst other things, out-of-pocket costs for families have fallen across all income levels. In 2004, families earning $55,000 a year—the average Australian would probably think that is a middle-class family—spent 13 per cent of its disposable income on child care. That had fallen to seven per cent by 2009. That is pretty clear: it fell by nearly half. So we are making progress. It is painstaking, but we are making progress. The report found that the Australian government’s funding for child care more than doubled in the past four years, up from $1.7 billion in 2004-05 to $3.7 billion in 2008-09.
That is clear, independent analysis of the achievements of the Rudd Labor government. It is not from a body or report of an internal Labor Party mechanism or organisation; it is independent analysis of the childcare sector and of the government’s commitment and the previous government’s lack of commitment when it comes to child care. We committed $114.5 million to deliver 38 early learning centres and care centres in the 2008-09 year, and we have provided that in my electorate. We have fulfilled our commitment. Recently the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth was in my electorate and we opened the Early Learning and Care Centre at Yamanto. I am pleased to say that that is the fulfilment of a commitment that we made at the last election. We invested $1.6 million in this new facility. It is a great facility. The minister and I were there, reading about the Billy Goats Gruff and all kinds of things and entertaining the children. I am not sure whether they were entertained more by me than by the stories. One little boy, Sam, had the good sense to be a Broncos supporter and was wearing a Broncos outfit. The Brisbane Broncos are a great team. Sam was there and said hello to us as we both walked in. It was great to see the delight on the children’s faces.
That is part of a new education precinct at Yamanto. We fulfilled our election commitments to the people on the south side of Ipswich—around Yamanto, Amberley, Walloon and Flinders View—when we said we would transfer Amberley District State School over to the Yamanto and Amberley District site. We said that it was up to the state government to determine the actual location. We paid nearly $28 million to the Queensland government while undertaking the expansion of the RAAF base at Amberley and for the relocation of Amberley State School to that site. We also said that we would provide sufficient money to relocate the C&K located at Amberley, and we have done that. In addition to that, Amberley District State School got BER funding. We are talking about an education precinct there at Yamanto—Amberley District State School—which received well above $30 million of federal government money to be built, and it is a wonderful facility. Numbers in the school have gone up from the low-300s to nearly 500. That is an indication that people are prepared to support the new school. There has been a very small reduction in the number of students just up the road at Churchill State School—only 12. There has been no loss of teachers there. So the alarmism and the criticism of my predecessor and some in the LNP in Queensland have not proved to be accurate.
The Early Learning and Care Centre at Yamanto is simply a fantastic facility. It cares well for babies and toddlers and will help them progress all the way to primary school by just going next door in the same precinct. I congratulate the C&K Amberley family. They have been passionate about their support of child care in their area. With their advocacy and the listening ear of the Rudd Labor government, they have facilitated a wonderful community resource which has been highly prized and valued by local families and, of course, their children. I am very confident that that facility at Amberley District State School will continue to educate our young people very well in the Ipswich community.
Government is about making some hard decisions. I know that this legislation before the House sets a cap on the amount of the childcare rebate—an annual maximum cap of $7,000 to $7,500 per child per year. But this government fulfilled its commitment by increasing the CCR from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The member for Capricornia accurately stated what that increase means to families across the country—thousands of dollars per year on average. This budgetary measure saves $86.3 million across the forward estimates. This government is committed to economic discipline and responsibility. Those opposite talk about that stuff, but we have seen nothing except gutting Roads to Recovery Program funding, gutting computers in schools, getting rid of trade training centres and getting rid of the National Broadband Network, and there are so many more things that they would do if they sat opposite. We are about making sure that we bring the budget back into surplus. We have a good and steady record with respect to child care. It stands in direct contrast to that of those opposite, who should hang their heads in shame for their apathy, inaction and procrastination in this area for so many years.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—in reply—I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the speakers who have contributed to this debate. I particularly acknowledge the previous speaker, the member for Blair, who I did have the good fortune to visit and to open the new childcare centre at Yamanto which was the honouring of an election commitment and see firsthand that the member for Blair does the finest ‘troll under the bridge’ voice of the Billy Goats Gruff. He amused the children out there whilst also delivering on a very important election commitment. I would like to thank all of the previous speakers.
We know that the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010

In relation to affordability, we have also delivered on our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent of parents’ out-of-pocket expenses. We know that last some 670,00 Australian families benefited from our significant reforms, which enabled them to claim back half of their out-of-pocket childcare costs where they spent up to $15,000 a year for each child in care. We have also delivered upon our commitment to change the payment of the childcare rebate from an annual payment under the previous government to quarterly payments under our government, giving parents assistance closer to the time when they incur their childcare costs.
In total, we are proud that our government will provide $14.4 billion over four years in financial support to parents with the cost of their child care and to help them manage the family budget. This is some $8 billion more than the Howard government provided in childcare fee assistance in their last years, which you may not have picked up on from the shadow minister’s contribution to this debate. Understandably, they are not trying to highlight the fact that we have more than doubled our commitment to helping parents with the affordability of their child care. We on this side have shown time and time again that we are committed to affordable and high-quality child care and that we are putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to delivering this. It is also really important to note that the majority of Australian families using child care—some 760,000 families—will not be impacted by this change. This is because the average claim for the childcare rebate is less than $2,000 per year per child which is obviously a long way off the $7,500 cap.
Our government has a strong commitment to early childhood education and child care with a record investment of $17.1 billion over the next four years, some $10 billion more than that provided in the last four years of the Howard government. We are proud of this record; we will continue to get on with the job of working to deliver affordable, quality and stable child care. I commend this bill to the House.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to place on the record the coalition’s views about the measures announced by the Rudd Labor government in this year’s federal budget. Beyond being a budget built on a house of cards, this budget has not met tests for all of Labor’s pre-election promises. Before addressing the key provisions of this bill, which the coalition will not oppose, I would like to talk about some of the areas where the veteran community is still waiting for answers and action.
Labor’s budget does not deliver on commitments made to deal with the cost of pharmaceuticals for war caused disabilities. Page 12 of Labor’s plan for Veterans’ Affairs from the last election reads:
Labor commits to reviewing this matter in the first term of Government and to establishing, in consultation with the ex-service community, a fair solution that relieves the burden on veterans of the cost of medications to treat their war caused disabilities.
So far Labor has released a discussion paper following a $500,000 in-house review, a review which took 30 months to materialise, but there is no detail to the two options in the paper. Both options potentially exclude some ex-service personnel who are severely injured but who do not have qualifying service. More will be said between now and the election on this issue.
I will continue to consult with the ex-service community on this important issue, an area where Labor has dropped the ball and will not meet its full commitment ahead of the election. Also outstanding is Labor’s delayed review of advocacy funding for ex-service organisations due for release in the first quarter of this year. The largely volunteer ex-service community does not know the fate of the key review into funding for their organisations. Many ESOs have been anxious about the findings. This year’s funding round, including a delayed application date, has created considerable angst among the veteran community.
Early analysis shows that Victoria’s veteran and ex-service community value-adds almost $23 million in volunteer hours to the repatriation system throughout the network of veterans’ advocates and welfare and pensions officers. This cannot be overlooked. I call on the minister to immediately release the findings of the ESO funding review to enable the ex-service community and the coalition an opportunity to chart the best course forward in the area of advocacy funding.
The minister cannot criticise the former government for keeping reports hidden when he does the same thing. Yesterday in another debate the minister criticised the former coalition government for not releasing a report into military superannuation when it was received by the then minister. The Podger review arrived on the former minister’s desk in July 2007. The election was held in November of that same year and the government changed. The new government released the Podger review on Christmas Eve, 24 December 2007. For no more than six months was the report held from public view. Yet this minister forgets that until only recently he sat on the re-review of the Clarke review for 15 months and continues to sit on the findings of the review of advocacy funding.
There is a re-review of the re-review of the Clarke review into the BCOF veterans’ service, with no timetable for delivery. The Rudd Labor government took some 11 months to respond to the parliamentary inquiry into the F111 reseal-deseal issue. It is indeed odd that the minister criticises actions that he condones through his own behaviour.
Also ongoing is the review of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. A couple of weeks ago at the RSL state congress the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel, in a particularly partisan attack, criticised the coalition for not supporting this review. This is not correct. Since becoming shadow minister in September 2008, I have supported this review. It is an important review into a key piece of legislation introduced by the previous coalition government. This review is critical to ensuring the act continues to meet the needs of the people it is designed to assist, veterans and their families. However, our support for the review is reliant on the minister being upfront about the timeline for the review. I was happy to support the review carrying on beyond the 31 March 2010 deadline. Nevertheless, the ex-service community and the coalition hope to have some indication from the minister or the government that this review will be concluded either before or after the election.
Veterans’ affairs legislation has been a largely bipartisan area of policy in this country for nearly 100 years. I hope that the minister and the government will not use this review to partisan politics in the lead-up to the election. The review needs to be on the table for both sides of politics and indeed the ex-service community to scrutinise ahead of an election.
This legislation enacts five measures by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Minister for Defence Personnel in the budget. The measures relate to the government’s long-awaited re-review of the Clarke review of veterans’ entitlements commissioned by the previous coalition government. The re-review, focusing on 45 unimplemented recommendations of the report, will accept only an additional four recommendations, with three being re-reviewed for a second time.
Schedule 1 of this bill creates a new classification of service in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. The new classification, to be known as British nuclear test defence service, will provide additional benefits to former Defence personnel associated with the British nuclear testing in Western Australia and South Australia during the 1950s and 1960s. The new classification will provide eligible ex-service personnel with access to disability pensions and their spouse access to a war widow or widowers pension and, in some cases, access to the repatriation health card for all conditions—the gold card. Approximately 2,300 ex-service personnel will benefit from this new classification, at a cost of $24 million over the forward estimates.
Earlier this year, I met with some individuals who were involved in the nuclear testing here in Australia. Their stories were truly shocking. Moreover, the impact of this testing on their lives and that of their families is something that many would find hard to believe. I heard stories of personnel entering the fallout zone within hours of the detonation taking place. I heard of Navy divers scouring the floor of the ocean off Western Australia in similar circumstances. Quite often, personnel working in the dry and dusty Outback had little protective equipment or clothing to protect them from the effects of the radiation on their bodies.
The previous coalition government undertook in the wake of the recommendations of the Clarke review to conduct a cancer and mortality study. In spite of the recommendations of this study, which continue to be disputed by veterans, their families and some experts in this area, the previous government introduced the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Testing Treatment Bill 2006. The bill provided a repatriation health card for specific conditions and the white card for all cancer treatments for all former military personnel and civilians involved in the testing. The card was provided without the need for a person involved in the testing to prove that their cancer was caused by their service. More than 9,000 people benefited from this scheme.
This new schedule extends further entitlements to former Defence personnel in line with a recommendation of the Clarke review. Although I am disappointed that it has taken until the 11th hour of the life of this parliament for the government to deliver on its commitment, I know that it will be welcome by the ex-service personnel involved in nuclear testing and their families. Importantly, the legislation enacted by the previous coalition government will still enable civilians involved in the testing to access cancer treatment at no cost to them.
Schedule 2 of the bill will alter the classification of submarine special operations at operational and qualifying service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. Between 1978 and 1992, Australian submariners participated in special operations. Little is known of the specifics of these missions. Their covert nature means that the specifics cannot be discussed. Nevertheless, these submariners were potentially placed in dangerous conditions. As a result, the government has decided to reclassify their service and provide additional entitlements to the veterans involved and their families.
Under the change, up to 890 personnel will benefit from access to the service pension, disability pensions, war widower pensions and the gold card once they reach 70 years of age. With ‘qualifying’ and ‘operational’ service, these individuals will be entitled to veteran status under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. I recently spoke to the President of the Naval Association of Australia, Les Dwyer. Les, I may say, is a great bloke. He warmly welcomes the extension of entitlements to the men who served in these missions. Les has written a very detailed article for the next issue of the White Ensign magazine in which he welcomes the government’s announcement.
At this point I would like to remind the House of a motion moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Fairfax and the Chief Opposition Whip, in February last year, which called on the reclassification of this service. Alex Somlyay’s commitment to the reclassification of special operations service was widely welcomed in the veteran community. Together with a former minister for defence, Dr Brendan Nelson, a former minister for veterans’ affairs, the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott MP, and a former parliamentary secretary for defence, the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay MP, the coalition moved and supported the call to reclassify this service. I am pleased with this amendment, and I pay tribute to my colleagues who pursued this issue in the parliament.
The third schedule in this bill deals with service at Ubon in north-east Thailand between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 inclusive. This change is brought about by a ‘nature of service’ review by the Department of Defence, which considers that there is sufficient new evidence to upgrade the status of service at Ubon at the beginning of the RAAF deployment there in 1962.
The history of Australia’s involvement in the stability of South-East Asia during the 1950s and 1960s is perhaps not well understood by many Australians. Following the involvement of Australian defence personnel in the Malayan Emergency, and the Indonesian Confrontation, RAAF personnel were deployed to the Ubon region of north-east Thailand to protect the territorial integrity of Thailand.
Ubon, located close to the Thai-Laotian border, was seen as a strategically important location in the protection of Thailand and other South-East Asian nations from the threat of communism. At the time, the domino theory—of communism sweeping southwards through Asia, one country at a time—prompted the Australian government to be involved in the protection of stable democracies and governments throughout the region. This deployment was sanctioned by the South East Asian Treaty Organisation, SEATO.
In May 1962, the Australian government authorised the deployment of 79 Squadron to the Ubon region. According to a recollection by retired Air Vic Marshall Ray Trebilco, at Ubon:
There was a 5,000 foot strip, a small American radar unit called Lion which was training the Royal Thai Air Force personnel, a non-directional beacon, jet fuel facilities and a control tower of sorts, but that was all.
He goes on:
We understood that the governor of the province and some of the local dignitaries would be flying in from Korat together with the Australian Ambassador and the press to meet our Sabres on arrival. We were also told there would be little crowd control at the air field and that … interested locals and even cattle could all present problems in having a clear runway to land on.
The modest nature of the facilities during the early deployment could have put personnel deployed there at risk. The explanatory memorandum states:
Service in Ubon … is to be re-classified as ‘qualifying service’ due to the potential risk from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements.
Activities at Ubon continued until 1970. From 1965, personnel at Ubon had their service classified as ‘warlike’ given the increased activity in the area due to the Vietnam War. However, service between 28 July 1962 and 1965 will continue to be considered ‘operational service’ under the VE Act. Principally, personnel who worked at Ubon during the period specified by this amendment will have access to a service pension and, when they turn 70 years of age, the gold card, over and above what they can already access by way of disability pensions and the war widow/widower pension for their spouse upon death resulting from their war-caused disability.
Schedule 4 of the bill corrects an anomaly in the VE Act regarding domiciled status for 18- to 21-year-old Commonwealth or allied veterans with eligible service under the VE Act. Under the VE Act, British Commonwealth and allied veterans may be eligible for pensions and other benefits if they have eligible service with a Commonwealth or allied defence force and if they had Australian domicile immediately prior to their enlistment in that defence force. This policy was intended to cover those Australians who were travelling or studying overseas at the time World War II broke out and who could not return to Australia to enlist in the Australian Defence Force.
In the absence of the legal concept of Australian citizenship until 1949, the domicile concept was adopted as a means of determining whether a British, Commonwealth or allied veteran could be regarded as an Australian at the time of enlistment. However, persons under 21 at the time of their enlistment in a Commonwealth or allied defence force could not establish a domicile of choice, as the common law rules that applied at that time meant that a person could not assume a domicile of choice before the age of 21.
The Domicile Act 1982 has since lowered the age at which a person can claim independent domicile from 21 to 18 years of age. However this act does not apply to circumstances that occurred before the commencement of the act, and thus the common-law rules continue to apply in those circumstances. This amendment, a recommendation of the Clarke review, which was not implemented in 2004, will enable those veterans who were between 18 and 20 and unable to nominate Australia as their domicile of choice to gain eligibility under the VE Act for their service as Australian veterans providing they meet the other domicile and service eligibility requirements.
The final schedule of the act relates to a loophole affecting war widows and widowers. This provision will close a loophole in the act which enables a war widower or widow living in a de facto relationship to claim a war widows or widowers pension after they enter the relationship. This is not consistent with the law relating to married or re-married war widow or widowers, who cannot claim the pension after marrying or re-marrying.
I have a particular interest in this measure. As the daughter and grand-daughter of war widows, I am determined to ensure future war widows and widowers do not come up against the same challenges that my mother, in particular, did. It took my mother more than 30 years to access a war widows pension, because her first application was refused and it took an advocate, 30 years later, to convince my mother that she was indeed eligible for a war widows pension and to re-apply.
People do not live neat, tidy lives. This measure, which is prospective and will not affect, we are told, any war widow or widowers living in a marriage-like relationship who claim their pension before 30 September 2010, risks disenfranchising future war widows or widowers. At a time of grief and bereavement, the last thing anyone wants to be doing is filling in a form. Some widows may not be aware that they are indeed entitled to such a pension. Equally, people’s circumstances change; they may enter more difficult times or unwittingly enter a relationship, denying themselves access to a pension in future years. I am concerned about this measure. Whilst I understand it closes a loophole in the existing legislation, I am concerned about the impact this will have on future war widows and widowers. I again make the point that people’s lives do not necessarily reflect an ideal, or perfect, image. Community standards have changed.
Of course, in 2001, the previous coalition government widened an earlier change to the legislation regarding war widows and widowers. Under the 2001 changes, war widows or widowers who remarried after claiming their war widow or widower pension and who lost their pension upon remarriage had their pension reinstated. However, this only applied to those widows or widowers who lost their pension after remarrying; it did not extend to people who had not claimed their pension before remarriage.
My office has been contacted by one woman from Queensland who is in this situation. This individual remarried after the death of her veteran husband because of an economic need and the cultural and social norms of the time. She was not aware that the war widow pension existed—let alone that she was entitled to access it. When she discovered, after the death of her second husband, that she might be eligible for a pension, she was denied it because she had not applied for the pension before she remarried. What we need to aim for, ideally, is to ensure that war widows and widowers in the generations ahead are not in any way disadvantaged because they did not fill out a form upon the death of their veteran spouse.
In conclusion, the coalition will not oppose the measures in this bill. While I do have concerns about the provisions of schedule 5, the other four measures of this bill are of benefit to the affected individuals and their families.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to lend my support to the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010, which will go some way to improving the wellbeing of Australia’s veterans and the wider ex-services community. It was only last week that I, together with many, rose in this place to speak on another bill that was introduced. This one actually made minor technical amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. Nevertheless, they were amendments that were designed to further align the veterans law with social security law and were another step in making improvements to conditions for our ex-service personnel, our veterans. During my contribution I spoke about what the veterans community can expect under this government and how our efforts will address a range of veterans issues, particularly around entitlements, services, wellbeing and recognition. This bill is another step in building better services for the Australian veterans community.
I have on many occasions had the opportunity to acknowledge the veterans community organisations that operate tirelessly in my area, the south-west of Sydney, such as the Macarthur veterans recreational centre, the Vietnam Veterans Association, the Ingleburn, Campbelltown and Liverpool RSL clubs and the Cabra-Vale Diggers. I should mention Mr Ron Brown of the National Servicemen’s Association. Last time I mentioned him, a number of members of the opposition approached me to tell me how active he was in organisations in their electorates in pursuing the very just causes of national servicemen.
Their hard work and devotion to improving the wellbeing of Australian veterans and the wider ex-services community particularly impresses me. On behalf of a very grateful community, I give thanks for their efforts. I know much of their effort goes unrecognised, but, without that assistance, the veterans community would not have the voice that it has today. Despite all the well-meaning commitment of others to their cause, we need those veterans associations to ensure that veterans have a proper and unfettered voice in determining their needs.
I have also had the opportunity on a couple of occasions to take Minister Alan Griffin out to my electorate. As I said, we have a very active veterans community there. Formerly, the Ingleburn Army Camp was plumb in the middle of my electorate, and a lot of people, after they demobbed from the service, stayed in the area. It is easy to understand why Werriwa is home to a lot of ex-servicemen. The minister has been very good with his time, coming out and addressing those issues with the local veterans community. I think he has a very clear understanding of the issues of the veterans community, certainly as it applies to my region, and I genuinely thank him for spending time with our local veterans.
Veterans can be assured that, under this government, their interests will always be a priority. One of the things the previous speaker, my colleague from Greenway, had to leave out of her contribution to the House, for obvious reasons, was that in their 11 years they were very slow to act on improvements for veterans. I do welcome a degree of bipartisanship when it comes to these bills, however, to improve clearly and decisively the conditions of veterans across the nation. I am confident that working more closely with our ex-services community will allow us to be more responsive to the needs of veterans and be prepared to meet the future challenges of our ex-services personnel and, importantly, their families. The introduction of this bill I think is an example of that.
Only this week I had the opportunity of welcoming to Parliament House Greg Brassil and Ian Fulton from the local army cadets operating in my region. They spent time with the office of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Mike Kelly, because of some concerns they had. They also spent some time talking with the Deputy Prime Minister. I should indicate what these people are doing in an area of great need. They have a base operating in Rosemeadow in south-west Sydney. You may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that was the location of considerable social upheaval last year with riots in the 3M estate. The area very clearly is social disadvantaged and many of the families within that community do not have positive role models. What these two gentlemen have done is set up an army cadet base where they are actively providing very positive role models for younger people in the community. I know the juvenile justice services are working very closely with them now by referring young people to the army cadets.
On a very positive note, over the last five years this one unit in the south-west of Sydney has been getting between 10 and 12 recruits into the ADF per year. Young people have decided to stay with the army cadets, finish high school and then apply to our military forces as a consequence. So I am certainly unashamed in introducing both these gentlemen to Colonel Mike Kelly’s office and to the Deputy Prime Minister and in telling people what they do. They are without doubt doing a very good job in the community. But what I see them doing through their local cadet unit, in assisting recruitment of personnel into the ADF, I think is extraordinary.
This bill will give effect to a number of veterans’ affairs budget measures that I would like to take just a little time to go through. First, the bill will create a new category of service of eligibility under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, to be known as defence service. It will importantly provide participants of that program in Australia with access to compensation and healthcare benefits for conditions accepted as related to the British nuclear test service. Currently, former personnel who participated in the British nuclear tests program have access to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 for any related period of their service. However, the Clarke review, in 2003, recommended—but it was not acted upon—that these people be considered for acceptance into the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. It was recommended that participation by defence personnel in the British nuclear test program in Australia be deemed non-warlike hazardous service and, therefore, the legislation be amended to ensure that the declaration can have effect in extending Veterans’ Entitlements Act coverage. While the recommendation was not acted upon by the Howard government, I do appreciate that on this occasion it is now being supported by members in opposition. When this comes into law, it will have an effect for 2,700 former defence personnel, which is quite significant.
The second element of the bill is the reclassification of certain submarine operations between 1978 and 1992 as operationally and qualifying service. At present, this service is classified as peacetime service. In the 2003 review of veterans’ entitlements, conducted by Justice John Clarke, it was recommended that service on submarine special operations during this time be classified as non-warlike hazardous under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. As I understand it, over this period our submarines were equipped with special intelligence-gathering equipment and were deployed in covert operations. It was only fitting in that instance to accept the recommendation of Justice John Clarke that this be regarded as non-warlike, but nevertheless hazardous, for persons qualifying under the Veterans’ Entitlements ct. In 2009, Defence recommended that service on these operations and deployment on those submarines did meet the criteria for allotment of duty, the qualifying service requirement that applied at the time of those operations. Consequently, this measure will provide relevant members of the Australian Defence Force with qualifying service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, which will provide a service pension at age 60 and, importantly, an automatic gold card at age 70. I understand that, whilst this is long overdue, it is nevertheless very welcomed by the ADF and will affect 890 members as a consequence.
The third measure in this bill I wish to discuss relates to RAAF service in Ubon, Thailand as qualifying service for the purposes of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. After a review was undertaken by Defence, it was determined that the initial deployment between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 mirrored the readiness of the RAAF presence in Ubon between June 1965 and August 1968. By the way, that later service is already deemed to qualify for the purposes of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986.
This bill seeks to recognise that those RAAF air crews and ground crews, from which there were some 60 members on base in Ubon, were exposed to the potential risk of hostile activities and that as a consequence they should be treated as falling within the definitions in the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. It is the right thing to do. It recognises that the outbreak of fighting against the Pathet Lao forces along the Thai border with Laos and Cambodia was considered—and is still considered, when the history is looked at—a very real and imminent possibility which would have impacted on our forces. As a consequence, the period between May 1962 and July 1962 will be treated in the same way as the later occasion in 1968 in that the earlier of the two periods of service will qualify and be recognised under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.
Another measure in the bill will lower the age of domicile of choice from 21 to 18 for the purposes of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. I know a small number of British, Commonwealth and allied forces veterans have not been able to access the compensatory benefits under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act because they were between the ages of 18 and 21 when they enrolled in the forces and, because of their age, were automatically determined to be domiciled in the same country as their father or, if their father was not alive, that of their mother. This was an automatic default position, and men who enlisted between the ages of 18 and 21 are directly impacted by it as a consequence. I doubt whether this affects many, but it is certainly an injustice to many of those who fought alongside Australian servicemen, who were part of the British, Commonwealth and allied forces at that time. It is almost anachronistic to us these days that an 18 year-old person could go to war and vote in this country but not have his place of residence acknowledged as valid when making an application to join the services.
This bill corrects an anomaly that has long been a bugbear for a number of people, though I know that it does not affect many. One person it has affected, albeit in a slightly different way, is my father-in-law. He was 20 when he disembarked from a British Navy ship in Sydney, so he had his discharge papers signed here. He went through his whole working life, and it was not until sometime well into the future that issues were discovered, because his point of engagement on the British ship was in Scotland. We had to work a number of things through for him, but the measures in this bill will help a number of people in the same age group as my father-in-law who joined the services outside Australia.
It should be known that under this bill all other aspects of the domicile rules still need to be met. The condition of residency in Australia—including the intention to reside, the length of the period of residency et cetera—still needs to be met. So it is not just a matter of the point in time that the individual in question made application to join the service.
I turn to the final aspect of this bill that I wish to mention. An amendment in this bill will end the eligibility for the war widows pension and the war widowers pension of war widows and widowers who enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widows pension or the war widowers pension. This seeks to provide equal treatment for partners who enter into a de facto relationship and those who enter into a marriage or a form of marriage-like arrangement which is registered. The amendment will apply only to claims made from 1 October 2010 or where there is an automatic grant of a widows pension or a widowers pension in relation to a death that occurs on or after 1 October 2010. So importantly, no existing widow’s or widower’s pension will be affected by this measure.
In conclusion, this government will ensure that the ex-servicemen’s community and our veterans get a fair go. I think this bill goes some way to improving the existing arrangements for veterans. Australians are justifiably proud of their veterans and their ex-service community. This government believes that the provision of robust services and support for our ex-service community is a sincere way to show our gratitude in recognition of the bravery and sacrifice of these Australian men and women in a time of need in this country. As the Prime Minister said on 13 August 2007:
There is perhaps no greater duty that we as a nation and as a parliament have than to honour, remember and express our gratitude to those Australians who have served in the defence of our nation in times of war, because our security and liberty have not come without a price.
I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I rise today to speak on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. In essence, this bill will address a number of election commitments made by Labor during the 2007 election campaign. It is no surprise that these changes are only now being introduced, three years later, in the run-up to the 2010 election. The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs regularly stands up in this House and says, ‘You had 12 years to do something,’ and I accept that, but this government has been in place for nearly three years and only now are we finally seeing action. So let there be no doubt that the only thing that spurs this government into action is bad press or bad polls.
The first measure contained within this bill concerns ex-defence personnel who have service relating to the British nuclear tests and is in line with the recommendation of the Clarke review. This measure seeks to insert a new classification within the Veterans’ Entitlement Act titled ‘British nuclear test defence service’ and will provide ex-defence personnel with additional entitlements. These entitlements will be equivalent to the existing entitlements contained within the Veterans’ Entitlements Act for hazardous or non-warlike service. Those persons who qualify under this definition will be eligible to access disability pensions, war widow/widower pensions and, in some cases, the gold card. Importantly, the reverse criminal standard of proof will be used to asses a person’s eligibility to claim benefits under this measure.
The next measure contained within this bill relates to service undertaken while on submarine special operations. This measure will reclassify service as operational and qualifying under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. This change applies only to service undertaken on submarine special operations between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992, whereby some Royal Australian Navy submarines were engaged in special operations and intelligence operations to the north and west of Australia. The benefits available to qualifying and eligible persons are the service pension, the disability pension, the war widow/widower pension and a gold card from age 70. Eligibility for this entitlement will again be determined by applying the reverse criminal standard of proof and will be determined on service during the periods I previously specified, as well as on the basis that a member is entitled to be awarded with the Australian Service Medal with a ‘Special Ops’ clasp.
The next measure contained within this bill concerns service rendered by ADF personnel in Thailand—specifically service rendered at Ubon between 21 May 1962 and 27 July 1962. Currently, service at Ubon during this time is classified as operational; however, this amendment seeks to reclassify that service as qualifying service in light of the fact that those deployed at Ubon during the aforementioned period were exposed to potential risks arising from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements. However, it is important to note that this amendment does not affect the classification of service rendered throughout the rest of the north-east of Thailand during this period and, as such, this service will remain classified as operational service. This amendment will grant eligible persons access to the service pension, the disability pension, the war widow/widower pension and the gold card from age 70.
The fourth amendment put forward under this legislation relates to the legal concept of a domicile of choice. By way of a short historical explanation, in the absence of the legal concept of Australian citizenship until 1949, the domicile of choice concept was used to determine whether a British, Commonwealth or allied veteran could be regarded as an Australian at the time of enlistment. That is, if a person was deemed, under common-law rules that applied at the time, as living in a residence located in Australia, they were regarded as a resident at the time of enlistment. However, a problem arose with this construct as a person aged under 21 years at the time of their enlistment could not establish a domicile of choice due to the common-law rules as they applied at the time. To correct this situation, the Domicile Act 1982 lowered the age at which a person could be legally regarded as establishing a domicile of choice from 21 to 18 years. However, the legislation did not apply to those cases arising before the commencement of that act. This amendment seeks to enable those British, Commonwealth or allied veterans aged between 18 and 21 at the time of enlistment to access Australian pensions and other benefits, provided that other common-law tests used in determining the domicile of choice are met.
The final amendment contained within this bill seeks to remove a so-called loophole which allows a widow/widower to claim a war widow/widower pension even if they enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow/widower pension. By way of contrast, a widow/widower who marries or remarries before claiming the war widow/widower pension is not eligible for that pension. This legislation effectively means that the provisions for claiming a war widow/widower pension will now apply equally to those who are married or in a de facto relationship. Importantly, this amendment is prospective and will not affect any claim for a pension made before 30 September 2010.
While the measures contained within this bill meet with the recommendations contained within the Clarke review, and I note they also have the broad support of the veterans community, it is important to note the timing of the introduction of this legislation. It is quite obvious that the Rudd Labor government has chosen to introduce this legislation during the time immediately preceding the election campaign proper. This point has not been lost on the veterans community. While they may be supportive of the changes I have just outlined, I am confident that they will also be cognisant of the fact that the timing of this bill is, to put it nicely, suspect. Take, for instance, the recommendations of the review of the Clarke report. These recommendations were delivered to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mr Griffin, in February 2009. It has taken Minister Griffin 15 months from the time he received the report for any action—at all—to occur on the recommendations of the review of the Clarke review. Yet only today in this House, Mr Griffin had the audacity to criticise the former coalition government for a three-month turnaround time on the Podger review.
I put it to you, Minister Griffin: what are you going to do with the Podger review? You have had it for 2½ years and you have done nothing with it. Committing to release it says nothing about what you intend to do with its recommendations. It is just more talk, no action. The veterans community simply does not buy the line that because you said you would release it, and did, that you have discharged your responsibility on this matter. And I am here to remind you that you have a long way to go before anyone would consider that you have even come close to doing so.
This is just more spin from a government trying to deflect attention away from its own failings—and there are lots of them. For the minister to stand in this House and claim that three months was far too long a time for the release of the Podger review, only to take over 15 months to act on the Clarke review illustrates the utter hypocrisy of this minister. And let us not forget that for all the fanfare made by the Rudd Labor government about ‘correcting’ the service of BCOF veterans, some 30 months later it has decided to have the three recommendations reviewed again. So they are re-reviewing the re-reviewed recommendations! But that is the modus operandi of the Rudd Labor government: if it is too hard they will delay it, bury it or re-review it. Therefore, 2,700 aged veterans and their families are still waiting on the Rudd Labor government to fulfil their 2007 election commitments.
I note that the measures contained within this bill will be widely welcomed by the veterans community. But I also note that the Rudd Labor government, through the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Mr Griffin, has waited until the last possible moment to introduce this legislation, all so he can maximise the political impact of these new measures. This is the action of a desperate government, a government trying to regain momentum. This is an act of a government that puts its self-interest before the interests of those in the veterans community.
To conclude, veterans deserve a government that is upfront and honest with regard to its policies and promises, something that the current government has failed on both accounts. Veterans deserve a minister that will take action based on the interests of veterans, not the political interests of the Rudd Labor government. And finally, our service personnel, past and present, deserve to live out their lives in dignity and peace after giving so much to their nation. They deserve a government that will make the tough decisions and give veterans a sense of what is to come, instead of leaving them in limbo, waiting for answers on the important matter of their future financial and social security.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Hale, Damian, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to make my contribution to the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. It was an election commitment to look at the five areas that are in this bill. It is disappointing, to say the least, that the member for Paterson’s contribution was overshadowed by having a swipe at the government. The point was made by the minister earlier today, when introducing the bill, that the former government had ample opportunity to address these matters and failed to do so. We are addressing them now. But we have come to expect that from those opposite, that even when they do support a bill, they still find it very difficult to speak in a proper manner of support.
The bill will give effect to a number of Veterans’ Affairs budget measures. Firstly, it will create a new category of service eligibility under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to be known as the British nuclear test defence service; secondly, reclassify certain submarine special operations between 1978 and 1992 as operational and qualifying service; thirdly, reclassify certain service in Ubon in Thailand as qualifying service; fourthly, lower the age of domicile of choice from 21 to 18 for the purpose of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986; and, finally, cease eligibility for war widow and war widower pensions for widows or widowers who enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow or war widower pension. I will look at each of these in some more detail.
The compensation for military participants in British nuclear testing is important because the British government conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga, Emu Field and Montebello Islands in the 1950s and 1960s and participants have long sought recognition and compensation under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 for conditions arising from their service. In reviewing recommendations of the 2003 Clarke review, the government has decided that former Defence Force personnel who participated in the British nuclear tests program will be provided with access to compensation and benefits under the VEA, as intended by the Clarke review. This will provide disability pensions and healthcare benefits to former Defence Force personnel who suffer from conditions accepted as related to the BNT service. It will also provide the war widow/war widower pension and gold card to the widows and widowers where the participant’s death is accepted as related to the BNT service. People who will benefit from this will be former Defence Force personnel who participated in the BNT program. It is estimated 2,700 surviving personnel will potentially benefit, at a cost of $24.2 million over five years.
The second item we have looked at is the domicile of choice. It is important that veterans who served with the British, Commonwealth and allied forces during the Second World War are able to access benefits under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 if they have served during the war and were domiciled in Australia prior to the war. A small number of these veterans, the BCAL veterans, have been able to access VEA compensation benefits because they were between 18 and 21, thus automatically determined to be domiciled in the same country as their father or their mother if their father was deceased. The Clarke review of veterans entitlements recommended that this discretionary treatment be removed by lowering the age of domicile of choice to 18 years, but this was not implemented. The government committed to reviewing the unimplemented recommendations of the Clarke review and is now implementing these recommendations.
The other aspects of the domicile rules still need to be met, such as integration into Australian society and residency in Australia including intention to reside and length of such residency. The BCAL veterans who enlisted aged between 18 and 21 and would have had Australia as their domicile had they been legally able to choose will benefit from this measure. It is estimated to affect only a handful of veterans and war widows but is an important point of principle. The cost of this amendment will be $700,000 over four years on the forward estimates.
As to the reclassification of certain submarine operations, the Clarke review of veterans entitlements recommended that certain submarine special operations between 1978 and 1992 be deemed non-warlike hazardous for the purposes of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. This recommendation was not accepted by the previous government. The government committed to reviewing the unimplemented recommendations of the Clarke review, and in 2009 the Vice Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Navy concluded that the special operations met the special criteria for qualifying service and operational service that applied at the time. The reclassification of the service to qualifying service and operational service will provide access to benefits under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986, including access to disability pensions, the service pension at age 60 and automatic entitlement to the gold card at age 70 to all submariners who served on certain special operations between 1978 and 1992 and who are eligible for the award of Australian Service Medal with Special Operations Clasp for that service.
The beneficiaries of this amendment are some 890 former submariners and others who are eligible for the award of the Australian Service Medal with Special Operations Clasp for certain special submarine operations between 1978 and 1990. The government has committed $11.1 million over four years to fund this amendment.
The fourth part of the bill concerns the Defence-initiated nature of service review and the reclassification of service at RAAF Base Ubon in Thailand. The Clarke review of veterans entitlements recommended that the classification of service at RAAF Base Ubon in Thailand between 31 May 1962 and 24 June 1965 not be changed. This recommendation was accepted by the previous government. Although not part of the revisitation of the Clarke review recommendations, a recent separate Defence nature of service review recommended the classification of service between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 as qualifying service. This reclassification will allow veterans to access further benefits under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 for this service, including a service pension at age 60 and automatic entitlement to the gold card at age 70.
Personnel who served at RAAF Base Ubon in Thailand between 31 May and 27 July 1962 will be the beneficiaries of this. About 60 of the estimated 215 surviving veterans with this service currently do not have access to these benefits. This will be funded by the government at a cost of $2.7 million over the next four years.
The Clarke review also recommended the removal of inequities in treatment of widows or widowers who marry or remarry as opposed to those who enter into a de facto relationship. Under this proposal, if a deceased veteran’s partner enters into a marriage-like relationship, they will no longer be eligible to claim the war widow or widowers pension, in the same way as those who marry or remarry are not eligible. This ineligibility will be permanent. Eligibility will not be reinstated if the de facto relationship ends. This removes the inequity in treatment of widows and widowers who marry or remarry as opposed to those who enter into a de facto relationship. This measure will ensure equal treatment of partners who marry or remarry and those who enter into a de facto relationship. This only applies to new claims. No current pensions are affected. There will be a saving to the government over four years of $1.4 million.
There is always a lot of passion in this House when we talk about our veterans. Our war veterans are often left behind, and I know the member for Dobell has many veterans in his community who have served their country. I look forward to being able to inform the veterans in my community of the amendments that have been made to this bill.
The 2010-11 budget delivers on key election commitments that the Rudd Labor government made to the veterans community—some $246 million worth of new initiatives, greater access to compensation and income support, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions from members of the veterans community, action on further recommendations of the Clarke review, better access to health care and compensation for the F111 workers. I have often spoken in this House about the F111 workers and how moving and gut wrenching that inquiry was. I was very happy to see that there was compensation for those people affected all those years ago. Some $55 million will be invested to give an additional 2,400 F111 aircraft fuel tank maintenance workers access to better health care and compensation. These workers include those known as pick and patch personnel, who were not deemed eligible under the previous scheme. This means that more than 3,000 F111 workers will now have access to benefits should they need them. That is very important, and I was glad to see that that compensation will be paid to those people who so thoroughly deserve it.
I know that people are now turning up in the chamber, but not to listen to me talk about this bill. That is being a bit harsh on myself, but I would like to add my congratulations to the member for Kooyong. As a new member here, he is somebody I have looked up to and respected. He took many different positions on issues within the former government. I certainly congratulate him on his contribution to this place, and I look forward to his valedictory speech.
In conclusion, David Hardy has worked for me for three years. He is going back to work in his previous job. David Hardy is a lifelong friend of mine. During the election campaign he took 13 weeks annual leave to help me campaign and then he took a $5,000 pay cut and lost his airfares to come to work for me. He has finally seen the light and is going back to the Northern Territory government. So, to David Hardy: thanks a lot. And, to Petro: congratulations, and I look forward to your speech. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I was in the chamber to hear Kim Beazley’s brilliant valedictory speech. One of the distinctive things he did was to thank people at the beginning rather than at the end of the speech. Expressions of gratitude are too often truncated by time constraints, so I will emulate Kim’s example.
One of the nice things in my case about getting older is that the black list shrinks while the white list, the debts that cannot be repaid, grow. I thank my mother, Anastasia, and my late father, Costandino Georgiou, for their enormous affection and commitment to their children despite the pressures and anxieties of migration. I thank my children, Costandino and Alexia, who, while still very young, felt the impact of my involvement in politics. Dino is in the gallery today; Alexia has unfortunately been caught in the fog in Melbourne. They are admirable young people. I thank Roxanne, who is everything.
I thank my friends who have held me to my true compass through their support and by administering frequent and systematic beatings. I am grateful to have too many friends to thank them all individually, but they include Jo Szwarc, whose towering intellect has been totally committed to defending the vulnerable; Michael Kapel, a truly remarkable political talent; Ted Baillieu, whose devotion to the public good is unsurpassed. I also thank Alister Drysdale, Peter Wilkinson, Tony Staley, Giancarlo Martini-Piovano, Colin Rubenstein, Bret Walker, Brian Burdekin and Anna Cronin.
Friends embrace staff: Andrew Manton, whose enormous capacities helped me to survive my first years in parliament; Helen Morris, my long-suffering secretary, for whom I worked for 21 years; Eleanor McKinna; Kelly Sexton; and Tony Conheady. These people and all my other staff over the years have enabled me to perform far beyond my capacities.
I thank my colleagues in the coalition, the Independents, third parties and those on the other side of the House. I thank Russell Broadbent, Judi Moylan, Judith Troeth and Bruce Baird. We have lived through some interesting times together. I will miss seeing them regularly. They embody the Liberal Party’s traditions of strength, independent thinking and compassion.
There is a special portal in the parliament. It makes people patient, sensitive, trustworthy, objective advisers and true defenders of the parliament. Unfortunately, passage through that portal is restricted to the clerks of the House of Representatives. I thank all the clerks I have known over 35 years. I thank the Parliamentary Library, Parliament House staff and Comcar drivers. I thank them for their indefatigable efforts to make an unruly parliament work.
I thank the Liberal Party and the electorate of Kooyong. Kooyong is the birthplace of the Liberal Party. I have worked for the Liberal Party for most of my working life. As state director, as policy adviser and as a member of parliament, I have worked in pursuit of the Liberal Party values of enterprise, opportunity, incentive and social justice. I am grateful to the party in Kooyong for their support,  and I thank Haddon Storey, Bill Clancy and Paula Davey for their work as my electorate chairs. The party in Kooyong is one of the powerhouses of liberalism and I wish it well.
I have been genuinely humbled by the support I have received from the Kooyong electorate. Occasionally, some try to dismiss Kooyong as one of the ‘leafy suburbs’, populated by doctors’ wives. I note in passing that leafy suburbs have been the backbone of the Liberal Party and that ‘doctors’ wives’ have always been at the heart of Australia’s rural and urban communities. Not to recognise this is to disregard our historic traditions and our current realities. Kooyong is an open-minded and forward-looking electorate. Our people are active and socially responsible, with real insights on local and national issues. They are forthcoming in expressing their views, needs and values. It has been a great honour and a great privilege to have been able to serve them as their parliamentary representative.
I would like to thank the press gallery. In the interests of transparency, I wish to disclose the following: my first media interview was with Laurie Oakes in, I think, 1975, for the Australian Playboy. I was a total novice. He was very fair to me. But I can truly say that I only bought Playboy for the articles.
Journos, like politicians, can be good, bad or indifferent. They face imperative challenges, deadlines, the complexity of material and occasional misbriefing by interested parties. The good ones are full of insight and have a capacity to communicate with Australians and make politicians accountable.
This is my 16th year in the parliament as the member for Kooyong and it is my 35th year in politics. I first sat on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1975 as an adviser to Malcolm Fraser, having brought some of the Khemlani telexes to Canberra as the coalition was blocking supply. Gough Whitlam’s brilliant parliamentary skills defending a government that was weakened was mesmerising, as was the remorselessness of Malcolm Fraser’s attacks. The fact that the supply crisis did not harm Australian democracy attests to the resilience of our political system. The fact that Gough and Malcolm reconciled years ago is a tribute to their stature as national leaders. To those who have sought to denigrate Malcolm Fraser, I just want to say one thing: Malcolm’s fusion of political toughness with compassion and social conscience is simply beyond their comprehension.
I have been enormously privileged to have worked personally for Liberal parliamentary leaders over the last 30 years: Malcolm Fraser, Andrew Peacock, Jeffrey Kennett and John Hewson. Some have broken through; others have not. My respect for their commitment to creating a better Australia is boundless. Nobody forces people to be leaders but, nonetheless, the responsibilities they volunteer to shoulder and the pressures they are subjected to are almost inconceivable. It is unfortunate that our political culture takes partisanship to the point of corrosiveness. I think our political leaders deserve more respect than we give them, regardless of which party they belong to.
I came into the parliament at the age of 47, having been at the sharp end of partisan politics and also having contributed to public policy through the establishment of SBS Television and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. I was strong in my view of what the Liberal Party stood for and confident in the common sense and fair-mindedness of the Australian people. I believed that politics was a tough business. There were two dominant parties, they were in conflict, they had power and they had resources. They were strong and evenly matched. They punched and they counterpunched, and sometimes low blows were landed. In my view, however, scapegoating the vulnerable was never part of the political game. I still believe this.
Not all politics is confrontation. Main force clashes, negative advertising and attempts to score lethal blows at question time—all too often unlethal—do dominate. But there are some less confrontational arenas. In parliamentary committees, the focus is on working cooperatively to inquire into issues of national significance and to scrutinise the executive. In my time on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, for instance, the committee, which included Senator Robert Ray, whose knowledge of the electoral system is as legendary as his lack of political tender-mindedness, managed to bring down three unanimous reports on the electoral system. This sort of cooperation provides some relief from a political landscape that is, generally, bleakly partisan. It should be highlighted more often.
Eleven years of my term was as a member of the government under John Howard. With Peter Costello as Treasurer, its economic achievements were remarkable. We enjoyed strong economic prosperity and record low levels of unemployment, and Australia was left with an enormously strong economy. These achievements should not be belittled and I do not think that they can be denied.
During my time in parliament, a number of developments caused me grave concern. The emergence of the pernicious influence of Hansonism stirred up racial prejudice; multiculturalism, one of Australia’s unique accomplishments, was denigrated; asylum seekers were subjected to increasingly harsh measures; our civil liberties came under challenge after September 11; and the proud Australian tradition of inclusive citizenship was, without sound justification, reversed.
My experience in politics leads me to value party discipline highly. On some issues, however, I was unable to support the position of the party majority. A Liberal member of parliament has the right to do this. The Liberal Party has changed over the decades, but the right of Liberal parliamentarians to differ from the majority of their colleagues on matters of individual principle and conscience has endured. The belief that party discipline does not override individual principle is built into the very foundation of, and is the very reason for, our party’s existence. In recent months there has been efflorescence within the party of the right to dissent—dissent over climate change and alcopops spring to mind. I may have differed with my colleagues on their position, but I unequivocally endorse their right to dissent. Hopefully, we will never again hear a member of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party brand colleagues ‘political terrorists’ because they took a stand on principle.
I have not differed from the majority without considerable reflection and deliberation or without speaking with my colleagues and my party leader—and I have always known the consequences of my actions. Ultimately, however, being a member of parliament, especially a member of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party brings the responsibility of speaking with one’s own voice on matters of principle. I am grateful to the many members of the public, and in particular Liberal Party supporters, who have expressed their respect for my actions, even when they have disagreed.
It is my conviction that public policy is served when members of parliament feel able to speak publicly about deeply felt concerns, even when their views do not conform with those of the majority of their colleagues. I believe that the public good was promoted by the attempt by myself and others to have the Commonwealth intervene to override the Northern Territory laws which jailed children for minor infractions such as stealing a bottle of spring water—laws which fell particularly harshly on Indigenous children. We did not succeed in getting the laws overridden; we did achieve the establishment of diversionary programs which effectively displaced jail.
I believe that Australia benefited from the reforms that flowed from the attempt of a number of us to introduce private member’s bills reforming the treatment of asylum seekers. Children and families were taken out from behind razor wire. The Ombudsman was made responsible for publicly reporting on people being detained for prolonged periods. Thousands of people on temporary protection visas were given permanent protection.
I believe that the resistance to draconian aspects of the anti-terrorist laws and the introduction of a private member’s bill to establish an independent reviewer of terrorist laws—which was in essence taken up by the Labor government, with much reluctance—served liberal principles well. I do not pretend that our efforts had anything like total success. The Northern Territory laws were not struck down. The policy of mandatory detention was not abolished by either the Howard or the Rudd government. What happened, however, was that the compromises achieved made a significant difference to the lives of thousands of vulnerable men, women and children.
For most of my life I have believed in the inevitability of progress. The reality is that many of the things that I believed were embedded parts of our polity—multiculturalism, the inclusiveness of Australian citizenship and the protection of civil rights—have been rolled back. Also rolled back has been a more decent treatment of asylum seekers. Until a few months ago I believed that the reforms made by the Howard and the Rudd governments meant that we had irreversibly turned the corner. I wrote that we were closing a dark chapter in our history. This chapter had seen men and women who were seeking refuge in our country incarcerated. It had seen innocent people imprisoned for longer than convicted rapists, robbers and kidnappers. Escapees from persecution were demonised and detention centres traumatised—not just the detainees, but their guards.
This chapter, I am afraid, has been reopened. Regression has become the order of the day. With an increase in boat arrivals, asylum seekers are being subjected to increasingly virulent attacks. The Labor government has frozen the processing of Afghani and Sri Lankan asylum seekers and is reopening the Curtin detention centre. Historically, Curtin is the most notorious of the detention centres, which have all been places of despair and self-harm. Opposition policies would turn back boats, process asylum seekers in undisclosed third countries and restore the destructive temporary protection visas. These policies are cruel. They do not have my support.
This regression does not reflect credit on either side of federal politics. Vulnerable people are again being made into a football to be kicked around in the interests of partisan politics. This is despite the facts and the best values of our society. The fact is that Australia’s punitive approach did not deter people coming to Australia. Mandatory detention, the charging of asylum seekers for the costs of their detention, the introduction of temporary protection visas and the Pacific Solution did not deter them. After mandatory detention was introduced, boat arrivals increased. After temporary protection visas were introduced, boat arrivals increased. Most of the people subjected to the Pacific Solution were found to be genuine refugees and resettled in Australia and New Zealand.
I do not believe that we have lost control of our borders. I do not believe that people smugglers determine who comes into Australia and who does not. We can support orderly processes, we can warn people against people smugglers and we can warn them not to risk their lives on unseaworthy boats. We have to realise, however, that escaping from persecution is not an orderly process. Desperate people do take desperate measures. But beyond the arguments about deterrence, and what causes what, is a more fundamental point. It goes to our obligations. I believe that we have a fundamental obligation as a nation to, at the very least, not further harm those who bring themselves into our orbit of responsibility by seeking a safe haven. We should not, as Australians, compound the persecution of genuine refugees by delaying their processing, locking them up in unnamed third countries or keeping them in insecurity on temporary protection visas.
I once said to journalist Michael Gordon:
In life there are many things that you’d like to walk past and not notice. Lots. But sometimes you do notice and when you notice, you have to do something.
I have noticed some things, and I have tried not to walk past.
Progress is not inevitable. It requires commitment, and it requires effort. There are setbacks and there are regressions. But I leave this place still optimistic that Australians will seek and find in their representatives, declarations and deeds that elevate hope above fear, and tolerance above prejudice. I am optimistic that they may be proud of the laws made by their parliamentarians and the contribution they make to help build a fair, decent and civil society for quickly coming generations. We here each bear a responsibility for our nation’s calling and our nation’s standing.
It has been a profound honour to serve the nation as a member of the Australian Parliament. I am proud to have been part of this place during this time. Thank you.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 addresses five parts of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act that require amendment and it includes service relating to British nuclear tests, service on submarine special operations, service in Thailand, domicile and effect of widows and widowers entering into de facto relationships, and requires further interpretation of the eligibility criteria. The Veterans’ Entitlements Act provides eligibility for pensions, treatment and other benefits on the basis of the type of service that the veteran or Defence Force member has rendered. The three main types of service are operational service, which includes non-warlike service, qualifying service and defence service. Service regarded as operational service provides eligibility for disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits, and the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof is used to determine pension claims. Operational service is overseas service within defined areas and dates in a time of war or during warlike or non-warlike operations. Operational service also grants veteran status under the Veterans’ Entitlement Act.
Qualifying service provides eligibility for service pension and associated benefits. Post Second World War qualifying service generally requires a person to have been allotted for duty and to have served in an operational area listed in schedule 2 of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act or to have rendered warlike service. The other main category of defence—defence service—provides eligibility for disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits. Broadly, defence service is peacetime service of three years or more in the Defence Force between 7 December 1972 and the commencement of the Military Compensation Act 1994 on 7 April 1994 and any period of hazardous service. Pension claims relating to defence service only are determined on the balance of probabilities, unless the member has peacekeeping service or hazard service, in which case the generous reverse criminal standard of proof is applicable.
Then we have to look at those who were in defence forces during the series of British nuclear weapons tests which were conducted in Australia at the Monte Bello Islands off the coast of Western Australia and at Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia between October 1952 and October 1957. Minor trials were also conducted at Emu Field and Maralinga between 1953 and 1963. Both Australian and British personnel were involved in the tests and those involved included military and civilian participants but have yet to be included under this legislation.
Workers compensation coverage for participants who were at the time members of the Australian Defence Force or the Australian Public Service is provided under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and its predecessors. In 1986 the government created a like safety, rehabilitation and compensation act administrative scheme to provide compensation coverage for civilians, including pastoralists and Indigenous persons, who were at the test sites. This scheme is still open to claimants. The test participants also had access to a special administrative scheme and an act of grace scheme, both administered by the then Department of Science, Education and Training.
In 2006 the government enacted the British Nuclear Test (Treatment) Act to provide free testing and treatment for cancer for both military and non-military personnel who participated in the tests and related activities. The changes allowed a group of veterans who had been left out before to be included. As part of the 2010 budget, a new category of eligible service is to be created under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act to provide former Australian Defence Force members who participated in the British nuclear tests and related activities with eligibility for benefits equivalent to those that are available to members with non-warlike or hazardous service. In addition, pension claims relating to British nuclear test defence service are to be determined under the more generous standard of proof of the reasonable hypothesis test under sections 120 and 120A of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. British nuclear test defence service is a distinct new category of service and is not non-warlike or hazardous service, although the benefits it will attract are equivalent to those for non-warlike or hazardous service or defence service.
To achieve this, the British nuclear test Defence service will be incorporated into part 4 of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The amendments will be made to sections 120 and 120A to ensure that pensions claimed relate to British nuclear test Defence service and are determined on the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof and reasonable hypothesis test. British nuclear test Defence service will be incorporated into part IV of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act by including British nuclear test Defence service in the definition of Defence service in part 4 item 4 of this schedule, including members of the British nuclear test Defence service in the definition of member of the forces in part IV item 5 of this schedule and applying part IV of the VEA to members with British nuclear test Defence service. This requires a new subsection, 69B, at item 6 of this schedule. It will also define the criteria a member must meet to have rendered British nuclear test Defence service.
Because of the incorporation of British nuclear test Defence service into part IV of the VEA, members will become eligible for disability and war widow and war widower pensions under part IV; treatment under part V by virtue of section 81 of part V; allowance and other benefits under part VI by virtue of section 96 of part VI; rehabilitation under part VIA; the Veterans’ Children Education Scheme under part VII; and the veterans’ supplement under part VIIA.
The second part of this legislation applies to certain submarine special operations, which will be reclassified as operational and qualifying service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. This will provide eligibility for all pensions and associated benefits under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and will mean that disability and war widow and war widower pension claims relating to this service will be determined on the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof.
The amendments made by schedule 2 reclassify certain submarine special operations that were undertaken in the period between 1978 and 1992 as operational and qualifying service. Service regarded as operational service provides eligibility for disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits and the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof is used to determine pension claims. Operational service is overseas service within defined areas and dates in a time of war or during warlike or non-warlike operations. Operational service also grants veteran status under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. Qualifying service provides eligibility for service pension and associated benefits. Post Second World War qualifying service generally requires the person to have been allotted for duty and have served in an operational area listed in schedule 2 of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act or to have rendered warlike service.
Persons with Defence service will generally have the same access to disability and war widow and war widower pensions, treatment and other benefits as those with operational service, except that pension claims will be subject to the civil standard of proof. On that basis a pension will only be granted if the Repatriation Commission, in deciding the claim, is able do so to its reasonable satisfaction. Persons with operational service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act are also eligible for subsidised home loan advances under the Defence Service Homes Act.
Relevant submarine special operations service between 1978 and 1992 currently attracts dual eligibility under both the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act as Defence service. As such, under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act claims for pension relating to this service are currently determined on the civil standard of proof and not the more generous reverse criminal standard of proof. All persons who served on the relevant submarine special operations were awarded, or were eligible to be awarded, the Australian Service Medal with Clasp SPECIALOPS.
As a consequence of the inclusion of the certain submarine special operations as operational and qualifying service under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act there is a need for consequential amendments to both the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Defence Service Homes Act. Eligibility under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will be retained for claims made before the commencement of the amendments in this schedule; that is, claims made under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act before 1 July 2010.
Eligibility under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will cease for new claims relating to the relevant submarine special operations on and from the commencement of the amendments to this schedule, 1 July 2010. This means that any compensation payable under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act prior to the commencement of this schedule, including claims lodged before the commencement of this schedule and determined after the commencement of this schedule, will continue to be payable and may be offset against any subsequent disability pension payable under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. The Defence Service Homes Act will be amended to provide eligibility under that act for members with the relevant submarine special operations service.
Then there are the changes for those who served in Ubon in Thailand from 31 May 1962 to 27 July 1962 inclusive, which is to be re-classified as ‘qualifying service’ due to the potential risk from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements. The reclassification of this service to qualifying service will provide members with eligibility for service pensions and associated benefits. Service in Ubon in Thailand from 31 May 1962 to 27 July 1962 will retain its current operational service status.
It should be noted that the qualifying service reclassification is limited to service in Ubon and does not extend to service in other parts of north-east Thailand during that period, as the circumstances justifying the reclassification applied only to those serving in Ubon at that time. Service in other parts of north-east Thailand during this period will remain operational service. Some of these areas of service have been the subject of much discussion over the years and I am pleased to see they have now been recognised.
Domicile legislation is also to be altered by this legislation. Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, British, Commonwealth and allied veterans may be eligible for pensions and other benefits, if they have eligible service with a Commonwealth or allied defence force and if they had Australian domicile immediately prior to their enlistment in that defence force. This policy was intended to cover those Australians who were travelling or studying overseas at the time World War II broke out and who could not return to Australia to enlist in the Australian Defence Force.
In the absence of the legal concept of Australian citizenship until 1949, the domicile concept was adopted as a means of determining whether a British, Commonwealth and allied veteran could be regarded as an Australian at the time of enlistment. However, persons under 21 at the time of their enlistment in a Commonwealth or allied defence force could not establish a domicile of choice—independent domicile—as the common-law rules that applied at that time meant that a person could not assume a domicile of choice before the age of 21. Until the age of 21, a person’s domicile would have been dependent on the domicile of the father, or if the father was deceased, the domicile of the mother. The Domicile Act 1982 has since lowered the age at which a person can claim independent domicile from 21 to 18 years of age.
However, this act does not apply to circumstances that occurred before the commencement of the act and thus the common-law rules continue to apply in those circumstances. This will enable those veterans who were between 18 and 20 and unable to nominate Australia as their domicile of choice to gain eligibility under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act for their service in a British, Commonwealth or allied defence force, as Australian veterans, providing they meet the other domicile and service eligibility requirements.
Finally, the amendments made by schedule 5 will cease eligibility for war widow or war widower pensions for widows and widowers who enter into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow or war widower pension. It will also cease eligibility for a widow or widower who is in a de facto relationship at the time of the veteran or member’s death and who would otherwise have been automatically granted war widow or war widower pension.
Under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, a war widow or war widower pension is payable to compensate the widow or widower of a veteran or member of the Defence Force who has died as a result of war service or defence service. Under the current provisions, a widow or widower remains eligible for a war widow or war widower pension even if the widow or widower enters into a de facto relationship prior to claiming the war widow or war widower pension.

",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—This bill implements Labor’s 2007 election commitment to reconsider the unimplemented recommendations of the Clarke review of veterans’ entitlements. The review was, of course, conducted by the Hon. John Clarke QC and was completed in 2003. I note that in 2004, the previous coalition government responded with a package of $236 million over five years.
In Labor’s plan for veterans affairs in the Kevin 07 election the Labor Party promised:
A Rudd Labor Government will give further consideration to recommendations of the Clarke Review of Veterans’ Entitlements that were not acted upon by the Howard Government.
They said:
This process will also give early priority to recommendations relating to those Australian participants in the British Commonwealth Occupational Force in Japan—
BCOF—
and Defence participants in the atomic tests in Australia.
I do confess a conflict of interest: my uncle was part of the BCOF in Japan and would later volunteer and fight with the 3rd Battalion in Korea in 1951.
On 9 September 2008, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs issued a great press release: ‘Government kicks off Clarke Review—nuclear veterans and BCOF a priority.’ Submissions from veterans about unimplemented recommendations were due by 1 December 2008. The recommendations were delivered to Minister Griffin in February 2009. And then we waited. We waited some 30 months from the election of the government, and 15 months from the time the report was delivered, for any action at all on the recommendations.
And now we see in the budget, $36 million. The previous government spent $236 million. So another 15 per cent—$36 million—was certainly welcome over four years to implement the re-reviewed recommendations.
The Rudd Labor government noted that three had already been accepted and acted upon; four have been accepted and are the basis of this bill; four deferred for further consideration; 22 referred to the review of military compensation arrangements; and 12 rejected for a second time. Noting my declared conflict of interest, I am somewhat amazed that recommendations relating to BCOF veterans have been further delayed.
The government has stated it proposes to defer its response to these recommendations to allow further examination and discussion within the government and with the defence Nature of Service Review team. There appears to be no time line for the completion of this re-review of the re-review of the review, which is interesting because the minister’s press release was titled ‘Government kicks off Clarke review: nuclear veterans and BCOF a priority’. But apparently there is no time line for this ‘priority’; it just seems to have disappeared into the ether.
There is lots of noise from the government about correcting the service of BCOF veterans under the re-review of the re-review of the re-review of the review. But, again, nothing happened—30 months and there is still nothing for the 2,700 aged BCOF aged veterans, including my uncle, who has since died, and their families. And no-one is any the wiser about the commitment Labor made to them at the last election. I can only surmise that when the minister said ‘Government kicks off Clarke review’ and ‘BCOF a priority’ that a ‘priority’ would not end up as a re-review of a re-review of a review. I can only assume that is another broken promise—I have to say that list must be exceptionally long by now.
In terms of the substance of the bill, it deals with within the four accepted recommendations in five schedules, and there is one new issue there that was not part of the Clarke review. Schedule 1 deals with recommendation 45 of the Clarke review. The Australian government will reclassify the service of British nuclear test defence service veterans to an equivalent ‘hazardous, non-warlike’ status—costing $24.3 million over four years. Eligible ex-defence personnel will be able to access disability pensions, war widow pensions and, where applicable, a gold card. Of course, where I say ‘war widow’ I also refer to ‘war widowers’. Eligible ex-defence personnel will be able to access those benefits. In 2006, the previous coalition government extended coverage of the white card to all ex-defence and civilian personnel who were involved in the tests. White card coverage will remain for civilian personnel who are not ex-defence personnel. Under changes to the VEA Act, a new classification of service would be entered into the act.
Schedule 2 looks at the issue of submarine special operations—recommendation 31 of the Clarke review. The Australian government intends to reclassify the service of submarine special operations undertaken between 1 January 1978 and 31 December 1992 as ‘qualifying’ and ‘operational’ service. Considering that this service was on board the British Oberon class of submarines, I have absolutely and utterly no problem with this recommendation and where the government is going. I have not been or served on board an Oberon class submarine. I have been on board the Collins class submarine. But I know, from talking to my colleagues who served on the Oberon class, that it was like living completely wrapped in smelly, diesel-covered oily rags. I think anything we can provide for those men that served long periods in quite dangerous occupations in that sort of unknown environment is well and truly deserved. This change will entitle eligible people access to an asset- and means-tested service pension at age 60, to the disability pension, to the war widow pension and to the gold card at age 70. The Naval Association of Australia strongly supports the extended classification, as do I.
Schedule 3 looks at service in Thailand. The Australian government will reclassify certain service between 31 May 1962 and 27 July 1962 in Ubon in north-east Thailand as ‘qualifying service’. Again, this will entitle eligible veterans access to service pensions at age 60 and the gold card at age 70, on top of existing entitlement to disability pensions, and will entitle eligible widows to war widow pensions. This is not in response to the Clarke review. Yet a quick note of the history I think explains where the government has gone, and again I think it is a relatively good move. Throughout the 1960s, Australian service personnel were stationed throughout South-East Asia—in fact, some of them were stationed there from 1948, when the Malayan Emergency began, in which I think 36 Australian servicemen lost their lives. Australians were involved in confrontation in Malaysia. After 1965, of course, personnel were involved in the Vietnam War, specifically with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam and then other forces that went there. On a quick side note, my first exposure to the Training Team Vietnam was through our school sergeant Jim Geedrick, a great Australian who fought at a very young age in World War II, fought in the Malayan Emergency, fought in the Korean confrontation and then fought with the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. He was a tremendous man, a great Australian and a great asset to my school, Rockhampton Grammar School.
In May 1962, 79 Squadron from the RAAF, the Royal Australian Air Force, was despatched to north-east Thailand to protect the territorial integrity of Thailand. At the time, suffice it to say there were few facilities at Ubon. It was pretty rugged. It was very, very tough going for two months before something more permanent began to be constructed. I have lived in some fairly tough, disgusting places in the north of Australia and other countries on operations. The situation in 1962 I think took tough to a whole new level. So, for the government to reclassify ‘potential risk from the activities of hostile forces and dissident elements’, considering the circumstances they were living in, is appropriate and just.
Moving on to schedule 4, which relates to recommendation 60 of the Clarke review, the Australian government will correct an anomaly in the VEA Act to enable certain British Commonwealth and allied veterans who were aged between 18 and 21 at the time of enlistment in a Commonwealth or allied defence force to access the Australian repatriation system. Under the VEA Act, British, Commonwealth and allied veterans may be eligible for pensions and other benefits if they have eligible service with a Commonwealth or allied defence force and if they had Australian domicile immediately prior to their enlistment in that defence force. Again, that makes a fair degree of sense to me.
Finally, schedule 5 deals with war widows entering into a de facto relationship. In line with recommendation 54 of the Clarke review, the Australian government will remove an entitlement from war widows who claim a war widow pension after entering a marriage-like—that is, a de facto—relationship. Consequently, the government will require eligible war widows to claim a war widow pension before they enter a new relationship in order to qualify for their pension. I note that, under current legislation, a war widow who applies for a war widow pension after marrying or remarrying is not entitled to that pension. However, a war widow who enters a marriage-like relationship could still apply for a war widow pension. There was a difference between de facto and married. I note the government is proposing a change. It is not retrospective, but it does make assumptions on the way people live. The government is looking to save $1.4 million over four years, which in effect denies about 10 new applicants per year.
I think it is instructive to again look at history. In 1984, the Hawke government put back pensions to married or remarried war widows who, until then, had lost their pension upon remarriage. Again, this was a prospective, not retrospective, change. In 2001, the previous coalition government broadened the 1984 change to include any married or remarried war widow who lost their pension as a result of their marriage or remarriage after applying for and being granted a pension.
Justice Clarke recommended, inter alia, that no change to the present arrangements be made, including the broadening of the base of the war widow pension to people who had applied after marriage. The war widow pension is a compensation payment and is not means tested. I think it is paid at a rate of $703.90 a fortnight, and some eligible war widows may indeed receive an income support supplement. I note this change has the support of the veteran and ex-service community, including the War Widows Guild of Australia and Legacy. However, my view is that a war widow is still a war widow. Regardless of whether she remarries or moves into a de facto relationship, they have lost their partner—their husband and, in some cases, their wife—in combat operations overseas. I cannot imagine the horror and the pain of losing my wife or of someone losing their partner, but to lose them in the defence of the nation or in the national interest overseas in combat operations, in such difficult environments, is a whole new world of horror.
There is an incredibly brave Australian in my electorate, Nicole Pearce. She is the war widow of David ‘Poppy’ Pearce who died in combat operations in Afghanistan, fighting for all that we believe in and our way of life. I have recently got back from 10 days in the Middle East operations, including five days in Kandahar and in Tarin Kowt. In the middle of the base is an Australian memorial, to the young Australian—in this case—men who have paid the ultimate price, who have died on combat operations serving their nation. David ‘Poppy’ Pearce’s name is there. I took a photograph of the memorial and a close-up of his name, of his plaque, and sent it to Nicole. I gave her a call, because she is in my electorate, and she said, ‘You know what: today would have been our 15th wedding anniversary.’ You cannot imagine the horror. A war widow is a war widow—and we should never lose sight of that.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to speak in support of the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010. The Rudd government is committed to supporting our veterans and their families. The budget handed down this year has a suite of new initiatives totalling $246.4 million. This includes greater access to compensation, income support, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions for members of the veteran community, decisive action with respect to the recommendations of Justice John Clarke in what is known as the Clarke review, and better access to health care and compensation for F111 workers, particularly those who worked on F111s at RAAF Base Amberley in the electorate of Blair. I have been a strong advocate of our actions on the Clarke review and of acting on what I would describe as the Bevis parliamentary recommendations, which recommended more justice and fairness for those in the military who worked on F111s, particularly in refuelling and the deseal-reseal operations at RAAF Base Amberley.
The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is probably heartily sick and tired of my speaking to him on this issue. Every time he looks at me he initiates the conversation before I mention it to him. But I am pleased with the budgetary measures we have undertaken on both of these issues. Certainly, 2,400 extra people will receive justice in the deseal-reseal operations that took place at RAAF Base Amberley. These include the ‘pick and patch’ workers, at a cost of $39.6 million. The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs said on budget night that more people will be eligible for care and compensation now, including those who carried out F111 fuel tank maintenance involving fuel tank entry. He announced a $55 million package of health care and compensation to those in need and the reopening of the SHOAMP healthcare scheme, which was closed on 20 September 2005 at a cost of $12.5 million. This is acting where the previous government failed to act.
I am pleased that Kathleen Henry from the group who advocated for justice on this issue has liaised closely with us. I commend her work and the work of Ian Fraser on this issue. It is not only the people involved in the F111 aircraft fuel tank maintenance operations but also those people who, sadly, in a terrible tragedy of our history participated in or were exposed to radiation as a result of British nuclear testing who will receive a degree of decency, compensation and health care as a result of the budget. British nuclear testing took place in a number of different locations in Australia. On 3 October 1952, the UK tested its first nuclear weapon, named Hurricane, at the Monte Bello Islands off the Western Australian coast. Two major test series were conducted at Maralinga called Operation Buffalo and Operation Antler. The Indigenous people in the area at Maralinga, who considered Maralinga to have very deep spiritual significance to them going back generation after generation, were simply ignored and treated appallingly at the time. This is a terrible period of our history, and it is not as though governments of the day did not know about this.
These people were exposed to radiation which had lifelong impacts upon them. The government’s response is to act on the recommendations of Justice Clarke, who recommended in 2003 in a report that the participation of defence personnel in the British nuclear test program in Australia be deemed non-warlike hazardous. This had implications for the provision of decent health care and compensation for these people. I say 2003: the actual review was the 2003 review of veterans entitlements conducted by Justice Clarke. We were not in power at the time; the coalition government was in power in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and nearly all of 2007. It is a terrible shame that the recommendations of Justice Clarke were not acted upon by the coalition government. We appreciate that now there is a bipartisan approach on this issue. We appreciate that from those opposite. But those opposite have failed dismally when it comes to the recommendations of Justice Clarke.
After I was elected to this place in November 2007 a fellow came to see me, a constituent of mine, Merv Kleidon, who lives in Ipswich at a place known as One Mile. It is a nice place with a great community centre, and there is a great Baptist church in the Leichhardt-One Mile area.
My uncle Merv Neumann is actually the president of the Leichhardt-One Mile Community Centre and secretary of the Leichhardt Baptist church.
Merv Kleidon is a well-known figure in the Leichhardt-One Mile area. He came to see me because he was concerned about this issue. I pointed out to him that there were about 470 submissions made in relation to the Clarke review when the government was considering this issue. I said, ‘Tell me, Merv, why are you interested in this topic?’ He said, ‘Well, Shayne, I’ve got a gold card. I got one for my service in Malaya in 1959 to 1961. I worked in the RAAF. I was an engine fitter and I was based at the RAAF base at Amberley in Ipswich,’ now in the electorate of Blair. He said, ‘I worked on the Lincoln aircraft. Me and my mates worked on them.’ I said, ‘Tell me about this.’ So Merv proceeded on this occasion, and on numerous occasions subsequently when he popped into my office to have a chat with me, to say that so many of his friends had died from radiation sickness and poisoning. He said, ‘We worked on these aircraft which were monitoring the clouds that came across as a result of the nuclear tests.’ He said he had been advocating for quite some time for justice, but he told me that the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association had contacted him about it. He said that the Australians who are involved in this association had contacted him and asked him to get involved. So he is actually on the editorial committee that publishes a magazine that deals with issues concerning nuclear veterans. He told me about the stories of his friends and what they put up with.
Merv went to places like Alice Springs and Toowoomba to advocate for the cause. He said, ‘We were treated shabbily. They knew and we weren’t told. We were exposed to this stuff and the authorities knew about it. We would go into the planes afterwards, the gunnery areas and where the pilots were, and they would have great packs of chocolate and nuts and food and we would eat these rations. We weren’t told that they were exposed to radioactive material, we weren’t told that we were damaging our health, but we were effectively fodder. We were misled deliberately and mistreated.’ So he and his mates and their families suffered accordingly.
Merv is obviously still alive and still advocating for the causes in which he believes. He claims that the British knew all about and he said, ‘We knew that they knew all about it later on.’ He felt the Australian government knew about it at the time but did little about it. Artie Fadden, who had been Prime Minister for a while, supposedly said to the British, ‘What’s going on about these clouds that are coming across the country?’ And the previous coalition government knew about it as well.
Merv’s response when I had a chat with him today about this issue was, ‘Good one, Shayne. You have done what you said you would do.’ Merv has got a gold card from his overseas service in South-East Asia, but he said it is long overdue recognition of what went on. He said that many people have been affected. I will never forget Merv coming into my office, with tears in his eyes, telling me about his mates. I want to commend Merv and all those like him who fought for justice for so long, who travelled around everywhere, who wrote articles, who advocated, who agitated, who annoyed politicians on both sides of the political divide. He said he was exposed not just for a couple of days but for a considerable period of time.
We treat and have treated our men and women who have served in the military pretty shamefully at times and we have adopted the views and we have followed slavishly at times the advice and the actions of our great and powerful friends. But sometimes our friends deserve to be told that they got it wrong. Sometimes we need to stand up more strongly for the Australian public, the Australian veteran community and the Australian military who serve on our behalf.
I thank Merv for his advocacy and I thank him for the many times he popped into my office. It is never a short conversation with Merv; he likes to let you know what he thinks. I want to thank him very much and I want to pay tribute to Merv and all those like him for what they have done in this regard.
I see the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs here. He will have nothing to talk to me about after the Clarke review and after the Bevis review. But I am pleased we have acted on those things, because he has honoured what he said he would do. This has not been an easy process, but it is a just decision. We will see legislation amended to ensure that the declaration of non-warlike hazardous service can in fact be extended to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. We have given action to the recommendation of Justice Clarke and it means veterans and their widows and widowers can get access to the kind of health care and assistance that they so deserve. This is the closure of a sad chapter in the military service of our country by so many people.
Other aspects of this legislation deal with the reclassification of certain submarine special operations as qualifying service, the reclassification of service in Ubon in Thailand as qualifying service, the lowering of the age of domicile of choice from 21 years to 18 years for the purpose of the VEA Act and the cessation of eligibility for war widow or widower pensions for widows and widowers who enter into de facto relationships prior to claiming the same.
Many of these things are the recommendations of Justice Clarke. I am sure that many people across the country will be pleased today with this legislation. It will help a lot of people. It will help honour their memories, particularly in relation to the British nuclear testing service. This change will potentially help up to 2,700 former defence personnel. This is a good day where we correct a terrible injustice that was perpetrated and perpetuated on Australian military personnel and their families for a very long time.",REPS,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2010 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—in reply—I will concentrate my comments on a number of issues that have been raised in the debate on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and address some of the concerns that have been raised. Some of the issues include not only the legislation but also, in a wider sense, the government’s conduct in veterans affairs over the last couple of years. I think some of these points need to be addressed. I will go back in time a bit, because much of what we are dealing with in this legislation is about going back in time and dealing with issues which were outstanding over many years.
I make the point that the government, when in opposition, came forward with a very comprehensive plan for veterans affairs. It has been mentioned by some of the speakers and I have a copy with me today. The funny thing about it, though, is that a number of people who have brandished the document or have endeavoured to quote from the document have, frankly, just quoted selectively. They have not gone to the details. They have picked headings out. They have used quotes such as, ‘The government promised to restore the value of compensation and entitlements.’ And, yes, we did. We then listed a series of specific commitments that we would act on, which we have overwhelmingly done.
Some people have sought to expand upon that far beyond what the government ever said, far beyond what the government ever suggested. In that way, they try and say on the basis of a heading or one line, ‘That means that the government meant (a), (b), (c).’ Well, it did not. We laid it right out there. That is why there was a document this big—some 28 pages—with details and specific commitments. What we heard from the ex-service community was that they were sick of being lied to, they were sick of being led down a path and they were concerned that matters were not getting addressed and had been outstanding for more than a decade.
In fact, when we look at the Clarke review, some of the issues that it raised are dealt with in this legislation. The Clarke review was the result of, under the previous government, massive concern within the veteran and ex-service community about the government’s lack of action around a whole range of issues. That is why the Clarke review was established. It was a commitment by the previous government earlier this century to look at what they had not addressed in the last part of the last century. It was about going to an all-encompassing inquiry which produced a range of different issues.
The government of the day subsequently responded to that, but, as has been said, many recommendations were not accepted and that was the nature of the commitment that was made by the government. We made the commitment to review those recommendations, not to accept them all, not to implement them all but to review them and to see what could be done about those recommendations that were worthy of action and those recommendations that were worthy of support.
We stipulated in our election commitment—in fact, it was in our platform—two particular recommendations that had received a good deal of public interest and a good deal of concern. We made sure that the debate internally around those issues was considered carefully and we looked to the question of what should be done with those particular issues. On this occasion and in this response one of those key issues—British nuclear test participants—has been addressed.
What is funny about it is speakers from the opposition saying ‘this has taken too long’, ‘it hasn’t gone far enough’, ‘some of these recommendations shouldn’t have been acted upon’ or whatever—take your pick. But let us remember what this means. This is an opposition complaining about the fact that this government is taking too long to address issues that they refused to address when in office. These recommendations were rejected by the previous government. It is great to see speakers like the member for Fadden and the member for Greenway standing up and endorsing, to a large extent, what is in the legislation and saying these are positive moves forward, even though the member for Greenway is a member of the party that rejected those recommendations—not so much the member for Fadden, seeing as he is a new member. I agree with him that action is long overdue in relation to submarine service, but, frankly, it was reviewed by the Howard government and it was rejected. I agree that action is long overdue on the question of Clarke’s recommendation about British nuclear test participants, but, frankly, the previous government refused to go any further than they did with their response in 2006, which provided white card coverage for cancer treatment.
Every single dollar under this legislation is a dollar that goes to members of the veterans community. It is money that they did not get, would not have got and were refused by the previous government. So it is funny to have the opposition stand in here today and talk about how long it has taken. It took them a long time to consider the issues in the first place, but then they were very clear: the answer was no. I am very proud of being part of a government where today the answer is yes on some of these issues. I am very proud to be part of a government that is moving forward in dealing with some of those outstanding concerns.
There are other issues that have been raised today which again I would like to comment on and which I think also tell part of that story. The member for Blair made much of the F111 deseal-reseal program, and I know in comments if not today then certainly in the appropriations debate that the shadow minister, the member for Greenway, raised issues in relation to that. The member for Blair made the point that this was a positive $55 million commitment in the forward estimates to deal with issues around the deseal-reseal program—that it expanded significantly the number of people who were covered and gave people access to opportunities to receive compensation and health care for conditions they had developed. The shadow minister said of the F111 Deseal-Reseal Support Group:
They feel incredibly let down by the response to the review.
Maybe she should go back and check with them now, because I met with them in Brisbane subsequent to the budget announcement to discuss the issues around the response and what it means for the people that they have concerns about—and it is fair to say that there are concerns that remain. But one of the key people in that group, who has had a long involvement in this issue, Kathleen Henry, said in an open meeting, ‘I think you’ve got this 90 per cent right.’
I will tell you what else: this was the result of a parliamentary inquiry conducted under the chairmanship of the member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis. It was a parliamentary inquiry that was a commitment I made as the shadow minister, in opposition, out at Amberley at a meeting of the deseal-reseal support group. I remember it very clearly because at the time I was not sure what the answer was, I was not sure what needed to be done here, but I was concerned about the level and degree of concern being expressed by those people about their circumstances. I could not commit, and it would not have been sensible to commit, to firm action at that time in terms of a monetary sum or a system, but I committed to having the parliamentary inquiry. ‘Let’s have a look at it,’ I said, and that is what they wanted us to do.
The next speaker after me that day was the then minister, the member for Dunkley. I have a lot of time for the member for Dunkley and, as I have said on the public record, I think he was a good Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. In his time as minister I think he addressed some issues where action was long overdue on a number of fronts. But on this one he dropped the ball, because he was asked for the same commitment that day and he refused to give it. We have the shadow minister complaining about a response to an inquiry that, when they were in government, they refused to have. They refused to conduct it; they refused to allow it.
As I said, there is some $55 million, according to estimates from the department, in health care and compensatory support, potentially going to up to another 2,700 or so members who were actively involved in the deseal-reseal area, and every single dollar of that exceeds the requirement and the allowance of the previous government in terms of what they were prepared to do. The opposition are saying: ‘Oh, it took too long,’ and, ‘Oh, it doesn’t go far enough.’ Well, it goes a bloody sight further than what the previous government did over a decade. I might add that the general response within the ex-service community on that issue, on most occasions—certainly from those who have actually read it—has been positive.
The shadow minister also mentioned the review of ESO advocacy and welfare services, commonly known as the BEST review. It has been put, as I understand it, that this has been sitting on my desk. It started sitting on my desk today—today; not a month ago, not six months ago. I received it today, and what I received is what we said and what I have said publicly it would be: a key issues paper for circulation. I have made that very clear to the ex-service community.
There are concerns about this review and there is good reason to be concerned, because it is a complex area. It is a complex area in terms of providing support where the ex-service organisations need it and where the people that they service need it. It is a complex area in which to make sure things are done properly, transparently and fairly. There have been issues, and the ESOs know that. It is one of the reasons why, despite their concerns about what the result might be, they have overwhelmingly supported the review. It has been embraced because people know there are issues that need to be looked at. I might add that there were probably more issues under the previous government, the reason being that there was less funding provided in their forward estimates for this program compared to what we have provided. So, if there are problems now, goodness knows what the problems would have been if the previous government had been returned. We are going to work through the issues in that review because it is important, but we are going to work through them with the ex-service community to ensure that we get a good outcome to deal with some of the issues in the future.
My understanding is that it was also said, if not in the appropriations debate then today, that there were concerns about the MRCA review. I think it was said that I verballed the opposition so they would not support it. No. What I said was: when they were in government and they established the system in terms of the MRC Act, it was said by all and sundry, frankly, that there ought to be a review of it once it had been in operation for several years. I said that when we committed to that in opposition the then government did not.
This is another example of today’s opposition all of a sudden on the road to Damascus having an epiphany and deciding that they will now support something. It was not that long ago that they were in government and had an opportunity to deal with these issues but did not. It was not that long ago that they just sat on their hands.
Concerns have been raised about the pharmaceutical costs review—it is long-awaited but still has not quite been delivered. Many ex-service organisations regularly raised the very important issue of the cost of medications to deal with war caused disabilities. The commitment from the opposition at that time—the Labor Party—was to review that area to achieve a fair outcome for those who have war caused disabilities. It was always made very clear that this commitment would be acted on very late in the term, and the bottom line is that is what is happening. Once again this issue was raised repeatedly with the then government and they refused to take any action. Again this government is being criticised by the opposition for taking too long to consider an issue that they refused to consider. Frankly, it smacks of hypocrisy.
There has been quite a bit of debate on military superannuation matters, which are also relevant to this. There was some debate yesterday on the legislation relating to the governance of superannuation schemes in the government sector. It has been suggested by members of the opposition that I made commitments prior to the last election to remove the confusion and ensure there was certainty.
Once again they were sitting on a report—they had information and they would not release it. Once again they had the ability to ensure people understood what was being considered, but they refused to do anything about it. It has been suggested that it has taken too long to consider Clarke. Yet they sat on that review for three months. They sat on that review for only three months because the election was called. I suspect that, if we had had another 12 months to wait, they would have sat on it for another 12 months because there was absolutely no sign of it coming out before the election.
We have the opposition intimating they may take action around issues like indexation in the longer term when they are back in government and when the budget is in surplus, yet they were in government for over a decade and overwhelmingly in that time the budget was in surplus and they did not do it. In fact, the opposition sat on the report. When we released that report, it was roundly turned on by the ex-service and defence community as being not the way they thought the government should be going. The Rudd government publicly released a report produced under the previous government, as we committed to do. Having released it, we sought to have it discussed and commented on. We had a process for that. The response from that process was, ‘We don’t want this,’ and we have been looking at the issue since.
I am happy to admit that it is taking a long time and it is taking too long. I am hoping to make some announcements in the next few weeks about where we will go with that issue. I think the opposition need to make clear whether they are supporting the Podger recommendations, the recommendations that were taken out of a review conducted under their stewardship. Are they saying they think that should be the military superannuation scheme for this country?
The opposition also should have a think about what they are doing with the superannuation governance bills that are heading towards the Senate. The improvements and efficiencies that will be made by that new system will mean real dollars in the hands of military superannuants in the years to come, as they retire. Depending on the circumstances of the individual—their rank and their length of service—the lump sum under the MSBS that they will receive towards the end of their career will be between an additional $20,000 and $50,000. When this parliament has the opportunity to provide people with those sorts of benefits I do not think we should be playing politics with issues of symbolism—and that is what it is. I think that, when serving personnel on the bases around this country understand what the implications of the action being taken by the opposition are for their final payments, they are not going to be real happy. I do not think they are going to think that is a good or fair way to go.
On the question of British nuclear test participants—one of the key issues covered by this bill—I want to put on the public record that we are talking about compensation, pensions et cetera being in the region of $24 million over the next four years. I also need to put on the record what that means in the longer term. We estimate on the basis of the age profiles of the people involved and their expected longevity that, although it is $24 million over the first four years, it will be some $71 million over the first 10 years. Beyond that, over 20 years, it will be in the region of $135 million. There is significant compensatory support to be paid out over time, as is the system under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act.
I commend the bill to the House. I urge the opposition to concentrate on criticising what we actually have done rather than what they say we promised to do when we never, ever did so.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to speak on the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010. This bill is designed to align legislative arrangements relating to child care, particularly those relating to payments. Firstly, the bill aligns child support pay income estimate periods with financial years rather than child support years. Essentially, this changes the period over which income estimates are reconciled from 15 months to a financial year. This will ensure greater accuracy and efficiency as it is a simpler process to assess taxable income at the end of the financial year. This will also reduce delays in the automated reconciliation process.
Secondly, the bill will align care determinations under both the family assistance law and child support legislation. This amendment will allow parents or carers who are recipients of family tax benefit and who are paying or receiving child support to have the same care determinations made for a child in the case of a child having multiple carers.
Thirdly, this bill also allows for payments of family tax benefit to recipients who have not lodged their tax returns in the hope of having a lower accessible income to be cancelled. This will allow parents or carers who are entitled to FTB and also child support payers or payees to have the same care determinations made for a child where the care of the child involves more than one carer. This payment will be based on their adjusted taxable income.
The coalition has a proud history of child support policy. It was the former coalition government that established the Family Law Hotline to enable Australians to access information and advice about family law and child support issues. It funded a child support strategy that was aimed at improving post-separation relationships and encouraging parents to maintain contact with their children, which, evidence shows, will increase the likelihood of child support liabilities being met. It let payers with second families claim 100 per cent of child support paid as a deduction from the household income used for determining family tax benefit and the childcare benefit entitlements and increased the family tax benefit income test deduction for child support paid by non-resident parents with a subsequent family.
It was also the former coalition government that offered unemployed parents who had a child support responsibility access to community based parenting and relationship support services. When relationships break down and children are involved and where parents cannot agree on what support should be provided, our child support system plays an important part in ensuring that appropriate support is provided. If the government were serious about helping families and resolving disputes quickly and amicably, they would not have cut $50 million from family relationships centres and marriage counselling services in this year’s budget.
But Labor did just that. Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, has demonstrated that the government is genuinely disinterested in families when it comes to ensuring smooth and efficient dispute resolution. For example, the government has decided not to replace four judges in the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court, placing unnecessary pressure on the judiciary, meaning that family law matters will now take even longer to get to court, let alone to be resolved.
The decision to cut almost $50 million from the Family Relationships Support Program is one to be deplored. In the budget papers the Treasurer announced a $4.5 million slashing of funding to marriage counselling in Australia. What was not in the budget papers, but was revealed in the next 24 to 48 hours, was a further slashing of $43.9 million to the family relationships centres. As my colleague here at the table will recall, these family relationships centres were established by the previous government—
—And very important too.
—and were very important centres. I think there were about 65 of them throughout Australia, set up with the intent of providing a place where families having disputes and problems or issues with their relationship could go to a one-stop shop for assistance. They could obtain advice, information and assistance in relation to those disputes with a hope that reconciliation of the difficulties might be achieved and, where reconciliation could not be achieved, to at least conciliate rather than litigate the outcome of those difficulties.
The problem with this sneaky decision—sneaky because it was not announced on the budget night and was not in the budget papers but we found out afterwards—to slash $43 million from family relationships centres is that the very centres, the very organisations, the likes of Relationships Australia in the various states, and Centacare and Anglicare and other similar agencies around Australia, charitable and voluntary agencies that are providing excellent services to Australian families, will have less funding to provide those valuable and important services to Australian families right throughout Australia. As I said, it is something to be deplored and condemned and it is hard to understand why a government that routinely has used the phrase ‘working families’ in its rhetoric would actually pull funding out from the very services that provide support for families right around this nation. There has been no explanation as to why that has been done. As I said, it is regrettable in the circumstances.
The coalition support legislation that makes the interface of citizens and government departments and agencies simpler. We support aligning legislation in the areas of child support and family assistance to make life easier for parents and carers. Because of that, we will be supporting this bill.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—Family bonds are the link to our own being and, as a guide to our future, we rely on families a lot. As I have said in this place many times in a range of different debates, there is also no doubt about the cost of raising a family—and having three kids myself, and now four grandkids, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it does not stop when they leave school or university. I guess that is one of the things that comes with parenting. There is a commitment to children because that is what we do, that is innate in us as parents. Without trying to put too fine a point on it, there are very real costs in raising children, with cost pressures associated with a range of different things, from school, to sport, to everything else.
Unfortunately, an inescapable fact of life—and this statistic is extraordinary—is that for every, I think, 2.3 or 2.4 marriages or unions there is one separation. That has a real impact not only on the social and emotional wellbeing of the family but also on the financial aspects of raising children. Having been married now, as of last May—I have got this figure right—for 34 years—
 (Hon. Peter Slipper)—Congratulations.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I could give you the date too, but I won’t! My youngest son has been through a separation and I know the impact that has had emotionally on both sides and I know the effect on my granddaughter. It is something that involves the whole family and it is inescapable that people are going to look internally and externally for reasons. But, at the end of the day, we need to provide for the child. That is what this legislation we are debating is about—putting the child front and centre in all this. It is about encouraging parents to settle their disputes, to make sure that first, second and third in their thinking is the proper raising of their child. That is what we are attempting to do. We are not trying to say that we are removing the emotional and financial stresses. We are trying to put a better balance in place that will at least allow the parties to address the real issue at stake, and that is providing support for the child.
It is not uncommon for each of us as members of parliament to hear some very tragic stories when people come to our offices. Many of them are pretty emotional when they see us. We are the last port of call. In my electorate of Werriwa alone there are 11,000 kids on child support. We have to be pretty positive that we are making sure those kids in my electorate, and kids in the same situation in everybody else’s electorates, are given the best opportunity so that they are not scrounging and will not be apologetic for life about coming from a separated family. We have to make sure that they are able to participate and feel included in a normal life as a child. This is what we are trying to do. As I said, parents have to learn to sort out their problems as maturely as they can, and I know that it is often somewhat difficult. But we must focus our arguments and our attention on what we deliver for these young people who are going to go on to become the Australians leading this country in the future. Responsibility does not just start and stop with the parents. We need to focus their attention on the cost factors associated with the child and we want to make sure that they are reasonably met.
The bill before us, the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010, will do a couple of things. Firstly, it will introduce amendments making rules easier for separated families by implementing the 2009 budget measure aligning care determinations between family assistance and child support. The Child Support Scheme aims to ensure that children receive the appropriate level of child support from their parents. Conversely, to assist with the costs of raising children, many parents receive family tax benefit. Under the current arrangements, the Family Assistance Office and the Child Support Agency use different rules to determine the care levels for child support and family assistance, and this creates inconsistencies and unnecessary duplication of processes and decision making between both agencies.
Under the current rules, where there is no alignment, parents may not receive their correct assessments unless they separately notify each agency. Unquestionably, this can put additional strain on separated parents who have to deal with two agencies and two different sets of rules. As a consequence, there can be numerous elements of inconsistency. To address this, the bill makes amendments to provide for a single determination of care for both child support and family tax benefit purposes. Aligning the determinations of care will provide consistency in decisions about the level of care being provided by separated parents who have to deal with both agencies. Another advantage expected is that this will reduce objections and appeals flowing from the separate determinations in the two agencies.
To those parents I have had to have discussions with on this, I say that the government is listening, is taking these matters into account and is trying to make it easier for them to balance their arrangements and finances and to do what they need to do in making provisions for their children.
The bill also makes improvements to the process of estimating income for the purposes of child support. To determine their child support obligations, some parents estimate their income. The estimate is reconciled with the actual income earned and various corrections are made to ensure that the correct amount is being paid. Currently, when parents estimate their income to calculate their obligations under the Child Support Scheme, it is for a child support period of 15 months. This period can cross over up to three financial years.
It comes as no surprise that estimating income over multiple financial years can be difficult for parents and often leads to inaccuracies. As a consequence, debts and credits can accrue. Often, reconciliation cannot occur until the parent’s actual income for each financial year is known. We are therefore introducing measures that will help align these child support periods directly with financial years. This measure will make it easier for parents to estimate their income, which will be automatically determined with the filing of your tax return. This will mean that people will not have to wait until the end of their child support period before making adjustments. When you submit your tax return at the end of the year, the estimate will be automatically reconciled and this reconciliation can be taken into account in making any necessary adjustment. I can confirm that these amendments will not affect the length of the child support period, being 15 months, but they will make the adjustment process more practical and will allow it to occur automatically, as I said, with the filing of the income tax return.
Lastly, there is a minor amendment to family assistance provisions. The bill excludes two circumstances from the provisions that prevent family tax benefits being paid if tax returns have not been lodged. This amendment will put in place more flexible arrangements for the 2008-09 budget measures, which have applied since January of this year, 2010, to suspend fortnightly tax benefit payments for recipients who have not lodged tax returns and who have a family tax benefit debt as a consequence of not filing those returns. The budget measure was designed not to punish people but to encourage family tax benefit customers to lodge their tax returns to ensure that they receive accurate payments and, as a consequence, to reduce the incidence of overpayments. It was a measure that was recommended following the 2007 Australian National Audit Office report and one that is made more flexible by this legislation.
I know this suite of amendments will not remedy the issues that arise for young people when relationships tragically break down, but what we are trying to do is to make sure that the loving products of those relationships, the children, have a fair stake in their life ahead. We are trying to encourage parents not to use children as weapons in protracted disputes but rather, in a loving way, to make sure that their children are put first and foremost in a way which provides for their future. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to support the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and I am glad to have the opportunity to address the issues that it raises. The Child Support Scheme, as we know, was first introduced over 20 years ago by the Hawke government. It was implemented to ensure that separated parents share the cost of raising their children, subject to each of their financial capacities to do so. The system was, however, subject to heavy criticism over many years at a variety of different levels. It was subject to confusion, to misunderstanding and, in some cases, to misuse. Many parents felt that the child support formula was unfair and, whilst parents could understand the need for a system that looked after children, they felt that the system in place did not in some cases give them a fair go. For instance, many parents felt that it did not take into account the often large costs that were incurred by the non-custodial parent when the children were under their care.
The 2003 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs entitled Every Picture Tells a Story found that, of the 597,000 families who had a child with a natural parent living elsewhere, 41 per cent  received no child support, 42.3 per cent received cash child support and a further 16.3 per cent received only in-kind child support. In the report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support entitled In the best interests of children—reforming the Child Support Scheme, a number of issues were identified. For instance, the report found that, under the fixed percentages that were paid in child support, it was assumed that people across the income range spent the same proportion of their income on children. However, the research of the task force found that, while the higher the household income the more parents spent on their children in dollar figures, expenditure actually declined as a percentage of their income. The report also found that, in setting the percentages paid in respect of children regardless of their age, the scheme did not adequately reflect the much larger cost of caring for teenagers, which was estimated at two to three times the cost of caring for younger children. The report also found that the system in place at the time did not take into account the issue of parents who had started new families with children and the extra associated costs that those children brought to their lives. These were just a few of the issues raised. There were many more.
In response to the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, the system was subject to a major overhaul between 2006 and 2008 to provide a fairer and more flexible calculation of child support. A key element of the reforms was the development of a new formula to calculate how much child support would be paid by using an income shares method, which calculates and shares the costs of children between the parents according to their share of the combined income. Currently, approximately 1.1 million children are supported through this scheme.
The amendments put forward by the government aim to build on the recent changes already made to the system. Firstly, they allow for the implementation of the 2009 budget measure of aligning care determinations between family assistance from Centrelink and from the Child Support Agency. This will create simpler rules for separated families. Currently, the Family Assistance Office, which covers Centrelink and Medicare, uses rules to determine care levels for child support and family assistance that are different to the rules used by the Child Support Agency, creating inconsistent processes and decision making between the two agencies. Under current arrangements, where the rules between the Family Assistance Office and the Child Support Agency differed, many parents did not receive their correct assessments unless they notified each agency separately.
It would be fair to say that many separated families undergo the strains of tense and acrimonious circumstances. Many members in this place, including me, can attest that very strongly. The fact that parents had to deal with two different sets of rules under the two agencies created additional strain within these families. This need not happen. These amendments will make a single determination of care for both child support and family tax benefit purposes, thus removing the acrimony that can be created by separate decisions. It is expected that it will also reduce the number of objections and appeals that are lodged as a result of the two different determinations from the two agencies. Therefore, it has the added bonus of saving Australian taxpayers money—money that was spent unnecessarily on appeals—through simple clarification of the system.
Secondly, the amendments will correct anomalies that occur where parents estimate their income. Some parents estimate their income, and this estimate is reconciled against their actual income to ensure that the correct amounts have been paid and received. Under the current system, parents can estimate their income for a period of up to 15 months. This period has the potential to cross over into three different financial years. Understandably, where this means that parents have to estimate income over multiple financial years, it can easily lead to inaccuracies in their estimates.
One of the outcomes of these amendments will be to align estimate periods with financial years, thus making it easier for parents to estimate their income. Once their actual income is known, it will allow the Child Support Agency to reconcile the estimate automatically. These amendments do not affect the length of the child support period, which will remain at 15 months. However, they will change the period over which the estimates are reconciled from 15 months to a financial year.
Thirdly, the amendments will put in place more flexible and fairer arrangements where fortnightly payments are ceased for parents who fail to lodge tax returns. Following recommendations in a 2007 Australian National Audit Office report into the reduction of family payment debts, new rules were introduced to encourage family tax benefit recipients to lodge tax returns in order to ensure that they received the correct amount that they were entitled to, thus reducing overpayments. These amendments will retain those arrangements. However, they are also more flexible in that they will allow payments to continue in circumstances where people do not have a family tax benefit debt, or where the cessation of payment would cause hardship.
There will also be the provision to suspend the loss of entitlement of family tax benefit where special circumstances apply. This measure is to target certain vulnerable sections of society, such as those affected by severe illness, domestic violence or bereavement. These measures build on and strengthen the comprehensive changes previously made to the child support system. The amendments make many improvements, particularly in the area of the estimation of family income. We are hoping, in fact we are planning, they will make the system fairer and more flexible.
As other members have said and as I wish to say as well, this system will probably never be perfect for the reason that, with this legislation and this area of public policy, probably more so than in any other area, we are dealing with human nature and intimate family relationships at a level that only those who are in those relationships can understand. It really can be a very difficult and very fraught area of public policy. The intent of these amendments and the intent of the legislation generally is to ensure that children in families where separation does occur are at the centre of the argument, the discussion and the debate, and that their ability to be cared for is uppermost in all of our minds. I know from the experience I have had in my office with some very difficult cases the lengths that people of both genders have gone to in the past to avoid their responsibility or to use the situation to pay back for some relationship issue they have had in the past. Where children are concerned, that cannot be countenanced. Where this legislation is concerned, everything we are doing is to put in place as safe and as secure a system as we can to allow the CSA process to work for the benefit of the children and the families concerned. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—In what may be my final speech in this House, I wish to make a few remarks reflecting on my close to 12 years as a member of this parliament and express my thanks to those who have made my time in this place memorable. In my first speech in November 1998, in a parliament which would see Australia and the world entering a new millennium, I saw my challenge in a quotation by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who on her graduation expressed this thought:
… for too long now, our leaders have used politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practise politics as the art of making what appears impossible, possible.
That is not an easy challenge, you would agree. On the same day as I made my first speech, the newly elected member for Griffith, now our Prime Minister, quoted Keynes’s well-known remark:
The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually the slave of some defunct economist.
The member concluded:
Debate, therefore, about fundamental ideas … about the proper role of the state in the economy and society, is critical to an informed discussion about policy.
So it is with some sadness that, when I reflect on my years as a member of this parliament, I note there has been little achieved in this place in addressing these challenges. Indeed policy—whether it be economic, social or foreign affairs—is increasingly framed within a straightjacket of orthodoxy. Think tanks, academics, editorial writers and radio shock jocks all sing from the one song sheet, all the slaves of some defunct economist. They cast a long shadow over governments and, it seems, this parliament.
When I was first elected to this parliament, I had already been a member of the Australian Labor Party for more than 30 years. I have been described by some journalists as being the outspoken member for Fowler or ‘old Labor’. I wear those comments as a badge of honour. I believe that there are, as the title of the well-known Ben Chifley pamphlet declared, things worth fighting for. I saw my role as carrying on the causes that so many former members had fought so valiantly for.
I am one of the few remaining members who began their political life in what was the Labor Youth Council in the late 1960s. Its leaders then included Paul Keating, Laurie Brereton, Bob Carr and Leo McLeay. While we were on opposite sides of the factional aisle in those days, Leo proved to be a great supporter and friend during my earlier terms, and I thank him. Along with Michael Lee, those people held the soul of New South Wales Labor, and I believe Michael might have proved to be a fine Labor leader in time.
I should also mention Labor’s leader for most of my time here, Kim Beazley. On three occasions I walked proudly with Kim to caucus ballots, and each time he lost. I half expected Kim to ask me not to walk with him anymore, as I must bring him bad luck—so for that, Kim, I apologise. To my mind, Kim Beazley was the greatest Labor leader never to have become Prime Minister.
In my time here, my spirit has not always made me friends on either side of this House, but I believe it has earned me the respect of those who I hold in high regard, especially Senator Steve Hutchins, who has made that very long journey from the Senate to be here today, and that is all that matters to me, Steve.
On issues such as drug addiction—especially drug law reform—unemployment, single parents and refugees, I, like the Member for Kooyong, have not been afraid to take up the cause, even when doing so has not been in line with the popular view. And then there is Palestine. It could be said that foreign affairs matters are not often debated in this House, the Iraq War being one exception and the short debate on my Middle East peace motion in 2002 being another. The nature of that debate explained why that issue is rarely discussed in this parliament. Even the 2006 war on Lebanon did not raise more than a ripple of concern. It seems that our reluctance to participate in real debate about the Middle East has placed a muzzle over the parliament on all foreign affairs issues.
A large part of the work of backbench members is their work on policy committees. I have had the opportunity to serve on a number of committees which have conducted inquiries into issues of great concern to me.
I mention some of the inquiries which influenced me and which I believe have produced reports addressing some of the most important issues facing Australia today. The Joint Standing Committee on Migration report entitled Not the Hilton, which was tabled in 2000, reviewed migration detention centres at that time. The report raised concerns about conditions in migration detention centres and recommended improvements. However, unfortunately, in the wake of the Tampa incident and the so-called ‘Pacific Solution’, it seems that most of the committee’s recommendations were thrown overboard by the Howard government.
My longest committee experience was with the variously named committees on family and community services, and my friend Annette Ellis, the member for Canberra, chairs the current committee. The social policy area has always been my main focus in public life, and this committee conducted a number of inquiries which covered some of the thorniest issues faced in our society. We began in my first term with an inquiry into substance abuse. As the often-described ‘drug capital of Australia’—Cabramatta—was in my electorate, the issue was of vital importance to me. As with later inquiries, there were widely different approaches to the problem of drug abuse as well as a great deal of common ground. Not surprisingly, I found myself contributing a dissenting view on some parts of the final report tabled under the title, Road to recovery.
The next inquiry was into the controversial area of child custody. With the member for Riverina as chair, the inquiry made forthright recommendations on shared parenting and other custody issues which, thanks to the continued advocacy of the chair, have since been included in legislation. Other inquiries included overseas adoption and balancing work and family. Again, in the last inquiry, along with my Labor colleagues, a significant dissenting report was included.
In terms of winning and losing on the many issues confronted, I would have to say that I have lost more than I have won, which has brought some of my friends and some people in the media to award me the portfolio as the ‘minister for lost causes’. Perhaps because of my record, or in spite of it, I was appointed as the first Chair of the Petitions Committee, which was established in this term of the parliament. You could say that I have found my spiritual home, along with my deputy chair, a man of integrity, Russell Broadbent, the member for McMillan. I have certainly found it to be the most rewarding of my many roles in this place. In guiding the committee in its formative years, I have attempted at every opportunity to make the committee a sounding board for the people of Australia in this parliament and to welcome public participation in the parliamentary process. I am very pleased with the progress we have made and I look forward to the many potential developments in the petitions process which can enhance our parliamentary democracy.
The other role of members of this place is their work in the electorate. Having worked in electorate offices since 1975, I have seen the value of this part of a member’s duty. In assisting me to represent the people of my electorate of Fowler I have had the benefit of a loyal and dedicated staff. As I frequently remind them, it may be my name on the door, but we are all part of a team. I have been fortunate to have had long-serving staff, including Joy Petrovic, who has been with me from the beginning. Joy has assisted constituents efficiently and sympathetically as well as keeping me organised—and she has had to on many occasions—in times of acute chaos. I wish Joy and her husband, Petro, well in their future life with their family in Cairns. Margaret Brindley, also known by us as ‘Have a chat’, is the heart and soul of the office, whose political knowledge has been invaluable and whose service to constituents has been outstanding. Rocco Leonnello’s knowledge of the electorate, assistance with community groups and advice have been second to none. John Alam has ably supported me, particularly in Canberra. I promised him when he started with me two years ago that it would not be boring—and I think I have delivered on that front, John. Pina Violi, my relief staff, was thrown in at the deep end when she started but has been quick to learn, in spite of the political culture shock.
Others who have given so much of themselves in the past include Justin Lee, the wild man of my office and an adviser of the first order, and Dean Superina, who has always been a calming influence. Last but not least, Grahame Hungerford, who was with me for nine years, brought a touch of creativity as well as nitpicking correctness to the task. Grahame could be lovable, although infuriating at times, but he was dedicated and loyal to the end. All have shown great understanding and empathy with our local community and I could ask for no better support than I have had from all my staff in my years in this parliament.
I should at this time add my thanks to those on the other end of the phone—the parliamentary liaison officers in the various government agencies, in particular, Immigration, Centrelink and Veterans’ Affairs. Probably the most rewarding aspect of my work has been the small personal victories won on behalf of constituents, sometimes against an unfeeling bureaucracy but more often simply by putting a case on behalf of people who did not have the experience or resources to do so themselves.
In an electorate such as Fowler, where economic and social disadvantage are more commonly found than in most parts of Australia and where too often people are not aware of their rights or are afraid to press for their entitlements, I have always been proud to speak out on their behalf and felt especially receptive to their concerns. In such a diverse community as Fowler, community organisations have a special role to play. I am proud to have been associated with the ex-service organisations in Fowler—‘my boys’, as I call them—at Canley Heights RSL, Liverpool RSL and Cabra-Vale ex-services, and I specially mention the boys at Bonnyrigg Men’s Shed.
Indigenous and migrant community organisations have been crucial in developing the greater community of the Fowler electorate. Vietnamese, Chinese, Italian, Croatian, Serbian, Lebanese and so many other community associations and religious bodies provide the pillars for integration in our greater Australian society. I have been pleased to work with these organisations to benefit our local and national progress.
To my loyal ALP branch members go my sincerest thanks for their loyalty and support, for their patience and for their assistance. They are too many to mention by name, but let me acknowledge two people: Sid Hugen and Joan Windsor, whose wise counsel and staunch support over the years have been much appreciated. Without the support of the people of Fowler, my role here in this esteemed chamber would have been all the more difficult. It has been a singular honour to represent them, and I trust that my representation has played a small part in helping them to fulfil their aspirations.
After 11½ years as the member for Fowler, like many other members I could say that I have never stayed in one job for this long. For me that has meant travelling to Canberra from my home in Sydney. Considering my work as a staffer since 1990, that is now 20 years of driving down from Sydney. I can say that the road has improved quite a bit in that time, and I think at times I could almost make the drive with my eyes closed. But I am fortunate in that for the last 10 years I have had the hospitality of Anne and Michael Gardiner to look forward to on my arrival. I have come to feel a part of the Gardiner family and I have been privileged to share in their lives. As a member spending 20 or more weeks a year away from home, being able to spend some time with an ordinary family while in Canberra has kept me in touch with the real world, something that other accommodation would not have provided. While family are only a phone call away, it is always more comforting to have warm and caring people like Anne and Michael with whom one can share the ups and downs of each day of parliamentary life.
Another part of my extended family in Canberra—and I will mention them—have been the Comcar drivers. Always courteous and always friendly, they have helped me get off to a good start to each sitting day and seen me safely home after a hard day’s night, as well as kept us all in touch with the real world in, I will add, a most discreet way.
The same can be said of the attendants and security staff here at Parliament House. When you think of the time we spend locked away in here during sitting weeks, it would be impossible to endure if it were not for the friendly smiles and happy remarks of those staff. And I would especially thank the dedicated clerks and committee staff who make it all possible. If I have caused committee staff some angst over the years by insisting very strongly on making dissenting reports, they certainly showed no outward signs at the time.
And if I may, through you, Mr Speaker, make my peace with the chair for my many lapses in decorum.
—No!
—Yes, I am apologising! I do not know if I hold the record for female members of this House—I may share the record with my friend and my mentor, the Hon. Janice Crosio, former member for Prospect—for the number of occasions of being sin-binned during question time, and possibly two or three times being asked to leave for 24 hours. But I assure you, Mr Speaker, that this morning—and you are going to be very, very proud of me—I finally did take the trouble to read standing order 94 and I can now see what all the fuss was about. And having said that, can I thank speakers past and present for the many indulgences I have been allowed over the years and in particular today.
Which leaves me with the other 148 members of the House, friends and foes alike. As has been said before, not all the foes are on the other side of the House and not everyone on this side can be counted as a friend. Can I say to the friends, and they definitely know who they are, I thank you for your friendship and support over my years in this place. And to those friends who will go on to the next parliament, can I offer the tribute made by Les Haylen—a man I have had discussions with for many years, along with his son Wayne—in his book Twenty years hard Labor:
To my mates in Canberra, the ones who saw clearest, fought hardest and suffered most in the struggle.
Mr Speaker, there is one other group that I must thank: my family. Unlike Petro, I am leaving this until the last. When I look back over what now seems a short time, I have seen my children, Rebecca and Blake, grow into adulthood, complete university and establish their own homes, and I am so proud of them. I have been blessed with two beautiful grandchildren, Liam and James Hunt, and I lost my beloved father, Alan Welsh, in 2006. Family life goes on regardless of what happens here in Canberra. With my mother, a true believer, a life member of the party, Lois Welsh, and my sister, Helen del Gallo, I have known the love, support and comfort of a very, very close family and I have been sustained through the highs and definitely the lows of life as a member of parliament by the love and support of my best friend, my husband, Geoff.
Those members fortunate to have a loving partner will understand the bliss at the end of a sitting week of returning to a home-cooked meal and a chance to shrug off the mask of life in Canberra. Thanks to Geoff I have been able to return for another bout, refreshed, rearmed and ready for another battle. While there is much that I will miss in Canberra, I am looking forward to the role finally of being a full-time wife, daughter, sister, mother and grandmother.
Mr Speaker, like Hillary Clinton I have not made the impossible possible, but I have definitely given it my best shot. I do leave this place with my heart bruised but it is definitely not broken, my spirit tested but not bowed and I leave with my integrity intact.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Bidgood, James, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—To be or not to be a federal politician: that is the question. Why? Because it is the road less travelled as a career path. There are very few people who can truly relate to the experience. In fact, when I came to Canberra for the very first time in my life in November 2007 as the elected member for Dawson, I was told that I was the 1,020th federal member of parliament to be elected in 107 years of Federation. I recognise the honour and the privilege that was bestowed upon me by the 45,000 people who voted for me in that historic Rudd Labor election win, with a swing of 16.9 per cent and a two-party preferred vote swing of 13.2 per cent. Labor won the seat of Dawson for the first time in 32 years. I consider it to be the greatest political honour and achievement in my life. This would not have been possible without the dedication of the rank-and-file membership of an active volunteer base of the Australian Labor Party and union movement in the seat of Dawson.
So what is it that inspires a man or a woman to aspire to this office, where so many are called but so few are chosen by the people? For me, it was the passionate conviction in my heart for social and political change in our society and workplaces to improve the lot of everyday working people. All politicians are driven people. They are focused, determined and single-minded, and some, dare I say it, are ruthlessly ambitious. Their souls burn with conviction.
What drives me is the passion to fight injustice wherever that occurs, whether it is in the workplace or the home. It may be the worker who is being victimised because they are speaking out for better workplace health and safety, or asking for better wages and conditions. That is why I am so proud to be part of this historic Rudd Labor government that said it would scrap Work Choices, and we fulfilled and delivered that promise to the people of Australia. The good news for the workers of Australia is that this Rudd Labor government has saved you from unfair dismissal laws; this Labor government has saved your long service leave from being scrapped; this Labor government has saved your sick pay from being abolished. We can say with proud conviction that this Labor government has delivered to you, everyday working Australians.
The global financial crisis revealed corruption and bad trading activities overseas which resulted in global capitalism being put into crisis and in meltdown around the world. This, in turn, had a knock-on effect in this country. Thankfully, the people had a Labor government who had as its priority the protection of everyday jobs for people. We were engaged in an economic stimulus package, and that would not have happened under a conservative Liberal-National Party government. They would have let the anarchy of the free market rip and shred over 200,000 jobs. They would have explained it away as merely a market correction. This government has a totally different view. We intervened when capitalism went into crisis, and we stepped in to save those jobs from being lost. I believe in grassroots democracy, and that for me means being on the street meeting people outside newsagents, video stores, post offices, fish and chip shops and in the marketplace. During the election campaign it meant getting up at 5 am every day, being out at 6 am and standing outside the local newsagent, 7 am standing at a busy intersection greeting the early morning traffic and then, at 8 am, I would fulfil my duty as a single parent doing fifty-fifty child care, and take my kids to school.
I am proud to say I totally kept my commitment to my children during the whole electoral campaign, from April 2006 through to November 2007, as well as during the past 2½ years as a member of this parliament. It is not easy being a member of parliament and a single parent. I know there are a small number of people on both sides of this House who really know what it is like. Two of my three children are in the gallery today—Zoe, who is nine, and my son, Jade, who is eleven. Jazmin, who is 14, could not make it today as she has had exams this week. My children are the most important people in my life, and I will always love and be proud of them. I love their straightforward and ruthless honesty. Being a member of parliament also puts a huge strain on relationships, partnerships, family life and personal time. Political life has caused a rollercoaster of emotions for my partner Davina, and I want to thank her for her love through all the highs and lows over the last four years.
I want to thank Brendan Greenhill and Lee Webster, a great couple who housed me at Curtin in their spare room. These good friends of mine I knew in Bowen before they moved to Canberra just before the election. They have truly given me a home away from home; a real brother and sister who looked after me with wonderful hospitality. Another good friend and brother who has been there through all the rough and tumble of this job is the member for Blair, Shayne Neumann—you are a good man, and I will deeply miss your company and our long political, religious and social conversations. There was never a dull moment!
I would love to name all 34 of my Labor colleagues in the class of 2007—but time is of the essence! So I wish to have the whips list of new Labor members’ names and photos included in this speech. Perhaps I will table that. I am proud to be with you in history as helping to form the Rudd Labor government. Each and every one of you has so much potential, talent and vision to serve the Australian people. Thank you for all your friendship and support.
I want to acknowledge the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the full cabinet and ministers in their commitment to grassroots democracy demonstrated by bringing the federal cabinet to Mackay in June 2008. That was a historic first for the city. Also I want to acknowledge the three other visits in this term of government by the Prime Minister as well as his three visits during the election campaign. The people of Dawson know you take the contribution of the region and its value to the bottom line of the nation’s wealth very seriously, compared with the previous Prime Minister who visited only once in 11 years. I can say with confidence to the Prime Minister that your sacrifice of time has borne fruit and it is widely appreciated in the community that this government has delivered for the people of Dawson.
Funding for Dawson includes, for example: roads $350 million, including $50 million for the southern approach to Mackay and $95 million for the port access road in South Townsville; health, $6.1 million for brand new training facilities for dental care at the base hospital in Mackay and a new clinical training facility at the Mater Hospital; and education, 2,022 computers for secondary schools across Dawson, $121,247,926 for the Building the Education Revolution, with 278 individual projects across Dawson, and $9,376,617 for trade training centres. In May 2010 the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard—who I think has done a fantastic job—visited the nearly completed TTC for the Mackay Christian College-Carlisle Christian College-Whitsunday Anglican cluster. There is also a state cluster made up of Mackay North, Mackay High, Mirani High, Pioneer High and Sarina High. This project is in danger if the Liberal-National Party form the next government. There is no guarantee for that cluster. For training and TAFE, there is $2,645,000 for the Mackay TAFE Training Infrastructure Investment for Tomorrow program, and $2,630,994 for Better TAFE Facilities Program projects in Bowen, the Burdekin Cannonvale and Mackay
There was funding for community infrastructure: $4.9 million for Mackay Regional Council, Whitsunday Regional Council and Burdekin Shire Council; there was $742,727 under the National Bike Path Project for the Whitsunday Regional Council. Under Caring for our Country there was the Reef Rescue package worth $15,106,424 in 2008-09 and 2009-10. That is delivering for the people of Dawson. There was the Better Regions program. There is more! There was $8.8 million for the Mackay Stadium; $4 million for the Bluewater Lagoon; the Australian Mining Innovation Centre based in Mackay is worth $14 million. For social housing, there was $24,496,692 for 82 new housing units and 281 units to undergo repairs and maintenance.
I am proud to be a part of this government’s increases in pension payments—the best in 100 years. These increases, following on from 2009, mean that total pension payments for those on the maximum rate, including base rate and pensions supplement, is $701.10 a fortnight for singles and $1,057 a fortnight for couples, combined. This represents an increase of around $100 per fortnight for singles and around $74 a fortnight for couples, combined, in pension payments as a result of the government’s increases and indexation in 2009. Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, has done a fantastic job in delivering for the pensioners across the whole nation.
To all my electoral staff, I say thank you for all your work during very difficult times, particularly during the Mackay floods in February 2008. We had only just moved into our federal office in December 2007 and then were completely flooded out. We moved into my house and operated from a spare lounge room for three months. Then we moved to The Dome Shopping Centre in Mackay’s CBD before finding permanent accommodation in November 2008. It was an incredibly disruptive and stressful first year. No-one should underestimate the problems it caused on many different fronts. I still have all the same staff. None of us had worked in a federal office before, and I can tell you that we are now all older, wiser and greyer. I put on record thanks to government services based in Brisbane for all their help in re-establishing offices we could work from. I also thank all parliamentary staff in this building and thank the Comcar drivers for their professionalism in helping MPs do their job. I thank Roger Price, the Chief Government Whip, for his wisdom and advice over the last 2½ years and all the executive for their support.
I, James Bidgood, federal member for Dawson, can stand here today with my hand on my heart and truly say I made a promise to deliver for the people of Dawson. The Rudd Labor government and I have delivered over $600 million to the people of Dawson in 2½ years—more than was delivered in the previous 2½ years of the conservative Liberal-National Party government. The only way for this to continue is for the people of Dawson to vote Labor in the upcoming election. I totally endorse Mayor Mike Brunker of the Whitsunday Regional Council who is the new Labor candidate for the seat of Dawson. I am proud to have established a Labor legacy in the seat of Dawson, and long may it remain a Labor seat into the future. I have passionately served with all of my heart, soul, body and mind. I have given 110 per cent, and I thank the people of Dawson for the honour of serving them.
—During the member for Dawson’s contribution he sought to include material in Hansard. There were no dissenting voices, so I take it that leave was granted. However, that might be a challenge to the Speaker’s guidelines for incorporation, so, given the intent and the generous spirit of the member for Dawson, leave will be granted for the documents to be tabled and they will form part of the parliamentary papers.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I will speak briefly in relation to the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010. The organisations which impact on Australians the most in terms of services are Centrelink, Medicare and the Child Support Agency. These government agencies impact on people’s lives by providing financial support, providing care, reimbursing people for their health costs, and providing assistance at times of loss of economic security through the loss of jobs and at other times. Making sure that there is alignment in relation to these great government organisations is absolutely crucial to ensuring that we deal with Australians consistently and decently. We need to make sure that they have access to all the information and financial support that enables them to meet their family’s needs, pay for their household challenges and get the kind of health care and assistance that they richly deserve in the Australian community. We want to make sure that they have the kind of help that allows them to clothe themselves, house themselves, educate their children and make sure they have jobs and job security. These are vital for the needs of average Australians.
The bill makes amendments to implement our budget measures. It lines up care determinations between the Family Assistance Office and the Child Support Agency; it makes improvements to estimating the income for the purpose of child support; and it makes some minor changes in relation to family assistance law to exclude two circumstances from the provisions that prevent the payment of family tax benefit on the basis of an income estimate if the relevant tax returns have not been lodged.
Since coming to office the Rudd government has been diligent and determined to deliver significant reforms across a suite of areas, particularly in areas of pension reform. The member for Dawson talked about the very significant pension reforms—the largest pension rises and the biggest change in the 100 years of Australian Federation. We have substantially increased assistance to carers for those with a disability and in the House of Representatives we have legislated for Australia’s first Paid Parental Leave scheme. These things make Australia’s systems of help for families better and simpler. It is a real scheme that we believe will make a difference in people’s lives. Those opposite have failed to assist Australian families, whether it is in the area of paid parental leave, the area of social security and pensions, or whether it is in the area of child support and other sorts of assistance.
We have provided enormous assistance. The Child Support Agency was a reform of the Hawke-Keating government back in the late 1980s. For a long time before that—decades before that—the child maintenance systems in this country were inadequate. When I was practising as a family lawyer all manner of child maintenance was avoided by both mothers and fathers at various stages. You had to end up taking cases to court on behalf of clients who were not being paid, often without legal assistance. It was a really difficult set of circumstances. Enforcing those orders were very difficult and costly for people in time, effort and money. The Child Support Scheme, for all its failings, faults and foibles, has taken us forward. It is not without difficulty or problems. It interfaces with people at the coalface. Most people do not get charged with criminal offences, most people do not involve themselves in fraud, most people do not have contract breaches, most people are not injured in car accidents and most people do not face the litigation system in this country. But many people end up separating from their partners and spouses, and child support becomes a real thing of them.
The child support systems in this country say very clearly that parents have a primary obligation to support their children and provide for their proper needs from reasonable and adequate shares in the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of both parents. It is stated very clearly in the Child Support (Assessment) Act. Similar words are used with respect to the care of children in the Family Law Act. Indeed, in section 3 and section 114 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act the act says that there are extra duties and responsibilities and that parents have a primary duty to maintain their children. If people are unhappy with the outcome of the decision that is made with respect to child support, they can always seek internal reviews and they can rely upon section 117 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, which sets out the grounds for departure orders. They can undertake internal reviews and then look at the SSAT and the Federal Magistrates Court for further justice if they feel they have been hard done by.
The legislation here makes the interaction between the family assistance provided to people and the child support arrangements more consistent. In determining people’s child support obligation some parents use an estimate of their income and that estimate is then reconciled against actual income to make sure the correct amounts are paid or received. Also, if they are not happy with a child support assessment and a feel that their income is 85 per cent of or less than the actual estimate, they can, under section 60 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, request the Child Support Agency to look at it again.
We have made changes in this regard in terms of the estimates and the reconciliation. The measure in schedule 1, which talks about child support income estimates, will make it easier for people to estimate their income and allow the Child Support Agency to reconcile the estimates automatically once the actual income is known. The amendments do not amend the length of the child support period, which remains at 15 months. The amendments only change the period over which an estimate can be reconciled—from 15 months to a financial year. That makes sense, because most people look at their budgetary arrangements on a financial year basis.
There are also changes with respect to percentage of care. This implements a 2009-10 budgetary measure to create simpler and clearer rules for separated families. We know that the Child Support Scheme aims to provide adequate levels of child support, which of course is used to meet children’s needs. But there is also assistance given with family tax benefits, which help parents pay for their costs of raising their children. Currently the Family Assistance Office—that is really Centrelink and Medicare—and the Child Support Agency use different rules with respect to determination of care levels for child support and family assistance. Those care levels are always difficult and problematic, and often discussions with respect to these matters take place on the doorstep of courts and also in lawyers’ offices, at mediations and arbitration, at conciliation conferences and at Family Relationship Centres.
The reconciliation and removal of inconsistencies and unnecessary duplication is a good thing. The amendments make plain it is to provide a single determination of care for both child support and family tax benefit purposes. There are some amendments, too, with respect to schedule 3, as it deals with more flexible arrangements with respect to details concerning family tax benefits. That follows a recommendation of the Australian National Audit Office in a report concerning the reduction of family payment debts. This second change will have some benefit, because there are people whose personal and financial circumstances are such that they are vulnerable and are open to challenges. Dealing with separation is really hard. They do not always think of Centrelink and Medicare changes or electoral enrolment changes or child support issues.
I was a litigation lawyer practising in family law for more than 20 years before I came to this place. People do not always think as clearly as they should or as they would normally think when they separate and are facing circumstances that they never thought they would face. Often they are affected by illness, domestic violence or other circumstances which cause them not to think clearly. Anything that makes the situation better for them or makes their circumstances easier with respect to family tax benefits is a good thing. Flexibility, simplicity and clarity are important for them in those circumstances.
The member for Menzies had a go at the government about family relationship centres and other types of assistance that we are providing within the family law system. But the member for Menzies did not talk about the great initiatives that the Rudd Labor government is undertaking in these areas—the extra $154 million that is being given to family law services, particularly legal aid services, for people who are facing child support issues and family relationship breakdowns. The previous government—the Howard government—gutted legal aid in this country. They came up with a ridiculous artificial distinction between Commonwealth matters and Commonwealth persons. The Rudd government is seeking to address the failures of the previous government to invest in legal aid, providing for Indigenous people and those with family law or child support needs in a way that the Howard government never thought to do. It is providing additional legal aid and putting a greater emphasis on family dispute resolution, particularly with the new civil dispute resolution bill implementing recommendations made by the National Alternative Dispute Resolution Advisory Council. There is also a greater emphasis on mediation, particularly the use of family relationship centres for property and spousal maintenance matters, with very few exceptions.
The member for Menzies is simply not correct when he criticises the Rudd government’s commitment to alternative dispute resolution. We have improved access to justice with this bill. That was a budgetary measure. The Commonwealth contribution to legal aid services across the country now totals over $1.2 billion, far more than the Howard government ever had the wisdom, the wit or the will to undertake. We are putting a huge amount of resources into making sure that there is access to legal services in rural, regional and remote areas through providing additional funds. The previous government should stand condemned for its failure to provide adequate legal services.
In Ipswich in my electorate of Blair, we are giving additional assistance through Centrelink; Commonwealth, state and local government services; Job Services Australia; disability employment services; and education providers. Community welfare organisations are going to join Centrelink to provide improvements in services for disadvantaged job seekers. We are one of four locations across the country which will host this initiative. They will be wraparound type services—a local connections-to-work program, providing disadvantaged job seekers with access to justice. This will be all at one location, providing the kinds of services that will deliver for all of us and deliver for those who are disadvantaged, helping with financial assistance advocacy, housing, employment, health services and education as well as giving advice on child support and family assistance, which is the topic of this legislation.
This is important reformist legislation. Those opposite would not do it. Those opposite failed on legal aid, they failed on child support and they failed in providing these integrated services. It is up to the Rudd Labor government to do that which is necessary to help those in need.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—in reply—I thank those who have contributed to the debate on the Child Support and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2010 and particularly recognise the previous speaker, the member for Blair, because he has considerable experience in this area. His contribution to the debate has been very valuable, as is his advice on child support and other family law matters.
The bill contains three measures affecting the family assistance law and child support legislation. All measures are largely administrative and are designed to make government systems easier for families. Firstly, the bill includes a measure from the 2009-10 budget that will align care determinations in the child support and family assistance systems. This will simplify administrative decision making, making life easier for separated families. Current rules allow for two different care percentages to be determined for the same child in child support and family assistance. This amendment will provide for a single determination of care that applies across both systems, bringing consistency and reducing administrative complexity.
Secondly, the bill amends the income estimate process under the Child Support Scheme. A number of parents provide an estimate of their income to assist in determining their child support obligations. To make sure that the correct amount of child support has been paid or received when actual income is known, the amount is reconciled against the estimated income. This amendment will align estimate periods with financial years and is intended to avoid inaccurate estimates, which can occur when parents are providing estimates for multiple financial years. It will also allow automatic reconciliation against tax returns, speeding up the reconciliation process. This will also help improve the accuracy of child support calculations to make sure that the correct information is used.
Lastly, the bill contains amendments to the family assistance law to provide greater flexibility in dealing with family tax benefit non-lodger debts. This will amend rules introduced in January this year that allowed for the temporary suspension of fortnightly family tax benefit payments where a person has not lodged their tax return more than 18 months after the end of the financial year. These amendments will give the secretary the discretion to determine that the rules that will apply in special circumstances and to clarify that, where there is no outstanding family tax benefit debt due to the failure to lodge a required tax return, the new provisions will not apply. I commend the bill to the House.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-06-03,"—This Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010 underlines yet again the sheer administrative incompetence of the Rudd Labor government. It breaks at least four specific election promises. It is another botched program that shows this government’s complete lack of understanding that what business needs most is certainty.
In 2007 the Labor Party promised before the election that it would revitalise the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. It said it would increase the maximum grant by $50,000 to $200,000. It would allow the cost of patenting products in the international marketplace to be treated as an eligible export marketing activity. It would allow approved regional not-for-profit economic development bodies, including tourism bodies, which promote Australian exporters to access the scheme. It would lift the maximum turnover limit of eligible applicants from $30 million to $50 million. It would cut the minimum threshold of expenditure by $5,000 to a $10,000 minimum. It would extend the limit on the number of annual grants from seven to eight annually and it would replace the list of eligible services provided in Australia with a negative list which means all services would be considered eligible unless otherwise specified. The Labor Party said in its election platform:
These sensible changes will revitalise and update the EMDG and will assist businesses, especially small businesses, to break into the export market. The program will be more accessible, especially to businesses in the service sector and those based in regional areas.
I can recall debating these issues at the Lowy Institute with the then shadow minister for trade, the current minister, when he outlined the importance of all of these measures and promised Australian exporters that there would be a much more generous EMDG scheme in the future.
This bill breaks four of those commitments. One, the negative list for items to be covered, was never even implemented. So, in effect, almost all of the Labor Party’s pre-election promises to the tradie sector and almost all of the reforms that the government promised to make to the EMDG scheme are being reversed in this legislation. The scheme will largely go back to the scheme that was in place before Labor came into office. They said they would make substantial reforms. The reforms have not worked and now Labor is reversing those changes.
This bill will reduce the maximum grant from $200,000 to $150,000. It will reduce the maximum number of grants available for an individual recipient from eight to seven. It will cap intellectual property registration expenses at $50,000 per application. It will increase the minimum expense threshold from $10,000 to $20,000 and it will increase the eligibility income limit for members of approved joint venture consortia from $30 million to $50 million.
If we go back through these listed changes, the government in this legislation is reducing the maximum grant from $200,000 to $150,000. That is precisely the size of the maximum grant that the previous government had in place and that the government said it would change. They have decided to reduce the number of grants available to an individual recipient from eight to seven. The number of grants available under the previous government was seven. They are increasing the minimum expenses threshold from $10,000 to $20,000 and that is a specific reversal of the commitments that the government has made. It is indeed a humiliating backdown. The government is returning the scheme largely to the one that they inherited. All of the specific changes that the government said it would make are being reversed.
The EMDG scheme operates by reimbursing eligible enterprises for 50 per cent of the cost spent on specific export promotion activities above a threshold. The scheme has been capped at $150 million per annum since 1997 and through the forward estimates except in 2009-10 when a $200 million cap applied.
Labor knew that its changes to the EMDG scheme would cost more money but it only funded an amount for an increase for just one year. There was no additional funding provided in the long-term even though the government knew that a more generous scheme would inevitably cost more. So that they could allow for better refunds in 2007-08, there was some top-up funding in that year. That was a top-up for payments under the scheme of the previous federal government. So Labor knew that the scheme was more than exhausting the funds that were available. They promised additional grants and additional benefits but, in reality, did not offer the money that was going to be necessary to fund those benefits. Because this is a capped scheme, it meant inevitably therefore that thousands of small businesses—exporters—did not get the export market development grants that they expected—and had a right to expect—on the basis of the rhetoric of the government before the election.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the announcement this morning by mining company Xstrata that it has suspended $586 million of current investment in two major mining projects in Queensland as a result of his great big new tax, putting at risk total capital investment of over $6.4 billion and 3,250 jobs in regional Queensland. Given the statement of Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, who said, ‘This is no longer of war of words; this is causing real pain to Queensland families,’ and given Xstrata’s statement that neither of these two projects would be viable if the new tax were imposed, will the Prime Minister now listen to these warnings and dump this tax before any further damage is inflicted on the Australian economy? Why did the Prime Minister gutless out of fully debating this issue, first in response to me and second in response to the member for Kennedy?

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—In fact, this is such a matter of national importance to the opposition that their stated matter of public importance today is about the government’s failure on people smuggling. Those opposite, frankly, speak again with two voices on these matters. The Leader of the Opposition, come the end of each sitting week, feels the need always to move a censure—and not just at the end of a sitting week; in fact, according to my numbers, every third day on average since he has been Leader of the Opposition there has been a censure, a suspension or some other parliamentary device in order for the Leader of the Opposition to assume the dispatch box. I also say in response—
Honourable members interjecting—
—Order! Now that we have question time underway, a question has been asked, the question is being responded to and I think that perhaps members should sit in silence and listen. The Prime Minister has the call.
—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The first thing I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition’s question is: this government will not be intimidated by any statements by any mining company anywhere. This government will not be intimidated by the statements of any mining company, foreign or domestic. This government does not stand here as the puppet of parts of the mining industry, as those opposite do; this government stands here to act in the national interest on behalf of all Australians.
Honourable members interjecting—
—Order!
—Out of his depth!
—The member for Flinders is warned! He might have been a bit unlucky, but he filled the vacuum. I simply say: for the next short period of question time could members try to show a little bit of respect for each other. The Prime Minister has the call.
—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition’s question also went to the impact on jobs. I find this remarkable from the Leader of the Opposition, who has resolutely opposed any form of stimulus in the economy, which has created 225,000 jobs in this economy. Had we followed the prescription of those opposite, we would have had 200,000 more people in Australia out of work. So, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to stand on his feet here and speak sanctimoniously about his concerns for jobs, I would ask him to reflect on his own party’s record on the question of how we responded to the global economic recession. That is the second point.
The third is this, and it goes to the particular statement put out by Xstrata this morning: it is passing strange that, when we have a new system which was announced just one month ago, we have 12 months to go before draft legislation and we are 24 months away from the start of a new system, a company of this nature would issue a statement of this type. Furthermore, in relation to the particular project at Wandoan, I add the following: under the proposed RSPT, first of all, such a project would have been eligible for a 40 per cent tax credit on its investment—that is the first point. The second is that coal royalties payable to the Queensland government would have been refunded. Furthermore, when it comes to the use of the tax credit, that becomes available to the company irrespective of whether it is generating a profit or not. This stands in stark contrast to the royalty system, which is a crude—

Ms Julie Bishop interjecting—
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to interject again, I presume in the national interest.
—Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should learn to cease interjecting and the Prime Minister should ignore her.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition always interjects in this place, with enormous credibility! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, each time she opens her mouth, is in fact greeted with the shaking of heads on the part of all those behind her—and we know the reasons why. This set of taxation arrangements replaces a royalties regime which is a crude instrument applied only to, firstly, volume and, secondly, revenue.
In response also to the question of the Leader of the Opposition, he should also pay attention to the fact that it is our understanding that there are a number of other existing issues impacting on this particular development, concerning the feasibility of rail access, port infrastructure and power supply. My understanding is that these issues have not been fully resolved.
I conclude my answer to the Leader of the Opposition by saying this: we on this side of the House stand for the national interest; we do not stand here as the instruments of Clive Palmer or anybody else. I would say also to the Leader of the Opposition that Clive Palmer’s intervention in this debate yesterday was to make the remarkable statement that the minerals in the ground do not belong to the Australian taxpayers. This is the individual, Clive Palmer, who is the major contributor to the Liberal National Party in Queensland; he is the major contributor to the conservative parties in Queensland. He seems to also dictate the policy position of those opposite—and he stands in this capital and says that these resources are not owned by the Australian people. That is wrong. Those opposite obviously believe that this Mr Palmer’s position on this is right; we will stand for the national interest, not for the sectional interests of an individual mining company, foreign or domestic.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-06-03,"—The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2010 talks about the assistance provided to Australian exports. In the couple of minutes left before the House adjourns for a week, I want to talk about the importance of mining exports to the Australian economy and in particular how important it is to encourage this industry. It is hypocritical of a government on one side to be claiming that it wants to assist industries to export through the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and on the other side to invent a great big new tax to make mining uneconomic in this country.
The Prime Minister must surely be the only person in the world who actually thinks that you make your mining industry more prosperous by taxing it more. The President of Zambia once tried this route to encourage mining in his country, and he quickly realised it did not work—there was no point, he said, in collecting a few million dollars in tax if you lost thousands of jobs in the process. Our Prime Minister has not learnt that lesson. He believes that if you put a tax on alcopops you will reduce consumption. He believes if you put a tax on cigarettes you will reduce consumption. But, if you put a tax on mining, you will have more of it—you will have more investment.
Ask Xstrata how much more investment they are going to have in Australia with this great big new tax hanging over their head. Ask the people of Whyalla what is the future of their steel works with this great big new tax hanging over their heads. Ask other investors, like British Gas, who have a proposal to open up coal seam gas harvesting in Queensland, what the future of that investment is, and the $20 billion LNG train in Gladstone. All of that, along with hundreds of other projects in Australia, is at risk, might not proceed, because of this government’s great big new tax on mining.
Last night the Prime Minister had an opportunity to explain this to the Australian mining industry. But, instead, he ran away—he went to a function for the centenary of Andrew Fisher’s government—a one-term government, I might add. But the centenary was actually three weeks ago, so this function was put on in Old Parliament House so the Prime Minister could run away, not face the mining industry but talk to a few party faithful about events of 100 years ago.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—Today I would like to bring the serious concerns of constituents in my electorate of Forrest to the attention of the government. In May the Labor Minister for Resources and Energy announced the government would allow oil and gas exploration in the Mentelle Basin in Commonwealth waters off the coast of Margaret River, as one of 31 new offshore exploration leases around the country. The minister may be aware of the potential for oil and gas deposits to exist off Margaret River, but my constituents are also aware of the existing environmental qualities of the area, as well as the current and future environmental, lifestyle, tourism and surfing potential of the south-west of Western Australia, which includes Margaret River in its heartland.
There is no doubt that Margaret River is recognised and valued as an international destination and for its environmental qualities. The communities living in and around the spectacular and, in places, rugged south-west coast have long recognised that they are privileged to live in one of the most ecologically valuable environments in Australia and internationally. The communities also recognise that with that privilege comes the responsibility to care for and protect the land, air and water resources in their area. They and I want to be assured that the Labor government also understand their direct responsibility in this regard.
The minister has said that the strongest safety and environment protection regulations will be in place. However, how can a community like Margaret River trust this Labor government and the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett? They are responsible for the tragic and disastrous Home Insulation Program that has seen four young Australians lose their lives, over 100 house fires, thousands of roofs at risk—endangering the lives of thousands of people—and a potential billion dollar clean-up bill for taxpayers. I have no confidence in this environment minister and this government when they could not even deliver the Green Loans Program. On that basis, how can the residents of Margaret River and the wonderful south-west possibly trust the environment minister and the government to protect the pristine environment in which they live and which they love?
I ask how the minister for resources will assure my constituents that exploration and possible extraction of oil and gas will not impact on them, their homes or, either on land or in the ocean, the wonderful region in which they live. I specifically ask the minister: what safeguards has he put in place to protect the people and the environment of the south-western forest? Even the local shire CEO was recently quoted in the Augusta Margaret River Mail saying:
The shire is aware of the high level conservation issues which would need to be considered as a high priority in any policy development and would be sensitive to the community’s wishes.

"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I welcome the opportunity to rise in this debate to speak about some of the important issues in the federal budget but also some of the important issues economically for Australia, with particular regard to the electorate of Casey. Madam Deputy Speaker, as a fellow Victorian I have said before in this chamber I know your familiarity with the eastern and outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Your electorate is a little more than a torpedo punt away but you are in the vicinity of the outer eastern suburbs. The electorate of Casey comprises outer eastern suburbs, part of the Yarra Valley, part of the Dandenong Ranges. The decisions that are taken here in Canberra in a budgetary sense are very much felt on the ground in the electorate, and I want today to address a number of those as we talk about the Rudd government’s third budget.
Three years ago this government inherited one of the best budget situations of any government in the world. Now as we consider this budget all Australians are very familiar with the policy implementation failures, the waste and mismanagement that have become a feature of the Labor government. We have had billion-dollar blowouts in the Building the Education Revolution, we have had countless examples right across Australia and within my electorate of value for money being abandoned in a rushed project with poor and disastrous policy implementation. No amount of opposition from the government members in this parliament will conceal the fact that the Australian people are a wake-up to what has been monumental policy failure on so many levels.
The parents of school communities across Australia and within Casey know about the failings of the Building the Education Revolution program because they see the waste, they see it in their school community. They know that under the previous government they had a choice about their school’s future through the Investing in our Schools program. Under this government they have no choice and when large amounts of money are spent they know that they are not getting value for money as a result of the mismanagement of this government’s programs.
On the ceiling insulation program—and I know this will be the case for all members of parliament and I know many of those opposite will never say what I will say but they know that what I am about to say is a fact—there has not in recent memory been an example of a government program that has adversely affected so many people in our electorates. The number of phone calls and amount of correspondence about this failed Home Insulation Program has been astronomical. I say that because the experience of Casey residents will be the same as the experience of other residents right across Melbourne, Victoria and Australia.
The Home Insulation Program, which the government belatedly admits was a failure, will be a symbol of the incapacity of this government to deliver policy effectively. It will be a symbol of this government’s waste and mismanagement. I stand here with my friend and colleague the member for Mallee, who has been a member of this House longer than me, and I am sure that he would agree that, once, a billion dollars seemed an incredible amount of money. Of course it is, but with a billion dollar blow-out in the Building the Education Revolution and a billion dollar blow-out in the ceiling insulation program, these are now just rounding errors for this government—rounding errors that occur time after time. The amount of debt we have—and the Leader of the Opposition spoke of this in his budget reply—now sees Australia borrowing $700 million each and every week.
In the electorate of Casey, under the Howard government, community infrastructure projects were funded, despite what those opposite would say. Significant community infrastructure projects were funded between 2004 and 2007—for example, the Monbulk Community Centre hub, to the tune of a couple of million dollars, and the Montrose Recreation Reserve, to the tune of $600,000. These were funded out of surplus budgets. We did not borrow that money.
Casey residents see the federal government racking up debt and deficit and they know that, at the end of the day, that is paid for by them. It is paid for in higher taxes, it is paid for in higher interest rates and it is paid for in fewer opportunities. In three short years, many people across the electorate have seen the government’s form on policy implementation and they rightly pose the question: if the government cannot run a ceiling insulation program, how could it possibly run bigger programs and how will it possibly implement policies into the future? The one thing the electors of Casey know is that the government has revealed its incapacity and that this government cannot and will not get any better in the expenditure of their money here in Canberra.
We have also seen broken promises and mass hypocrisy. The greatest hypocrisy we have seen over the last week—and I know the member for Mallee will agree—has been the decision, and the concealment of the decision, by the government to engage in political advertising on its resources tax. Australians will be interested to know that tomorrow will be day 7 of a national emergency. We will be at the end of one full week. Last Friday we and the Australian public discovered that the government had bypassed its own processes to enable this advertising campaign. Not only that; it spent all week in Senate estimates concealing it.
Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister, could not have been clearer when he was the Leader of the Opposition. Last Friday night the news footage showed him as the Leader of the Opposition pledging with his hand on his heart to change the system and inviting journalists to come back if he when in government did not meet his promise. Well, he has not met his promise. He deliberately decided that the emergency of saving his political skin was more important than his solemn promise to the Australian people. People want to know when the Prime Minister decided he was going to break faith with the Australian people. Once he had there was, as we have seen with this government, this incredible effort to cover it up in the inquiries during the week.
The electors of Casey have seen that, if this government makes a promise, it is likely to break it and, if it implements a policy, it will muck it up. They have seen in just a few short years this government make promises to them that it does not keep and this government seek to implement policies and then waste money. When confronted over many weeks and months, as it was with the ceiling insulation debacle and the Building the Education Revolution school halls debacle, there is stubborn refusal to acknowledge the failure. There is not even the slightest attempt to say, ‘Maybe there’s a problem here and we should fix it.’ The government’s first instinct is to deny. This went on for months with the ceiling insulation program and the Building the Education Revolution program.
The sad part for those opposite is that the residents of the electorate of Casey and right across Australia can see this policy failure every day. They see it in their community. More than 40 residents have contacted me with disastrous stories about ceiling insulation. A lady had people knock on her door and proceed to install insulation. They damaged her roof and then disappeared. There are countless examples—

Mr Forrest interjecting—
—I am tempted to say that maybe the same installers went to Mildura. Sadly, there were so many cases like that. The first instinct of the government was to pretend that it was not happening. In doing that, they knowingly let this bad and catastrophic program continue.
This third Rudd government budget has answered the question for many in the Australian community. This government cannot manage money, cannot implement programs and cannot be trusted on anything it says in the lead-up to the next election. If the government will break promises it made before the last election, it will break promises in the future if it gets a chance. If the government is not competent to implement basic policy, that will never change. At the next election, the people of Australia will have a choice, and they will have that choice having seen the Rudd government over three years of policy failure, broken promises, waste and mismanagement. This budget is a budget that is starkly different from the budgets of the Howard government. Back in those days, those opposite complained about how money was spent in times of surplus budgets. Now, their promises on reducing the deficit and reducing debt must be kept alongside their track record on broken promises to date.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak to the appropriation bills, and I also welcome the budget. For us as a nation, this budget is able to build on a position of strength. That is important as the world is still grappling with the impacts of the global recession. We avoided the global recession—the worst the world has seen—but not all of the fallout from it. There is no way we could escape some of the fallout, but we did not go into recession. People can say that was good luck, but it was not—it was good management. Luck can always feature in a lot of things, but basic good economic management and political management helped make sure that we did not go into recession when almost all other developed countries with advanced economies did not.
Norway would have been one country that did not go into recession. Norway has also gained its richness and wealth over the years from resources. They have been world leaders in the way they manage their resources. I have great familiarity with this—as members of the House know, I lived and worked in Timor-Leste for nearly four years, so the resources sector is not unknown to me, and big mining companies and how they operate are not unknown to me either—some of them have immersed themselves in the debate that is happening here. I have seen the way that they operate in countries around the world, and sometimes it is not a pretty site. The Treasurer said in his budget speech, and I agree:
A position of strength from which we will build a modern tax and retirement income system, invest in renewable energy, and deliver historic health and hospital reform.
He further said:
A position of strength from which we will build the skills base and capital stock we need for a new generation of prosperity.
I want to congratulate the Treasurer not only for the budget but for three budgets, the three successive budgets of the Rudd Labor government. I also want to say to him: credit where credit is due, because often in politics people do not get credit where it is due. The economics editor Tim Colebatch, writing in the Age on 1 June, in an article titled ‘The dirt on dodging the GFC’ said:
And the Rudd government’s stimulus measures put a floor under retail spending, housing and construction activity when it was most needed. Let’s give credit where credit is due.
We should give credit where credit is due. He said some other interesting things in this article and one of them was:
The recession was concentrated in manufacturing, where output fell 11 per cent: mining output fell just 1 per cent. Mining didn’t save us from recession. The impact of China’s stimulus certainly helped us recover, but only after the worst had passed.
The article goes to the heart of the issue of the stimulus and clearly articulates that the stimulus helped save us from recession, and it certainly did. We do not live in isolation. We are members of parliament, we have got electorates, businesses, local people, schools and local economies, and it is clear that stimulus has worked to help keep us out of recession.
We would have seen people in long unemployment queues. I can remember seeing them, and members in this House would remember seeing them, and the queues go on for a long time. Some people I know, who were unemployed years ago, found it nearly impossible to get back into employment, particularly older people, and older males especially. I have seen it when we had high youth unemployment—
—Back in the eighties and nineties.
—Yes, in the eighties and early nineties. So we did not want to repeat that situation, and without the stimulus we could have had that happen. So let us be clear, we needed the stimulus. It saved our bacon, as the saying goes. Yes, we had a reasonable basis to launch from, but far from as sound and perfect as the opposition would have us believe. They often try and remind us that the Labor government inherited all the good things. Yes, some things were good, but there had been all those years of growth preceding the Howard government and through the time of the Howard government.
Let us just have a look at the facts. When in 2007 the Rudd government came to government, there were some really tough conditions. There was inflation, the highest in 16 years, and it had risen to that rate in the last quarter of 2007. The average increase was high in the Reserve Bank’s measures of underlying inflation. It was 1.2 per cent. That was in the December quarter of 2007, just after Labor came into government. But it was to be three per cent higher through the year. Throughout the previous government they had been given 20 warnings about inflation from the RBA. From everything that I have looked at it appeared that those warnings were not acted upon.
We know that productivity was at its lowest level. We have had debates about the 457 visas and, yes, they have been needed so that we could bring people into the market to do certain jobs. But if the productivity had been higher, had it been worked on, had there been policy input, it would have made a difference. The average annual productivity growth over the last five years of the coalition government was lower than in any other equivalent period in 16 years. The productivity growth fell from an average 2.1 per cent a year over the 1990s to an average of just 1.4 per cent during 2000.
There was no investment in infrastructure either. Yes, there might have been little projects, which are very welcome. I have seen some little projects in my electorate, and that leads me to digress to talk about the Investing in Our Schools Program, which the honourable member who spoke previously talked about in his contribution. I have seen some of the projects from that program, and some of them were good projects. But it was done on a competitive basis—not every school got one. When we are looking at schools, if it is good enough for one school then it is good enough for another school. That is why the BER and the NSP and a whole range of those programs can work, because they cover all schools. When we are looking at education, schools should not have to bid on a competitive basis for resources and things needed in their schools.
Child care was an absolute mess, and that takes time to sort out. Health reform had been deemed too hard in some areas. Yes, there had been some things that had happened, but it was ‘too hard’. The opposition leader, the member for Warringah, as the then health minister said it was too hard. He said the Commonwealth should take over the dominant role, but that was too hard to do, and then he ripped a billion dollars out of what is referred to as the Medicare agreement, the Australian healthcare agreement.
Regional development was another area. Yes, they had regional development projects, but we saw the regional development rorts. We all saw the Auditor-General’s reports on that. If you have a look at the map of where those regional development projects went to, it was to a very small range of areas, and some appeared to be favouring certain members of certain parties. And in 1997 they actually axed the department of regional development, which astounded me. I cannot understand how a coalition partner like the National Party, whose rhetoric is that they are the natural party in the country, allowed that to be just ripped out. They watched all of these things go.
Turning back to the budget, one thing that is clear is that without the stimulus we in Australia would have gone back 0.7 per cent in 2009. That was when the advanced economies contracted by three per cent, but Australia grew at 1.4 per cent. So this bodes well for us. Also, to comment on spending, the spending growth is capped at two per cent so it is responsible economic management. Under the previous government the spending growth was around six per cent, even up to 6.6 per cent. So if you want to do a quick check about responsible management, the facts have to match up with the political rhetoric, and they do not.
There were other important measures in the 2010-11 budget, particularly the health investments. There is $772 million to improve access to general practitioners and primary health care and $523 million for training and supporting Australian nurses. There is $467 million to modernise our health and hospital system, and that is e-records. That can sound a bit high-tech, but it is about our health. It is about having less interventions. It is about our health records, with our health status following us wherever we go in the health system so that they can be accessed by whichever practitioner we have to go to for treatment. That is really important. I know, as would other members here, that you can have to go to one doctor and then to another and might have to have multiple X-rays or blood tests. That is not good for us when we are dealing with health issues, because there are risks in that, but it is also an absolute waste of public money. Having the e-records will start to change the system so that a lot of that will not have to happen.
Obviously, one of the key reforms is in the area of hospitals. It is about hospitals being funded nationally and run locally. It is a change welcomed—certainly I welcome it—right across my electorate of Page. We are very engaged in local debate and discussions about how it is going to play out. I notice the honourable member for Lyne is here and I have heard him engaged in that local debate as well. It is a discussion that we do have to have locally to make sure that we have the best fit for our local needs.
I will discuss a couple of other issues in the budget. One is the resource super profits tax. Under it, the government will contribute 40 per cent of the investment in mining projects and take 40 per cent of the superprofits—and it is ‘superprofits’. It is not the regular profits, the standard profits, the normal profits—it is superprofits. This structure means that the tax applies to what the secretary of the Treasury has called ‘supernormal profits’. By taxing only supernormal profits, this tax does not distort production and investment decisions.
Listening to the debate, it is as though all the investments in the resources sector are about to happen now. In fact, they are locked in for years ahead. They are locked in internationally. There is absolute discord between what some of the big mining companies are saying and the reality on the ground. I have never heard such rubbish as when I heard them talking about sovereign risk. In the resources sector, the sovereign risk of a country is associated with a whole range of factors: its stability, its security, its political stability. These mining companies operate in countries all over the world in places where risks are great. In Australia, there is no sovereign risk. It is absolute nonsense when they talk about that in this debate. They are just throwing words around and running this whole fear campaign. The Leader of the Opposition has unashamedly jumped on board and become the champion of fear. His attitude is: ‘Can we scare people? Let’s go out and do it. Let’s run a campaign. We will not have any policy or any well thought out initiatives. Let’s just go out and try and scare people.’
The whole debate as it is being played out is unbelievable, especially some of the numbers and claims that have been bandied about. The mining boss, Clive Palmer, was absolutely ridiculous with one claim about the shutting down of a project in South Australia that did not even exist. It is a bit like the cheese factory that did not exist under the previous government’s regional rorts funding. It is similar absolute nonsense and Clive Palmer is a leader of the LNP, as it is called in Queensland.
We saw the same scare campaign last time a 40 per cent profits based tax was introduced in the eighties and that industry went on to flourish. So this will just get played out. The government’s engagement with most industry representatives has been very constructive. There is a panel set up just for that.
I will just make a couple of concluding remarks. Australia’s fiscal position is the envy of the world. Our net debt peaks dramatically lower and Australia’s unemployment peaks lower. I seek leave to have these graphs incorporated into my speech.
Leave granted.

The graphs were as follows—

 

 

—I thank those opposite for doing that and I commend this budget to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2010-06-03,"—I rise to talk about the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and associated bills, and to do a round-the-world trip of some issues within the Lyne electorate on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. I will start with the central issue for a high-growth area that has traditionally been underserviced by state governments in regard to its own resource distribution formulas in the area of health. In the 2007 Garling report, the whole North Coast window was identified as being underserviced by up to $70 million per year. Our area has been underfunded for too long now due to our high growth rate and our large ageing population cohort. State structures have continually failed to deal with that growth. Therefore, the move by the Prime Minister and others to tackle the issue of health and hospital reform was strongly welcomed by me and others on the North Coast. It was described as a slam dunk for high-growth areas such as ours because it would bypass the perennial problems of state based funding, and the abuse of resource distribution formulas, through direct Commonwealth funding of local health networks. A bit of command and control at a clinical level and at a local level would be very welcome.
That was pre-COAG language. In post-COAG language it is probably less of a slam dunk. We are now at the detailed stage where boundaries are being defined and governance structures in regard to who is going to be involved and how they are going to be involved at a local level are being determined. I flag this as an issue of concern: we have the same foxes in the henhouse of reform—that is, the same state authorities that have been the traditional problem in high-growth areas are now, post COAG, back in a position of command and control over some of the critical issues around boundary definitions and governance of local health networks. Also post COAG, we have the concerning issue of once again putting state funding authorities and state based human discretion into resource distribution. We are potentially repeating the same problems of the past. I hope I am wrong. I hope that this detailed stage fleshes out this new state funding authority, which has been included in the Commonwealth funding direct to local health networks, and that it actually does not mean anything, does not get in the way and does not affect resource distribution formulas. I hope that there is no human discretion element and no ulterior state motives involved in it, which raises the question of why it is there at all. I sincerely hope that it plays a minimal role in deciding where money ends up and that we can be as pure as possible about Commonwealth funding direct to local health networks.
I also raise the concern that it is a state cabinet decision that is essentially being made now in regard to boundary definitions and local health network governance structures. I would hope those decisions are as pure as possible and that the Commonwealth is not walking away from the critical framework decisions that are being made right now. It is in this detailed stage that we will hopefully see a health reform system that is pure and does meet the rhetoric and the language of the Prime Minister when this whole process started. I sincerely hope it does, but I do flag that there are creeping concerns at the community, clinical and political levels. Some of those command and control issues are now creeping back to the area that was the problem in the first place—the state bureaucracy in New South Wales not coping with questions of equity and population movement to high-growth areas like the North Coast of New South Wales.
I sincerely hope that the federal health minister, the Prime Minister and the federal cabinet have not walked away from the detail stage and that they are still very much engaged with what is happening in this detail phase of the proposals. If necessary we do not just use carrot; we also use stick in regard to tied grants and in relation to any mechanisms that keep the rhetoric pure. We see in practice what has been promised in this reform program, which is critical for communities, particularly for high-growth communities such as the mid-North Coast of New South Wales.
Pre COAG I was thrilled that for the first time in the history of the seat of Lyne we had a Prime Minister, regardless of political persuasion, walk through the door of a local hospital in the Lyne electorate. That reflects on the history of the Commonwealth and on the history of political representation nationally and in the seat of Lyne. I will also give credit where credit is due and say I think it reflects well on the Prime Minister that he was willing to get his hands dirty on the topic of health and was willing to get into the regions and meet with clinicians and communities. I know the Prime Minister cops criticism for being overexposed in hospitals but, for regional areas such as mine, when this was a first to have a Prime Minister walk through our hospital’s doors, it was well received, I can assure this place. Again, regardless of political persuasion or who holds office, I would hope that in the future we all encourage prime ministers to get into the regions, to get into regional hospitals and to be willing to get their hands dirty on some of these critical community issues around health services.
I was pleased he came through our doors. By logical extension, when he came back a second time, he was also the first Prime Minister ever to come back. I think that was welcomed as well. I know our clinicians, of all political persuasions, pitched a very strong case to the Prime Minister and did leave an impression, which could be seen in the language when he announced the health and hospital reforms. At the National Press Club it was hospitals in the Lyne electorate, Port Macquarie Base Hospital in particular, that were front and centre in those debates and in those policy releases.
From a community perspective that is very, very welcome because we have a history on the mid-North Coast of division over health. Port Macquarie Base Hospital was the Australian experiment in regard to privatised public services, which caused enormous divisions at a local, state and national level in regard to the ideologies in and around how health services are delivered at a community level. The Prime Minister’s visit was therefore a good moment for us to be a leading example in a positive way rather than one that is dragged down and used to clobber one political party or another over the head as a negative example.
I appeal to this place to keep health and hospital reform on the agenda and ask that no-one walks away now that we are in the detail stage—that we do not leave it to the same decision makers at a state level to make the same decisions for the same poor reasons. The regions matter, and equity in resource dollars also matters. I would hope the Commonwealth stays very engaged on that front.
We have a submission for a fourth wing at Port Macquarie Base Hospital. It is a large project of $70 million but it is to meet the growing needs in our area. None of this reform will fly in areas such as mine unless we deal with the capacity questions that are confronting us on a daily basis right now—that is, the issues of more beds, more bricks and mortar and more capacity for hospitals such as Port Macquarie Base Hospital. That submission sits and waits to be dealt with by, preferably, the state government—because capital is traditionally theirs—but, in this environment where reform is on and capital is in the game, I also have put that submission before the government. I urge them to deal with it sooner rather than later.
As well, we have put a submission in for what will hopefully be the next round of GP superclinics. That program has been broadly welcomed by both the community and the primary healthcare network locally. I am surprised at the politics around it and disappointed that some have chosen to oppose the concept of GP superclinics. It is a model that works. Aligning allied health and primary healthcare organisations generally into the one-stop shop concept is eminently sensible, particularly, I might add—from my old state parliament days—locating them as close to hospital emergency departments as possible to relieve pressures on emergency departments. I would certainly recommend that the minister for health once again look at our submission. It is exactly along those lines and includes a component on GP training. If government is going to make a contribution then there should be a contribution from the GP network to build a long-term GP structure for the future, as part of those who might receive some government support giving a bit of love back.
I flag the issue of mental health. I am not sure whether others have flagged it in this debate. There were a range of concerns expressed—including by the Chair of the National Advisory Council on Mental Health, John Mendoza—around the lack of support within this budget for mental health services. It does matter in regions such as mine. We have been traditionally underserviced. I was pleased we saw a change of budget position with regard to the ability of social workers and occupational therapists to participate in the delivery of mental health services. That was a sensible change after the budget. If it had not been changed, it would have had a huge impact in communities like mine. I make the pitch again, and I am sure there are others who have done so in this debate: mental health services are needed and they need much greater attention from government to get it right, because we have not got it right at the moment.
I noticed that John Mendoza also made some comments about Indigenous health services. The medical centre within my community that deals with 2,000 Indigenous residents made a very strong point to me—that is, there is largely no difference between Indigenous health issues and mental health issues. Of their clients, 70 per cent have mental health issues. We need to get our heads around—pardon the pun—a lot of these issues in a much better way from a policy perspective, because many people in the community are suffering and the services are not on the ground to meet the need.
I also want to mention education, while I have the chance. It is probably a nice segue from comments about silo thinking in public policy on issues such as Indigenous health and mental health. We have submissions before government within the education space around place based thinking. Our region has a pretty good track record of people making it through to year 12, but the figure is still frighteningly low at just over 50 per cent. For that to be the national average, I think, reflects on all of us and is something for us all to think about. Secondary school participation rates, in my view, are low; so why are they generally seen to be accepted?
We as a region have pretty good comparative levels of vocational education and training uptake, but traditionally we have had very poor tertiary education uptake. The Bradley review wants 40 per cent or higher of 25- to 34-year-olds to hold bachelor degrees by 2025, but our current levels on the mid-North Coast are 11 per cent. As a local community we need to get our skates on, but so does the federal government. There is a lot of very exciting work being done within the education space on low SES engagement and within the space of employment-education, and I welcome that, but we still face some challenges. I want to put on the record a comment in the DEEWR report—the government’s own report—that was released this week in the lead-up to the regional loading questions. The report focused specifically on engagement, access and participation rates in regional and remote areas. A comment in this report said that, based on administrative data—the government’s own data:
Regional and remote access and participation rates … have deteriorated over the last five years.
The report did not say ‘slowed’, it did not say ‘declined’; it said ‘deteriorated’. All of us who have read hundreds of government reports know that the language used in such reports is normally incredibly cautious and incredibly conservative. For a report to say ‘regional students’ access and participation has deteriorated’ is, I think, national emergency stuff.
If we treat as a national emergency a dispute with some mining executives then I would ask the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to have a conversation with the Deputy Prime Minister about the crisis of confidence with regional students’ access and participation rates and to get their skates on in turning this deterioration around. If we are serious about the national interest, if we are serious about meeting these Bradley targets—these ambitious and welcome Bradley targets—we need to deal with this issue now and turn around the trend which is saying that regional and remote students are not participating and not accessing education pathways. ‘Why not?’ is the question. And what is the government doing about it when it is a national emergency?
I also very quickly want to put on the record some issues about roads and bridges and the community regional infrastructure program. I am disappointed that this program has been cut. It has been treated as a stimulus only program. For regions such as mine, it was an absolute breath of fresh air to see Commonwealth funding going directly to local councils. It made a huge difference in their capital works programs. I would urge some reconsideration on that front and that it be an ongoing program. You do not have to be too much of a visionary to argue the case that such a program finishes the story around regionalism and the very point of the Commonwealth. You could argue that that job is only half done. Direct funding from the Commonwealth to local councils for community infrastructure was very welcome, and it is disappointing that it has been cut.
I have asked the government before, and I will ask it again, about a national timber bridge fund. It might sound small scale to some in this place but it is not for people who live on the North Coast of New South Wales. This issue affects not only my electorate but also that of the member for Page, who spoke before me. The town of Kyogle has the highest number of failing timber bridges in Australia. In the land of valleys and hills, these timber bridges are the lifeblood of many people. We cannot leave it to local councils to deal with this issue when the bridges are all failing around the same time, en masse. Councils are rate pegged in New South Wales and simply do not have the budgets to deal with this situation. It is a shame that, in 2010, we see one level of government struggling for money while the other two levels of government are splashing it around. I once again ask the government to consider this matter.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2009-2010 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010. The budget that was handed down by the Treasurer is a responsible budget. It is a budget that will return the financial position of the Commonwealth to surplus in three years time. That is three years ahead of schedule. It is a responsible budget because it recognises that, after having invested in key areas of the economy throughout the global financial crisis and having supported jobs and delivered the economic activity that flowed from the stimulus measures, it is now time for us to build for the future and build for recovery.
I note the success of those stimulus measures. The national accounts which were released yesterday really underlined the significance of the stimulus measures and their impact on the economy. The national accounts show that the economy grew by 0.5 per cent for the March quarter. That is a rate of 2.7 per cent annualised. Australia continues to be, as a result of these measures, one of the best-performing economies in the world. CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian said:
If these measures—
that is, the stimulus measures—
were not in the mix, effectively the Australian economy would have been broadly flat or even negative.
Scott Haslem, the UBS chief economist, said:
Traditionally economic growth has been split 80-20 between the private and public sector. Over the last year it was 60-40 in favour of the public sector as the private sector struggled.
So you can clearly see that, had it not been for that investment by the public sector to support jobs, to stimulate demand, the economy would not have been able to record the growth figures that have been achieved. Justin Smirk, St George chief economist, said:
Domestic demand, fired up by government spending and fiscal handouts, is the key driver for now …
Clearly these respected market economists have concluded that the stimulus measures were integral to the achievement of that growth that has just been reported. I remind the House that those opposite voted against those stimulus measures. Had we not been able to secure the support of others in the other place, then we would not have been able to do what we did in steering the Australian economy through the global financial crisis, supporting jobs and making sure that the economy continued to grow and to grow strongly.
I wish to refer to a couple of graphs, which I will later seek leave to incorporate into the Hansard. In particular I would like to draw attention to a graph that is described as ‘Fiscal position the envy of the world’. When we look at this graph, we can see in very stark terms that, when it comes to our fiscal position—returning the budget to surplus in three years, three years ahead of schedule—Australia is outperforming the rest of the advanced economies. If we look at the graph that is referred to as ‘Net debt peaks dramatically lower’, we see in very stark terms that Australia’s net debt is at much more manageable levels than that of any comparable economy throughout the advanced world. This is as a result of good economic management over many years in this country, over several administrations. Reform initiatives that were undertaken by the Hawke and Keating governments and the budgetary position that was maintained—notwithstanding the escalation in spending—under the Howard government allowed the Australian economy to weather the storm through the good financial management of this government.
I want to refer to a couple of measures that are set out in the budget. In particular, I want to talk about health, because health is one of the key issues that take a very prominent place within the budget. We have delivered $7.3 billion over five years starting from 2009-10, including $417 million for more after-hours GP access, including 24-hour hotlines, and $355 million for 23 new GP superclinics. I heard the member for Lyne, who is very passionate in advocating the needs of his community, talk about the need for a GP superclinic in his community. The member for Lyne had better be quick or he had better hope for the re-election of the Rudd Labor government, because without a Rudd Labor government that program, that investment in GP superclinics, will be ripped away by Tony Abbott. This is the same Tony Abbott who, when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing, ripped a billion dollars out of the health system. He now wants to rip away another $820 million of health funding. He ripped a billion dollars away in government and now in opposition he wants to rip away $820 million. There is no end to his determination to rip away base levels of funding within the health system.
If we have a look at the important area of education we see that there is a further attack that has been mounted by the opposition in relation to trades training centres. I am fortunate to come into this place and represent a community that has secured funding for two trades training centres delivering trades training opportunities in 13 local schools in my community. That program is going to be cut, the heart ripped out of it by the spending cuts that have been proposed by the opposition leader. Computers in schools has been a fantastic program. Come into the schools in my community and see the progress that has been made. So many of them had ratios of fewer than one computer for every eight students and secured funding in the first round of this program. We now have all of our local schools, years 9 to 12, running at a ratio of one computer to every two students. We have a determination to reduce that to one to one. Those on the other side want to rip away the funds that have already been allocated for this program. They want to ensure that the schools in my community will not have the opportunity to move from the ratio of one to two to one to one. I will be fighting hard on this issue because I know how important it is for the educational opportunities of young people in my community. In fact, in my community approximately a thousand computers will not be delivered if there is a change of government. In terms of national partnership funding, I see that there is also an attack on measures that are targeted towards teacher training and teaching quality. Schools in my community are getting the benefit of those funds and they will be subject to those cuts and those attacks.
I want to mention briefly skills, and in particular the Apprenticeship Kickstart program which has been a fantastic program that has delivered massive benefits in a community such as mine. If we have a look at the impact this has had on apprenticeship startups through the global financial crisis, we see that from December 2007 to February 2008 there were 212 apprenticeships taken up. From December 2008 to February 2009 it dropped to 165. Then have a look at what happened after Kickstart kicked in. It got the numbers up to 243, not only returning those figures to pre-GFC levels but exceeding them, giving more young people in my community opportunities to learn trades, to develop their skills and to move into those parts of the economy that require those skills so desperately. Those on the other side would attack these sorts of programs.
I will briefly refer to the resource super profits tax and what an important initiative this is for delivering benefits right across the economy, ensuring that the entire Australian economy, all of the Australian people, secure the benefits from the exploitation of our nation’s mineral wealth. We will ensure that money is directed towards key initiatives that will stimulate and liberate economic activity right across the economy. There are cuts in company tax rates to 28 per cent—we are the only party proposing to cut company tax. Those on the other side, with their paid parental leave, that sham of a policy—

Mr Ciobo interjecting—
—The member for Moncrieff knows that it is a sham of a policy. I do not believe he would ever have supported this if he was in any party room discussions that decided this because he knows it is a sham. It is an impost that has been imposed upon business, and arbitrarily on big business. Why? Because they had to find the money somehow.
The RSPT is about ensuring that all Australians secure the benefits of the exploitation of our mineral resources. They are a finite resource, they are non-renewable. They are the resources of the Australian people and once they are dug up and shipped off overseas, every time that happens a little bit of Australia’s natural wealth is exhausted, dissipated. That is why it is so important that we are able to capture some of the benefit of that and spread it right across the economy to ensure that communities such as mine in Western Sydney are able to get some of the benefit of that. When the Reserve Bank makes its judgments on whether or not to increase interest rates it takes into account the rapid growth, the capacity constraints and all of the challenges that occur in places like Western Australia and Queensland. Meanwhile, those small businesses in Western Sydney doing it tough get slugged with the same increases in interest rates where those capacity constraints lead to that effect.
What we say is, ‘Let’s share the benefits.’ Let us make sure that small businesses in communities like mine get a tax cut, get an opportunity to build on the investment allowance that we introduced during the global financial crisis and get a one-off deduction of up to $5,000 on their capital items that they purchase to invest in the future of their business.
We say that we should be investing in superannuation. I note that those on the other side always want to tell us, in the debate that we are having at the moment, that they support superannuation and that they think we should increase it but just not yet. With all of these things it is: ‘Just not yet.’ Their attitude is: ‘Yes, we believe in an adequate retirement savings, but most of the people that we represent, well, they can adequately provide for that above and beyond what might be compulsory contributions, so the rest of the unwashed masses should be happy with nine per cent until we determine at some future point that they might be entitled to it.’
They have never supported superannuation. They opposed it from the start and they continue to oppose it today. I want to quote the Leader of the Opposition because this particular quote puts in very stark contrast the position of this side, the government, and what we want to do for working people to boost their retirement savings, and the approach of the Leader of the Opposition. He said this in 1995, but I have to say that comments he has made more recently reinforce this view. In 1995 he said:
Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.
It is not a con job; it is an initiative that has delivered one of the biggest funds management sectors in the world. There is $1.1 trillion under management. It has assisted in steering us through the global financial crisis. This is a great achievement this country has put in place and we want to build upon it. We want to make sure that everyday people in my community are able to retire with a decent standard of living.
I would like to conclude by saying that the trilogy response to the budget was like a play within a play within a play. But, when we finally drilled down to what the response was, it was about opposing the things that will build a more prosperous future for Australia, going into recovery. It was about opposing health spending—but are we surprised, from someone who has a record of ripping money out of the system? It was about opposing superannuation—but are we surprised, from someone who is on record as saying it is the biggest con job ever foisted on the Australian people? It is about opposing infrastructure spending—but are we surprised, from those who spent all of those years in government failing to invest in the infrastructure needs of this country and building capacity constraints that ultimately led to the interest rate increases that they told us we would never have because they said they would keep them at record lows. All they did was lie to the Australian people. They failed to tell the Australian people that the Reserve Bank makes these judgments independently. To the extent that they could contribute to taking the pressure off interest rates by investing in infrastructure, they were asleep at the wheel and failed.
We have someone who is also opposed to the resource super profits tax and opposed to putting a price on carbon. This is an opposition led by leader that is opposed—
 (Mrs MA May)—I draw the member’s attention to the word ‘lie’ and I ask him to please withdraw that comment from his statement.
—If that suits you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. What the opposition and particularly the Leader of the Opposition stand for is opposing things—oppose, oppose, oppose. If you really want to have a look at what it is that they stand for, when you strip away all of the hot air that is the opposition of the opposition, they stand for one thing and that is Work Choices. They stand for ripping away the standards, the conditions and the wages of working people. They did it when they were in office and the sad reality is that they failed to hear the message the Australian people sent them at the last election, and that was: ‘Get your hands off our penalty rates, get your hands off our unfair dismissal protections and get your hands off the protections that mean that we are not forced to go into workplaces and bargain one-on-one with an employer that has vastly superior bargaining power.’ They were the messages that they sent to the former government. The failure of this opposition to hear those messages is something I intend to spend every waking hour between now and the next election informing and advising my community about. I seek leave to have the graphs I referred to incorporated in Hansard.
—I advise the member that a previous speaker also sought to have similar documents incorporated. I advise you that the incorporation of the documents will only be granted if the documents meet the Speaker’s requirements. The graphs appear on page 5265 of today’s Hansard.
—I understand that.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I am certainly pleased to have this opportunity to speak in the cognate debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills—in other words, on the Rudd Labor government’s most recent budget. It is instrumental when looking at the Rudd Labor government’s performance over the past almost three years to look at the way in which this government has truly come to fruition in terms of the promises it has made to the Australian people and how much it has actually delivered. It is instructive when you look at the journey of the Rudd Labor government and at the state of the nation’s economy to look at who it is we now have governing this country and what their philosophical and ideological beliefs are.
We know in 2007 that the Prime Minister stood before the Australian people and said, ‘Elect me because I am fiscally responsible, I am economically conservative and you can trust me.’ Shortly after being elected the Prime Minister wrote a treatise effectively in which he spoke about the dangers of neoliberalism, about the great concerns that he had about capitalism and about the structures that this country and others have had in place for decades. He did it in the context of global economic tumult as a consequence of the so-called GFC. I have no doubt that, within the core of the man who is our Prime Minister, there is a wholly unreconstructed socialist who is pulling the levers of the economy of this country.
As a young man growing up I often heard comments about former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Gough Whitlam is heralded as being among the greatest of the Labor pantheon. He was a man who represented all the greatest ideals of the Australian Labor Party. His approach to government in a short period of time—I would argue, with my knowledge of history, it was too long a period of time—did incredible economic damage to this country. A common statement was that the very last thing Australia needed was another Gough Whitlam. I almost thought it was common knowledge. Unfortunately, that is where we find ourselves with this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister and his Labor government in less than three years have brought profound change to this country, and I predict it will take decades to repair the damage that has been done.
We know the former coalition government, in 12 years in office, did a number of notable things. Among them was the full repayment of $96 billion of Labor Party debt. The Labor Party have form when it comes to managing the nation’s finances and their form is to spend big and to tax big. Every time Labor are in power in this country they spend recklessly and then have to raise taxes to pay off their debt. Every time Labor are in power they drive the budget into deficit. Every time Labor are in power there is a reason why it has to happen. This government once again, true to form, have done exactly that.
So after 12 years of diligent, disciplined, safe stewardship by the former Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, the coalition paid off in full Labor’s $96 billion debt. We effectively lifted a burden off future generations of young Australians so that they would not have to pay the price for the ridiculous and reckless spending of the previous Labor government. We got the budget back into the black, and because we had paid off the debt and had the budget back in surplus, we were able to ensure that instead of paying billions of dollars every year towards the repayment of Labor Party debt, that money was better able to be channelled into the programs that the Australian people needed.
It was done in two ways. One was through investment in issues like health, education and infrastructure, and the second was through the provision of tax cuts, meaningful tax reform and personal income tax cuts. Those tax cuts, when it came to personal income taxes, amounted to around $150 billion. Our tax reform package, which Labor opposed, included the abolition of wholesale sales tax, which was being levied—I think from memory—at 12, 22 and 32 per cent, and it was replaced by a single growth tax, the GST, with all the funds flowing directly to state governments so that they had an ongoing source of revenue. That was the tax reform legacy of the coalition. More than that, the previous coalition government brought about reforms which actually reduced this nation’s unemployment level to a 30-year record low, to below four per cent. So I believe on any measure that Australians can be justifiably proud of the performance of the previous coalition government.
Contrast that with what we see happening under the appropriations bill and the performance of this government. We know that there was global economic tumult. We know that there was some need for some stimulus of the Australian economy. But the problem is that what the Labor Party gave the Australian people was not what they promised or what the Australian people wanted. What the Labor Party has given all Australians—and, most distressingly, future generations of young Australians—is debt and deficit. In the short course of around two years this Labor government has racked up what is expected to be net peak debt of around $95 billion. So we spent 12 years paying off the debt that Labor gave us, only to have them in two short years turn around and deliver another $95 billion of debt. That is the indictment on the Australian Labor Party, because it will be my children and the children of tomorrow that have to pay off Labor’s debt.
Frankly, I—and, I know, many other people in the community—get fed up with Labor Party politicians and with this Prime Minister and this Treasurer marching around the country claiming to be Santa Claus, saying, ‘If you do not like spending on schools, then get out of our way. If you do not like spending on these projects, get out of our way. If you do not like spending on this new initiative that we have got, get out of our way.’ I say right back to the Australian Labor Party—what I believe in and I know young Australians believe in—and that is: let us have sustainable spending and value for money, not the kind of ridiculous, wasteful, reckless spending that we see from this government, which has absolutely scant regard for value for money and for what Australian taxpayers work damned hard for. Australian taxpayers can spend their money a lot better than Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan, and it is disgraceful that the Labor Party would dare to stand up and argue that $600,000 school canteens and $1 million covered outdoor learning centres, which only two years ago had a cost of around $200,000, are in some way justifiable given the economic tumult.
It is absurd that Labor Party politicians would say to future generations of Australians: ‘Yes, we know we promised that we were going to provide a computer to every child in school between year 9 and year 12. We know we have only delivered 25 per cent of that—one in four. And we know that the cost has doubled to now be in excess of $2 billion. But that doesn’t matter. It’s only a billion dollars!’ So a billion dollars on computers in schools, several billion dollars under the so-called Building the Education Revolution, billions of dollars wasted under the solar program, homes burning down under their completely bungled and botched insulation program—and Labor members have the audacity to look Australians in the eye and say, ‘We’re doing a good job.’ How patently absurd.
I went to the opening recently of one of these new so-called education revolution buildings at one of my schools in Moncrieff. I endured a Labor senator standing there and waxing lyrical about how visionary the BER was and how it was a record investment in Australia’s school needs. I had the opportunity to speak, and when I stood up in front of those children I said to them: ‘You should enjoy this building. The community should own this building because, you know what, the community is going to take decades to pay off the debt that put that building there—decades to repay the $95 billion of debt that needs to be repaid.’
We hear the sophistry of the Treasurer when he says, ‘We’re going to get Australia back in the black in three years time,’ as if in some way it is a credit to their economic stewardship. But they will not have Australia back in the black in three years time. They might, if everything goes exactly according to their overly optimistic forecasts, get Australia’s budget a billion dollars back into surplus, but the $95 billion debt will still be there—and it will be there for decades. So when I see people like the member for Lindsay, who spoke prior to me, stand up and crow that Labor has Australia in the lowest net debt position in the Western world, I am forced to scratch my head over what an incredibly misleading tale Labor members provide in this parliament. The reason that Australia has the lowest level of debt in the Western world is because of the starting point: zero net debt—in fact, nearly $50 billion worth of assets.

Ms Owens interjecting—
—How incredible that Labor members sit in the chamber now and shake their head, no. Fifty billion dollars of net assets is an inescapable fact, and it has been your government that has eroded that $50 billion of assets and left us now with $95 billion of debt. The members opposite can laugh—
—Laughing at your ignorance!
—but that just highlights how completely ignorant they are of the facts. Labor members do not appreciate when you go from a net savings position of $50 billion of surplus—which they have expended in full—to leaving Australia with net peak debt of $95 billion, that in some way that is wrong.
—It’s wrong!
—Well, I would dearly love to hear from Labor members who claim that that is wrong. I would love to hear them explain how that is wrong and attempt to justify to future generations of Australians that they have to pay off the debt that this government has left. I would dare say about the robustness than their arguments that, frankly, this piece of paper would have more strength.
What else have Labor said they will be able to do? What else have they promised the Australian people that they have absolutely failed to deliver on? We know that Australians are justifiably very concerned about the state of health. On the Gold Coast, Australia’s sixth largest and fastest-growing city, we have a number of unique pressures on the public health system. That is part of the reason the former coalition government put so much emphasis on driving people who could afford to pay into private health insurance through incentivisation. We knew that the more people there were in the private health system, the less pressure was placed on the public health system.
Unfortunately, our good work in the area has been undone. When in government, we lifted the level of private insurance coverage from the low 30s up to, in my electorate for example, the mid-50s. That meant that more people were using the private system because they were incentivised and they could afford to use the private system. But, because of Labor’s absolute ideological commitment to socialised health, we have now seen them slowly unpick at the edge of that. Kevin Rudd, prior to the last election, stood up and said that he promised not to touch private health insurance, but, as with so many of the promises of this Prime Minister, it meant nothing. One of their first acts in government was to start to erode the effectiveness of the private medical insurance scheme by playing around with thresholds. There are projections that this would force up to a million people who were privately insured onto the public system. That is Labor’s solution: to push people who were not a burden on the public system and who were actually utilising the private system back into public hospitals.
To compound the problem, the Labor Party said it would deal with this effectively through the rollout of what it called GP superclinics. Apart from the fact that the GP superclinic model has been lambasted by medical practitioners, we also know that in a city like the Gold Coast, Australia’s sixth largest city, not a single GP superclinic has been built or promised—not one. The Gold Coast is Australia’s sixth largest city, with a population of 500,000 people, and this government, which hails itself to be the greatest thing since sliced bread, has neither promised nor built a single GP superclinic there. The government has made the problem worse by taking people from the private system into the public system. Is it any wonder that Australians are scratching their heads about what exactly this Labor government is up to? It is not delivering services. It is, in fact, compounding problems. It is little wonder that the Gold Coast hospital is so frequently on bypass. It is little wonder that Gold Coast residents and residents in my electorate are forced to go up to Brisbane because of the incredible neglect of the public health system on the Gold Coast.
Another promise that was made by Rudd Labor ahead of the election was to end the double drop-off. How many times did we hear the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister talk about how Labor would end the double drop-off? They were going to create 260 childcare centres across the country that would enable working mums and fathers to make a single drop-off of their children at school and child care at the same time. Now, as with all the other false and hollow promises of Rudd and of Rudd Labor, this has also been axed. This was yet another promise where, suddenly, apparently the market radically transformed itself in two years, so now they no longer need to build these childcare centres.
The truth is that the Rudd Labor government would say anything to get elected and then just junk it after the election. That is what has happened. But we were warned. The current Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, the member for Kingsford Smith, said—and was in fact quoted by a radio announcer ahead of the last election when he made a remark in one of the airport lounges—that it did not really matter what Labor said, because they would just change everything once they got elected. Now we see the absolute truth of that statement.
So it is little wonder, then, when it comes to Labor’s performance, that this Prime Minister says he is an economic conservative, but then writes extensively boring essays on neoliberalism, runs up $41 billion of debt in this budget alone and has $95 billion of net debt forecast for this country. It is little wonder when he promises a computer for every child from grade 9 to grade 12 but then only delivers, in my own electorate for example, 16 per cent of those computers. This is a Prime Minister who promises the Australian people that he will not touch private medical insurance but then seeks to unpick it and pull it apart; a Prime Minister who promises that he will be strong on border protection but then does everything he can to completely dilute and water down our border protection policies; a Prime Minister who says that he knows and understands small business but then creates incentives which are totally ineffectual because they rely on small business cash flow; a Prime Minister who says that he understands the needs of older Australians who are self-funded retirees but then proposes an obscene 40 per cent extra tax on the industry that has helped to make this country strong and the economic powerhouse that it is; and a Prime Minister who erodes the retirement savings of older Australians, both those who hold shares in mining companies and, through his threatened exploitation of Telstra’s provision of copper cable, those who hold shares in Telstra.
On each of these fronts, is it any wonder that Australians have lost faith, confidence and trust in our Prime Minister? The track record of this Labor government is appalling. Australians can see straight through this Prime Minister and straight through this Labor government. It is best summed up in a comment that was made by one of my colleagues. He said that Kevin Rudd is just like Gough Whitlam but lacking the conviction.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Rea, Kerry, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to give my very strong support to the budget that was delivered by the Treasurer in this House a couple of weeks ago. In so doing I also acknowledge comments that were made by the member for Moncrieff regarding Gough Whitlam. I think it is important to remind the House and those listening that, if he was such a terrible Prime Minister and if it was not for the investment in social infrastructure, support for community services and development through education thus ending discrimination and other measures, my colleague the member for Parramatta—indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister and many other women in this House and I—would not be here. Unfortunately we would see a parliament still full of people mostly like the member for Moncrieff, which I am sure everybody would agree is not necessarily a good thing. We need different perspectives in this parliament and sometimes we need the facts.
I congratulate the Treasurer for the budget that he has delivered, but I offer just one piece of advice to him, which is the fact that he has undersold his achievements in this budget. We heard from the Treasurer that this would be a no-frills budget, a fairly financially conservative budget and measured in its response to dealing with the global financial crisis. It is certainly setting Australia down the path of returning to surplus and is looking at ways in which we could reduce our deficit and be a responsible economic government. However, what the Treasurer has not done is acknowledge that he has managed to do all of that. He has managed to produce a budget that is financially responsible, that sets the nation in good stead for the years ahead, that takes us down a path which will see peak debt halved and will see the budget return to surplus in just three years, which is some three years less than was originally predicted.
He has done that and at the same time also delivered some very key, important economic reforms to all sectors of the Australian community. Whether you are a young person looking for a job, or a woman in the workforce caring for your family, or someone looking at going into the aged care system or someone who is concerned not just about our economic sustainability but about our environmental sustainability with the Renewable Energy Fund, there are a whole range of measures in this budget which deliver some very important reforms and very important initiatives to support the Australian community. At the same time we are doing so in a very responsible economic environment which sees us addressing the issue of the deficit and reducing our debt. I commend the Treasurer on the budget that he has delivered and I think it is a very significant one for the times that we are currently living through.
I will particularly mention a few of the things in here that I think are very important not just to the nation but to the community of Bonner, which is the electorate that I represent. To begin with, we have the health announcements. Nobody can possibly decry the significance of a $7.3 billion spend on health. We all know that wherever you are in this country, whether you are in a metropolitan city or a rural and regional area, there is an issue with accessing good-quality health services when you need them. This budget goes a long way to improving those services for people regardless of where they are. In particular I am very interested to see more around the Medicare Locals and e-health initiatives. There is $417 million for Medicare Locals, a service which will give people the sort of after-hours access to medical advice and care that they currently cannot get. They cannot get it because there are not enough doctors in our suburbs to be able to service that need. They cannot get it because we have not been clever about the way we can use the skills of nurses, doctors and allied health professionals to see more people receiving advice more quickly.
As I have said many times before in this House, we all know—and I know personally as a mother of three—that, if a child is going to get an ear infection, it is not going to happen from nine to five, Monday to Friday. You can almost count on that being the very time it is not going to happen. The fact that people will now be able to seek after-hours advice through GP services, that they will be able to either contact the National Health Call Centre Network or get advice from a nurse or a doctor or be sent to a service in their local area that they know is open after hours and that will be able to see their children, is a fantastic initiative that will not just see extra dollars go into health but see extra dollars go into health that are going to make a difference for the wellbeing of our community.
On top of that, there is the $467 million set aside for e-health and developing e-health records. When I have spoken to my health professionals in Bonner, they have said to me that the one thing they believe could improve the health system significantly is the opportunity for a national e-health system. They see so many people unnecessarily hospitalised or unnecessarily traumatised because, in an emergency in particular, health professionals dealing with that person do not have the data and the background of their overall health record. They do not necessarily know all the medication they are taking. They do not know their past health history. If they were able to access that instantaneously, it would reduce the amount of trauma that people go through when they are being wrongly diagnosed or given medication that is not compatible with other medication that they are on. It can actually prevent people needing to go to hospital because you can provide a much better diagnosis based on their whole medical history. It is a very significant initiative and one that I know is welcomed by the profession.
Of course, health is not the only winner in this budget. We have heard a lot of discussion about environment policy, the issues of climate change and the support for a trading scheme. Personally, I am incredibly disappointed that the opposition did not take the initiative in the Senate to support the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. I am very disappointed that the Greens, who have set themselves up as the party that most cares for the environment and is most committed to seeing a reduction in emissions, did not take the opportunity to see a trading scheme go through the Senate when they had it. I think it is one of the biggest disappointments that I and my local community have seen in the last couple of years. But I know that we as a government have not resiled from our commitment to put a price on carbon and to look at ways to get the big polluters and the industries involved to pay their fair share in reducing emissions. Nevertheless, we know that this is an ongoing debate and one that we the government will not walk away from until we get a good result.
In the meantime, the Treasurer has had the foresight to put into this budget some $652 million for a renewable energy fund, because we all know that, if there is one single way in which we can reduce emissions, it is changing our dependence on carbon and fossil fuels. We have to look at ways we can boost renewable energy. It is not going to happen overnight but it is going to happen. It is going to happen with a government that is prepared to put funding into research and development and to support the small initiatives out there that will probably one day become mainstream with the right level of support and endorsement. We are going to encourage the community to reduce their emissions by changing the source of their energy and by looking at ways in which they can seek alternative energy sources that are renewable. So this fund is a significant step in the government’s commitment to dealing with climate change and taking action—not paying lip-service but actually putting in place initiatives and policies that will see genuine outcomes on the reduction of carbon emissions across this country.
I am also very pleased to see that there is $661 million—in fact more than that—in this budget for skills training and support for youth employment and education policies. One of the biggest things that has confronted us and something that industry has been saying for years in this country—and it has become crystal clear throughout the global financial crisis and the government’s response to it—is that, while we were benefiting from a major resources boom and while the accounts of the country were rising significantly, we were not planning for the future to make that boom sustainable. We were not investing in the infrastructure that we need to support our export industry, particularly the resources industry. We were not investing in the ports, the rail, the roads and all of that very important physical infrastructure required to get the stuff out of the ground and get it to wherever it needs to be.
More importantly, we know that industry was also saying that we were not investing in the workforce. We were not putting much-needed programs and policies in place that were skilling up our young people to take advantage of a continued and more sustainable resources boom. Luckily for the young people in Bonner and for the young people across Australia, we now have a Rudd Labor government that understands the cry from industry and has answered their call. This government understands how important long-term secure employment is not just for economy prosperity but for social prosperity. We are putting money into much greater skills and training programs that will see a long-term benefit over the forward years.
As I said, we have invested over $661 million in reforms and programs to increase our skills base. This will ensure that our training system is responsive to the skills that our economy needs to prosper. It will provide the sorts of jobs that people need in terms of economic growth. It will mean that young people, regardless of who they are or where they come from, will have opportunities to contribute to that growth. This will mean that they can seek the advantages of those programs and they can be valuable contributors to economic growth in this country.
The Skills for Recovery Program will provide, over four years, $299 million—nearly $300 million—to look at capacity constraints and to create up to 39,000 training places. It will supply $242.5 million over four years to develop training systems that will support participation, support training and support the link between the training that is needed and the businesses that are looking for employees. The Foundation Skills Package will help 140,000 Australians build core foundation skills such as language, literacy and numeracy.
I know that, when the huff and puff of various debates is set aside, every single member of this House will acknowledge the enormous contribution that people who have come here from other countries have made to the building of Australia. I know that everyone in every electorate across this country can identify those migrant communities and individual people who have migrated here who have built up an enormous strength in terms of their contribution both socially and as part of the economic growth of this country. In fact, we could not have done it without them. Here is a program that will provide support for another 140,000 Australians who, with the benefit of some basic skills—such as literacy, numeracy and language—will be able to continue that very valuable contribution that people from other countries who have migrated here have made.
I also acknowledge the significant contribution in this budget to the aged care system. We all know we are facing an ageing population. We all know that aged care, in a sense, is the elephant in the room. It is the very huge financial and social policy debate that we will have in the next couple of years. If we do not get right the mix between adequate funding and good programs to support both the not-for-profit and private sectors in providing aged care facilities, many Australians will not get in their older years the care that they deserve. In this budget there is $907½ million over the next four years to deliver better aged care workers, greater training, more staff and capital support—that is, all of those things that go into making an aged care facility not just good or adequate but actually a lovely place to be, a place where people will enjoy their retirement and enjoy all the support that they need as they get older and frailer.
There are many other initiatives in this budget that I unfortunately have not got the time to talk about. I just want to acknowledge the increase in funding for international development assistance, particularly in my role as Chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am so pleased that, even despite financial constraints, we are committing to increasing funding to support our goal in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I am also very pleased to see the historical increase in funding for legal assistance. We all know that the difference between getting legal aid and not having access to good quality legal assistance can make the difference for a young person between getting their life back on track and going completely off track for the rest of their life, with them being a burden rather than a contributor to our community. It is a very important part of the budget and I commend this and the other programs and congratulate the Treasurer on his efforts.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—I rise to address the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills. The third budget handed down by the current Labor government will go down in Australian history books as being the hypothetical budget. It is based on a wing and a prayer. It is based on robbing the resource industry and it is based on dreams and hypotheses. This budget is not worth the paper it has been written on. The Rudd government took office with a coalition created surplus to the tune of $45 billion. Three years later, here we are looking down the barrel of debt, debt and more debt. Reckless spending and gross mismanagement of taxpayers’ dollars will result in Australian families wearing the millstone of debt for many years to come. Prime Minister Rudd’s unfettered access to the taxpayers’ money is akin to Scrooge McDuck going for a daily dip in his cash filled bins. I can picture Mr Rudd throwing the cash in the air and yelling: ‘Ah, mirth and be merry. My worries are over! I will kill the golden goose. I will make resource companies pay the highest tax in the world, and that should make Australia the richest land in duck world.’
It is now time for the Labor government to put their comic books down, to stop imagining themselves as cartoon characters and superheroes and to understand the gravity of the situation they are about to place all Australians in with the introduction of what they call a tax on ‘superprofits’. Superprofits are apparently profits in excess of just six per cent. The Labor government believe that, by taxing the resource industry at the highest rate in the world, they will increase investment. This creative and imaginative thinking may be applicable in duck world but the reality is that it will not work in the real world.
So why is the Rudd government willing to put at risk the living standards of all Australians? I will tell you. Firstly, he needs to claw back revenue to cover the cost of his cash splash that is now costing all Australians in higher interest rates. Secondly, his polling of south-eastern Australia has convinced him that he can keep people from the truth and con them into believing he is some sort of modern day Robin Hood, robbing the rich to give to the poor. And thirdly, he believes, or so he tells us, that miners are not paying enough tax.
On Monday, 31 May in the House, the Prime Minister said in defence of his great big new tax on mining: ‘Whichever way you cut the cake the return to the Australian people via the taxation system is infinitely less than it was a decade ago.’ On Tuesday, in a question to the Prime Minister, I asked him how he could reconcile that statement with data compiled by Access Economics, Treasury, ATO and ABS which show that the total tax-take from mining over the last decade has increased from $2.6 billion to $21.9 billion. How could he describe tax revenues, which have increased by more than eight times, as ‘infinitely less’? Mr Rudd gave no explanation whatsoever.
Let us look at some cold, hard facts. Australian projects compete with other projects in other countries for capital. Obviously, less profitable projects will not be looked upon as favourably by investors as those which are more profitable. This is just plain common sense. The Labor government has assumed there will be no change to the perceived level of sovereign risk in Australia with this new super tax. Capital and currency market initial reactions to the announcement suggest the perceived sovereign risk has increased. According to the Australian, Macquarie Bank advised clients that Australia was ‘now seen as being a high sovereign risk destination to invest’ and there was a ‘significant risk of major capital flight out of Australia’. BHP Billiton CEO Marius Kloppers warned that Australia was in danger of ‘tarnishing’ its reputation as the ‘gold standard’ of investment destination for mining companies. According to Mr Kloppers, ‘it would be extremely unlikely to think that we can approve a major investment while this uncertainty hangs over us’.
The impact that this tax will have on investment and projects is immeasurable. The resource industry of Australia, the very same industry that has fed and clothed Australians for many years, did not happen by chance. Ingenuity, planning, resourcefulness, belief and, most importantly, hard work, often in the face of great adversity, have all contributed to the now successful industry. Many towns in regional Australia have been built on the back of resource companies. These companies provide the population with infrastructure such as airstrips, hospitals, schools, police stations, ports and roads that local towns and communities enjoy.
The mining sector has paid $80 billion in tax over the last decade. That is $80 billion dollars back into the communities of Australia, and the Rudd government has the audacity to tell us that putting this tax collection at risk will not affect the living standards of everyday Australians. What gibberish! This same sector paid eight times more tax last year than it did a decade ago.
The Treasurer’s Economic Note dated 23 May 2010 stated:
…  wholly-domestic mining companies paid an effective tax rate of only 17 per cent and multinational mining companies paid an effective tax rate of only 13 per cent—both dramatically below the headline company tax rate of 30 per cent.
In reality ATO statistics show that for 2007-08 the mining industry as a whole paid 27.8 per cent effective corporate tax rate, and that rate equates to 41.3 per cent when royalties are included. BHP Billiton, year ending June 2009, had an effective tax rate inclusive of royalties of 43 per cent. BHP Billiton alone, between 2004 and 2009, paid total taxes of over $24 billion. These taxes are helping to support the entire nation—a nation where the majority of the population is on the eastern seaboard and the majority of whom have never even seen a remote mine site. Yet these same people are being conned by the Labor government and lulled into a false sense of security that there will be more money in the coffers for them. Well, let me tell you: there will be no extra cash coming from my patch if this great big new tax is introduced.
Already Fortescue Metals has put $17.5 billion of its projects on hold, due entirely to this great big new tax and its far-reaching effects. Steve de Kruijff, Chief Operating Officer for Xstrata Copper North Queensland, said in a press release:
We have decided to suspend exploration activities in north Queensland until there is greater certainty on the fiscal regime for future mining developments. Exploration activities are high risk and, while the targets we had identified are prospective, the proposed tax has introduced great uncertainty about the potential impact on the economics of developing resources into viable operations in Australia. It would also change the relative economics of these prospects compared with exploration programs that Xstrata Copper is pursuing in other parts of the world.
Oz Minerals chief executive, Terry Burgess, in a statement to shareholders regarding the impact of this great big new tax on the Western Copper project in South Australia, stated:
… in light of the proposed resources industry tax, we will be unable to make a decision on this project until we have certainty on the proposed tax arrangements and therefore the economics of the project.
According to Ivor Ries, Head of Research at EL&C Baillieu Stockbroking, as published in the Eureka Report:
There are 270 major resource projects in Australia undergoing feasibility studies and financing with a total capital value of $320 billion. These projects would have employed somewhere around about 120,000 people during the construction phase. The Resources Super Profits Tax has stopped them dead in their tracks. All of those projects are now frozen.
Never before has a proposed government policy had such a direct effect on my electorate. You, Mr Rudd, are dudding the people in my patch and we won’t stand for it.
Ashok Parekh, a local chartered accountant with over 3,000 clients in the Goldfields, has been a chartered accountant for 32 years and has been operating his own company for 25 years. In 2003 he received a Centenary Medal from the government and last year he was awarded the highest award of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Meritorious Service Award. Here is what he has to say:
I have lost faith due to the recent performance of the Rudd Government. I think they have lost the plot. What the Federal Government is doing is very similar to the old communist system. The tax is bad for all Australians. We have suddenly become a sovereign risk with all the mining companies in the world. Already mining companies are finding it difficult to raise funds because of this tax. We are also finding in the Goldfields there is reduction in turnover for retailers because the general public are scared of what is going to happen. The idea that lots of small businesses are going to benefit from the company tax, reducing from 30 to 20 per cent is misleading. Most small business are set up in structure of either number one, a sole trader, number two, a partnership and number three, a family trust. None of the structures will get the benefit in the company tax because they are not companies.
In Kalgoorlie we have an electronic notice board, or a ticker board, on the Palace Hotel, the most prominent position in town. While it usually displays financial information, right now it says ‘Kevin Super Tax, High-Interest, Insulation Rudd has got to go, no batts about it.’ If this does not indicate the feeling of true Australians, true Australians who have not fallen prey to Kevin Rudd’s spin about the great big new tax, what does? The Labor Party need to listen to the people of Australia, the people who are about to have the rug pulled out from under them.
Two people aware of this are Derek Johnston of JNS Mine Management and Pat Schimanski of GWH Equipment. On Saturday, 29 May, they took it upon themselves to inform the people of Kalgoorlie of the dire consequences of the resource tax. Nearly 600 people signed their petition in the few hours they were in St Barbara’s Square in Kalgoorlie. Pat Schimanski of GWH Equipment said:
The purpose of the petition is to raise awareness of the tax. These politicians—
and I am sure he was not speaking of me—
think miners are an easy target. They think we are easy beats. If these Labor clowns don’t get kicked out we here in Western Australia should cut the cord to the rest of Australia. This tax will affect the food on the table of all Australians.
JNS’s Derek Johnston said:
My business has dropped since the announcement of the tax; it has dropped off because everyone is now looking at costs.
Let us look at what some of the profits from some of these resource companies do for local communities, something our eastern seaboard friends are either unaware of or unashamedly do not care about. You see, our friends in the eastern cities have doctors, nurses, teachers, bitumen roads and the flashest coffee beans you can buy, all at their fingertips. This is not so over in remote Western Australia.
Let us look at the Telfer mine. Telfer provide between $5m and $6m a year for the Martu people—who cover six language groups from Wiluna to Fitzroy Crossing; that is an area about the size of New South Wales—through the following community programs: health, education, training, employment, sport and recreation, and community, cultural and social events. They ensure that remote community stores have fresh fruit and vegetables, and they are installing bar code systems in stores. They have supplied fuel to communities that have run out. They fix community sporting ovals, and Telfer’s airstrip has been used to bring up support specialists for schools and to enable nurses and teachers to go home on R and R. Many Martu communities have no doctors, no post office and no police station.
Many houses in the communities have no phone lines, and there is no mobile communication. The chances of members of Indigenous communities getting employment in this remote area is severely restricted. Telfer recognise the need for Indigenous employees and mine managers to balance Martu cultural traditions and beliefs, such as the need to attend funerals in various parts of the state. Telfer’s emergency response is the only emergency response team in the area, thus providing an essential service to remote communities. This company and other mining companies in Western Australia are providing essential services and jobs to remote communities. Keep this in mind: bigger tax equals less profit equals fewer jobs—it is as simple as ABC.
Rio Tinto have engaged in comprehensive efforts to maximise Aboriginal participation in the resources industry. A $200 million contract going to a joint venture with a strong local Aboriginal participation will help traditional owners to build capacity in mining services, and in this way traditional owners will increasingly participate in the resource development taking place on their own country. This initiative is over and above the $112 million that Rio Tinto will spend through Aboriginal contractors this year. More than $50 million of this will be spent through members of the Pilbara Aboriginal Contractors Association, or PACA. Again, bigger tax equals less profit equals fewer jobs—it is as simple as ABC. Eight out of 10 jobless Indigenous people are presently unable to work because of illiteracy, alcohol or other psychological problems. In some rural areas, 70 per cent of children do not regularly attend school. The Indigenous unemployment rate is around three times higher than that of non-Indigenous people. Rio will spend more than $10 million this year on Indigenous education and training in the Pilbara. Remember: bigger tax equals less profit equals fewer jobs—it is as simple as ABC.
These companies and many more like them provide life opportunities for the people of rural and regional Western Australia—not just an existence, which is what the Labor government want the people in my patch to return to. If this super profits tax is such a great thing, such a godsend for Australia, why the need for the Labor government’s obscene spending on advertising it? It has been confirmed that the government began doing market research in March and had prepared an advertising campaign by April—before the tax was announced in May. That completely blows apart Mr Swan’s argument that the mining industry’s campaign against the tax justifies the government’s decision to do its own advertising.
The Rudd government has breached its own advertising guideline on the basis of a national emergency and is spending $38.5 million on a taxpayer-funded television and newspaper advertising blitz promoting the resource super profits tax. Mr Rudd’s excuse for losing his moral compass is that we have a national emergency. Let me assure you: a greater threat to the nation is the introduction of a great big new tax on mining. This threat will impact all Australians and is cause for real concern. Killing the golden goose will do nothing to secure investment, jobs, taxes and royalties into the future. The only way to guarantee the future prosperity of this country is to drop this dud government and elect a Liberal coalition government.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—I would like to use this opportunity to talk specifically about the remarkable contributions that this federal budget makes towards sport. This budget delivers a record $1.2 billion for sport over the next four years, including $325 million in additional funding for the Australian Sports Commission and incorporating $195 million in new funding for sport. To put this in context and to make it very clear, what we have announced is the biggest single funding injection into Australian sport in our nation’s history. Unlike the previous government, our government will be providing long-awaited security to Australian sports as we signal the end to the previous government’s short-term bandaid solutions and provide another example where the government have delivered on our commitment to be a strong financial partner of sport.
Along with the record funding increase, on 11 May this year I released Australian Sport: The Pathway to Success, which provides a new vision for Australian sport that will help forge the way to a healthier community and a stronger sporting sector. I think it is important to note that the government has always made it clear that there is a need for us to better support sport and to help tackle emerging challenges in our society and also maintain our status as one of the world’s greatest sporting nations. We have understood from day one that sport is critical to the wellbeing and good health of our individuals; to bringing communities together; to teaching life skills; to uniting the nation; to sending positive reflections to the international community; to boosting trade, tourism and economic activity; and to giving moments of pure joy, pride and inspiration.
We are committed to strengthening sport, and we have outlined the process by which we will achieve this. I am really proud of our record in just over 2½ years in government, from last year investing the biggest ever injection into Australia’s community sporting infrastructure, as part of our response to the global financial crisis, to reforming the leadership of the Australian Sports Commission, to funding EuroHub to assist Australian athletes in their international endeavours, to working with Football Federation Australia, state and territory governments and sporting codes to lodge a fully compliant bid for the FIFA World Cup, to successfully legislating to put in place a strengthened anti-doping structure in the reformed ASADA, and introducing the Local Sporting Champions Program to better support our developing athletes—to name just a few initiatives.
Over the past decade, sport in Australia has been promised leadership and direction but, under the former government, report after report gathered dust on the shelf. I have read the Oakley report, which the former government heralded would be the biggest reform to sport in decades—but was left sitting on a shelf, not responded to and soon effectively forgotten. We as a government know the challenges that this has posed for sports and for the sports sector in this nation, as the previous government squandered the opportunities and the momentum that developed from the Sydney Olympics. That is why we committed to act. That is why, upon coming to government, we released our new directions paper, which outlined the crisis that sport was facing and the case for reform. We announced that we would appoint an independent panel to help direct the best way forward, and that is why, at the Olympics in 2008, the Prime Minister declared that our government would be strong financial partners of Australian sport into the future. And it is why, upon receiving the Crawford report, we publicly stated that we would increase funding to both community sport and elite sport. This year’s budget did just that. The funding announcement within it, along with the release of the government’s policy document, shows just how committed this government is, has been and always will be when it comes to backing Australian sport.
In terms of our high-performance athletes and systems, the government is committed to ensuring that Australia not only cements but builds on our reputation as a world leader in elite sport. In doing so, we will provide not only new money to support Australia’s talented sports men and women but also long-term stability for sport through locking in previously terminating funding into baseline funding going forward for sports budgets.
This equates to an additional $42 million of funding to support high-performance sport alone each and every year. This funding will ensure that our national talent identification program is doubled, broadening the net to uncover more of our potential champions and boosting the development pathway. It will provide further support to our high-performance coaches, because our government recognises just how important high-performance coaches are to our system. This investment will ensure that we retain as many of our high-performance coaches as possible. The government will also boost direct assistance to athletes, providing greater levels of financial support to an increased number of Australian athletes, assisting them and allowing them more flexibility to dedicate to their training.
In addition to this support, the government will underpin this investment through the recent landmark agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories to establish the first national sport and recreation policy framework to help guide the development of sports policy across Australia. This agreement will better enable cooperation across the pathway, increasing the alignment of our institutes and academies of high-performance sport.
We know that sport is not just about supporting the dreams of our future champions; it is also about gaining opportunities and experiences. Australian sport should be bustling with children lining up to play their favourite sports, keeping healthy or just having fun. Sport should have a strong community and development sector, providing a pathway to keep all of us involved and active and to nurture our future champions as they develop. Our government has committed $18 million of new funding each and every year to strengthen our sporting system and increase participation and activity. The government is committed to working in partnership with sport to see a real increase in the number of Australians being active.
According to the OECD, Australia has the fifth-highest rate of adult obesity in the developed world. The dramatic increases in body weight that we have seen over recent years have already seen the number of Australians with diabetes triple over just the last two decades. And, according to ABS data, participation rates have stalled over the last decade amongst Australian children. We know that, during the 12 months to April 2009, one million children aged from five to 14 did not participate in any organised sport outside of school hours, with a higher proportion—some 44 per cent—of girls not participating in organised sports compared with 30 per cent of boys. In a recent survey, approximately 11.8 million Australians, or 73 per cent, reported no involvement in organised sport. In 2005-06, approximately 5.5 million people reported that they did not participate in any sports or physical recreation activities of any kind over the preceding year.
So, in order to reinvigorate re-engagement in sport amongst our community and to regain our competitive edge, we need to look at ways to do things differently. We need to place a strategic focus on collaboration, reform and investment across the entire sporting pathway, from the grassroots up. We want to work with sport to achieve this goal, because it is sports and national sporting organisations that already have the connections with state sporting organisations, local communities and state and local governments to support and grow sport at all levels.
In recognition of the essential role sports play in leading and growing the sporting base, the government, through the commission, will, for the first time, provide funding to national sporting organisations to provide direct assistance to community clubs and organisations in support of initiatives that aim to expand participation. This will be done through comprehensive participation plans that we, through the commission, will ask national sporting organisations to put in place about how they drive participation within sport and within their local communities. In addition, the government will double the Local Sporting Champions program to support 8,000 junior athletes to participate in competition and to boost opportunities for up-and-coming athletes to compete in domestic competitions.
Alarmingly, we have also seen a decrease in sport in our schoolyards. Despite there being an obvious partnership between sport and education, when it comes to achieving both health and educational outcomes in our children we have seen a decline in the quality of sport and physical activity being delivered in our primary and secondary schools. Whilst there has previously been a national requirement for schools to provide a minimum weekly allocation of two hours of physical activity, the requirement did not specify the level or intensity of activity required in line with health guidelines and did not provide any detailed information as to how physical activity was delivered or met.
The Australian government has announced our commitment, in partnership with the state and territory governments, to prioritise sport and physical education in our national school curriculum. In a landmark agreement, state and territory ministers agreed in response to the Crawford report that the Australian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority prioritise physical education in the development of phase 3 of the national curriculum and further agreeing that the number of hours committed to physical activity in the school curriculum must be maximised. Getting sport right in schools will not only help tackle the serious health issues that we face as a community but also help sport tap into Australia’s sporting talent on an unprecedented level.
It is important that we recognise that sport in Australia is largely dependent on the volunteer and that Australia has a proud history of volunteering. Who could forget the worldwide recognition of those volunteers who helped make the Sydney Olympics ‘the best Olympics ever’? Whether it be the volunteer coaches or officials who help run our local sporting competitions, this government recognises just how important these volunteers are to sport and to the broader community. In this budget, we will provide funding to support volunteer coaches and officials and those volunteers who play such a remarkable role in sporting clubs across the nation. This funding will provide additional coaching and officiating training opportunities for up to 45,000 community coaches and officials, including subsidies for the costs associated with training for 5,000 new community coaches and officials.
In addition, we will provide funding support to national sporting organisations to deliver coaching and officiating education programs, especially in regional areas, deliver funding to support mentoring to community coaches and officials, deliver a national sport volunteer strategy and introduce a national sports volunteers awards program to reward those volunteers and promote their contribution to sport and the wider community.
We also believe that sport has a unique capacity to bring communities together. But sport needs to be more conclusive and a sector which better reflects our diversity—and that means both genders. Our government has great ambitions for women’s sport, both on and off the field. One of our biggest challenges, of course, is getting women seen, heard and supported by our media so that we can end what seems to be the never-ending cycle of no media coverage equalling no resources for women’s sport. Recently we released the report Towards a level playing field, which reveals that in 2008 coverage of women in sport made up just nine per cent of all sports coverage in Australian television news and current affairs. On the other hand, male sport occupied a whopping 81 per cent of television news and current affairs reporting and 86 per cent of non-news programming on television. To put this in context—the nine per cent of coverage dedicated to women’s sport—horseracing alone receives more airtime than all women’s sports combined in Australian television news.
I am really proud of the steps that we have taken so far to address these issues and to help promote women within sport. Over our 2½ years in government we have undertaken several measures including a $2.4 million investment to Netball Australia to support the transTasman netball competition, $400,000 to support and promote the free-to-air coverage of this wonderful championship and also delivery of funding over four years to the Football Federation of Australia, which included the condition that they support a televised women’s Westfield W-League. In support of raising the profile of women’s sport and as a result of the funding included in this measure I can announce that we will also be funding Women in Sport awards to recognise exemplary initiatives, which provide special support for women’s and girls’ participation in sport whether as players, coaches, administrators or officials, and to recognise and reward outstanding media reporting.
The culture of sport itself is long overdue for a significant shake-up and we have signalled that this is exactly what we intend to do. Our government will require all national sporting organisations to annually report on the gender representation of their boards with the information then being published. Too often we have heard excuses about the frequently dismal representation of women on sporting boards such as, for example: ‘If there were women with the appropriate skills then of course we’d appoint them.’ Well our government is happy to work with sports to help them find these women.
I was pleased to announce that the government will establish a register of women with appropriate skills and experience to assist sport to improve their record. The Women in Sport register will enable women to register their skills and interest in being involved in sport and sporting organisations can readily access potential candidates and find a match to their needs. This initiative is not only about growing the number of women on Australia’s sporting boards, it is also about working from within to promote healthy cultures in Australian sport and that requires women.
Labor governments have a fine tradition when it comes to supporting sport. It was under Labor and under Hawke that we established the Australian Sports Commission. It was Labor under Keating who gave sport, up until this budget, the record funding boost to prepare us for the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games. While both these governments injected significant resources into sport they also drove innovation and reform, putting in place the foundations for Australia’s future sporting success.
In this budget we proudly build upon this tradition. Through renewed focus and strategy, enhanced partnerships across tiers of government, a close cooperative approach with our sporting organisations and the biggest increase to sports funding in Australia’s history, we map out the course for Australia’s continued sporting excellence. Of course the implementation of this strategy will require a dedicated partnership approach. We as a government are committed to this because, ultimately, we recognise that sport is important and we need to work to keep it as the strong central thread that it has become to Australian life.
The success of sport cannot be measured in simplistic terms alone. We need a bolstered participation base, we need strengthened development pathways and we need successful elite performances if we are to cement our place as a truly great sporting nation. I am really pleased with the contributions that this budget has made to achieve these goals with a record funding increase; the biggest amount of funding ever dedicated to sport in this country in our nation’s history.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—In rising to speak to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills I do so in the heat of what is a full-on debate about a brand new tax, a supertax. It is well named because it is a tax on superprofits but it is also a tax on people’s super. As I have said before, for every dollar that goes into Mr Rudd’s pocket by way of taxation that is a dollar less for people’s superannuation. This impacts on the standard of living for Australians who are on fixed incomes provided by their savings in their superannuation.
Last night I attended, as many others did, the Mineral Council’s dinner. We heard many fine speakers point out just how bad the big new tax on so-called superprofits is for Australia. We are seeing advertisements that are being put out currently by the Labor Party in the guise of legitimate government advertising but which, in fact, are just plain old Labor Party advertising paid for by the taxpayer—$38 million worth. The main content of their advertising is to try and say that mining companies do not pay their fair share of tax. They conjured up this figure of somewhere between 13c and 17c in the dollar by finding some obscure report put together by a PhD student supervised by a professor, which was submitted to the Henry review as a footnote. They have seized on this report, which was a mixture of Australian and New Zealand figures and so unreliable that it was withdrawn from the draft upon which the government is basing its statements.
Yesterday in the parliament we quizzed the Treasurer continually about the pie chart that he has put out asking him whether it had any modelling significance, any real basis, or was it just dreamt up in his office. For question after question he obfuscated. He talked around the side of it, he would not answer the question and finally he did say it was made in his office. We should understand that the Treasurer has form. Back in 2000 he was exposed on The 7.30 Report by a journalist called Wayne Sanderson who brought to light the fact that the now Treasurer and then member for Lilley, who lost his seat in ‘96, had tried very hard to keep it by giving a brown paper envelope to Lee Birmingham which contained $1,400 in $50 notes. The envelope was then taken by the said Lee Birmingham to the Democrats campaign manager with whom Mr Birmingham said Mr Swan had spent some time only a day or two before. Lee Birmingham delivered the brown paper envelope containing $1,400 to the Democrats and the Democrats in return gave their preferences to Mr Swan.
This matter Mr Swan said was a terrible thing. He had not paid for those preferences at all—high dudgeon. It was referred to the Australian Federal Police. Mr Swan came out and said he had been cleared, but I think what was actually said by the spokesman for the Australian Federal Police was, ‘There is no further action in relation to Wayne Swan.’ The Federal Police spokesman said, ‘I can’t say there was no case to answer, but no further action will be taken.’
This is the same Wayne Swan who is telling us that the mining companies in fact do not pay their share of tax when the Taxation Office’s own figures show that they are paying in excess of 40c in the dollar. When you count up royalties paid and corporate tax paid, that is the amount that they are paying. Yet in these deceptive and lying ads there is no mention made of the corporate tax which those mining companies are paying. It is no wonder that they are in high dudgeon and angry about the way in which they are being derided and ridiculed as an industry when, in fact, they are—I like the words—the new sheep’s back on which we ride to prosperity.
We have seen the promise that the Prime Minister made when he was Leader of the Opposition that he would never allow an advertising campaign to be rolled out unless the Auditor-General gave it the tick-off. Never mind politicising the Auditor-General, he was going to be the stamp of approval for the integrity of the ads. So what are they like? They did not like the job the Auditor-General was doing, so they created a new committee headed up by Mr Alan Hawke who found that the Auditor-General was undermining the authority of the secretaries and that the Auditor-General should be sacked and guess what? Mr Hawke got the job. But that was too much for this Prime Minister—he sacked him too and used the let-out clause so that he could get the Cabinet Secretary to respond to the Treasurer and say, ‘It’s a national emergency, we’ve got to spend this money.’

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-06-03,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak this afternoon on adjournment in relation to a very important issue in my electorate: the waste and mismanagement of the Building the Education Revolution building program which we are seeing in my electorate—massive waste, massive mismanagement and examples of cost shifting by the incompetent Rann state Labor government. It relates to possibly the worst scheme ever implemented in the Australian parliament’s history. Estimates of up to $5 billion of waste have been suggested in recent days in this program alone.
In particular, in my electorate we have now seen several examples of different types of waste and mismanagement and the failure of this Deputy Prime Minister to implement a program properly and coherently in Kangaroo Island and eastern Fleurieu schools last year: three schools on Kangaroo Island that have had $100,000 in architectural fees for drawings they already had; Eastern Fleurieu School, which was mistreated by the state government’s decisions; and Meadows Primary School, which could not build what it wanted to build on the site because of the mismanagement of this program.
More recently and more worryingly, we have seen the example of five Adelaide Hills schools: Yankalilla, Basket Range, Macclesfield, Stirling East, and Eden Hills—which is in the member for Boothby’s seat. The issue is fire water tanks and cost shifting by the incompetent Rann state Labor government, who have used the opportunity of the bucket of money provided by the BER because they have run out of their money to implement a state program, something that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister made very clear would not be allowed to happen. In fact, on 3 February 2009 the Prime Minister of our country said:
This Government will adopt a zero tolerance approach to any state government, whatever its political complexion to any substitution of effort.
The Deputy Prime Minister, on 16 June 2009, said:
We have been very clear, with very tough penalties for states that do not maintain effort in their forward estimates in school capital. We are very clear about that and we will be very vigorous with any state that does not acquit its obligations under the Building the Education Revolution guidelines.
So there were very clear and very stark statements by the two most senior members of this government. However, when it comes to the rubber hitting the road, they have taken no action at all. These schools are therefore missing out on significant sums. In a Stateline story last Friday night, the sums being taken out of their entitlements were stated. At Basket Range Primary School, Felicity Playford stated that the sum was $104,000; Anna Richards from Yankalilla Area School stated that it was $103,000; Carmel McNamara from Stirling East Primary School stated that it was $88,000; and Tom Shepperd from Eden Hills Primary School stated that it was $116,000. There was a similar amount from Macclesfield Primary School.
This is purely a state government responsibility; let us not misunderstand. This is a decision made by the state government to apply a bushfire rating to schools which are in dangerous bushfire zones. Of course, protecting schools from bushfires is something we support. However, these are community water tanks. They are not just for the schools’ use but for community use. This is a state government issue, a state government responsibility and something that they should be looking after. However, because the incompetent Rann state Labor government have run out of money, they have found a bucket of money that they can use to implement this program. So stark is this that, after the initial quotes were given for the buildings in these schools, they were changed after the event to include the additional money for the firefighting tanks. Clearly, what that says is that this incompetent Rann state Labor government saw the opportunity to pass this type of expenditure on to this program. As usual with the Labor Party, who do not have the courage to front up when things are difficult—like the Prime Minister last night—they sent out the chief executive officer of the Department of Education and Children’s Services, who made the situation even clearer last Friday night in a Stateline interview. This is mismanagement. This program is completely mismanaged and it is costing these schools. The Deputy Prime Minister should take some action and fix it before it is too late.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mayo Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program</title>,Adjournment,24,1,speech
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-06-03," asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 24 February 2010:
Have you and/or your departmental officials met with representatives of Hawker Britton this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting.
Has Hawker Britton arranged meetings with other organisations and you and/or your departmental officials this Parliament; if so, (a) on what dates and at what addresses, and (b) who attended each meeting.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS IN WRITING</title>,<title>Hawker Britton</title>,Questions in Writing,25,1,question
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2010-06-03,"—On behalf of the Minister for Trade and myself, the answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:

Responding to this question would require departmental officials to review calendar and diary entries since December 2007 to identify information about meetings with, or arranged by Hawker Britton. This would require the manual examination of a large number of diary and meeting records, which is an unreasonable diversion of government resources.
Conducting the same searches across the diary records of current ministers and parliamentary secretaries in this portfolio would be an unreasonable diversion of resources for similar reasons.
