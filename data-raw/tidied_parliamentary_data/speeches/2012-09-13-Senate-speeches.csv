Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (09:31):  I rise to continue my remarks on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. I want to take the opportunity to run through a few facts and figures about waste in Queensland. Unfortunately, it is not a pretty picture. Waste generation in Queensland is still increasing—and rapidly. Between 2003-04 and 2007-08 waste generation grew by 40 per cent. Over the same period the population increased by 10 per cent and retail turnover increased by 21 per cent. Our total volume of waste produced every year is simply huge. In 2008 there was an estimated 32.6 million tonnes generated from commercial, industrial, construction, demolition and household activities. This includes the data collected on waste that is classified for indefinite storage, such as fly-ash from electricity generation, which amounts to 22.3 million tonnes. Queensland households and businesses generate the remaining 10.3 million tonnes.


The trend over the past five years has been for a significant increase in waste generation and disposal. The data shows that domestic waste generation in 2007-08 was 40 per cent higher than in 2003-04 and yet, as I said, the population only grew by 10 per cent. In 2007-08 more than 60 per cent of the waste generated by households and businesses was disposed to landfill. According to the 2011 National Litter Index, Queensland is the most littered mainland state. Tasmania unfortunately tops the national list.


This bill, which I am really proud to support, proposes a solution for the 12 billion beverage containers that Australians use every year. It seeks to address practicably the fact that only about half of those are recycled, while most of the remainder wind up as litter or in landfill and, of course, much of that runs off into our precious marine environment. We have a serious problem with landfill and waste in Australia and, as I have already said, Queensland is one of the main contributors. It is just a really wasteful situation in Queensland and across Australia, which is exactly why we need a bill like this.


Some argue that there is no need for national leadership on waste and that we can just trust the states, so I want to put on record my deep concern about one of the many retrograde steps that the Newman government have taken in their short time in office so far. The Newman government wound back Queensland waste levy, which had been set at $35 a tonne, on 1 July this year. That levy had been designed to promote recycling by making the cost of landfill more expensive. But removing this fee for commercial, industrial and construction waste makes landfill in South-east Queensland a more attractive proposition for some operators in northern New South Wales, where a waste levy on those vast volumes of waste continues to apply, so we have South-east Queensland becoming a dumping ground for everybody's waste. This is a serious backward step for Queensland and, unfortunately, is one of the many backward steps and attacks on Queensland's environment under this new government. We really need national leadership to tackle our waste issues—the states are just not up to it.


Returning to this bill, there is broad, consistent and very high support in the community for a container deposit scheme and there is a demonstrated willingness to pay. The study was done twice and we are now buried in the swamp of a regulatory impact statement process being undertaken by the Commonwealth on container deposits that simply has this proposal buried in quicksand. At best, we think this could result in a scheme being implemented in two or three years time, thanks to this analysis paralysis. We need to develop a sense of urgency. For every 12 months that we drag our heels on this, another 12 billion beverage containers are used.


The main industry-government program is the Australian Packaging Covenant, which sounds great but does not really deliver as much as industry seems to think. In fact, the latest information on the recycling rate for beverage containers shows that it has dropped to about 40 per cent, down from the 48 per cent that is claimed in the packaging regulatory impact statement. As a result, the overall recycling rate for all packaging has also dropped by about three points. This calls into question the claims made about the effectiveness of the Australian Packaging Covenant—it certainly continues to reach its own 2010 target of 65 per cent.


When you consider all the co-benefits of a container deposit scheme—more jobs, help for charities, new material drop-off centres and a big reduction in litter—it is a scheme that wins hands down. With regard to local government, which supports a container deposit scheme, the regulatory impact statement finds that it would benefit from a CDS by more than $2 billion over 20 years. When releasing the RIS the environment ministers said they:


… recognised that assessment of the costs and benefits of options has many dimensions and cannot be based on quantifiable matters alone.


The Consultation RIS acknowledges other potential benefits of better manage packaging, including the employment generated by more recycling, reduced use of energy and water, and the provision of infrastructure to support other recycling.


Surely the case has now been proven. If we want to solve the beverage container problem, acknowledged as the main packaging issue, then we should act now. Opponents of a CDS like to talk about how well we are doing in recycling packaging, but the figures are bulked out by the 70 per cent recycling rate for paper and cardboard. We do not have a problem here if you include those figures, and yet beverage containers are slumped at 40 per cent. The only certain and sustainable policy is a container deposit scheme. This factor is acknowledged by the RIS in comparison to the untested assumptions and fairyland targets proposed in other industry options.


My colleague Senator Ludlam has noted that this is a portfolio for patient people. The larger project of creating a genuinely sustainable Australia for cleaning up our act, for cleaning our fouled waterways, our parklands and our wilderness from rubbish and for recovering those valuable materials that go to waste is worth it. But now we are wasting time. Australia needs and is ready for this bill, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (09:38):  I rise to speak on the Greens bill for a government run beverage container deposit and recovery scheme, a scheme that would collect a deposit from importers and producers of beverage containers under four litres and provide a full refund to consumers when containers are returned to a collection point. It does not sound like a bad idea, does it? In spirit it is not but, instead of allowing the reasonable processes the government is taking through COAG to run their course, the Greens have put this bill up today. Instead of trying to get an outcome that is fitting with the South Australian scheme that has been running for 35 years and instead of trying to get an outcome that is fitting with the recently enacted Northern Territory scheme, the Greens want to throw out these schemes and implement a national scheme—a national scheme that is government run rather than use the current state based industry-run schemes as a base. There is definitely a need for further work in this area.


The schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory are based on industry-run arrangements. This bill proposes a government-run scheme—a government-run scheme that would be a different mechanism over and above the two existing arrangements. Locally, this only leads to increased regulatory complexity as well as cost to industry and the community. I am unsure why the Greens consider it is a good thing to increase legislation in this space when we have a system that works. It is run in South Australia and the Northern Territory.


Federal Labor is committed to reducing the amount of packaging, waste and litter in our society. This includes increasing recycling facilities and schemes for beverage containers. We want to continue to work on this with state and territory governments through the COAG process to expand the schemes to all states and territories. We are not in favour of a national government-run scheme. What we are doing at the moment is to work through the COAG regulation impact statement process. This process is across the broad issues encompassing packaging waste and includes container deposit schemes. This process has just reached the decision regulation impact statement stage. That means that this bill, which would be over and above state schemes, would sideline all of the good work done during the COAG process. It is appropriate that we continue the good work underway in the COAG processes, work that is seeking to expand the South Australian and Northern Territory industry-run schemes, not impose national government-run regulation of packaging waste. 


According to the consultation regulatory impact statement for COAG, Australia's packaging recycling rate has increased from 39 per cent in 2003 to 63 per cent in 2011. This was achieved through concerted industry, state and local government action and also the Australian Packaging Covenant. I repeat: this increase in recycling rates in just eight years from 39 per cent to 63 per cent is quite an achievement and it has again, as I have said, been achieved through cooperation by industry, state and local governments with the Australian Packaging Covenant.


This matter has been progressed by government and industry working together. It seems illogical for the federal government to now impose a regulation that is different to that which has been cooperatively progressed. I understand that the Australian Packaging Covenant represents a commitment by governments and industry to the sustainable design, use and recovery of packaging. It is a voluntary component of this cooperative, co-regulatory model which has been designed to reduce the environmental impacts of consumer packaging. The covenant encourages improvements in packaging design, higher recycling rates and better stewardship of packaging. Product stewardship imposes an obligation on all those who benefit from production of consumer packaging to assume a share of responsibility for a product over its life cycle.


There are currently over 800 signatories to the covenant, representing a significant proportion of industry in Australia. Participation in the covenant is voluntary, but brand owners with a turnover of over $5 million per annum who choose not to become signatories or who fail to comply with the covenant requirements are regulated under the National Environmental Protection (Used Packaging Materials) Measure. Each state implements the National Environment Protection Measure through its own regulations.


This covenant mechanism has, in part, seen Australia's packaging recycling rate increased from 39 per cent in 2003 to 63 per cent in 2011. Most Australians have access to broad municipal kerbside recycling services which have assisted Australians with household recycling activities. In 2009, over 91 per cent of Australian households used municipal kerbside recycling to recycle waste, an increase from 87 per cent in 2006. In 2009, almost all Australian households reported that they recycled waste and almost 90 per cent reported that they reused waste. This is a significant increase over the mid-1990s levels.


Labor has a proud record of environmental protection. Long before environmentalism became the movement that it is today, resplendent with a political party in this place, it was Labor that not only talked green but acted green—acting to protect the environment. It was a Labor premier of New South Wales who founded the Kosciusko National Park in 1944. It was a Labor government that intervened in 1983 to protect the Franklin River and surrounds. Prime Minister Hawke pushed for the enacting of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, which today sees some of Australia's most iconic sites protected. 


It took a Labor government to lead world efforts to preserve Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. In 1988, Prime Minister Hawke was told it was a lost cause to push for a mining ban. Thanks to his perseverance and determination, over two decades later Antarctica remains free from mining. It was also the Hawke Labor government which preserved Kakadu National Park by standing up to stop mining at Coronation Hill in 1991. At the time, a section of the mining industry said the decision would 'make or break the development of Australia's resources'. Twenty years later we know Labor made the right decision in the national interest. It is Labor that World Heritage listed the wet tropics of Queensland, the Daintree rainforest, and Labor that created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the authority to manage it.


This current Labor government has provided $200 million, the largest single commitment ever made, to address the threats of climate change and declining water quality to the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, it was a Labor government, the Keating government, which in 1992 signed and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We all know it took this Labor government to ratify the Kyoto protocol in 2007.


And let us not forget that state Labor around the country has a proud record too. New South Wales Labor brought together the resources and expertise of small agencies to create the Department of Environment and Conservation. They created financial incentives for pollution reduction by introducing load based licensing for air and water pollutants and enacted New South Wale's first contaminated land remediation laws. Queensland Labor enacted laws in 2004 to phase out land clearing, and by January 2007 most clearing had been banned.


Tasmanian Labor, working with federal Labor, is working through the details to protect further high-conservation-value forests. Tasmanian Labor introduced the Climate Change (State Action) Act 2008 to provide for a legislated emissions reduction target to reduce emissions to at least 60 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050. Labor in Victoria committed the state to a 20 per cent emissions reduction target by 2020. ACT Labor has set a target of 40 per cent by 2020.


And let us not forget the Clean Energy Future package that federal Labor negotiated through this parliament, demonstrating our commitment to striking the balance between economic growth and environmental protection and putting a price on carbon that will cut Australia's emissions by five per cent by 2020. And by 2050 we will have cut our emissions by 80 per cent.


Acting to protect our environment and preserve our nation for generations to come is not new to Labor; we have been doing it proudly for years. I note a recent campaign launched by the Australian Workers Union in Tasmania around preserving both the mining industry and the natural environment. This is a campaign where mining industry employees are seeking community support to continue their trade in just one per cent of the region. The workers and their unions are saying that they have done both for over 100 years. They want to continue to do both for the next 100. Mining is a critical part of the region's economy, and with several major projects currently planned, mining will continue to play a central role in the north-west's future prosperity. Labor has a proud record of environmental protection. We continue to work hard to strike the balance.


This bill does not strike the right balance. It does not respect the national cooperative work that has been done across the whole packaging waste and litter issue. It is a heavy-handed, national approach that seeks to undo the good work done at the COAG table, good work that has been seeking to involve industry and all levels of government to find a good outcome.


In December last year at the COAG table, environment ministers released the consultation regulation impact statement. This was an important step in better managing packaging waste and litter nationally. On 24 August this year, environment ministers met to consider outcomes of the consultation process and to make a decision on next steps in addressing the ongoing problems of packaging waste and litter. Ministers committed to progress to a decision regulation impact statement, and noted the strong response at the consultation regulation impact statement stage. This is the proper process for considering national regulation of packaging waste. It is the process agreed upon by COAG for any national regulatory reform. It is therefore important today that, while we may support the merits of this bill, we look to the COAG approach as a way forward—an approach that is seeking to build on current state based schemes and not to reinvent the wheel.


A regulation impact statement examines the likely impacts of a proposed regulation. It proposes a range of alternative options that could meet the government's policy objectives. It is an important means of providing evidence of what the problem that we are attempting to solve is and formalising the problem so that costs and benefits of each option can be assessed. This bill pre-empts the appropriate and transparent consideration of the costs and benefits of national approaches to packaging waste and litter which are currently underway.


Once the regulation impact statement process has concluded, COAG's Standing Council on Environment and Water will be in a better position to assess the merits of a range of national approaches to addressing packaging waste and litter, including a national container deposit scheme.


The Australian government and all state and territory governments made a commitment at the beginning of this process. This commitment was that the regulation impact statement process would be open and consultative, and allow for a balanced assessment of all options—including a national container deposit scheme. Consistent with the commitment to having an open and transparent process, stakeholders have been involved throughout—including through two workshops. The first workshop was used to gain the stakeholders' views on the range of problems. At the second, stakeholders sought to identify options which will target and address these problems.


At their recent meeting in August, ministers made a commitment that the process would continue to be transparent and consultative. As mentioned earlier, the consultation regulation impact statement was released on 7 December last year for an extended four-month public consultation. As part of the consultation process, a series of public forums were held. They commenced in Brisbane on 13 February this year and ran through to 7 March in capital cities, as well as the three regional centres of Bunbury, Townsville and Albury. These forums provided an opportunity for people to discuss the consultation regulation impact statement in further detail, to ask questions in relation to its findings and assumptions and, importantly, to give their views on the options that were proposed.


The consultation regulation impact statement was just that: a consultation document. It did not endorse one particular option over another, but aimed at stimulating further discussion on how to address this important issue. The subject has attracted a great deal of interest. Hundreds of submissions from industry, environment groups, the community and local government showed strong support for further action to address the impacts of packaging waste and litter. The community is getting behind this reform. We must follow the process that is seeking comprehensive change to management of packaging waste and litter. Yes, a container deposit scheme could play a good part in this.


We are moving through the process. I remind the Senate that ministers carefully considered the submissions received during the consultation process. The environment ministers committed to pushing ahead with a decision regulation impact statement to provide a more detailed analysis of the potential impacts of the options. Regulatory change can only take place once this decision regulation impact statement has been conducted, so this represents a significant step forward in this process. This is the appropriate process for considering national regulation of packaging waste and litter—national regulation that builds upon the good work done in South Australia and more recently in the Northern Territory and that builds upon the work done by all environment ministers and by industry.


Seven options were assessed in the consultation regulation impact statement in terms of their costs and benefits for packaging waste and litter. Two key stakeholders, the Boomerang Alliance and the beverage industry, proposed specific options to reduce packaging waste for the regulation impact statement to assess. At their August meeting ministers agreed that, in addition to the options considered in the consultation regulation impact statement, three further options will be included in the decision regulation impact statement. The first additional option is an industry co-regulatory stewardship scheme that will focus on beverage containers only. The second additional option is an approach similar to the Australian Packaging Covenant, with a substantial increase in funding from industry for packaging recycling and litter initiatives. The third additional option is a container deposit model based on the South Australian system.


In accordance with ministers' commitment to a transparent and open process, they have agreed to undertake targeted consultation with key stakeholders on the design of additional options. The decision regulation impact statement will undertake a more detailed analysis, including regional and other distributional impacts of options. I have just articulated that we have three additional options on the table. These are going through the regulation impact statement channels. These are seeking to build on the existing work done over many years to limit packaging waste and litter.


The Australian government has consistently displayed its commitment to sustainability and responsible environmental management. This has been most recently seen in the enactment of the Product Stewardship Act 2011. This act, which passed the Australian parliament last year, provides the basis for a more efficient and environmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia. Product stewardship means that everyone involved in the production, supply and use of the products we consume shares responsibility for those products from the point of design and manufacture through to disposal. The framework product stewardship legislation allows for national product stewardship schemes for specified classes of products to be established by regulation.


Regulations under the Product Stewardship Act established the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme, which commenced on 8 November 2011. Three organisations have been approved to deliver e-waste collection and recycling services under this scheme. Canberra was the first to start this free e-waste recycling service in April 2012. This is the start of a nationwide rollout, boosting television and computer recycling rates to 30 per cent in 2012-13 and 80 per cent by 2021-22, to provide a long-term solution to television and computer waste. Televisions and computers contain valuable non-renewable resources, including gold and other precious metals, as well as hazardous materials including lead, bromine, mercury and zinc. By recycling them we can recover useful materials and at the same time reduce health and environmental risks. The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme is funded and implemented by the television and computer industry and regulated by the Australian government under the Product Stewardship Act.


Again, I have articulated that Labor is committed to reducing both packaging waste and litter, as well as boosting recycling of a whole range of products. Labor is committed to striking a balance. Labor is committed to following established processes and working with stakeholders, including industry and other levels of government. The intent of this bill has merit. No-one in this place will dispute that. But what we need is to continue working through the current channels. We need to get the facts on the table through the regulation impact statement, because Labor is committed to continuing its proud record of getting the balance right between protecting the environment and promoting economic growth. It is why we are pricing carbon, it is why we are creating the biggest marine national park in the world and it is why we are progressing this important waste management reform through the appropriate channels: the COAG process.


The Greens want to throw out the schemes operating in the Northern Territory and implement a national scheme over and above these schemes instead of trying to get an outcome that is fitting with the South Australian scheme that has been running for 35 years. This bill proposes a government-run scheme that would be a different mechanism over and above the two existing arrangements. Logically, this only leads to increased regulatory complexity as well as costs to industry and the community. Federal Labor is committed to reducing the amount of packaging waste and litter in our society. This includes increasing recycling facilities and schemes for beverage containers. We want to continue to work on this with state and territory governments through the COAG process, to expand the schemes to all state and territories.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:57):  This is a debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010, introduced by the Greens political party. It relates to recycling and deposit schemes that have been in force in South Australia for some time. Because it is a debate, I want to take issue with some of the contributions made by the previous two speakers. Can I say in relation to the last speaker that about the only thing that I agree with her and her party on is that we will not be supporting the bill before the chamber today, for the same reasons as the Labor Party has indicated. I will come back to that later.


I could not contain my mirth when I heard the previous speaker rewrite history yet again in telling us what a great environmental party the Australian Labor Party was. Those who have observed politics and governance for a long time, as I have, clearly understand that Labor's only interest in the environment is the second preference votes they can get from the Greens political party when dealing with the issues of the environment. I still remember then Senator Graham Richardson, the environment minister, up in my neck of North Queensland, in the wet tropics, speaking to a crowd who were about to lynch him because he was destroying their jobs—another Labor government destroying the jobs of workers. He was saying, 'We're here to save these pristine rainforests.' The only problem was these 'pristine rainforests' had been logged for 110 years previously. Yet Senator Richardson was saying they were pristine. Why was he saying that? Because Richo, as we all know, master tactician of the ballot box, knew that they were coming to an election in which they desperately needed the support of the fledgling Greens political party.


Richo did not worry about the workers' jobs. Where was the AWU when you needed them? Where was the CFMEU when you needed them? The workers' jobs just went like that, and none of the great unionists raised a whimper in support of the jobs. It was the same with the Tasmanian forest industry eventually, though I have to say the F part of the CFMEU back in the 2004 days did actually join with the Liberal government to protect workers' jobs. I am always very proud of the F part of the CFMEU for the work they did in 2004 to protect the jobs of workers in Tasmania. Regrettably, the Labor Party have been less than forceful since.




Senator Feeney:
  Michael O'Connor is now the national secretary.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  He was excellent. I had a lot of dealings with him. He was genuinely interested in workers' jobs, unlike the present head of the AWU, who says, 'If one job goes from the carbon tax, I'm out of here.' Just yesterday we had 900 jobs in the mining industry up my way. Mr Howes is still there. You could give a litany of jobs that have gone because of the carbon tax. The only jobs that haven't gone are Mr Howes's and those of his colleagues in the chamber.


The previous speaker rewrote history by saying that the Labor Party was so interested in the environment. The Labor Party's interest in the environment is always invoked. The previous speaker went through a list of things that were so-called achievements of the Labor Party. The Labor Party talks a lot about the environment but never does much. Let me give some facts on which party actually works and acts for the benefit of the environment in Australia. Which party was it that prohibited sand mining on Fraser Island, a very substantial step and one of the first environmental battles that the Liberal Party took up on behalf of the nation? Which party was it that actually banned whaling in Australian waters? It was the Liberal Party.


Which party was it that, contrary to the previous speaker, actually introduced the declaration of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park? It was the Liberal-National party in conjunction with the Liberal National Party in Queensland. Which party was it that proclaimed Kakadu, Uluru, Christmas Island and the Coral Sea national parks? Which party was it that had five properties placed on the World Heritage List, including the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu, the Willandra Lakes, Lord Howe Island and South-west Tasmania and, in the Howard government, the Heard and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic? Which party was it that took through the passage of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment and Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981? Which party was it that regulated the uranium industry in the Northern Territory? Which party was it that enacted major pieces of legislation to control pollution, especially for the protection of the high seas? Which party was it that legislated for the introduction of unleaded petrol as a pollution control measure? Which party introduced the bicentennial waters program, the National Soil Conservation Program, the national tree program? Which party introduced the Natural Heritage Trust and the Green Corps, two practical, on-the-ground activities that actually did something for the environment that we live in? Which party had Australia's first minister for the environment? Again, the answer to all of those questions is the Liberal Party in conjunction with the coalition colleagues in the National Party, when you want real action, not vote-winning action, not action that allows you to strut round the stage and say that, by reducing Australia's 1.4 per cent of world emissions of carbon, we are going to save the world, and look at us, aren't we great—that is so typical of the Labor Party. Up there when the cameras are flashing the rhetoric is always pretty good, but the actual work on the environment is always very limited. I regret to say that, with one or two exceptions, the Greens political party is now no longer a party of the environment but a party of very left wing social, economic and political views. I am a proud member of the Liberal Party, a party that has a record of achievement on the environment.


I also want to make reference to Senator Waters's comment about waste generation in Australia. It reminded me that I was in Rockhampton the other week. The Rockhampton Regional Council, a medium-large regional council in my state of Queensland, have set aside $3 million for the carbon tax on their landfill operation. That equates to $68 per rate notice issued in the Rockhampton Regional Council area. You wonder why costs of living are going up. That story is repeated right around Australia. If actions such as the tax on ordinary Australians for landfills were going to make a difference, you could grin and bear it. But everybody knows that what Australia is doing is in fact increasing its emissions by 2020. So it is not going to make one iota of difference to the world's climate. I am one of those people who always acknowledges that the climate is changing, that it has been changing for millions of years and that it will continue to change. But the cost to Australia from this stupid carbon tax, this toxic carbon tax, is just horrendous, and that is why the first action of the Abbott government will be to remove it. 


In debating this issue with other speakers, I have not yet come to the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010, except to say that, in this instance, we will be supporting the Labor Party in opposing the bill. Why? Because the environment ministers, as the COAG Standing Council on Environment and Water, at a meeting as recently as 24 August 2012 agreed to move forward and develop a decision regulation impact statement to undertake a more detailed analysis, including regional and other distributional impacts. The meeting on 24 August followed consultation by the standing committee in their December 2011 Packaging Impacts Consultation Regulation Impact Statement. 


I think, as other speakers have mentioned, all Australians are concerned about littering and about recycling where that is appropriate. The South Australian government introduced its scheme for recycling of containers in that state back in 1977, and the world has certainly moved on since then. I live in a not so small rural area. It is a shire of about 20,000 people, and the town of Ayr, where I live, has about 10,000 people. For several years now, even our shire has had a waste recycling bin. We have a general rubbish bin, and recently we have achieved a green waste bin. So, right across Australia, Australians, supported by their local governments, have been involved in the recycling of waste products. 


I am very pleased that our council, the Burdekin Shire Council, on which I once had the privilege of serving for 11 years, has been at the forefront in the use of not just the ordinary, if I might call it that, recycling bins but the green waste recycling bin as well in recent times. I could not quite understand Senator Waters, but certainly in the case of the Burdekin shire—and I am sure this applies elsewhere—those general recycling bins take beverage containers, paper and cardboard. They have indeed contributed substantially to recycling in our area, but I know the same thing is happening right around Australia. They have certainly assisted in reducing the amount of roadside waste and rubbish of beverage containers, which was, we all might recall, the initial thought behind the South Australian legislation way back in 1977. I congratulate local government right across Australia on the very good job it has done in promoting and developing those kerbside recycling initiatives, which have in many ways reduced the recycling benefit of initiatives such as the container deposit legislation. 


There is still a way to go in relation to workplace waste as opposed to ordinary household waste, but that is the sort of thing that the government or the ministerial council is progressing. I am a bit critical of the federal government for failing to progress those ministerial forum discussions as quickly as we might have hoped, but I think they are on the way now and we look forward to a good outcome from that particular forum. The difficulty is, as we all know—and this is not so much the case with South Australia, which, in a geographic sense, is a little bit insular—that with a place like Queensland with its close borders to New South Wales and a place like New South Wales with its close borders to the ACT, Queensland and Victoria, you have to have in place a national protocol where all states agree. 


As with all regulation, it does come at a cost. We should not overlook the fact that these recycling schemes do come at a cost, which is passed through to the consumers in due course. The ministerial council did commission some research in May 2009, and this research was looked at by the Senate committee that reported on this bill some time ago. That report, prepared by consultants BDA Group and Wright Corporate Strategy, had attempted to quantify the cost of the benefits of introducing a scheme of the nature proposed by the Greens political party. In its quantification of those costs and benefits, it reported a total national annual net economic cost to government and the broader community, which took into account all of the compliance and administrative costs mentioned previously in this debate. The BDA report estimated that those costs would be around $492 million per annum in net terms. Overall it sees an economic cost of $763 million versus an economic benefit of $294 million—giving you that $492 million per annum net cost. Those costs do have to be taken into account, particularly in this time in the nation's economic cycle where things like the carbon tax are increasing costs and reducing employment opportunities and the mining tax substantially reducing employment opportunities. I understand the real figure of people unemployed or underemployed in Australia and looking for work or more work at the present time is in the order of 17.3 per cent. So it is a difficult time for our country, made worse by the additional costs that this government continues to pile upon ordinary citizens day after day. So we do have to bear in mind the costs.


The coalition, along with all of our other significant environmental initiatives, are very keen to see good recycling programs—programs that actually work; programs that do not add to the cost of living of ordinary Australians. We are keen to see the COAG meeting between the state environment ministers come up with its conclusions and we await the recommendations from the DRIS. For that reason, the coalition will not be supporting this bill.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:16):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. Australians use 12 billion beverage containers every year. This bill, introduced by my Greens colleague Senator Scott Ludlam, introduces a scheme for the environmentally sustainable management and reuse of those containers to apply throughout Australia. This is a major and long overdue reform. Only half of those 12 billion beverage containers are currently recycled. Too many of them end up as litter or in landfill.


The Australian Greens have long been a strong advocate for this approach. Recycling is important because it alleviates the need to use our precious natural resources when producing materials from scratch. It reduces the amount of energy and water used in product development, it decreases air emissions created by the processing of new containers and it lowers the cost of waste collection and sorting.


As I have said in this place before, 200 years of increasingly intensive industrialisation, fuelled by the burning of fossil fuels and coupled with an exponential increase in the earth's population, has led to the situation that is before us. It is one that we must grasp in this decade of the 21st century. Our environment is at risk. We are facing serious consequences from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide and methane. For the sake of our future and our kids and our grandkids we must use every means to reduce our impact on our planet. This container deposit legislation scheme is a critical step.


I am proud to say that my state of South Australia has had a container deposit legislation scheme in place since the 1970s. South Australia provides a case in point as to the benefits and successes of these schemes. Our container deposit scheme works in conjunction with kerbside schemes. In South Australia the beverage companies own their unredeemed deposits. South Australia has achieved a recovery rate of over 80 per cent of containers, with 1.5 tonnes per person recycled each year. The South Australian statutory authority Zero Waste SA was established in 2003 and since then the total amount of waste disposed to landfill has decreased by over 15 per cent to 2008, despite population growth.


According to the National Waste Report 2010, waste generation in South Australia for 2006-07 was 2,090 kilograms per person, which is 0.5 per cent above the national average generation of 2,080 kilograms per person. In 2010-11, approximately 47,000 tonnes or 593 million beverage containers were returned for refund, a rate of 80.4 per cent. South Australian councils have benefited from the scheme, with some reporting incomes of up to $90,000 per year. As well, kerbside recycling is more economically viable, as reduced volumes require fewer collection services and sorting operations and reduce landfill and associated levy costs.


Community organisations have also benefited. Those that operate collection depots use the income to fund their numerous activities, such as the Scouts, who earn approximately $9 million a year from recycling containers. As the founder of Keep Australia Beautiful, Ian Kiernan, has said:


What happens (in South Australia) is that instead of seeing a bit of rubbish beside the road or the beach, you see a bit of money—and (the rubbish) is gone.


In addition to South Australia's container deposit legislation, Zero Waste SA promotes recycling and minimisation of waste at home, work and in industry. We have legislation to reduce the use of checkout style plastic bags used in supermarkets.


South Australia's recycling and waste management achievements have been recognised by UN-HABITAT in its 2010 international report Solid Waste Management in the World's Cities. This report considered 22 cities across the world and highlighted that:


Adelaide's and South Australia's waste resources management system is in some respects global best practice. South Australia has demonstrated a high level of political commitment and willingness to 'stick its neck out' and implement some policies and legislation upon which other administrations take a more conservative position.


The South Australian community overwhelmingly supports our container deposit scheme, with 92 per cent in favour.


I am proud to share these positive achievements of my state and, as a federal parliamentarian, I want to see good ideas from South Australia going national. It is time for the national container deposit scheme outlined in this Australian Greens bill, and I commend it to the Senate.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:21):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2012, introduced by Senator Ludlam. As you have heard from the government speakers, we will be opposing this legislation. Opposition to this bill does not mean that I rise to speak against the environment. It does not mean I rise to speak against recycling. In fact, I support both. I rise today to speak against this bill as another example of developing policies without solid foundation or thought to their implementation.


Let me tell you about the things that we do agree on. We agree that we should do more to manage packaging waste. We agree that recycling is important. The difference is Labor make responsible choices when developing policies. A container deposit scheme has been in place, as we have heard in this chamber today, in South Australia since 1977 and in the Northern Territory since January this year. However, what is proposed by Senator Ludlam's bill is different to those schemes. The schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory are based on industry run arrangements, whereas this bill proposes a government run scheme. Because of this key difference, this bill would introduce a different mechanism over the top of these two existing arrangements, increasing regulation and potential cost to industry and the community. More regulatory complexity and cost to industry and cost to the community to recycle bottles and cans is irresponsible and not what Australians want.


Labor believe in looking after the environment. We understand that looking after our beautiful and unique country is one of the best ways to ensure a prosperous future. We want to deal with this issue in a responsible and measured way, a way in which we all benefit—the community, the industry and the environment. The Australian government, as well as state and territory governments, are committed to reducing the amount of packaging waste and litter in our society, including beverage containers. To suggest anything else is simply ridiculous.


In 2010 Commonwealth, state and territory environment ministers agreed to examine and release to industry interest groups and the community for consultation options for the better management of packaging waste. As part of this process a consultation regulation impact study was developed. This report examined options for dealing with packaging waste, including container deposit legislation. In December 2012 the consultation regulation impact statement was released by environment ministers. This was a significant step in better managing all of the packaging waste and litter nationally. Hundreds of submissions were received from industry, environment groups, the community and local government in response to the consultation RIS. This shows strong support by Australians for further action to address the impacts of packaging waste and litter.


The environment  ministers have carefully considered the submissions received during the consultation process and will develop a decision regulatory impact statement to provide a more detailed analysis of the potential impacts of the options. When we consider any policy change, we must consider what possible consequences this change may have. Regulatory change can only take place once a decision RIS has been conducted, so this represents a significant step forward in this process. This is the appropriate process for considering national regulation of packaging waste because it is the process agreed upon by COAG for any national regulatory reform. We have these processes so that we can make the best decisions possible when we have fully reviewed the evidence.


The RIS examines the likely impacts of proposed regulations and a range of alternative options that could meet the government's policy objectives. It is the responsible and considered way of making changes. Once the RIS process has concluded, the COAG Standing Council on Environment and Water will be in a better position to assess the merits of a range of national approaches to addressing packaging waste and litter, including a national container deposit scheme. It is an important means of providing evidence of what the problem is and what we are attempting to solve. It allows for the formalising of the costs and benefits of each option so that they can be assessed. Labor is committed to weighing the costs and the benefits of the national regulation reform.


It is clear that this bill is an attempt to pre-empt the appropriate and transparent considerations of the costs and benefits of a national approach to packaging waste and litter that is currently underway. Labor are taking action on the issue. We are taking action responsibly and with due diligence. The consultation regulation impact statement was released on 7 December 2011 for an extended four-month public consultation. By consulting with a wide range of stakeholders, including industry, the community, and state and local governments, Labor are showing our commitment to finding the best solution rather than just putting something up in the Senate where there has been no considered consultation. We are taking responsible action. The Australian Labor government and all state and territory governments made a commitment at the beginning of the RIS process that it would be open, that consultation would be allowed and that there would be a balanced assessment of all options, including a national container deposit scheme. We have kept that commitment.


The process has been open and transparent. Stakeholders have been involved throughout. Two workshops have been held: the first to gain views on what are a range of problems and the second to identify options which will target and address these problems. They commenced in Brisbane on 13 February this year and ran through to 7 March in capital cities as well as three regional centres: Bunbury, Townsville and Albury. In total, about 250 people attended the sessions, and each session consisted of a two-hour public forum, including presentations by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the economic analysis. These forums provided an opportunity for people to discuss the consultation RIS in further detail. They were able to ask questions in relation to its findings and, very importantly, they were able to give their views on the options proposed.


The subject has attracted a great deal of interest. Hundreds of submissions from industry, environment groups, the community and local government showed strong support for further action to address the impacts of packaging waste and litter. This shows that the Australian people, like Labor, are concerned about the impact of packaging waste and that they want a solution that will help the environment. The consultation RIS collected some fantastic statistics about the Australian people's commitment to recycling and the environment. According to the consultation RIS, Australia's packaging recycling rate increased from 39 per cent in 2003 to 63.1 per cent in 2011. Recycling in Australia is on the rise. This was achieved through concerted industry and state and local government action and through the Australian Packaging Covenant.


Most Australians have access to kerbside recycling services, which have assisted Australians with household recycling activities. Yellow-top wheelie bins are now a common sight in the average Australian suburban street. In 2009, over 91 per cent of Australian households used kerbside recycling to recycle waste, an increase from 87 per cent in 2006. In that same year, almost all Australian households, 98 per cent, reported that they recycled waste and 86 per cent reported that they re-used waste. Recycling has become a way of life in Australia and we want it to increase. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as far back as 1996, 91 per cent of Australian households reported some form of waste recycling and/or re-use activity.


What we can see here is that Australians are committed to recycling and that the programs currently in place are working. Rather than just introduce a package fix into the Senate that would create all sorts of red tape and expense for the industry and for the Australian people, we are doing our homework and will come up with a solution which will be appropriate and measured. The consultation RIS, which had the opportunity to engage with Australians on the issue of recycling, was just that: a consultation document. It did not endorse one particular option over another but was aimed at stimulating further discussion on how to address this important issue.


At their August meeting a few weeks ago, the environment ministers made a commitment that the process would continue to be transparent and that they would continue to consult industry, community and government. The packaging impacts regulation impact statement is examining a range of options for managing packaging waste. Seven options were assessed in the consultation RIS in terms of their costs and benefits for packaging waste and litter. Two key stakeholders, the Boomerang Alliance and the beverage industry, proposed specific options to reduce packaging waste. The Boomerang Alliance, who support a collection deposit scheme, congratulated the RIS consultants on their effort in compiling such a range of data and detailed analysis.


At the August meeting, the environment ministers agreed that, in addition to the options considered in the consultation RIS, three further options will be included in the decision RIS. The first of these options is an industry co-regulatory stewardship scheme that will focus on beverage containers only. The second additional option is an approach similar to the Australian Packaging Covenant, with a substantial increase in funding from industry for packaging recycling and litter initiatives. The third additional option is a container deposit model based on the South Australian system.


The environment ministers have agreed to undertake targeted consultations with key stakeholders on the design of additional options, in accordance with their commitment to a transparent and open process. The decision RIS will undertake a more detailed analysis. Its focus will include the regional impacts of these options. This demonstrates the seriousness of this Labor government's commitment to finding an appropriate solution which will encourage Australians to recycle more.


That is not the only step Labor is taking to promote the protection of the environment. The Australian government has consistently shown its commitment to sustainability and responsible environmental management through legislation and action. This has been most recently seen in the enactment of the Product Stewardship Act 2011. The Product Stewardship Act passed the Australian parliament last year. It provides the basis for a more efficient and environmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia. It demonstrates Labor's commitment to the environment. Product stewardship means that everyone involved in the production, supply and use of the products we consume shares responsibility for those products. This extends all the way from the point of design through to the manufacturing process, right through to the end of the product's life and disposal.


Three organisations have been approved to deliver e-waste collection and recycling services under the scheme. In April 2012, right here in Canberra the first free e-waste recycling service started. This is just the beginning. It is the start of a nationwide rollout. It will boost television and computer recycling rates to 30 per cent in 2012-13 and to 80 per cent by 2021-22, providing a long-term solution to television and computer waste.


Technology is rapidly developing and, as new products are introduced, old ones are discarded, and it is very important that we can cope with this waste by recycling rather than packing it up in the boot of the car and dumping it in the landfill at the nearest tip. Televisions and computers contain valuable non-renewable resources, including gold and other precious metals, as well as hazardous materials, including lead, bromine, mercury and zinc. By recycling them, we can recover useful materials and at the same time reduce health and environmental risks. This is a win-win situation and demonstrates the positive results of recycling. The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme is funded and implemented by the television and computer industry and regulated by the Australia government under the Product Stewardship Act.


Recycling is not the only way to protect the environment. Labor is taking this fight to many fronts. Further, the Labor government has demonstrated its commitment to the environment through its grant program Caring for our Country. Through this project, the Labor government will fund 66 new projects across the nation at a cost of $12.5 million. These projects will protect Australia's natural environment. They will safeguard our iconic natural places and protect our unique species. These projects demonstrate a responsible commitment to the environment. They are funded under the 2012-13 Caring for our Country business plan. They represent value for money and are located all across Australia. These Caring for our Country projects include funding natural resource management areas in Western Australia to regions on the eastern seaboard. Projects addressing Indigenous engagement and Northern and remote Australia are also well represented. Safeguarding our iconic natural places is essential in our continent-wide strategy for environmental protection. Caring for our Country not only protects our environment but also protects and enhances the social and economic values of our iconic regions.


Australia is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet and we have a responsibility to protect it for ourselves and for the citizens of the world now and into the future. We all know that habitat degradation, the spread of invasive pest plants and animals, the effects of climate change and human activity pose significant threats to our environment. The Labor government are acting to address this. Through the introduction of our carbon price mechanism we have shown that this government have a clear plan to cut pollution, tackle climate change and deliver the economic reform Australia needs to move to a clean energy future. We have put a price on pollution—the carbon price. It is a cheap and fair way to cut pollution. It will build a clean future for Australia and a clean energy economy. We are leading the world in this form of environmental protection. This scheme is the best way to stop businesses polluting as it gives businesses an incentive to invest in clean energy. Charging industries when they pollute is the surest way to change this behaviour and make Australia a cleaner place. We are reinvesting this money to assist families and households.


Labor has not shied away from making the tough decisions when it comes to protecting the environment. We understand that we must do this to ensure the health of our great land and for our economic future. These decisions are not easy. They take thousands of hours of intensive policy research and development. They are complex. We understand this. This bill is yet another clear demonstration of the failure to understand this process. It is not well thought through. It has not taken into account the economic consequences of trying to push a bill through this place without due diligence. On the other hand, we want to do what is right for the Australian people, for industries who employ many thousands of Australians and for the environment. We do not think that this is mutually exclusive. We believe that there is a solution that will be of benefit to all of these groups, and we are working with state and territory governments to find it.


I ask those listening or reading the Hansardto not be misled: The vote that we will cast in this place today opposing this bill is not a reflection of our views on recycling or on the environment, as the Greens will no doubt try to claim. The vote we are casting today is in favour of good process, sound policy and doing the right, the fair, the open and the honest thing by industry, by the environment and, most importantly, by the Australian people.


We live in a very special country and we have a unique responsibility to protect it. The Labor Party take this responsibility very, very seriously. Do not for one moment think otherwise. So today I rise not to oppose the environment; nor do I rise to oppose recycling. I rise to oppose a bill which does not propose an adequate solution to the management of packaged waste. This bill is pre-empting the results of a long period of consultation that is being undertaken. It is not a bill that will provide the solutions we need or the careful consideration that the Australian people and the environment deserve.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (10:41):  I rise to make a very brief contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010—and I thank Senator Xenophon for allowing me to do so prior to his contribution. The government is opposed to this bill for a number of reasons. I am opposed for the reasons that have been outlined by Senator Brown quite eloquently relating to the process of consultation that is underway between the federal government and the states concerning measures to improve recycling rates and look at schemes to promote recycling in our country.


Traditionally, beverage container deposit schemes have been operated on a state basis and reflect state environmental laws. The two that are operating in South Australia and in the Northern Territory are industry-run schemes on a cooperative basis. That is the approach that I believe is necessary for a successful scheme to be developed nationally, and that is the process that the federal government has entered into through COAG in cooperation with the states. The three largest states in the Commonwealth are involved in that and are essential to the successful development of any container deposit scheme operating on a national basis. I oppose this bill on the basis that there is a great risk that this bill would undermine that process going on at a national level.


I am also opposed to this bill because I believe it raises constitutional issues in the method by which it has been introduced into the parliament. The bill at clause 13 'provides that a producer or importer must pay the levy within 14 days after the end of the month in which the beverage container was sold to a wholesaler, retailer or individual, or to a producer or distributor of beverages in beverage containers.' There is, I believe, an issue of constitutional validity in that it may be construed that the bill imposes taxation. The relevant High Court authority on this issue is the case of Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd and the Commonwealth—a decision of the High Court of Australia of 1993—where the majority of the court, Chief Justice Mason and Justices Brennan, Deane and Gaudron, found that that:


… the collecting body of a fee does not have to be a public body for the fee to be regarded as a tax. Therefore a levy collected by a private body dictated by a statute for public purposes gives the private body a public character. 


And therefore raises a question mark over the validity of the levy.



The Commonwealth can, of course, apply a bill for taxation but, as we well know, section 53 of the Commonwealth Constitution says:


Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate—


which this bill proposes to do. Therefore I believe it raises an issue of constitutional validity, and certainly a question mark over the bill, and it is something that would no doubt be considered were the Senate to pass this legislation. That is another reason that I am opposed to the bill. But, on the whole, again I raise the issue of the process of consultation that is being undertaken at the moment with the states and the very great risk that the passage of this bill would undermine that cooperative process.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-09-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:46):  I will address Senator Thistlethwaite's considered contribution in relation to the constitutionality of this. I do not necessarily accept the point that is being made by Senator Thistlethwaite but I think that, even if that did have validity, the government could still indicate whether it supports the intent of this bill and supports a national container deposit scheme. So I think that is a separate issue. Let us not used that not use that as an excuse not to do something—and I am not suggesting that the good Senator was doing that. We need to make a decision in this place on this question: is this a piece of policy that we support or not? I believe this bill, the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010, is a piece of legislation that we ought to support.


The benefits of container deposit schemes are impressive, and the facts and figures suggest that they actually work. The South Australian scheme, which has been operating for over 30 years, achieves a recycling rate of more than 80 per cent—which is nearly double that of the rest of the country. When the scheme was originally introduced, the Australian Food and Grocery Council decried it as a 'tax on drinks'. Today, more than 98 per cent of the South Australian community supports it. I should say parenthetically of the Australian Food and Grocery Council that they are the same mob that have been fighting tooth and nail any sensible reforms as to country of origin food labelling laws, which the overwhelming majority of Australians support. There are some issues on which I am very happy to work with the Australian Food and Grocery Council in terms of private labels and the dominance of Coles and Woolworths, but when it comes to these issues, which I think are very much in the community and public interest, they are on the wrong side of history.


There has been 98 per cent support in South Australia for the container deposit scheme. I am sure governments around the world dream of the day when a new tax is supported by 98 per cent of its constituents. While it is early days for the Northern Territory, the container deposit scheme there has already increased recycling rates by more than 100 per cent. And that is not just beverage containers; it is recycling overall.


The evidence is mounting up that container deposits are a valuable piece of environmental policy—and cost effective at that. A national container deposit scheme would make a significant difference. Despite our best efforts to lift our recycling rates, our consumption continues to grow and we now landfill more than 21 million tonnes of waste every year. According to the Boomerang Alliance, a group of environmental organisations which has been studying container deposit schemes across the world for more than 10 years, a national deposit scheme would reduce the amount of rubbish in our parks, beaches and roadsides by as much as 15 per cent. Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I do not know whether you have ever done the trip across the Nullarbor into South Australia, but I know that those who travel across the border into Victoria, for instance, actually notice a difference in terms of roadside rubbish. I believe that is principally because of our container deposit scheme. You actually see a difference while on the roads in terms of the amount of rubbish that is left by the roadside.


A national container deposit scheme would increase Australia's recycling by more than 600,000 tonnes each year. That is more than 600,000 tonnes of rubbish not going into landfill. It would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1.3 million tonnes every year, the equivalent of taking 140,000 cars off the road in terms of air quality improvement. That is a much more efficient way of doing things than the aborted cash for clunkers scheme. It would also create jobs—about 4,000—mostly in rural and regional Australia, according to the Boomerang Alliance, and I think that has been robustly looked at by them.


But there is a possible downside that is completely avoidable with appropriate safeguards. Research conducted by the Boomerang Alliance and released publicly in August indicates that Coca-Cola, Lion Nathan and Schweppes could be charging prices that are not reflective of the cost of the container deposit schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory. The container deposit schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory see customers refunded 10c per eligible can or bottle when they are recycled. The majority of beverage companies do the right thing by only passing on the net cost of about 10c to customers. Unfortunately, there are a few who may not. For example, as published in the Boomerang Alliance's report, catalogues for Coles supermarkets for the month of July of this year showed price differences between states for the same products. Three bottles of Coca-Cola brand soft drink varieties were advertised for $7 in Sydney and Perth, where there are no container deposit schemes. In Adelaide and Darwin, where schemes are in place, the same three bottles were advertised for $8. I quote from the report:


Coca Cola Amatil brands like Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Sprite, Lift, Mt Franklin and Mother Energy drinks prices in Adelaide and Darwin are on average 22 cents more than those in other major cities …


On average, as the Boomerang Alliance found, Schweppes brands were 16.5c more. This is not a price difference reflected across the board on beverages between states. According to the Boomerang Alliance, other drinks averaged just 1.4c more per item in Adelaide and Darwin compared with other major cities. While a few extra cents or so per bottle may not seem an amount worth worrying about, let me put it in these terms: every year it equates to an extra $31.9 million that customers are paying for these products in South Australia and the Northern Territory. According to the Boomerang Alliance these are avoidable costs. That is why I have done some work on this with the Boomerang Alliance. In August of this year, I wrote to Mr Rod Sims, Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and pointed this out and made a formal complaint in regard to these issues. I hope that the ACCC will find it within its remit to thoroughly investigate this issue to determine whether there is any profiteering, because the Australian Food and Grocery Council assert in their media release of 25 June 2012 that price rises have been as a result of the container deposit scheme. That seems to be something worth investigation by the ACCC. If price gouging is going on, if consumers are being charged more, then that should be looked at—in the same way that the ACCC quite rightly should pick up on and prosecute and enforce the law against any companies making false assertions in relation to the impact of a carbon tax. If people are price gouging as a result of the carbon tax, they ought to be prosecuted. Similarly, if they are price gouging or purporting that there will be unfair impacts on consumers because of the container deposit scheme, that should be looked at.


Within a free market, I am comfortable with companies passing on the net cost of the container deposit scheme to customers, but this seems to go much further. The evidence suggests that companies are manipulating their prices and ignoring the value of unredeemed and scrap sales which offset most of their cost. That is why I wrote to the ACCC asking them to investigate the pricing practices of Coca-Cola, Schweppes and Lion Nathan, particularly given the ACCC's recent crackdown on profiteering as a result of the carbon tax. I have also called on the South Australian government to investigate the beverage companies and their pricing in relation to the container deposit scheme. But, most of all, I am calling on Coca-Cola, Lion Nathan and Schweppes to stop any practice which could be seen as price gouging from consumers. If this is how customers are being treated then that is something that ought to stop.


Container deposit schemes are a public good. They increase recycling rates and reduce landfill. They are supported by communities and, at least in my home state, they give kids the chance to earn some extra pocket money. If these schemes are being rorted to increase profits, that goes against their underlying premise, and a little bit in return can stimulate a lot of public good. I strongly encourage the government to request that the ACCC monitor this scheme should the legislation pass. But, in any event, it ought to. It has been a successful scheme for over 30 years in South Australia and the time has come for its national adoption. We cannot allow companies to take advantage of community and political goodwill. It has received 98 per cent support in my home state. This is a very modest cost impost on consumers, which will lead to a lot of public good and that is why I support this bill.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:55):  Having seen the schoolkids up in the gallery who are of a very similar age to my kids in Tassie, it occurred to me that there is a contrast between taking action on cleaning up rubbish and what we are doing here in parliament today with the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. I want to mention a program that my two children are involved in, particularly my 13-year-old daughter at Riverside High School—a nationwide program called Expedition Class. It is funded partly by the Bookend Trust in Tasmania and they have a program called Coastwatchers. A very fine gentleman, Andrew Hughes, is on his bike cycling around the country, visiting schools and taking schoolkids to clean up beaches. They make sculptures out of marine debris—sculptures of sea animals that are impacted by marine debris—and then they do projects about how these marine animals are being impacted by beverage containers, which were the key part of the marine debris I mentioned yesterday in the public interest debate.


The point I am trying to make is that there are people in this country—including the Surfrider Foundation, whom I have worked with for years; the Tangaroa Blue Foundation, and other organisations—that are taking action on reducing rubbish. We have Keep Australia Beautiful and other organisations, but the connection with the marine environment is one that has not been made yet. I think our parliament needs to take action. What has pleased me today listening to the debate is that all parties in this chamber believe in reducing waste in the environment. However, it is obvious that a container deposit scheme has been discussed nationally for over 20 years. In fact, it has been discussed internationally in lots of different countries and at international conventions. Policy instruments to try to remove debris from our waterways, landscapes and landfill include things such as recycling.


A container deposit scheme is a market based instrument that relies on a price incentive. It uses markets; it is not in itself seen to be a regulatory instrument. It provides an incentive for people to change their behaviour and there is a reward in place for people to pick up trash—cash for containers. Cash for cans is an Australian icon as old as Vegemite. It has been around for a long time. Most of us in this chamber grew up with something like that—whether it was for milk bottles or for other containers. We know from the survey work done by the Boomerang Alliance that most Australians agree with the concept. It was fantastic to hear Senator Xenophon talking with such pride about how clean his state is. Unfortunately we cannot say that about the whole country. Our bill here today is designed to put in place a national scheme. That is not taking away from the fact that there is a state and a territory that already have a container deposit scheme. However, as was mentioned by Senator Xenophon and will be covered by my colleague Senator Ludlam, we have concerns about an industry administered scheme. This bill is for a government administered scheme, and there are a lot of advantages to that. We also believe that the process underway at COAG, while positive, is just more talk. We have heard senators in the chamber talking about that process today, but that is what it is—it is talk. It is not action and it is not leadership. We have the potential today to put in place a scheme where parliament nationally can show leadership on this issue. I reiterate: parliament can take action. 


A market based scheme has worked well in other areas when we deal with pollution, and that is essentially what this is. We are talking about rubbish—cans and plastic bottles—but rubbish is pollution. It is a by-product or part of production and consumption. As I mentioned yesterday in the public interest debate, a container deposit scheme is unique in terms of its policy prescriptions because it puts an emphasis on the consumer as well as on the producer to take some action. The scheme has often been criticised by the industry as not their responsibility in terms of this rubbish that is thrown out the door. If you throw a plastic bottle or a can out the window when you are driving you get fined for that; there is a penalty in place for that. But we know that up to half of the beverage containers in this country do not make their way into home recycling—which has benefits and is admirable—but find their way into waterways and ultimately into the ocean and other areas over time and then they photodegrade. So we need a scheme that incentivises people to do the right thing and that works well in terms of its funding. We have various scenarios on what this would cost. We are convinced that this is a neat solution to a dirty problem. We are also convinced that it will be a popular solution.


I mentioned yesterday that recent work by the CSIRO on the marine debris database has shown that between a third and a half of all plastics found in Australia are beverage containers. The database is growing. This is a very new area of focus for the scientific community. However, the problem with damaging marine animals and the research that has been done on that has been around for years. I would like to stress that our use of plastics grows exponentially every day. For 40 years the world has wanted to get rid of plastics in the oceans but has not been able to; in fact, the problem continues to get worse. I would like to see not just a national container deposit scheme, I would like to see an international container deposit scheme. When I think about walking on the beach with my kids, I wonder how else we can solve this problem. A lot of plastic that is washed up on our beaches does come from China and other countries. The plastics that we find in the south-west of Tasmania in the World Heritage areas wash up from all around the world. If we are going to get rid of this problem or tackle it effectively we need a policy prescription that can be rolled out right around the globe.


If it makes sense to put a container deposit scheme in place, why hasn't it happened? What is it that is holding this back? The answer to that is industry. Industry is in talks. Industry does not want to see a national container deposit scheme. Which industry? The Grocery Council covers a large number of beverage companies and packaging companies, and they are a very powerful lobby group. If we had agreement from the big companies like Coca-Cola that this was an effective solution to the problem then we would get some action. This is why it has been held up so long, this is why we have been talking about the problem for 20 years, this is why we are doing more talking in COAG: industry does not want to see a national container deposit scheme.


I firmly believe that businesses and companies should be part of the solution and that it will be to their benefit to be part of the solution. I would encourage a positive attitude and action towards working with industry to get recognition that a container deposit scheme is an effective way of tackling this problem. It is not the only way; it is just one tool in the chest. There are lots of other things we need to do to encourage more recycling and to encourage participation by consumers in acknowledging issues with single use plastics and packaging. We need to invest in biodegradable plastic products, which are starting to become more commonplace now but are too expensive because of economies of scale. We do need to consider other regulatory measures on things such as plastic bags. We are all familiar with this. As I said, we have been talking about it for years. I would encourage all senators in this chamber and everyone who reads Hansard to do what the school kids are doing: take some action to help clean up this problem. You can do that by supporting our container deposit bill today.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:06):  I rise to close the debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010 but it is with no great pleasure that I do so. This bill is, from memory, the first one that I introduced when I arrived here in 2008. Today on the basis of the rather lacklustre contributions from the other parties, with the honourable exception of Senator Xenophon, I have no expectation that the bill will be carried. Of course that is not the end of the story. This is a very popular scheme. It is nice to have Senator Crossin chairing us because, if she had been able to take part in the debate, she would be able say that the NT government had dug its heels in, stuck to its guns and introduced a scheme for container deposits—the second jurisdiction in the country to do so against a fierce attack by the beverage industry. I will talk a little bit more this morning about how that is playing out on the national stage. 


To his great credit, Chief Minister Henderson issued one of the most sharply worded press statements I have ever seen from any minister's office anywhere telling Coca-Cola Amatil by name to back away from the kind of bullying countercampaign that they have run. I will describe in a little detail this morning exactly how audacious the beverage industry has become, or I should say to be accurate: some sections of the beverage industry. There are a couple of companies—in fact half the industry, you could say—that has stayed out of the grubby attack on this extremely popular scheme.


This is a bit reminiscent of the way the debate around a national feed-in tariff has played out: an extraordinarily popular initiative that has been proven to work in jurisdictions elsewhere that has been attacked by some sections of industry and now we are getting a patchwork of schemes getting set up all over the place. In the case of a feed-in tariff, the Australian Greens have a bill that would provide for a nationally consistent scheme, which is what some sections of industry, quite rightly, are asking for. In the case of a container deposit system, again we believe there is room—and a very strong case—for a nationally consistent scheme so that industry knows where it stands, as do the public. But instead my colleagues in state and territory parliaments around the country are getting consistent container deposit schemes. My colleague Robin Chapple has a bill in the Western Australian parliament that would provide for it in WA if Canberra cannot be bothered to pick up the campaign. So we are likely to end up with a patchwork of schemes. We believe a nationally consistent approach is the right one. 


Sections of the beverage industry led by Coca-Cola Amatil have a fourfold strategy of undermining the case for container deposit schemes. One of the Labor senators said before: 'This is not what people want.' Actually, they do. Consistent polls show 80, 90 per cent or even into the high 90s support for a container deposit system, partly because we have seen it working in South Australia since the 1970s; we know that it works.


The fourfold strategy is to delay, confuse, attack and then rort—and we are seeing this played out absolutely beautifully at the moment by the beverage industry. The delaying strategy is very well known, and I have spoken of it extensively before. We saw government senators struggling to stay awake as they described the RIS process, which Senator Farrell, who has just joined us, is intimately familiar with. People just roll their eyes when they realise what the scheme has had to go through. It is the regulatory equivalent of holding a pillow over somebody's head. They have decided to try and smother the scheme in various forms of regulatory impact statements in order to delay it for as long as possible. Delay, delay, delay—tie it up in the kind of brown tape that we have seen industry use in order to delay, for example, the rollout of successful renewable energy incentive schemes.


Delay has been reasonably successful but, as some government senators have pointed out, we are seeing some slow progress through COAG—achingly slow, but it is occurring. So industry has moved to stage 2, which is to try and confuse the debate and introduce data into the process to try and poison the economic models that are used to assess in a regulatory impact statement which scheme is better, which is better value for money, which is likely to be more successful. For example, you could see—if you want to read it in this way—the RIS claiming that a CDS would cost $1.4 billion. That sounds like a lot of money—of course it is a lot of money; anything is with a 'b' in front of it. However, that is over 20 years, so it averages out, even if you believe that cost, at about $70 million a year. Here is where it gets interesting: the industry has been very happy to make sure that these figures include participation costs or inconvenience costs, which is an imaginary number. It is a made-up number to try and quantify the inconvenience of walking out to the kerb and sticking the can in a bin. That has amounted to $22 million a year—that is unbelievably misleading and deceptive to introduce an imaginary number to try and tip the financial scales in these spreadsheets against a container deposit scheme.


It is reasonably well understood, because we have got these schemes on their feet around the country in a couple of places and elsewhere around the world—in places like Canada—that the actual financial flows and costs of running a scheme are no more than about half a cent, if that, per container. That is the transaction cost of making sure a scheme like this works, and that should be accounted for separately to the 10c deposit that is then refunded when you do the right thing. So the whole idea of introducing an imaginary inconvenience cost to the financial models is for no other reason than to make it look appallingly expensive so that opponents of the scheme can then be marching around the landscape waving a piece of paper that says it is going to cost more than a billion dollars. It is a total fabrication. In fact the scheme that is represented in the bill before us—just in case there is a possibility of changing the minds of a few senators—is revenue positive because of the small number of unredeemed deposits. 


We know from long experience in South Australia that no scheme is perfect—recycling rates there are up above 80 per cent, much higher than the rest of the country. That other 20 per cent are things that have still gone to landfill. They have gone out with the regular kerbside. They have ended up in the ocean, as Senator Whish-Wilson has so eloquently reminded us. Those deposits are never redeemed, and that is how the scheme pays for itself. That is how the network of collection centres are rolled out and that is how in a mature model you would find, I think, a revenue source that would enable you to do things like beach clean-ups, get some of the plastics out of the ocean or support alternate production methods. We can now get plastics made from cellulose that simply disintegrate if they are not recycled and genuinely biodegrade in ways that plastics simply do not.


When the strategy of delaying and confusing fails, the industry goes on the attack—and I could pin a crushed beer can on the chests of those who thought up this campaign as some kind of medal for the most brazenly offensive bit of rent-seeking that has ever been devised by way of an advertising campaign. People would have been well aware.A Current Affair ran a piece on this not so long ago, but you probably would have seen the full-page ads in most of the national daily newspapers with the headline: 'Unlike some politicians we think you have already paid your fair share of tax'. And there is a picture of a bunch of empty beverage containers with the word 'extra' plastered over them, as though the evil government and the evil Greens have come up with some scheme to make you pay even more for beverage containers. Those ads were run by the Australian Food and Grocery Council, and I will have a little more to say about them in a moment. The banner, of course, is 'No drink container tax'. So it is ripping off this fictional campaign that Mr Abbott has been running that the carbon price instrument and the clean energy package represent offensive taxes on Australians.


But this is something other. The industry has then gone ahead and produced modelling as to what would happen if a container deposit scheme along the lines of the one that is operating in the Northern Territory now were to run nationally, with the industry in control of how much it costs. It will cost hundreds of dollars a year, and that, I think, is the gift of whoever thought this up. The scheme has become more expensive than it needed to in the Northern Territory, and the reason it is so expensive is that the industry is profiteering. They have just added holding costs; they have added carriage costs to the containers and are basically rorting the scheme. They are profiteering; they have just added a margin on top when the scheme, in fact, would quite handily have paid for itself out of the unredeemed deposits. No, instead they have just added a holding cost, and that is why the scheme is more expensive in the Northern Territory than it needs to be.


What an act of brazen genius to then commission somebody to run a series of full-page ads saying, 'If the beverage industry is allowed to run this scheme nationally it will cost you hundreds of dollars a year, so make sure that you vote against the container deposit scheme.' I hope that nobody on the government benches has been sucked in by this thing. And I also note in Senator Macdonald's contribution—and he is normally not short of a certain amount of venom and anti-Greens polemic—that even he did not bother to use these fabrications that are being produced by sections of the beverage industry. I do not think that even Senator Macdonald was sucked in by this.


So I hope that our environment minister has not been. When the industry tried it on in the Northern Territory, Chief Minister Henderson pushed back and told Coca-Cola Amatil to get stuffed—to his great credit. With my Western Australian colleagues in 2008, unfortunately, the story was different. The beverage industry went on the attack against a state container deposit scheme in WA. They ran a marginal seat campaign running the same kind of highly deceptive advertising that they are running now, and the Carpenter government backed down. So we do not have a state container deposit scheme. The state ALP is still talking about it and, as I said, my Greens colleague Robyn Chappell has a bill; but we do not have a scheme operating in WA because of the same deceptive and misleading campaign that the industry is trying to run now.


I must admit that this is something other; there is a part of me that actually admires just how brazenly offensive this is. I have never seen anything quite like it. As Senator Xenophon has intimated, we will be writing to the ACCC to investigate whether an industry that runs ads saying that if this scheme is introduced the government will be taxing you and making your life more expensive as a result of charges that they themselves have added to make the scheme much more expensive than it needs to be is in fact being deceptive and misleading. I will be very, very interested to see what the ACCC thinks of that kind of conduct.


I will also indicate now for the benefit of any of the minister's advisers who are listening, or the minister himself, that we will be going into negotiations with the government to seek a short Senate inquiry into whether the industry has basically ripped off and undermined the scheme in the Northern Territory. The Boomerang Alliance paper that Senator Xenophon was speaking briefly to before contains some very interesting financial data about if beverages are more expensive in South Australia and the Territory when you net out the increased costs, the transport costs of shipping materials to the Northern Territory. The figures break out very interestingly. For Coca-Cola Amatil, Lion Nathan National Foods and Schweppes, who happen to be members and financial supporters of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, yes, there does appear to be a margin there. This smells enough for the ACCC, and I believe a Senate inquiry, to want to take a look at it.


When you look at Fosters, Diageo and Coopers on the other hand, there is no imprint; there is no additional price being levied by them. It appears that the part of the industry that is running this deceptive campaign under the rubric of the Australian Food and Grocery Council is actually ripping us off. Then they have the nerve to run a national ad campaign saying, 'Careful, you don't want to let us rip you off nationally. It'll cost you hundreds of dollars a year.' Breathtaking. I think this is, in fact, a very clear-cut example of profiteering. There is your fourfold strategy: delay, confuse, attack and, when you lose, just gouge. Turn it to your advantage. Brilliant—absolutely brilliant! It has to stop.


We will get a national container deposit scheme, I believe. The Australian Greens will come back with a bill. We will take advice from the industry and we will take the benefit of the work that has been done in the regulatory impact assessment process to see if the bill needs to be changed at all. We have always been open to negotiation and counterproposals on this one. But instead, we have seen a rather feeble response from government senators coming in here and reading from their talking points. Check the Hansard: there are a whole slabs of the contributions that are basically word for word. Please come in here, at least, with an original thought in your head. At least Senator Thistlethwaite, although completely off target, had a go at an original angle attacking the scheme.


What bugs me the most, I guess, is when we come in here with a concept that is proven, that is extremely popular and that is something that even Commonwealth environment minister, Tony Burke, has said that he supports, we are told, 'Yes, we support you in principle but we are going to vote against your bill because what we would rather do is spend another couple of decades crawling through a regulatory impact assessment process while we are undermined, white-anted and sandbagged by these parts of the beverage industry every step of the way.' We do not have decades. For any senators who were not in the chamber yesterday, Senator Whish-Wilson spoke so eloquently of the garbage patches that are arising in the middle of the world's great oceans and the trash washed up on beaches and inside marine creatures—the garbage that is left and ends up washing into rivers. Materials that we could use end up getting turfed into landfill; dumped and rotting, giving off greenhouse gas emissions or just being lost to industrial recycling processes forever. It is heartbreaking. It is absolutely time that we took action.


So we indicate for the benefit of senators now that we will call a division on this bill. We believe very strongly that its time is not too far away. We encourage the environment minister to work with us to introduce a brief Senate inquiry into whether the industry is basically white-anted and is now profiteering off the schemes in the NT, and arguably in South Australia as well. We will be back with another bill; this story is not yet concluded, and it will not be until we have what the vast majority of Australians want—a national container deposit scheme.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  The question is that the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010 be read a second time.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (09:31):  I rise to continue my remarks on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. I want to take the opportunity to run through a few facts and figures about waste in Queensland. Unfortunately, it is not a pretty picture. Waste generation in Queensland is still increasing—and rapidly. Between 2003-04 and 2007-08 waste generation grew by 40 per cent. Over the same period the population increased by 10 per cent and retail turnover increased by 21 per cent. Our total volume of waste produced every year is simply huge. In 2008 there was an estimated 32.6 million tonnes generated from commercial, industrial, construction, demolition and household activities. This includes the data collected on waste that is classified for indefinite storage, such as fly-ash from electricity generation, which amounts to 22.3 million tonnes. Queensland households and businesses generate the remaining 10.3 million tonnes.


The trend over the past five years has been for a significant increase in waste generation and disposal. The data shows that domestic waste generation in 2007-08 was 40 per cent higher than in 2003-04 and yet, as I said, the population only grew by 10 per cent. In 2007-08 more than 60 per cent of the waste generated by households and businesses was disposed to landfill. According to the 2011 National Litter Index, Queensland is the most littered mainland state. Tasmania unfortunately tops the national list.


This bill, which I am really proud to support, proposes a solution for the 12 billion beverage containers that Australians use every year. It seeks to address practicably the fact that only about half of those are recycled, while most of the remainder wind up as litter or in landfill and, of course, much of that runs off into our precious marine environment. We have a serious problem with landfill and waste in Australia and, as I have already said, Queensland is one of the main contributors. It is just a really wasteful situation in Queensland and across Australia, which is exactly why we need a bill like this.


Some argue that there is no need for national leadership on waste and that we can just trust the states, so I want to put on record my deep concern about one of the many retrograde steps that the Newman government have taken in their short time in office so far. The Newman government wound back Queensland waste levy, which had been set at $35 a tonne, on 1 July this year. That levy had been designed to promote recycling by making the cost of landfill more expensive. But removing this fee for commercial, industrial and construction waste makes landfill in South-east Queensland a more attractive proposition for some operators in northern New South Wales, where a waste levy on those vast volumes of waste continues to apply, so we have South-east Queensland becoming a dumping ground for everybody's waste. This is a serious backward step for Queensland and, unfortunately, is one of the many backward steps and attacks on Queensland's environment under this new government. We really need national leadership to tackle our waste issues—the states are just not up to it.


Returning to this bill, there is broad, consistent and very high support in the community for a container deposit scheme and there is a demonstrated willingness to pay. The study was done twice and we are now buried in the swamp of a regulatory impact statement process being undertaken by the Commonwealth on container deposits that simply has this proposal buried in quicksand. At best, we think this could result in a scheme being implemented in two or three years time, thanks to this analysis paralysis. We need to develop a sense of urgency. For every 12 months that we drag our heels on this, another 12 billion beverage containers are used.


The main industry-government program is the Australian Packaging Covenant, which sounds great but does not really deliver as much as industry seems to think. In fact, the latest information on the recycling rate for beverage containers shows that it has dropped to about 40 per cent, down from the 48 per cent that is claimed in the packaging regulatory impact statement. As a result, the overall recycling rate for all packaging has also dropped by about three points. This calls into question the claims made about the effectiveness of the Australian Packaging Covenant—it certainly continues to reach its own 2010 target of 65 per cent.


When you consider all the co-benefits of a container deposit scheme—more jobs, help for charities, new material drop-off centres and a big reduction in litter—it is a scheme that wins hands down. With regard to local government, which supports a container deposit scheme, the regulatory impact statement finds that it would benefit from a CDS by more than $2 billion over 20 years. When releasing the RIS the environment ministers said they:


… recognised that assessment of the costs and benefits of options has many dimensions and cannot be based on quantifiable matters alone.


The Consultation RIS acknowledges other potential benefits of better manage packaging, including the employment generated by more recycling, reduced use of energy and water, and the provision of infrastructure to support other recycling.


Surely the case has now been proven. If we want to solve the beverage container problem, acknowledged as the main packaging issue, then we should act now. Opponents of a CDS like to talk about how well we are doing in recycling packaging, but the figures are bulked out by the 70 per cent recycling rate for paper and cardboard. We do not have a problem here if you include those figures, and yet beverage containers are slumped at 40 per cent. The only certain and sustainable policy is a container deposit scheme. This factor is acknowledged by the RIS in comparison to the untested assumptions and fairyland targets proposed in other industry options.


My colleague Senator Ludlam has noted that this is a portfolio for patient people. The larger project of creating a genuinely sustainable Australia for cleaning up our act, for cleaning our fouled waterways, our parklands and our wilderness from rubbish and for recovering those valuable materials that go to waste is worth it. But now we are wasting time. Australia needs and is ready for this bill, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (09:38):  I rise to speak on the Greens bill for a government run beverage container deposit and recovery scheme, a scheme that would collect a deposit from importers and producers of beverage containers under four litres and provide a full refund to consumers when containers are returned to a collection point. It does not sound like a bad idea, does it? In spirit it is not but, instead of allowing the reasonable processes the government is taking through COAG to run their course, the Greens have put this bill up today. Instead of trying to get an outcome that is fitting with the South Australian scheme that has been running for 35 years and instead of trying to get an outcome that is fitting with the recently enacted Northern Territory scheme, the Greens want to throw out these schemes and implement a national scheme—a national scheme that is government run rather than use the current state based industry-run schemes as a base. There is definitely a need for further work in this area.


The schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory are based on industry-run arrangements. This bill proposes a government-run scheme—a government-run scheme that would be a different mechanism over and above the two existing arrangements. Locally, this only leads to increased regulatory complexity as well as cost to industry and the community. I am unsure why the Greens consider it is a good thing to increase legislation in this space when we have a system that works. It is run in South Australia and the Northern Territory.


Federal Labor is committed to reducing the amount of packaging, waste and litter in our society. This includes increasing recycling facilities and schemes for beverage containers. We want to continue to work on this with state and territory governments through the COAG process to expand the schemes to all states and territories. We are not in favour of a national government-run scheme. What we are doing at the moment is to work through the COAG regulation impact statement process. This process is across the broad issues encompassing packaging waste and includes container deposit schemes. This process has just reached the decision regulation impact statement stage. That means that this bill, which would be over and above state schemes, would sideline all of the good work done during the COAG process. It is appropriate that we continue the good work underway in the COAG processes, work that is seeking to expand the South Australian and Northern Territory industry-run schemes, not impose national government-run regulation of packaging waste. 


According to the consultation regulatory impact statement for COAG, Australia's packaging recycling rate has increased from 39 per cent in 2003 to 63 per cent in 2011. This was achieved through concerted industry, state and local government action and also the Australian Packaging Covenant. I repeat: this increase in recycling rates in just eight years from 39 per cent to 63 per cent is quite an achievement and it has again, as I have said, been achieved through cooperation by industry, state and local governments with the Australian Packaging Covenant.


This matter has been progressed by government and industry working together. It seems illogical for the federal government to now impose a regulation that is different to that which has been cooperatively progressed. I understand that the Australian Packaging Covenant represents a commitment by governments and industry to the sustainable design, use and recovery of packaging. It is a voluntary component of this cooperative, co-regulatory model which has been designed to reduce the environmental impacts of consumer packaging. The covenant encourages improvements in packaging design, higher recycling rates and better stewardship of packaging. Product stewardship imposes an obligation on all those who benefit from production of consumer packaging to assume a share of responsibility for a product over its life cycle.


There are currently over 800 signatories to the covenant, representing a significant proportion of industry in Australia. Participation in the covenant is voluntary, but brand owners with a turnover of over $5 million per annum who choose not to become signatories or who fail to comply with the covenant requirements are regulated under the National Environmental Protection (Used Packaging Materials) Measure. Each state implements the National Environment Protection Measure through its own regulations.


This covenant mechanism has, in part, seen Australia's packaging recycling rate increased from 39 per cent in 2003 to 63 per cent in 2011. Most Australians have access to broad municipal kerbside recycling services which have assisted Australians with household recycling activities. In 2009, over 91 per cent of Australian households used municipal kerbside recycling to recycle waste, an increase from 87 per cent in 2006. In 2009, almost all Australian households reported that they recycled waste and almost 90 per cent reported that they reused waste. This is a significant increase over the mid-1990s levels.


Labor has a proud record of environmental protection. Long before environmentalism became the movement that it is today, resplendent with a political party in this place, it was Labor that not only talked green but acted green—acting to protect the environment. It was a Labor premier of New South Wales who founded the Kosciusko National Park in 1944. It was a Labor government that intervened in 1983 to protect the Franklin River and surrounds. Prime Minister Hawke pushed for the enacting of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, which today sees some of Australia's most iconic sites protected. 


It took a Labor government to lead world efforts to preserve Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. In 1988, Prime Minister Hawke was told it was a lost cause to push for a mining ban. Thanks to his perseverance and determination, over two decades later Antarctica remains free from mining. It was also the Hawke Labor government which preserved Kakadu National Park by standing up to stop mining at Coronation Hill in 1991. At the time, a section of the mining industry said the decision would 'make or break the development of Australia's resources'. Twenty years later we know Labor made the right decision in the national interest. It is Labor that World Heritage listed the wet tropics of Queensland, the Daintree rainforest, and Labor that created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the authority to manage it.


This current Labor government has provided $200 million, the largest single commitment ever made, to address the threats of climate change and declining water quality to the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, it was a Labor government, the Keating government, which in 1992 signed and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We all know it took this Labor government to ratify the Kyoto protocol in 2007.


And let us not forget that state Labor around the country has a proud record too. New South Wales Labor brought together the resources and expertise of small agencies to create the Department of Environment and Conservation. They created financial incentives for pollution reduction by introducing load based licensing for air and water pollutants and enacted New South Wale's first contaminated land remediation laws. Queensland Labor enacted laws in 2004 to phase out land clearing, and by January 2007 most clearing had been banned.


Tasmanian Labor, working with federal Labor, is working through the details to protect further high-conservation-value forests. Tasmanian Labor introduced the Climate Change (State Action) Act 2008 to provide for a legislated emissions reduction target to reduce emissions to at least 60 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050. Labor in Victoria committed the state to a 20 per cent emissions reduction target by 2020. ACT Labor has set a target of 40 per cent by 2020.


And let us not forget the Clean Energy Future package that federal Labor negotiated through this parliament, demonstrating our commitment to striking the balance between economic growth and environmental protection and putting a price on carbon that will cut Australia's emissions by five per cent by 2020. And by 2050 we will have cut our emissions by 80 per cent.


Acting to protect our environment and preserve our nation for generations to come is not new to Labor; we have been doing it proudly for years. I note a recent campaign launched by the Australian Workers Union in Tasmania around preserving both the mining industry and the natural environment. This is a campaign where mining industry employees are seeking community support to continue their trade in just one per cent of the region. The workers and their unions are saying that they have done both for over 100 years. They want to continue to do both for the next 100. Mining is a critical part of the region's economy, and with several major projects currently planned, mining will continue to play a central role in the north-west's future prosperity. Labor has a proud record of environmental protection. We continue to work hard to strike the balance.


This bill does not strike the right balance. It does not respect the national cooperative work that has been done across the whole packaging waste and litter issue. It is a heavy-handed, national approach that seeks to undo the good work done at the COAG table, good work that has been seeking to involve industry and all levels of government to find a good outcome.


In December last year at the COAG table, environment ministers released the consultation regulation impact statement. This was an important step in better managing packaging waste and litter nationally. On 24 August this year, environment ministers met to consider outcomes of the consultation process and to make a decision on next steps in addressing the ongoing problems of packaging waste and litter. Ministers committed to progress to a decision regulation impact statement, and noted the strong response at the consultation regulation impact statement stage. This is the proper process for considering national regulation of packaging waste. It is the process agreed upon by COAG for any national regulatory reform. It is therefore important today that, while we may support the merits of this bill, we look to the COAG approach as a way forward—an approach that is seeking to build on current state based schemes and not to reinvent the wheel.


A regulation impact statement examines the likely impacts of a proposed regulation. It proposes a range of alternative options that could meet the government's policy objectives. It is an important means of providing evidence of what the problem that we are attempting to solve is and formalising the problem so that costs and benefits of each option can be assessed. This bill pre-empts the appropriate and transparent consideration of the costs and benefits of national approaches to packaging waste and litter which are currently underway.


Once the regulation impact statement process has concluded, COAG's Standing Council on Environment and Water will be in a better position to assess the merits of a range of national approaches to addressing packaging waste and litter, including a national container deposit scheme.


The Australian government and all state and territory governments made a commitment at the beginning of this process. This commitment was that the regulation impact statement process would be open and consultative, and allow for a balanced assessment of all options—including a national container deposit scheme. Consistent with the commitment to having an open and transparent process, stakeholders have been involved throughout—including through two workshops. The first workshop was used to gain the stakeholders' views on the range of problems. At the second, stakeholders sought to identify options which will target and address these problems.


At their recent meeting in August, ministers made a commitment that the process would continue to be transparent and consultative. As mentioned earlier, the consultation regulation impact statement was released on 7 December last year for an extended four-month public consultation. As part of the consultation process, a series of public forums were held. They commenced in Brisbane on 13 February this year and ran through to 7 March in capital cities, as well as the three regional centres of Bunbury, Townsville and Albury. These forums provided an opportunity for people to discuss the consultation regulation impact statement in further detail, to ask questions in relation to its findings and assumptions and, importantly, to give their views on the options that were proposed.


The consultation regulation impact statement was just that: a consultation document. It did not endorse one particular option over another, but aimed at stimulating further discussion on how to address this important issue. The subject has attracted a great deal of interest. Hundreds of submissions from industry, environment groups, the community and local government showed strong support for further action to address the impacts of packaging waste and litter. The community is getting behind this reform. We must follow the process that is seeking comprehensive change to management of packaging waste and litter. Yes, a container deposit scheme could play a good part in this.


We are moving through the process. I remind the Senate that ministers carefully considered the submissions received during the consultation process. The environment ministers committed to pushing ahead with a decision regulation impact statement to provide a more detailed analysis of the potential impacts of the options. Regulatory change can only take place once this decision regulation impact statement has been conducted, so this represents a significant step forward in this process. This is the appropriate process for considering national regulation of packaging waste and litter—national regulation that builds upon the good work done in South Australia and more recently in the Northern Territory and that builds upon the work done by all environment ministers and by industry.


Seven options were assessed in the consultation regulation impact statement in terms of their costs and benefits for packaging waste and litter. Two key stakeholders, the Boomerang Alliance and the beverage industry, proposed specific options to reduce packaging waste for the regulation impact statement to assess. At their August meeting ministers agreed that, in addition to the options considered in the consultation regulation impact statement, three further options will be included in the decision regulation impact statement. The first additional option is an industry co-regulatory stewardship scheme that will focus on beverage containers only. The second additional option is an approach similar to the Australian Packaging Covenant, with a substantial increase in funding from industry for packaging recycling and litter initiatives. The third additional option is a container deposit model based on the South Australian system.


In accordance with ministers' commitment to a transparent and open process, they have agreed to undertake targeted consultation with key stakeholders on the design of additional options. The decision regulation impact statement will undertake a more detailed analysis, including regional and other distributional impacts of options. I have just articulated that we have three additional options on the table. These are going through the regulation impact statement channels. These are seeking to build on the existing work done over many years to limit packaging waste and litter.


The Australian government has consistently displayed its commitment to sustainability and responsible environmental management. This has been most recently seen in the enactment of the Product Stewardship Act 2011. This act, which passed the Australian parliament last year, provides the basis for a more efficient and environmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia. Product stewardship means that everyone involved in the production, supply and use of the products we consume shares responsibility for those products from the point of design and manufacture through to disposal. The framework product stewardship legislation allows for national product stewardship schemes for specified classes of products to be established by regulation.


Regulations under the Product Stewardship Act established the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme, which commenced on 8 November 2011. Three organisations have been approved to deliver e-waste collection and recycling services under this scheme. Canberra was the first to start this free e-waste recycling service in April 2012. This is the start of a nationwide rollout, boosting television and computer recycling rates to 30 per cent in 2012-13 and 80 per cent by 2021-22, to provide a long-term solution to television and computer waste. Televisions and computers contain valuable non-renewable resources, including gold and other precious metals, as well as hazardous materials including lead, bromine, mercury and zinc. By recycling them we can recover useful materials and at the same time reduce health and environmental risks. The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme is funded and implemented by the television and computer industry and regulated by the Australian government under the Product Stewardship Act.


Again, I have articulated that Labor is committed to reducing both packaging waste and litter, as well as boosting recycling of a whole range of products. Labor is committed to striking a balance. Labor is committed to following established processes and working with stakeholders, including industry and other levels of government. The intent of this bill has merit. No-one in this place will dispute that. But what we need is to continue working through the current channels. We need to get the facts on the table through the regulation impact statement, because Labor is committed to continuing its proud record of getting the balance right between protecting the environment and promoting economic growth. It is why we are pricing carbon, it is why we are creating the biggest marine national park in the world and it is why we are progressing this important waste management reform through the appropriate channels: the COAG process.


The Greens want to throw out the schemes operating in the Northern Territory and implement a national scheme over and above these schemes instead of trying to get an outcome that is fitting with the South Australian scheme that has been running for 35 years. This bill proposes a government-run scheme that would be a different mechanism over and above the two existing arrangements. Logically, this only leads to increased regulatory complexity as well as costs to industry and the community. Federal Labor is committed to reducing the amount of packaging waste and litter in our society. This includes increasing recycling facilities and schemes for beverage containers. We want to continue to work on this with state and territory governments through the COAG process, to expand the schemes to all state and territories.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (09:57):  This is a debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010, introduced by the Greens political party. It relates to recycling and deposit schemes that have been in force in South Australia for some time. Because it is a debate, I want to take issue with some of the contributions made by the previous two speakers. Can I say in relation to the last speaker that about the only thing that I agree with her and her party on is that we will not be supporting the bill before the chamber today, for the same reasons as the Labor Party has indicated. I will come back to that later.


I could not contain my mirth when I heard the previous speaker rewrite history yet again in telling us what a great environmental party the Australian Labor Party was. Those who have observed politics and governance for a long time, as I have, clearly understand that Labor's only interest in the environment is the second preference votes they can get from the Greens political party when dealing with the issues of the environment. I still remember then Senator Graham Richardson, the environment minister, up in my neck of North Queensland, in the wet tropics, speaking to a crowd who were about to lynch him because he was destroying their jobs—another Labor government destroying the jobs of workers. He was saying, 'We're here to save these pristine rainforests.' The only problem was these 'pristine rainforests' had been logged for 110 years previously. Yet Senator Richardson was saying they were pristine. Why was he saying that? Because Richo, as we all know, master tactician of the ballot box, knew that they were coming to an election in which they desperately needed the support of the fledgling Greens political party.


Richo did not worry about the workers' jobs. Where was the AWU when you needed them? Where was the CFMEU when you needed them? The workers' jobs just went like that, and none of the great unionists raised a whimper in support of the jobs. It was the same with the Tasmanian forest industry eventually, though I have to say the F part of the CFMEU back in the 2004 days did actually join with the Liberal government to protect workers' jobs. I am always very proud of the F part of the CFMEU for the work they did in 2004 to protect the jobs of workers in Tasmania. Regrettably, the Labor Party have been less than forceful since.




Senator Feeney:
  Michael O'Connor is now the national secretary.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  He was excellent. I had a lot of dealings with him. He was genuinely interested in workers' jobs, unlike the present head of the AWU, who says, 'If one job goes from the carbon tax, I'm out of here.' Just yesterday we had 900 jobs in the mining industry up my way. Mr Howes is still there. You could give a litany of jobs that have gone because of the carbon tax. The only jobs that haven't gone are Mr Howes's and those of his colleagues in the chamber.


The previous speaker rewrote history by saying that the Labor Party was so interested in the environment. The Labor Party's interest in the environment is always invoked. The previous speaker went through a list of things that were so-called achievements of the Labor Party. The Labor Party talks a lot about the environment but never does much. Let me give some facts on which party actually works and acts for the benefit of the environment in Australia. Which party was it that prohibited sand mining on Fraser Island, a very substantial step and one of the first environmental battles that the Liberal Party took up on behalf of the nation? Which party was it that actually banned whaling in Australian waters? It was the Liberal Party.


Which party was it that, contrary to the previous speaker, actually introduced the declaration of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park? It was the Liberal-National party in conjunction with the Liberal National Party in Queensland. Which party was it that proclaimed Kakadu, Uluru, Christmas Island and the Coral Sea national parks? Which party was it that had five properties placed on the World Heritage List, including the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu, the Willandra Lakes, Lord Howe Island and South-west Tasmania and, in the Howard government, the Heard and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic? Which party was it that took through the passage of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment and Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981? Which party was it that regulated the uranium industry in the Northern Territory? Which party was it that enacted major pieces of legislation to control pollution, especially for the protection of the high seas? Which party was it that legislated for the introduction of unleaded petrol as a pollution control measure? Which party introduced the bicentennial waters program, the National Soil Conservation Program, the national tree program? Which party introduced the Natural Heritage Trust and the Green Corps, two practical, on-the-ground activities that actually did something for the environment that we live in? Which party had Australia's first minister for the environment? Again, the answer to all of those questions is the Liberal Party in conjunction with the coalition colleagues in the National Party, when you want real action, not vote-winning action, not action that allows you to strut round the stage and say that, by reducing Australia's 1.4 per cent of world emissions of carbon, we are going to save the world, and look at us, aren't we great—that is so typical of the Labor Party. Up there when the cameras are flashing the rhetoric is always pretty good, but the actual work on the environment is always very limited. I regret to say that, with one or two exceptions, the Greens political party is now no longer a party of the environment but a party of very left wing social, economic and political views. I am a proud member of the Liberal Party, a party that has a record of achievement on the environment.


I also want to make reference to Senator Waters's comment about waste generation in Australia. It reminded me that I was in Rockhampton the other week. The Rockhampton Regional Council, a medium-large regional council in my state of Queensland, have set aside $3 million for the carbon tax on their landfill operation. That equates to $68 per rate notice issued in the Rockhampton Regional Council area. You wonder why costs of living are going up. That story is repeated right around Australia. If actions such as the tax on ordinary Australians for landfills were going to make a difference, you could grin and bear it. But everybody knows that what Australia is doing is in fact increasing its emissions by 2020. So it is not going to make one iota of difference to the world's climate. I am one of those people who always acknowledges that the climate is changing, that it has been changing for millions of years and that it will continue to change. But the cost to Australia from this stupid carbon tax, this toxic carbon tax, is just horrendous, and that is why the first action of the Abbott government will be to remove it. 


In debating this issue with other speakers, I have not yet come to the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010, except to say that, in this instance, we will be supporting the Labor Party in opposing the bill. Why? Because the environment ministers, as the COAG Standing Council on Environment and Water, at a meeting as recently as 24 August 2012 agreed to move forward and develop a decision regulation impact statement to undertake a more detailed analysis, including regional and other distributional impacts. The meeting on 24 August followed consultation by the standing committee in their December 2011 Packaging Impacts Consultation Regulation Impact Statement. 


I think, as other speakers have mentioned, all Australians are concerned about littering and about recycling where that is appropriate. The South Australian government introduced its scheme for recycling of containers in that state back in 1977, and the world has certainly moved on since then. I live in a not so small rural area. It is a shire of about 20,000 people, and the town of Ayr, where I live, has about 10,000 people. For several years now, even our shire has had a waste recycling bin. We have a general rubbish bin, and recently we have achieved a green waste bin. So, right across Australia, Australians, supported by their local governments, have been involved in the recycling of waste products. 


I am very pleased that our council, the Burdekin Shire Council, on which I once had the privilege of serving for 11 years, has been at the forefront in the use of not just the ordinary, if I might call it that, recycling bins but the green waste recycling bin as well in recent times. I could not quite understand Senator Waters, but certainly in the case of the Burdekin shire—and I am sure this applies elsewhere—those general recycling bins take beverage containers, paper and cardboard. They have indeed contributed substantially to recycling in our area, but I know the same thing is happening right around Australia. They have certainly assisted in reducing the amount of roadside waste and rubbish of beverage containers, which was, we all might recall, the initial thought behind the South Australian legislation way back in 1977. I congratulate local government right across Australia on the very good job it has done in promoting and developing those kerbside recycling initiatives, which have in many ways reduced the recycling benefit of initiatives such as the container deposit legislation. 


There is still a way to go in relation to workplace waste as opposed to ordinary household waste, but that is the sort of thing that the government or the ministerial council is progressing. I am a bit critical of the federal government for failing to progress those ministerial forum discussions as quickly as we might have hoped, but I think they are on the way now and we look forward to a good outcome from that particular forum. The difficulty is, as we all know—and this is not so much the case with South Australia, which, in a geographic sense, is a little bit insular—that with a place like Queensland with its close borders to New South Wales and a place like New South Wales with its close borders to the ACT, Queensland and Victoria, you have to have in place a national protocol where all states agree. 


As with all regulation, it does come at a cost. We should not overlook the fact that these recycling schemes do come at a cost, which is passed through to the consumers in due course. The ministerial council did commission some research in May 2009, and this research was looked at by the Senate committee that reported on this bill some time ago. That report, prepared by consultants BDA Group and Wright Corporate Strategy, had attempted to quantify the cost of the benefits of introducing a scheme of the nature proposed by the Greens political party. In its quantification of those costs and benefits, it reported a total national annual net economic cost to government and the broader community, which took into account all of the compliance and administrative costs mentioned previously in this debate. The BDA report estimated that those costs would be around $492 million per annum in net terms. Overall it sees an economic cost of $763 million versus an economic benefit of $294 million—giving you that $492 million per annum net cost. Those costs do have to be taken into account, particularly in this time in the nation's economic cycle where things like the carbon tax are increasing costs and reducing employment opportunities and the mining tax substantially reducing employment opportunities. I understand the real figure of people unemployed or underemployed in Australia and looking for work or more work at the present time is in the order of 17.3 per cent. So it is a difficult time for our country, made worse by the additional costs that this government continues to pile upon ordinary citizens day after day. So we do have to bear in mind the costs.


The coalition, along with all of our other significant environmental initiatives, are very keen to see good recycling programs—programs that actually work; programs that do not add to the cost of living of ordinary Australians. We are keen to see the COAG meeting between the state environment ministers come up with its conclusions and we await the recommendations from the DRIS. For that reason, the coalition will not be supporting this bill.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:16):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. Australians use 12 billion beverage containers every year. This bill, introduced by my Greens colleague Senator Scott Ludlam, introduces a scheme for the environmentally sustainable management and reuse of those containers to apply throughout Australia. This is a major and long overdue reform. Only half of those 12 billion beverage containers are currently recycled. Too many of them end up as litter or in landfill.


The Australian Greens have long been a strong advocate for this approach. Recycling is important because it alleviates the need to use our precious natural resources when producing materials from scratch. It reduces the amount of energy and water used in product development, it decreases air emissions created by the processing of new containers and it lowers the cost of waste collection and sorting.


As I have said in this place before, 200 years of increasingly intensive industrialisation, fuelled by the burning of fossil fuels and coupled with an exponential increase in the earth's population, has led to the situation that is before us. It is one that we must grasp in this decade of the 21st century. Our environment is at risk. We are facing serious consequences from increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide and methane. For the sake of our future and our kids and our grandkids we must use every means to reduce our impact on our planet. This container deposit legislation scheme is a critical step.


I am proud to say that my state of South Australia has had a container deposit legislation scheme in place since the 1970s. South Australia provides a case in point as to the benefits and successes of these schemes. Our container deposit scheme works in conjunction with kerbside schemes. In South Australia the beverage companies own their unredeemed deposits. South Australia has achieved a recovery rate of over 80 per cent of containers, with 1.5 tonnes per person recycled each year. The South Australian statutory authority Zero Waste SA was established in 2003 and since then the total amount of waste disposed to landfill has decreased by over 15 per cent to 2008, despite population growth.


According to the National Waste Report 2010, waste generation in South Australia for 2006-07 was 2,090 kilograms per person, which is 0.5 per cent above the national average generation of 2,080 kilograms per person. In 2010-11, approximately 47,000 tonnes or 593 million beverage containers were returned for refund, a rate of 80.4 per cent. South Australian councils have benefited from the scheme, with some reporting incomes of up to $90,000 per year. As well, kerbside recycling is more economically viable, as reduced volumes require fewer collection services and sorting operations and reduce landfill and associated levy costs.


Community organisations have also benefited. Those that operate collection depots use the income to fund their numerous activities, such as the Scouts, who earn approximately $9 million a year from recycling containers. As the founder of Keep Australia Beautiful, Ian Kiernan, has said:


What happens (in South Australia) is that instead of seeing a bit of rubbish beside the road or the beach, you see a bit of money—and (the rubbish) is gone.


In addition to South Australia's container deposit legislation, Zero Waste SA promotes recycling and minimisation of waste at home, work and in industry. We have legislation to reduce the use of checkout style plastic bags used in supermarkets.


South Australia's recycling and waste management achievements have been recognised by UN-HABITAT in its 2010 international report Solid Waste Management in the World's Cities. This report considered 22 cities across the world and highlighted that:


Adelaide's and South Australia's waste resources management system is in some respects global best practice. South Australia has demonstrated a high level of political commitment and willingness to 'stick its neck out' and implement some policies and legislation upon which other administrations take a more conservative position.


The South Australian community overwhelmingly supports our container deposit scheme, with 92 per cent in favour.


I am proud to share these positive achievements of my state and, as a federal parliamentarian, I want to see good ideas from South Australia going national. It is time for the national container deposit scheme outlined in this Australian Greens bill, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:21):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2012, introduced by Senator Ludlam. As you have heard from the government speakers, we will be opposing this legislation. Opposition to this bill does not mean that I rise to speak against the environment. It does not mean I rise to speak against recycling. In fact, I support both. I rise today to speak against this bill as another example of developing policies without solid foundation or thought to their implementation.


Let me tell you about the things that we do agree on. We agree that we should do more to manage packaging waste. We agree that recycling is important. The difference is Labor make responsible choices when developing policies. A container deposit scheme has been in place, as we have heard in this chamber today, in South Australia since 1977 and in the Northern Territory since January this year. However, what is proposed by Senator Ludlam's bill is different to those schemes. The schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory are based on industry run arrangements, whereas this bill proposes a government run scheme. Because of this key difference, this bill would introduce a different mechanism over the top of these two existing arrangements, increasing regulation and potential cost to industry and the community. More regulatory complexity and cost to industry and cost to the community to recycle bottles and cans is irresponsible and not what Australians want.


Labor believe in looking after the environment. We understand that looking after our beautiful and unique country is one of the best ways to ensure a prosperous future. We want to deal with this issue in a responsible and measured way, a way in which we all benefit—the community, the industry and the environment. The Australian government, as well as state and territory governments, are committed to reducing the amount of packaging waste and litter in our society, including beverage containers. To suggest anything else is simply ridiculous.


In 2010 Commonwealth, state and territory environment ministers agreed to examine and release to industry interest groups and the community for consultation options for the better management of packaging waste. As part of this process a consultation regulation impact study was developed. This report examined options for dealing with packaging waste, including container deposit legislation. In December 2012 the consultation regulation impact statement was released by environment ministers. This was a significant step in better managing all of the packaging waste and litter nationally. Hundreds of submissions were received from industry, environment groups, the community and local government in response to the consultation RIS. This shows strong support by Australians for further action to address the impacts of packaging waste and litter.


The environment  ministers have carefully considered the submissions received during the consultation process and will develop a decision regulatory impact statement to provide a more detailed analysis of the potential impacts of the options. When we consider any policy change, we must consider what possible consequences this change may have. Regulatory change can only take place once a decision RIS has been conducted, so this represents a significant step forward in this process. This is the appropriate process for considering national regulation of packaging waste because it is the process agreed upon by COAG for any national regulatory reform. We have these processes so that we can make the best decisions possible when we have fully reviewed the evidence.


The RIS examines the likely impacts of proposed regulations and a range of alternative options that could meet the government's policy objectives. It is the responsible and considered way of making changes. Once the RIS process has concluded, the COAG Standing Council on Environment and Water will be in a better position to assess the merits of a range of national approaches to addressing packaging waste and litter, including a national container deposit scheme. It is an important means of providing evidence of what the problem is and what we are attempting to solve. It allows for the formalising of the costs and benefits of each option so that they can be assessed. Labor is committed to weighing the costs and the benefits of the national regulation reform.


It is clear that this bill is an attempt to pre-empt the appropriate and transparent considerations of the costs and benefits of a national approach to packaging waste and litter that is currently underway. Labor are taking action on the issue. We are taking action responsibly and with due diligence. The consultation regulation impact statement was released on 7 December 2011 for an extended four-month public consultation. By consulting with a wide range of stakeholders, including industry, the community, and state and local governments, Labor are showing our commitment to finding the best solution rather than just putting something up in the Senate where there has been no considered consultation. We are taking responsible action. The Australian Labor government and all state and territory governments made a commitment at the beginning of the RIS process that it would be open, that consultation would be allowed and that there would be a balanced assessment of all options, including a national container deposit scheme. We have kept that commitment.


The process has been open and transparent. Stakeholders have been involved throughout. Two workshops have been held: the first to gain views on what are a range of problems and the second to identify options which will target and address these problems. They commenced in Brisbane on 13 February this year and ran through to 7 March in capital cities as well as three regional centres: Bunbury, Townsville and Albury. In total, about 250 people attended the sessions, and each session consisted of a two-hour public forum, including presentations by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the economic analysis. These forums provided an opportunity for people to discuss the consultation RIS in further detail. They were able to ask questions in relation to its findings and, very importantly, they were able to give their views on the options proposed.


The subject has attracted a great deal of interest. Hundreds of submissions from industry, environment groups, the community and local government showed strong support for further action to address the impacts of packaging waste and litter. This shows that the Australian people, like Labor, are concerned about the impact of packaging waste and that they want a solution that will help the environment. The consultation RIS collected some fantastic statistics about the Australian people's commitment to recycling and the environment. According to the consultation RIS, Australia's packaging recycling rate increased from 39 per cent in 2003 to 63.1 per cent in 2011. Recycling in Australia is on the rise. This was achieved through concerted industry and state and local government action and through the Australian Packaging Covenant.


Most Australians have access to kerbside recycling services, which have assisted Australians with household recycling activities. Yellow-top wheelie bins are now a common sight in the average Australian suburban street. In 2009, over 91 per cent of Australian households used kerbside recycling to recycle waste, an increase from 87 per cent in 2006. In that same year, almost all Australian households, 98 per cent, reported that they recycled waste and 86 per cent reported that they re-used waste. Recycling has become a way of life in Australia and we want it to increase. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as far back as 1996, 91 per cent of Australian households reported some form of waste recycling and/or re-use activity.


What we can see here is that Australians are committed to recycling and that the programs currently in place are working. Rather than just introduce a package fix into the Senate that would create all sorts of red tape and expense for the industry and for the Australian people, we are doing our homework and will come up with a solution which will be appropriate and measured. The consultation RIS, which had the opportunity to engage with Australians on the issue of recycling, was just that: a consultation document. It did not endorse one particular option over another but was aimed at stimulating further discussion on how to address this important issue.


At their August meeting a few weeks ago, the environment ministers made a commitment that the process would continue to be transparent and that they would continue to consult industry, community and government. The packaging impacts regulation impact statement is examining a range of options for managing packaging waste. Seven options were assessed in the consultation RIS in terms of their costs and benefits for packaging waste and litter. Two key stakeholders, the Boomerang Alliance and the beverage industry, proposed specific options to reduce packaging waste. The Boomerang Alliance, who support a collection deposit scheme, congratulated the RIS consultants on their effort in compiling such a range of data and detailed analysis.


At the August meeting, the environment ministers agreed that, in addition to the options considered in the consultation RIS, three further options will be included in the decision RIS. The first of these options is an industry co-regulatory stewardship scheme that will focus on beverage containers only. The second additional option is an approach similar to the Australian Packaging Covenant, with a substantial increase in funding from industry for packaging recycling and litter initiatives. The third additional option is a container deposit model based on the South Australian system.


The environment ministers have agreed to undertake targeted consultations with key stakeholders on the design of additional options, in accordance with their commitment to a transparent and open process. The decision RIS will undertake a more detailed analysis. Its focus will include the regional impacts of these options. This demonstrates the seriousness of this Labor government's commitment to finding an appropriate solution which will encourage Australians to recycle more.


That is not the only step Labor is taking to promote the protection of the environment. The Australian government has consistently shown its commitment to sustainability and responsible environmental management through legislation and action. This has been most recently seen in the enactment of the Product Stewardship Act 2011. The Product Stewardship Act passed the Australian parliament last year. It provides the basis for a more efficient and environmentally responsible approach to waste management in Australia. It demonstrates Labor's commitment to the environment. Product stewardship means that everyone involved in the production, supply and use of the products we consume shares responsibility for those products. This extends all the way from the point of design through to the manufacturing process, right through to the end of the product's life and disposal.


Three organisations have been approved to deliver e-waste collection and recycling services under the scheme. In April 2012, right here in Canberra the first free e-waste recycling service started. This is just the beginning. It is the start of a nationwide rollout. It will boost television and computer recycling rates to 30 per cent in 2012-13 and to 80 per cent by 2021-22, providing a long-term solution to television and computer waste.


Technology is rapidly developing and, as new products are introduced, old ones are discarded, and it is very important that we can cope with this waste by recycling rather than packing it up in the boot of the car and dumping it in the landfill at the nearest tip. Televisions and computers contain valuable non-renewable resources, including gold and other precious metals, as well as hazardous materials, including lead, bromine, mercury and zinc. By recycling them, we can recover useful materials and at the same time reduce health and environmental risks. This is a win-win situation and demonstrates the positive results of recycling. The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme is funded and implemented by the television and computer industry and regulated by the Australia government under the Product Stewardship Act.


Recycling is not the only way to protect the environment. Labor is taking this fight to many fronts. Further, the Labor government has demonstrated its commitment to the environment through its grant program Caring for our Country. Through this project, the Labor government will fund 66 new projects across the nation at a cost of $12.5 million. These projects will protect Australia's natural environment. They will safeguard our iconic natural places and protect our unique species. These projects demonstrate a responsible commitment to the environment. They are funded under the 2012-13 Caring for our Country business plan. They represent value for money and are located all across Australia. These Caring for our Country projects include funding natural resource management areas in Western Australia to regions on the eastern seaboard. Projects addressing Indigenous engagement and Northern and remote Australia are also well represented. Safeguarding our iconic natural places is essential in our continent-wide strategy for environmental protection. Caring for our Country not only protects our environment but also protects and enhances the social and economic values of our iconic regions.


Australia is one of the most biodiverse places on the planet and we have a responsibility to protect it for ourselves and for the citizens of the world now and into the future. We all know that habitat degradation, the spread of invasive pest plants and animals, the effects of climate change and human activity pose significant threats to our environment. The Labor government are acting to address this. Through the introduction of our carbon price mechanism we have shown that this government have a clear plan to cut pollution, tackle climate change and deliver the economic reform Australia needs to move to a clean energy future. We have put a price on pollution—the carbon price. It is a cheap and fair way to cut pollution. It will build a clean future for Australia and a clean energy economy. We are leading the world in this form of environmental protection. This scheme is the best way to stop businesses polluting as it gives businesses an incentive to invest in clean energy. Charging industries when they pollute is the surest way to change this behaviour and make Australia a cleaner place. We are reinvesting this money to assist families and households.


Labor has not shied away from making the tough decisions when it comes to protecting the environment. We understand that we must do this to ensure the health of our great land and for our economic future. These decisions are not easy. They take thousands of hours of intensive policy research and development. They are complex. We understand this. This bill is yet another clear demonstration of the failure to understand this process. It is not well thought through. It has not taken into account the economic consequences of trying to push a bill through this place without due diligence. On the other hand, we want to do what is right for the Australian people, for industries who employ many thousands of Australians and for the environment. We do not think that this is mutually exclusive. We believe that there is a solution that will be of benefit to all of these groups, and we are working with state and territory governments to find it.


I ask those listening or reading the Hansardto not be misled: The vote that we will cast in this place today opposing this bill is not a reflection of our views on recycling or on the environment, as the Greens will no doubt try to claim. The vote we are casting today is in favour of good process, sound policy and doing the right, the fair, the open and the honest thing by industry, by the environment and, most importantly, by the Australian people.


We live in a very special country and we have a unique responsibility to protect it. The Labor Party take this responsibility very, very seriously. Do not for one moment think otherwise. So today I rise not to oppose the environment; nor do I rise to oppose recycling. I rise to oppose a bill which does not propose an adequate solution to the management of packaged waste. This bill is pre-empting the results of a long period of consultation that is being undertaken. It is not a bill that will provide the solutions we need or the careful consideration that the Australian people and the environment deserve.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (10:41):  I rise to make a very brief contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010—and I thank Senator Xenophon for allowing me to do so prior to his contribution. The government is opposed to this bill for a number of reasons. I am opposed for the reasons that have been outlined by Senator Brown quite eloquently relating to the process of consultation that is underway between the federal government and the states concerning measures to improve recycling rates and look at schemes to promote recycling in our country.


Traditionally, beverage container deposit schemes have been operated on a state basis and reflect state environmental laws. The two that are operating in South Australia and in the Northern Territory are industry-run schemes on a cooperative basis. That is the approach that I believe is necessary for a successful scheme to be developed nationally, and that is the process that the federal government has entered into through COAG in cooperation with the states. The three largest states in the Commonwealth are involved in that and are essential to the successful development of any container deposit scheme operating on a national basis. I oppose this bill on the basis that there is a great risk that this bill would undermine that process going on at a national level.


I am also opposed to this bill because I believe it raises constitutional issues in the method by which it has been introduced into the parliament. The bill at clause 13 'provides that a producer or importer must pay the levy within 14 days after the end of the month in which the beverage container was sold to a wholesaler, retailer or individual, or to a producer or distributor of beverages in beverage containers.' There is, I believe, an issue of constitutional validity in that it may be construed that the bill imposes taxation. The relevant High Court authority on this issue is the case of Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd and the Commonwealth—a decision of the High Court of Australia of 1993—where the majority of the court, Chief Justice Mason and Justices Brennan, Deane and Gaudron, found that that:


… the collecting body of a fee does not have to be a public body for the fee to be regarded as a tax. Therefore a levy collected by a private body dictated by a statute for public purposes gives the private body a public character. 


And therefore raises a question mark over the validity of the levy.



The Commonwealth can, of course, apply a bill for taxation but, as we well know, section 53 of the Commonwealth Constitution says:


Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate—


which this bill proposes to do. Therefore I believe it raises an issue of constitutional validity, and certainly a question mark over the bill, and it is something that would no doubt be considered were the Senate to pass this legislation. That is another reason that I am opposed to the bill. But, on the whole, again I raise the issue of the process of consultation that is being undertaken at the moment with the states and the very great risk that the passage of this bill would undermine that cooperative process.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-09-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:46):  I will address Senator Thistlethwaite's considered contribution in relation to the constitutionality of this. I do not necessarily accept the point that is being made by Senator Thistlethwaite but I think that, even if that did have validity, the government could still indicate whether it supports the intent of this bill and supports a national container deposit scheme. So I think that is a separate issue. Let us not used that not use that as an excuse not to do something—and I am not suggesting that the good Senator was doing that. We need to make a decision in this place on this question: is this a piece of policy that we support or not? I believe this bill, the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010, is a piece of legislation that we ought to support.


The benefits of container deposit schemes are impressive, and the facts and figures suggest that they actually work. The South Australian scheme, which has been operating for over 30 years, achieves a recycling rate of more than 80 per cent—which is nearly double that of the rest of the country. When the scheme was originally introduced, the Australian Food and Grocery Council decried it as a 'tax on drinks'. Today, more than 98 per cent of the South Australian community supports it. I should say parenthetically of the Australian Food and Grocery Council that they are the same mob that have been fighting tooth and nail any sensible reforms as to country of origin food labelling laws, which the overwhelming majority of Australians support. There are some issues on which I am very happy to work with the Australian Food and Grocery Council in terms of private labels and the dominance of Coles and Woolworths, but when it comes to these issues, which I think are very much in the community and public interest, they are on the wrong side of history.


There has been 98 per cent support in South Australia for the container deposit scheme. I am sure governments around the world dream of the day when a new tax is supported by 98 per cent of its constituents. While it is early days for the Northern Territory, the container deposit scheme there has already increased recycling rates by more than 100 per cent. And that is not just beverage containers; it is recycling overall.


The evidence is mounting up that container deposits are a valuable piece of environmental policy—and cost effective at that. A national container deposit scheme would make a significant difference. Despite our best efforts to lift our recycling rates, our consumption continues to grow and we now landfill more than 21 million tonnes of waste every year. According to the Boomerang Alliance, a group of environmental organisations which has been studying container deposit schemes across the world for more than 10 years, a national deposit scheme would reduce the amount of rubbish in our parks, beaches and roadsides by as much as 15 per cent. Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, I do not know whether you have ever done the trip across the Nullarbor into South Australia, but I know that those who travel across the border into Victoria, for instance, actually notice a difference in terms of roadside rubbish. I believe that is principally because of our container deposit scheme. You actually see a difference while on the roads in terms of the amount of rubbish that is left by the roadside.


A national container deposit scheme would increase Australia's recycling by more than 600,000 tonnes each year. That is more than 600,000 tonnes of rubbish not going into landfill. It would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1.3 million tonnes every year, the equivalent of taking 140,000 cars off the road in terms of air quality improvement. That is a much more efficient way of doing things than the aborted cash for clunkers scheme. It would also create jobs—about 4,000—mostly in rural and regional Australia, according to the Boomerang Alliance, and I think that has been robustly looked at by them.


But there is a possible downside that is completely avoidable with appropriate safeguards. Research conducted by the Boomerang Alliance and released publicly in August indicates that Coca-Cola, Lion Nathan and Schweppes could be charging prices that are not reflective of the cost of the container deposit schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory. The container deposit schemes in South Australia and the Northern Territory see customers refunded 10c per eligible can or bottle when they are recycled. The majority of beverage companies do the right thing by only passing on the net cost of about 10c to customers. Unfortunately, there are a few who may not. For example, as published in the Boomerang Alliance's report, catalogues for Coles supermarkets for the month of July of this year showed price differences between states for the same products. Three bottles of Coca-Cola brand soft drink varieties were advertised for $7 in Sydney and Perth, where there are no container deposit schemes. In Adelaide and Darwin, where schemes are in place, the same three bottles were advertised for $8. I quote from the report:


Coca Cola Amatil brands like Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke, Sprite, Lift, Mt Franklin and Mother Energy drinks prices in Adelaide and Darwin are on average 22 cents more than those in other major cities …


On average, as the Boomerang Alliance found, Schweppes brands were 16.5c more. This is not a price difference reflected across the board on beverages between states. According to the Boomerang Alliance, other drinks averaged just 1.4c more per item in Adelaide and Darwin compared with other major cities. While a few extra cents or so per bottle may not seem an amount worth worrying about, let me put it in these terms: every year it equates to an extra $31.9 million that customers are paying for these products in South Australia and the Northern Territory. According to the Boomerang Alliance these are avoidable costs. That is why I have done some work on this with the Boomerang Alliance. In August of this year, I wrote to Mr Rod Sims, Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and pointed this out and made a formal complaint in regard to these issues. I hope that the ACCC will find it within its remit to thoroughly investigate this issue to determine whether there is any profiteering, because the Australian Food and Grocery Council assert in their media release of 25 June 2012 that price rises have been as a result of the container deposit scheme. That seems to be something worth investigation by the ACCC. If price gouging is going on, if consumers are being charged more, then that should be looked at—in the same way that the ACCC quite rightly should pick up on and prosecute and enforce the law against any companies making false assertions in relation to the impact of a carbon tax. If people are price gouging as a result of the carbon tax, they ought to be prosecuted. Similarly, if they are price gouging or purporting that there will be unfair impacts on consumers because of the container deposit scheme, that should be looked at.


Within a free market, I am comfortable with companies passing on the net cost of the container deposit scheme to customers, but this seems to go much further. The evidence suggests that companies are manipulating their prices and ignoring the value of unredeemed and scrap sales which offset most of their cost. That is why I wrote to the ACCC asking them to investigate the pricing practices of Coca-Cola, Schweppes and Lion Nathan, particularly given the ACCC's recent crackdown on profiteering as a result of the carbon tax. I have also called on the South Australian government to investigate the beverage companies and their pricing in relation to the container deposit scheme. But, most of all, I am calling on Coca-Cola, Lion Nathan and Schweppes to stop any practice which could be seen as price gouging from consumers. If this is how customers are being treated then that is something that ought to stop.


Container deposit schemes are a public good. They increase recycling rates and reduce landfill. They are supported by communities and, at least in my home state, they give kids the chance to earn some extra pocket money. If these schemes are being rorted to increase profits, that goes against their underlying premise, and a little bit in return can stimulate a lot of public good. I strongly encourage the government to request that the ACCC monitor this scheme should the legislation pass. But, in any event, it ought to. It has been a successful scheme for over 30 years in South Australia and the time has come for its national adoption. We cannot allow companies to take advantage of community and political goodwill. It has received 98 per cent support in my home state. This is a very modest cost impost on consumers, which will lead to a lot of public good and that is why I support this bill.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (10:55):  Having seen the schoolkids up in the gallery who are of a very similar age to my kids in Tassie, it occurred to me that there is a contrast between taking action on cleaning up rubbish and what we are doing here in parliament today with the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. I want to mention a program that my two children are involved in, particularly my 13-year-old daughter at Riverside High School—a nationwide program called Expedition Class. It is funded partly by the Bookend Trust in Tasmania and they have a program called Coastwatchers. A very fine gentleman, Andrew Hughes, is on his bike cycling around the country, visiting schools and taking schoolkids to clean up beaches. They make sculptures out of marine debris—sculptures of sea animals that are impacted by marine debris—and then they do projects about how these marine animals are being impacted by beverage containers, which were the key part of the marine debris I mentioned yesterday in the public interest debate.


The point I am trying to make is that there are people in this country—including the Surfrider Foundation, whom I have worked with for years; the Tangaroa Blue Foundation, and other organisations—that are taking action on reducing rubbish. We have Keep Australia Beautiful and other organisations, but the connection with the marine environment is one that has not been made yet. I think our parliament needs to take action. What has pleased me today listening to the debate is that all parties in this chamber believe in reducing waste in the environment. However, it is obvious that a container deposit scheme has been discussed nationally for over 20 years. In fact, it has been discussed internationally in lots of different countries and at international conventions. Policy instruments to try to remove debris from our waterways, landscapes and landfill include things such as recycling.


A container deposit scheme is a market based instrument that relies on a price incentive. It uses markets; it is not in itself seen to be a regulatory instrument. It provides an incentive for people to change their behaviour and there is a reward in place for people to pick up trash—cash for containers. Cash for cans is an Australian icon as old as Vegemite. It has been around for a long time. Most of us in this chamber grew up with something like that—whether it was for milk bottles or for other containers. We know from the survey work done by the Boomerang Alliance that most Australians agree with the concept. It was fantastic to hear Senator Xenophon talking with such pride about how clean his state is. Unfortunately we cannot say that about the whole country. Our bill here today is designed to put in place a national scheme. That is not taking away from the fact that there is a state and a territory that already have a container deposit scheme. However, as was mentioned by Senator Xenophon and will be covered by my colleague Senator Ludlam, we have concerns about an industry administered scheme. This bill is for a government administered scheme, and there are a lot of advantages to that. We also believe that the process underway at COAG, while positive, is just more talk. We have heard senators in the chamber talking about that process today, but that is what it is—it is talk. It is not action and it is not leadership. We have the potential today to put in place a scheme where parliament nationally can show leadership on this issue. I reiterate: parliament can take action. 


A market based scheme has worked well in other areas when we deal with pollution, and that is essentially what this is. We are talking about rubbish—cans and plastic bottles—but rubbish is pollution. It is a by-product or part of production and consumption. As I mentioned yesterday in the public interest debate, a container deposit scheme is unique in terms of its policy prescriptions because it puts an emphasis on the consumer as well as on the producer to take some action. The scheme has often been criticised by the industry as not their responsibility in terms of this rubbish that is thrown out the door. If you throw a plastic bottle or a can out the window when you are driving you get fined for that; there is a penalty in place for that. But we know that up to half of the beverage containers in this country do not make their way into home recycling—which has benefits and is admirable—but find their way into waterways and ultimately into the ocean and other areas over time and then they photodegrade. So we need a scheme that incentivises people to do the right thing and that works well in terms of its funding. We have various scenarios on what this would cost. We are convinced that this is a neat solution to a dirty problem. We are also convinced that it will be a popular solution.


I mentioned yesterday that recent work by the CSIRO on the marine debris database has shown that between a third and a half of all plastics found in Australia are beverage containers. The database is growing. This is a very new area of focus for the scientific community. However, the problem with damaging marine animals and the research that has been done on that has been around for years. I would like to stress that our use of plastics grows exponentially every day. For 40 years the world has wanted to get rid of plastics in the oceans but has not been able to; in fact, the problem continues to get worse. I would like to see not just a national container deposit scheme, I would like to see an international container deposit scheme. When I think about walking on the beach with my kids, I wonder how else we can solve this problem. A lot of plastic that is washed up on our beaches does come from China and other countries. The plastics that we find in the south-west of Tasmania in the World Heritage areas wash up from all around the world. If we are going to get rid of this problem or tackle it effectively we need a policy prescription that can be rolled out right around the globe.


If it makes sense to put a container deposit scheme in place, why hasn't it happened? What is it that is holding this back? The answer to that is industry. Industry is in talks. Industry does not want to see a national container deposit scheme. Which industry? The Grocery Council covers a large number of beverage companies and packaging companies, and they are a very powerful lobby group. If we had agreement from the big companies like Coca-Cola that this was an effective solution to the problem then we would get some action. This is why it has been held up so long, this is why we have been talking about the problem for 20 years, this is why we are doing more talking in COAG: industry does not want to see a national container deposit scheme.


I firmly believe that businesses and companies should be part of the solution and that it will be to their benefit to be part of the solution. I would encourage a positive attitude and action towards working with industry to get recognition that a container deposit scheme is an effective way of tackling this problem. It is not the only way; it is just one tool in the chest. There are lots of other things we need to do to encourage more recycling and to encourage participation by consumers in acknowledging issues with single use plastics and packaging. We need to invest in biodegradable plastic products, which are starting to become more commonplace now but are too expensive because of economies of scale. We do need to consider other regulatory measures on things such as plastic bags. We are all familiar with this. As I said, we have been talking about it for years. I would encourage all senators in this chamber and everyone who reads Hansard to do what the school kids are doing: take some action to help clean up this problem. You can do that by supporting our container deposit bill today.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:06):  I rise to close the debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010 but it is with no great pleasure that I do so. This bill is, from memory, the first one that I introduced when I arrived here in 2008. Today on the basis of the rather lacklustre contributions from the other parties, with the honourable exception of Senator Xenophon, I have no expectation that the bill will be carried. Of course that is not the end of the story. This is a very popular scheme. It is nice to have Senator Crossin chairing us because, if she had been able to take part in the debate, she would be able say that the NT government had dug its heels in, stuck to its guns and introduced a scheme for container deposits—the second jurisdiction in the country to do so against a fierce attack by the beverage industry. I will talk a little bit more this morning about how that is playing out on the national stage. 


To his great credit, Chief Minister Henderson issued one of the most sharply worded press statements I have ever seen from any minister's office anywhere telling Coca-Cola Amatil by name to back away from the kind of bullying countercampaign that they have run. I will describe in a little detail this morning exactly how audacious the beverage industry has become, or I should say to be accurate: some sections of the beverage industry. There are a couple of companies—in fact half the industry, you could say—that has stayed out of the grubby attack on this extremely popular scheme.


This is a bit reminiscent of the way the debate around a national feed-in tariff has played out: an extraordinarily popular initiative that has been proven to work in jurisdictions elsewhere that has been attacked by some sections of industry and now we are getting a patchwork of schemes getting set up all over the place. In the case of a feed-in tariff, the Australian Greens have a bill that would provide for a nationally consistent scheme, which is what some sections of industry, quite rightly, are asking for. In the case of a container deposit system, again we believe there is room—and a very strong case—for a nationally consistent scheme so that industry knows where it stands, as do the public. But instead my colleagues in state and territory parliaments around the country are getting consistent container deposit schemes. My colleague Robin Chapple has a bill in the Western Australian parliament that would provide for it in WA if Canberra cannot be bothered to pick up the campaign. So we are likely to end up with a patchwork of schemes. We believe a nationally consistent approach is the right one. 


Sections of the beverage industry led by Coca-Cola Amatil have a fourfold strategy of undermining the case for container deposit schemes. One of the Labor senators said before: 'This is not what people want.' Actually, they do. Consistent polls show 80, 90 per cent or even into the high 90s support for a container deposit system, partly because we have seen it working in South Australia since the 1970s; we know that it works.


The fourfold strategy is to delay, confuse, attack and then rort—and we are seeing this played out absolutely beautifully at the moment by the beverage industry. The delaying strategy is very well known, and I have spoken of it extensively before. We saw government senators struggling to stay awake as they described the RIS process, which Senator Farrell, who has just joined us, is intimately familiar with. People just roll their eyes when they realise what the scheme has had to go through. It is the regulatory equivalent of holding a pillow over somebody's head. They have decided to try and smother the scheme in various forms of regulatory impact statements in order to delay it for as long as possible. Delay, delay, delay—tie it up in the kind of brown tape that we have seen industry use in order to delay, for example, the rollout of successful renewable energy incentive schemes.


Delay has been reasonably successful but, as some government senators have pointed out, we are seeing some slow progress through COAG—achingly slow, but it is occurring. So industry has moved to stage 2, which is to try and confuse the debate and introduce data into the process to try and poison the economic models that are used to assess in a regulatory impact statement which scheme is better, which is better value for money, which is likely to be more successful. For example, you could see—if you want to read it in this way—the RIS claiming that a CDS would cost $1.4 billion. That sounds like a lot of money—of course it is a lot of money; anything is with a 'b' in front of it. However, that is over 20 years, so it averages out, even if you believe that cost, at about $70 million a year. Here is where it gets interesting: the industry has been very happy to make sure that these figures include participation costs or inconvenience costs, which is an imaginary number. It is a made-up number to try and quantify the inconvenience of walking out to the kerb and sticking the can in a bin. That has amounted to $22 million a year—that is unbelievably misleading and deceptive to introduce an imaginary number to try and tip the financial scales in these spreadsheets against a container deposit scheme.


It is reasonably well understood, because we have got these schemes on their feet around the country in a couple of places and elsewhere around the world—in places like Canada—that the actual financial flows and costs of running a scheme are no more than about half a cent, if that, per container. That is the transaction cost of making sure a scheme like this works, and that should be accounted for separately to the 10c deposit that is then refunded when you do the right thing. So the whole idea of introducing an imaginary inconvenience cost to the financial models is for no other reason than to make it look appallingly expensive so that opponents of the scheme can then be marching around the landscape waving a piece of paper that says it is going to cost more than a billion dollars. It is a total fabrication. In fact the scheme that is represented in the bill before us—just in case there is a possibility of changing the minds of a few senators—is revenue positive because of the small number of unredeemed deposits. 


We know from long experience in South Australia that no scheme is perfect—recycling rates there are up above 80 per cent, much higher than the rest of the country. That other 20 per cent are things that have still gone to landfill. They have gone out with the regular kerbside. They have ended up in the ocean, as Senator Whish-Wilson has so eloquently reminded us. Those deposits are never redeemed, and that is how the scheme pays for itself. That is how the network of collection centres are rolled out and that is how in a mature model you would find, I think, a revenue source that would enable you to do things like beach clean-ups, get some of the plastics out of the ocean or support alternate production methods. We can now get plastics made from cellulose that simply disintegrate if they are not recycled and genuinely biodegrade in ways that plastics simply do not.


When the strategy of delaying and confusing fails, the industry goes on the attack—and I could pin a crushed beer can on the chests of those who thought up this campaign as some kind of medal for the most brazenly offensive bit of rent-seeking that has ever been devised by way of an advertising campaign. People would have been well aware.A Current Affair ran a piece on this not so long ago, but you probably would have seen the full-page ads in most of the national daily newspapers with the headline: 'Unlike some politicians we think you have already paid your fair share of tax'. And there is a picture of a bunch of empty beverage containers with the word 'extra' plastered over them, as though the evil government and the evil Greens have come up with some scheme to make you pay even more for beverage containers. Those ads were run by the Australian Food and Grocery Council, and I will have a little more to say about them in a moment. The banner, of course, is 'No drink container tax'. So it is ripping off this fictional campaign that Mr Abbott has been running that the carbon price instrument and the clean energy package represent offensive taxes on Australians.


But this is something other. The industry has then gone ahead and produced modelling as to what would happen if a container deposit scheme along the lines of the one that is operating in the Northern Territory now were to run nationally, with the industry in control of how much it costs. It will cost hundreds of dollars a year, and that, I think, is the gift of whoever thought this up. The scheme has become more expensive than it needed to in the Northern Territory, and the reason it is so expensive is that the industry is profiteering. They have just added holding costs; they have added carriage costs to the containers and are basically rorting the scheme. They are profiteering; they have just added a margin on top when the scheme, in fact, would quite handily have paid for itself out of the unredeemed deposits. No, instead they have just added a holding cost, and that is why the scheme is more expensive in the Northern Territory than it needs to be.


What an act of brazen genius to then commission somebody to run a series of full-page ads saying, 'If the beverage industry is allowed to run this scheme nationally it will cost you hundreds of dollars a year, so make sure that you vote against the container deposit scheme.' I hope that nobody on the government benches has been sucked in by this thing. And I also note in Senator Macdonald's contribution—and he is normally not short of a certain amount of venom and anti-Greens polemic—that even he did not bother to use these fabrications that are being produced by sections of the beverage industry. I do not think that even Senator Macdonald was sucked in by this.


So I hope that our environment minister has not been. When the industry tried it on in the Northern Territory, Chief Minister Henderson pushed back and told Coca-Cola Amatil to get stuffed—to his great credit. With my Western Australian colleagues in 2008, unfortunately, the story was different. The beverage industry went on the attack against a state container deposit scheme in WA. They ran a marginal seat campaign running the same kind of highly deceptive advertising that they are running now, and the Carpenter government backed down. So we do not have a state container deposit scheme. The state ALP is still talking about it and, as I said, my Greens colleague Robyn Chappell has a bill; but we do not have a scheme operating in WA because of the same deceptive and misleading campaign that the industry is trying to run now.


I must admit that this is something other; there is a part of me that actually admires just how brazenly offensive this is. I have never seen anything quite like it. As Senator Xenophon has intimated, we will be writing to the ACCC to investigate whether an industry that runs ads saying that if this scheme is introduced the government will be taxing you and making your life more expensive as a result of charges that they themselves have added to make the scheme much more expensive than it needs to be is in fact being deceptive and misleading. I will be very, very interested to see what the ACCC thinks of that kind of conduct.


I will also indicate now for the benefit of any of the minister's advisers who are listening, or the minister himself, that we will be going into negotiations with the government to seek a short Senate inquiry into whether the industry has basically ripped off and undermined the scheme in the Northern Territory. The Boomerang Alliance paper that Senator Xenophon was speaking briefly to before contains some very interesting financial data about if beverages are more expensive in South Australia and the Territory when you net out the increased costs, the transport costs of shipping materials to the Northern Territory. The figures break out very interestingly. For Coca-Cola Amatil, Lion Nathan National Foods and Schweppes, who happen to be members and financial supporters of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, yes, there does appear to be a margin there. This smells enough for the ACCC, and I believe a Senate inquiry, to want to take a look at it.


When you look at Fosters, Diageo and Coopers on the other hand, there is no imprint; there is no additional price being levied by them. It appears that the part of the industry that is running this deceptive campaign under the rubric of the Australian Food and Grocery Council is actually ripping us off. Then they have the nerve to run a national ad campaign saying, 'Careful, you don't want to let us rip you off nationally. It'll cost you hundreds of dollars a year.' Breathtaking. I think this is, in fact, a very clear-cut example of profiteering. There is your fourfold strategy: delay, confuse, attack and, when you lose, just gouge. Turn it to your advantage. Brilliant—absolutely brilliant! It has to stop.


We will get a national container deposit scheme, I believe. The Australian Greens will come back with a bill. We will take advice from the industry and we will take the benefit of the work that has been done in the regulatory impact assessment process to see if the bill needs to be changed at all. We have always been open to negotiation and counterproposals on this one. But instead, we have seen a rather feeble response from government senators coming in here and reading from their talking points. Check the Hansard: there are a whole slabs of the contributions that are basically word for word. Please come in here, at least, with an original thought in your head. At least Senator Thistlethwaite, although completely off target, had a go at an original angle attacking the scheme.


What bugs me the most, I guess, is when we come in here with a concept that is proven, that is extremely popular and that is something that even Commonwealth environment minister, Tony Burke, has said that he supports, we are told, 'Yes, we support you in principle but we are going to vote against your bill because what we would rather do is spend another couple of decades crawling through a regulatory impact assessment process while we are undermined, white-anted and sandbagged by these parts of the beverage industry every step of the way.' We do not have decades. For any senators who were not in the chamber yesterday, Senator Whish-Wilson spoke so eloquently of the garbage patches that are arising in the middle of the world's great oceans and the trash washed up on beaches and inside marine creatures—the garbage that is left and ends up washing into rivers. Materials that we could use end up getting turfed into landfill; dumped and rotting, giving off greenhouse gas emissions or just being lost to industrial recycling processes forever. It is heartbreaking. It is absolutely time that we took action.


So we indicate for the benefit of senators now that we will call a division on this bill. We believe very strongly that its time is not too far away. We encourage the environment minister to work with us to introduce a brief Senate inquiry into whether the industry is basically white-anted and is now profiteering off the schemes in the NT, and arguably in South Australia as well. We will be back with another bill; this story is not yet concluded, and it will not be until we have what the vast majority of Australians want—a national container deposit scheme.

The speech read as follows—



ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AMENDMENT (MAKING MARINE PARKS ACCOUNTABLE) BILL 2012


I present the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012.


We face a choice in this country. 


We can bumble along. Lurch from policy grab to policy grab. Adjust and realign policy settings as we get jostled by ENGOs and lobby groups.


Or we can put in place strong systems and processes. Proven over the test of time and trusted. Processes which engage the community and are based on methodical, scientific endeavour. 


We know this country is bounded by the most magnificent stretches of ocean. I know this well, coming from the island state of Tasmania. It is intrinsically part of who we are.


It is possibly because of this love affair we have as a country with our oceans that Australia has built an international reputation for its management of marine areas which is absolutely second to none.


The Coalition has demonstrable record here. These are not empty words. 


It was the Coalition Government in 2006 that began the process of establishing an integrated network of Marine Protected Areas around Australia’s coastline.


It was the Coalition Government that established the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.


We are a central part of that proud history of world class environmental management.


We also support a balanced approach. 


It’s not just substantial economic activity at stake. Some $2.2 billion a year recreational fishers put into the national economy. There is profound connection between our communities, our coastlines and our oceans.


We don’t believe these things are incompatible. We believe that in the overwhelming majority of cases, those things can exist harmoniously. We certainly don’t believe in locking people out of waters which are essentially theirs’. 


This is now at risk though. This proud history is in danger. And that is what this amendment is about today. Restoring some commonsense. Restoring the science.  Restoring some say on the part of the community.


Because that’s not where our Government is going.


We know this Government is poised to lock up great swathes of Commonwealth waters.


If left unchecked they will bring in a series of Marine Park Areas which make no real sense at all.


Because they are not based on science. They are not based on community engagement.


Instead they are based on a series of discussions which were selective. Which were secret. Which were not really representative. And were certainly not based on science. More a series of trade-offs between competing interests and brokered by the Environment Minister Tony Burke.


How do I know this? Because in my role as Parliamentary Secretary for Fisheries it’s my job. I’ve been following this black box marine park process with intense interest.


But also though personal experience.


In January this year, with my colleague, the Member for Hinkler Paul Neville, we had the chance to attend one of these sessions. The fishermen were happy for us to be there. But the Government formally refused. An open and transparent process? No. I can tell you from personal experience it has not been.


But that’s what this bill today is about. Bringing the engagement back. Bringing the science back.


To give the community to have faith in the way Marine Park Areas are nominated and managed.


This amendment will make the Government accountable. Make the Minister accountable.


It would make law that the community be consulted appropriately.


And it would establish an expert panel to review the science upon which our recent proud history of marine park management is based.


Not cynical tradeoffs. Not an exercise of political leverage and favour.


But proven experts. Reporting without fear or favour, the results of their work put on display for all to see. That’s something you can have faith in. That’s something you can trust.


So for mine the choice is pretty clear. 


Do you want environmental policy which lurches from scenario to scenario.


Or a proud continuance of a recent history which has Australia rightly recognised as leading the world managing its marine areas.


I’d say that choice is pretty clear.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today I introduce a bill to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 and the Corporations Act 2001.


This bill delivers another key plank in the Gillard Government's Competitive and Sustainable Banking Package, which the Deputy Prime Minister announced in December 2010. The overall objectives of the package are to improve consumer protection in banking services, to support smaller lenders in increasing competitive pressure on the big banks, and to secure the long-term safety and sustainability of the Australian financial system by reducing reliance on offshore wholesale funding markets.


As part of these objectives the Government has committed to fostering a deep and liquid corporate bond market. Establishing a strong and liquid retail market in the premium, AAA-rated debt security—Commonwealth Government Securities (CGS)—is a critical step in the formation of a wider retail debt market, including corporate debt. For the first time in our history, Australia has been awarded the gold-plated AAA rating from all three global ratings agencies. We are one of only 8 sovereigns around the world to achieve this with a 'stable' outlook.


Making it easier for mums and dads to invest in the safest bonds in Australia is an important step in building up their familiarity with fixed income investments more generally. It will provide retail investors with a visible pricing benchmark for investments they may wish to make in corporate bonds. 


The Commonwealth Government Securities Legislation Amendment (Retail Trading) Bill 2012 contains a number of measures to facilitate trading of CGS on financial markets that are accessible to retail investors. 


retail trading of commonwealth government securities


The first set of amendments contained in this bill allows retail trading of CGS to commence by making appropriate amendments to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 (the CIS Act). 


These amendments are required because retail trading will be conducted differently from the current practices in the wholesale market. During consultation with stakeholders it has become apparent that the most timely and cost-effective way to implement this policy is to use an existing model whereby retail investors will buy and sell beneficial interests in CGS, known as depository interests. This is a widely used model—for example, there are already over 80 types of depository interests traded on the ASX and more are expected. Based on this model retail investors will be able to buy and sell depository interests in CGS on retail markets like any other listed share. Owners of depository interests will have the same claim to payments of principal and interest as if they owned the underlying CGS itself.


As the CIS Act currently does not contemplate beneficial interests in CGS, the amendments in the bill are required to ensure that the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) is authorised to make the necessary payments in connection with the issue, sale and management of depository interests in CGS.


In order to enable retail trading of CGS depository interests to commence, the Government has sought proposals and tenders from industry stakeholders for commercial services necessary to implement this policy. In particular, proposals have been invited from market operators interested in quoting and trading CGS depository interests on their market. The Government anticipates that market trading will be able to commence in the near future.


The Government supports competition in financial services and will similarly engage with other market operators in the future should they be interested in hosting trading in CGS depository interests.




INVESTOR PROTECTION MEASURES



The second set of amendments in the bill will ensure that the investor protection and market integrity provisions in the Corporations Act 2001 (the Corporations Act) apply to retail CGS.


These measures will ensure that financial services providers will have to comply with a range of licensing, conduct and disclosure requirements when they provide their services in relation to CGS depository interests. As an example, financial advisers providing personal advice to a retail client about CGS depositary interests will have to be licensed and supervised by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) before they can do so. They will also have to give the client a Statement of Advice setting out a range of information relating to their advice as required under the law.


The amendments in the bill will also require information statements to be provided to retail clients when they are given personal advice about CGS depository interests. The information statements will take the place of the Product Disclosure Statement that is usually required for a financial product. The Government considers that tailor made disclosure documents are appropriate for CGS depository interests because they are a particular type of safe and simple investment.


The AOFM will consequently produce information statements providing concise information on CGS depository interests. These documents will be made available to the public on a dedicated website, together with other information related to CGS. Financial advisers will be able to download and print out the information statements from this website and provide them to their clients when they recommend investing in CGS depository interests. 


The Government will pursue other avenues in addition to this bill to ensure that the information statements are provided to retail investors through on-market transactions, for example through the online trading platforms offered by online brokers. 


The amendments in the bill also ensure that CGS depository interests quoted and traded on financial markets are subject to the same legal requirements and protections as other listed securities.




MINOR AMENDMENTS



In addition to the two key reforms I have outlined, the bill also contains some minor amendments in relation to the CIS Act that will facilitate the day-to-day administrative work of the AOFM.




MINCO APPROVAL



The Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the amendments to the Corporations Act contained in this bill. 




SUMMING UP



This bill delivers another key plank in the Gillard Government's banking reform package.


Passage of this bill will allow retail investors to buy and sell CGS depository interests on a financial market. They will also be provided with appropriate disclosure documents when they obtain personal advice about investing in CGS depository interests.


The establishment of an active retail CGS market will constitute an important step in the formation of a deep and liquid corporate bond market. 


A vibrant corporate bond market is critical to putting competitive pressure on bank lending rates to business.


It is also central to harnessing our national superannuation savings so we can domestically fund more productive investment in our economy, via both the banking system and the corporate sector, reducing our reliance on offshore wholesale funding markets.


This critical reform is part of the Gillard Government's broad agenda to promote Australia as a leading financial services hub and boost our reputation as one of the most attractive investment destinations in the world.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (12:09):  The Senate is currently considering the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Bill 2012, which, if agreed to, will amend the Equal Opportunity Women in the Workplace Act 1999.


Before dealing with the substance of the bill, I want to make very clear the coalition's commitment to the principle of equal opportunity for women in the workplace, recognising that under the former Rudd government and the current Gillard Labor government, gender inequality continues to be a significant disincentive to the participation of women in the workplace.


When the Equal Opportunity for Women in Workplace Agency released the latest data on the gender pay gap in August 2012, it stood at 17.5 per cent, which equates to approximately $252.80 per week. When they came to power many will recall that Labor promised to fix the gender pay gap. They have clearly failed to do this. Instead, under successive Labor governments, the gender pay gap has become wider. In financial services the gap is close to 30 per cent and in my home state of Western Australia it sits at approximately 25 per cent. Gender equality needs a variety of strategies to address its causes, which are both institutional and cultural. Unfortunately, this bill provides no evidence of progress in this important area.


The coalition proudly supports the principle of gender equality and is keen to make meaningful changes, be it by legislation or community awareness, to achieve gender equality, and to improve workplace participation and workplace flexibility. The coalition, indeed, has a strong record of supporting women in the workplace and the wider society, and we are extremely proud of our achievements in these areas over many years. It was a coalition government that enacted the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Again, in 2001, under a coalition government, employers reported to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency for the first time under the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. When the current Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, was a senior minister in the Howard coalition government, he took action to improve the circumstances of women in the workplace and was a strong advocate for improving women's health in the wider community. It was a coalition which amended the Sex Discrimination Act to explicitly recognise breastfeeding as a potential ground of unlawful discrimination in the workplace. The coalition committed $8.7 million over four years to breastfeeding education and support in the 2007-08 budget to raise awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding among parents and health professionals and support mothers who wish to breastfeed.


Under the coalition, Anastrozole was listed on the PBS for treatment of early stage breast cancer, allowing around 5,700 new patients to become eligible for treatment in the first 12 months of the extended listing. Under the coalition, Herceptin was listed on the PBS for treatment of early stage breast cancer, and around 2,000 patients commenced Herceptin in the first full financial year of listing. The coalition increased funding for successful screening programs for cervical cancer, resulting in a steady decline in Australia's cervical cancer rate. The coalition also announced funding for the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil. In addition, the coalition government committed $1 million for the establishment and initial operation of the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers.


Regrettably, time constraints prevent me from listing all the significant milestones of the coalition's numerous achievements for women, both in the workplace and the wider community. However, the coalition's achievements clearly demonstrate that we are committed to improving the lot of women in society, and that includes supporting gender equity in the workplace, because the coalition believes all Australian women and men are entitled to have an equal opportunity to contribute to society in a way that creates benefits for them, their families and their communities. The coalition values women and men as co-contributors to the economic and social wellbeing of Australia. We recognise and value the many roles that women play in society. The genesis of the bill that is currently before the Senate stems from a review of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act, which was announced in June 2009 and conducted by KPMG. KPMG provided the government with an extensive report in relation to the review but, regrettably, even with the benefit of the review and report, more than three years on from the review, the government has yet to be able to come up with a clear and coherent plan of action on what is described in the report as 'matters in relation to each gender equality indicator' and other core issues, all of which were critical elements of the KPMG report. Given the government's failure to address these critical core elements and, regrettably, its very clear failure to understand their relevance and importance to improving gender equality in the workplace, it is the coalition's view that it is premature to be introducing this legislation at this time when these critical issues have not been addressed.


The bill, in its present form, represents another failure by another Labor government in relation to policy and a lost opportunity to improve gender equality, which continues to be a significant disincentive to the participation of women in the workplace. One can only assume that the hotchpotch of disparate issues contained in the bill is a measure of the government's confused and jumbled thinking on the issue of gender equality and is designed as a smokescreen for supposed action in the run-up to the next election. This is given that Labor is good at making commitments in relation to gender equality and indeed made a number of commitments in relation to general equality in the workplace as part of its 2010 election campaign—which it has clearly failed to deliver.


The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill and the minister's second reading speech indicate that the bill is intended to amend the name and objects of the act; improve the coverage of the act; enhance the agency's advice and education functions; simplify and streamline reporting; and strengthen the compliance framework.


A close reading of the detail of the bill identifies four key issues which are of concern to the coalition. The minister's second reading speech is a continuation of the government's policy of promoting spin over substance and all about fabricating and spinning a story designed to give the impression that the substance of the bill will usher in major benefits for women in the workplace—when clearly it will not. The bill promotes additional, costly, bureaucratic regulation, at the expense of business, and will impose significant additional reporting burdens and costs on those employers caught by this legislation.


The bill is drafted with a bias to appease the union movement. The reporting functions of those employers caught by the legislation are designed to provide additional information, at the employer's expense, which may well be used by the unions to mount wages and other claims against the employers based on this information. The bill is also drafted to provide the minister with an inordinate amount of discretion. For example, the amendment bill gives the minister the power by legislative instrument to specify matters in relation to each gender equality indicator as set out in subsection 3(1), which states:


The public report must contain details of the matters specified in the instrument made by the Minister.


This broad discretion will provide the minister with opportunities to vary the principles enunciated in the supporting documentation to the bill and these yet-to-be-determined actions will not be subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny that could have occurred had the matters been properly included in the bill.


The coalition does not support legislation which provides such a broad-ranging ministerial discretion that is unjustifiable under the circumstances and which will allow the minister effectively to do what the minister likes as the minister is being empowered under the bill to 'add new matters' as the minister sees fit and further tie business up in costly but yet undisclosed bureaucratic red tape.


I participated in the Senate committee inquiry into the current bill and took a great interest in the written submissions and the oral evidence presented to the committee. Based on the questions posed to witnesses and the evidence given to the committee, and having regard to the majority report of the committee, I formed the impression that the government members were not interested in many of the issues that were raised by the witnesses. It seemed to me that the government was acting in haste and was more interested in being able to claim it was delivering on an election promise than in the potential adverse ramifications which will no doubt flow from this bill.


My concerns are covered, in part, by the comments set out in the minority report of the committee, of which I am a signatory. At page 32 of the committee report under the heading 'Evidence', the coalition senators in their dissenting report made the following comments:


1.10 The majority report seeks to selectively highlight certain submissions received in support of the proposed legislation. The majority report fails to acknowledge the divergent evidence received by the Committee from business and industry representatives, unions, academics and lobbyists, with many of these submissions highlighting concerns with the proposed legislation and calling for it to be amended. The majority report seeks to conveniently ignore much of [the] material critical of the proposed legislation.  


1.11  Coalition Senators recognise that it is employers who will have to implement these proposed workplace changes—not the public sector, unions, or lobby groups—and it is employers that will have to bear the additional costs of these changes notwithstanding that the government is unable to quantify these potential costs. 


1.12 It is the view of Coalition Senators that the committee majority report was dismissive and indeed contemptuous of the views of industry representatives who represented and spoke for thousands of Australian employers. 


At page 34 of the committee report under the heading 'The alarming absence of information', coalition senators in their dissenting report made the following comments:


1.16 The Bill is an example of 'coat hanger legislation' reliant on regulations that are yet to be drafted, or future Ministerial directives, with many important aspects proposed to be defined only after the legislation has been passed. 


1.17 Coalition Senators consider that it is irresponsible to support and pass legislation which imposes significant burdens and financial ramifications on employers, without being fully informed of the intentions of the Minister in respect to the proposed regulations and potential Ministerial directions. 


The coalition senators also say, at paragraph 1.20:


In considering the provision in the Bill that provides the Minister with these significant powers, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills concluded:


The Committee prefers that the use of delegated legislation is fully explained. In this case the explanatory memorandum does not address this point, but indicates at page 2 that the development of these standards will be evidence-based and that the Minister must consult the Agency prior to making the standards. It is also envisaged (see subsection 31(3)) that the Minister will consult with other relevant persons, such as industry and employee organisations. In these circumstances the Committee leaves the question of whether the proposed approach is appropriate to the consideration of the Senate as a whole.


In paragraph 1.21 of their minority report, coalition senators concluded:


.. the Bill is drafted to provide the Minister with an inordinate amount of discretion, 'without legislative constraint on the exercise of these powers'.


Earlier in my comments I described this bill in its present form as a hotchpotch of disparate issues which confirmed the coalition's view that the bill is an indication of the government's confused and jumbled thinking on this issue and was designed as a smokescreen to enable the government to claim supposed action in the run-up to the next election, given that Labor gave certain commitments relating to equality in the workplace as part of their 2010 election campaign and upon which they are yet to deliver. 


Whilst it is not practical to attempt to re-draft this bill on the run in the Senate, I indicate that, on behalf of the coalition, I propose to move a number of amendments during the committee stage, including calling on the government to commit to achieving equal opportunity for women by supporting the coalition's paid parental leave scheme. Other coalition amendments are designed to achieve a more balanced approach to the substance of the bill and include a specific amendment to lessen the inordinate discretion that this bill in its current form bestows on the minister.


In relation to the coalition's paid parental leave scheme, I must say that as a senator who has travelled around Australia and attended many forums in relation to paid parental leave, I am delighted at the manner in which the coalition's proposal has been embraced across the country by not only women but also men. There is no doubt that the coalition recognise that one of the most effective ways to increase female workplace participation is a solid paid parental leave scheme and affordable child care. If the government are serious about achieving gender equality, they should support the coalition's paid parental leave scheme. Unlike the government's scheme, which is nothing more and nothing less than a welfare based scheme, the coalition support the economic empowerment of women and under their scheme will provide real time and real money to working women, offering eligible women 26 weeks at their replacement wage of up to $75,000 per annum.


Financial security for women is something that Australians see the Labor Party pay lip-service to but take almost no real action on. This is highlighted by the fact that Labor's Paid Parental Leave Scheme, in addition to being a welfare based scheme, does not include any superannuation. The coalition's paid parental leave scheme includes superannuation, and those payments will be made at the mandatory level, because, unlike Labor, the coalition believe, that women should not be disadvantaged when the time comes to draw on retirement savings.


As I have stated, the coalition will move in the committee stage a number of other amendments which will seek to amend the bill to remove the inordinate level of discretion proposed to be provided to the minister; re-introduce provisions allowing the agency to waive public reporting requirements for relevant employers; insert a provision for the agency to give public acknowledgement to relevant employers who regularly meet compliance standards; and require the government, despite what it says it wants to do, to remove one regulation for relevant employers for each new regulation that it introduces as a result of this act.


In proposing these amendments, the coalition are seeking to strongly support the principle of gender equality. The amendments are drafted to make meaningful changes to the current bill in the interests of achieving gender equality, improving workplace participation and improving workplace flexibility. I have already provided examples of some of the actions the former Howard coalition government took and examples of the current policies of the coalition that irrefutably demonstrate that the coalition have a strong record in supporting women in the workplace and the wider society. We are proud of our significant achievements over many years and we are keen to continue to support gender equality improvement in the workplace. 


However, I remind the Senate that the minister's second reading speech on this bill is a continuation of the government's policy of promoting spin over substance. A close reading of the detail of the bill indicates that even Labor's colourful rhetoric, which is designed to portray action when there is nothing really happening, is unable to camouflage the fact that the Labor government have failed to address the core issues set out in the KPMG report, and the responses it has received from the employers and employer groups that they will end up paying for the increased bureaucratic red tape that comprises the substance of this bill.


The coalition support gender equality in the workplace. Regrettably, this bill in its present form represents a lost opportunity by another Labor government to improve gender equality in the workplace and, if passed, will be a source of great disappointment to women across Australia. Given the coalition's commitment to gender equality in the workplace, in the event that our amendments are not accepted by the government, the coalition will oppose the bill on the basis that it imposes draconian measures which are designed to increase the level of government interference in the workplace and may well have the opposite effect to what is stated as the bill's aims and objectives.


I urge the government to seriously consider the coalition's amendments, which we believe add considerable substance and value to the bill. Legislation for gender equality in the workplace should be drafted to encourage bipartisan involvement and be drafted in a form which is able to be embraced by employers and employees alike, in the wider interest of our society. The failure of the government to accept the coalition's amendments will confirm to the wider community that Labor see gender equality in the workplace as a party political football able to be kicked around in an attempt to score political points rather than a bipartisan social issue able to be embraced by our wider society.


The reform of EOWA represented the chance for the government to do something meaningful to advance gender equality in Australian workplaces by introducing measures to improve flexibility, productivity and incentives to encourage women back to the workforce after having children. Regrettably this has not occurred. (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:29):  The Greens support the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. We recognise that the measures set out here are quite minimal, but they still do provide some improvements for women in the workplace. I will come back later to some of the comments by the previous speaker, Senator Cash, but at the outset I would like to say that her contribution reminds us of what an Abbott led government would do to this country, in particular to women, and how tough it would be. That is certainly coming forward as a very relevant part of this debate.


When we are talking about workplace gender equality I think it is worth reminding ourselves just how much we need to achieve. Women make up more than 70 per cent of part-time employees in this country and only 35 per cent of full-time employment. The gender pay gap is also an interesting statistic. I pay tribute to our forebears, the women who, over many decades, have worked so hard for equal pay, but we are moving to that at such a slow pace. The gender pay gap is experienced at every level in the workplace, with women on average earning $250.70 per week less than men. Women still earn between 11 and 19 per cent less per hour than men in comparable non-managerial occupations. These trends are very worrying and in some areas the pay gap is becoming worse.


Just last month the Financial Services Institute reported a widening gender pay gap of 31 per cent in the financial services industry compared to the average 17 per cent gap across all industries. That is what we find when we look at the average figures of the difference between male and female pay rates, so in some industries the gap is much worse. It is also interesting to look at how graduates fare. More women than men are graduating with degrees; however, female graduates earn $2,000 a year less than male graduates on entry into the workforce.


I have set out those details just to remind us that we need much stronger legislation than the bill we are considering today. And it is interesting to consider that, from what I can see at the moment, there are 19 speakers listed for this debate and only three of them are men. But the bill before us is still a positive measure and I think we need to see it in terms of the long march to women's equality and equal pay.


The essence of the bill is that, from 2013, organisations with more than 100 employees will have to report annually on gender equality in their workplace and show improvements over two years if they are not meeting industry benchmarks. While this is supposedly already happening, not all companies report or their reporting is not compliant, and compliance enforcement is patchy. This is clearly why the legislation is needed and certainly answers Senator Cash's talk about how damaging the bill is. 


But I would call the current penalty system pretty much a wet lettuce. For example, the current penalty of 'tabling' non-compliant companies in parliament will be strengthened, whereby non-compliant companies may be disqualified from access to government work contracts or government funding or other financial assistance. Government contracts do represent quite a convincing amount—they are coming in at $42 billion—so hopefully that will be some incentive. However, the operative phrase here is 'may be disqualified'—it is only 'may'. The Greens therefore will be watching closely to check that that is enforced. How will it work? Companies will have to report to the new Workplace Gender Equality Agency on two matters. One is the gender composition of their boards and the second, importantly, is their performance against a set of gender equality indicators and outcomes. This is in the context of expecting that there will be ongoing improvement.


The gender equality indicators are a most important part of this bill. They are where we get down to some detail which, if it is followed through, can make a real difference to gender equality in the workplace. These indicators will be explicitly listed in the act to include: gender composition of the workforce and governing bodies, equal remuneration between men and women, flexible working arrangements and working arrangements relating to employees with family or caring responsibilities. Another important aspect is that the bill requires consultation with employees on issues concerning gender equality in the workplace.


The results should be that the reports are real, they represent what is going on within those companies and their employees can have some real and meaningful input. We should be able to get past the situation where companies whack out reports that have been done just at the top levels of the companies and they are able to do a bit of a spin job on how they come forward. Now, management at the highest level must engage with gender equality, with CEOs being required to sign off on the reports. Employees and their representative organisations must be advised within seven days of the report being lodged and they may provide comment to the employer or the Workplace Gender Quality Agency. The reports must be accessible to employees and shareholders, and the agency will have inspectorial powers to verify the reports. So again I put on the record that it is a good start, but there is a long way to go.


One aspect that the Greens are concerned about is that the bill excludes those businesses with fewer than 100 employees. We see that as quite detrimental. It means that about 4.8 million employees, which is nearly half of the private sector employment, are not covered by this legislation. The Greens see this as very unfortunate and we will continue to advocate for its extension to those businesses as well. The reframing of the act to include an expectation that male employees should be flexibly available to provide caring roles outside the workplace finally recognises that women's employment opportunities are limited when men are not available to share family responsibilities is a workplace norm. Again, that is another area where I would like to congratulate the minister who has worked on this legislation. I see that as an important part of the legislation to help change those attitudes within our society.


The explicit reference to pay equity between men and women ensures that this is not just a woman's problem. The new requirement for hard data provides a basis for clear measurement and benchmarking of gender equality in larger companies. Again, I think it is laying that basis for this important work to continue and to be extended. Better transparency is welcomed with employees' access to their company's reporting and an opportunity to comment on that reporting. The ability of government to wield a decent sized penalty for non-compliant companies is one of the positive changes that go some way to addressing the unacceptable fact that equality for women in the workplace has a long way to go.


This brings us back to some of the comments by Senator Cash. She spoke many times and opened her speech noting the strong commitment that she argues the coalition has to equal opportunity to women in the workforce. This is coming from a member of a party that gave us a former prime minister who was so keen to frame his policies around the white picket fence—and we know what that represented in terms of women's rights. A former treasurer, Mr Costello, was out there promoting his three-children policy to women. There is that whole culture within the coalition party that limits the rights of women.


Yes, there are many areas where we have been able to work together but, when you get down to the details, particularly the details of women's rights in the workforce—and there we are talking about the fact that a majority of women are still dominating in those low-paid areas of the workforce—that is where you see the massive failure of the coalition's policy. That comes through so clearly in the amendments that Senator Cash has outlined.


You have to see the coalition's attempt to dumb down the reforms in this piece of legislation as a worrying forecast of what is to come if we end up with an Abbott-led government which would be favouring business over women's equity at work. When we get to the committee stage, I think that Senator Cash has to be open and go into those aspects, because that is the wash-up of the amendments that we have before us. In essence, what the amendments do is return to the status quo of how the present system works. Clearly, when you look at the inequity in pay for women, how women dominate in the poorly paid jobs—jobs where there are few career paths—and the ongoing inequality in our workplace to try and wind back the clock, as the coalition is attempting to do with their amendments, this exposes what their policy stands for.


There are two broad areas which Senator Cash spoke about: she wants to retain the current power of the agency to waive public reporting requirements for relevant employees. Even though the whole point of the bill is that all companies must report on how they are meeting the minimum EEO standards, because they have not been required in the past, the coalition is saying: employers should not have to be held to account regarding minimum EEO and antidiscrimination standards. That is the wash-up of what the coalition's amendments would do, so you cannot therefore be concluding that the coalition is committed to women's equality in the workplace. 


The second aspect of the coalition's amendments is that they would remove the proposed requirement for the minister to set minimum standards in relation to gender. What is wrong with that? Surely if you are committed to women's equality in the workplace, you would want to ensure that the minister had that ability. In many ways, the whole point of the bill is for the minister to set minimum gender equality standards. This is more accountable than the agency setting the standards, which is the current situation. Again, it is a very revealing amendment that helps unpick where the coalition stands on women's rights in the workplace.


I look forward to the debate when we move into committee. The Greens will support the bill in its current form. The Greens will not support the amendments as outlined by Senator Cash on behalf of the coalition but we will continue to advocate for stronger measures to ensure that we move more quickly to women's equality in the workplace. We would argue that the starting place is the need to move this legislation to cover all private sector businesses and not just those with over 100 employees.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (12:43):  I rise to support the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012, a bill that delivers on our 2010 election commitment to retain and improve the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Senator Rhiannon just noted that there were 19 speakers listed to speak on this bill and only three of those are male. I can advise that of these three, two are from Labor, one is from the coalition and there are none from the Greens. 


I congratulate Minister Julie Collins for her work on this bill. Minister Collins is the first female to represent the people of Franklin in Tasmania, a role she has undertaken with distinction since 2007. 


This proposed legislation presents a new framework for promoting and encouraging gender equality in Australian workplaces. It is about supporting businesses to achieve cultural change. It supports improved workforce participation, particularly of women and carers, as well as reducing the regulatory burden on business. In 2009, the then Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, initiated a comprehensive review of the legislation. This review studied the status of both women and men in the workplace. It found that the act needed to be updated and modernised to be fully effective in supporting and driving change, change that is about creating a modern cooperative business environment.


A little over a week ago conservative broadcaster Alan Jones attempted to spark outrage with derogatory comments that women in leadership were destroying the joint.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (12:09):  The Senate is currently considering the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Bill 2012, which, if agreed to, will amend the Equal Opportunity Women in the Workplace Act 1999.


Before dealing with the substance of the bill, I want to make very clear the coalition's commitment to the principle of equal opportunity for women in the workplace, recognising that under the former Rudd government and the current Gillard Labor government, gender inequality continues to be a significant disincentive to the participation of women in the workplace.


When the Equal Opportunity for Women in Workplace Agency released the latest data on the gender pay gap in August 2012, it stood at 17.5 per cent, which equates to approximately $252.80 per week. When they came to power many will recall that Labor promised to fix the gender pay gap. They have clearly failed to do this. Instead, under successive Labor governments, the gender pay gap has become wider. In financial services the gap is close to 30 per cent and in my home state of Western Australia it sits at approximately 25 per cent. Gender equality needs a variety of strategies to address its causes, which are both institutional and cultural. Unfortunately, this bill provides no evidence of progress in this important area.


The coalition proudly supports the principle of gender equality and is keen to make meaningful changes, be it by legislation or community awareness, to achieve gender equality, and to improve workplace participation and workplace flexibility. The coalition, indeed, has a strong record of supporting women in the workplace and the wider society, and we are extremely proud of our achievements in these areas over many years. It was a coalition government that enacted the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Again, in 2001, under a coalition government, employers reported to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency for the first time under the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. When the current Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, was a senior minister in the Howard coalition government, he took action to improve the circumstances of women in the workplace and was a strong advocate for improving women's health in the wider community. It was a coalition which amended the Sex Discrimination Act to explicitly recognise breastfeeding as a potential ground of unlawful discrimination in the workplace. The coalition committed $8.7 million over four years to breastfeeding education and support in the 2007-08 budget to raise awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding among parents and health professionals and support mothers who wish to breastfeed.


Under the coalition, Anastrozole was listed on the PBS for treatment of early stage breast cancer, allowing around 5,700 new patients to become eligible for treatment in the first 12 months of the extended listing. Under the coalition, Herceptin was listed on the PBS for treatment of early stage breast cancer, and around 2,000 patients commenced Herceptin in the first full financial year of listing. The coalition increased funding for successful screening programs for cervical cancer, resulting in a steady decline in Australia's cervical cancer rate. The coalition also announced funding for the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil. In addition, the coalition government committed $1 million for the establishment and initial operation of the Centre for Gynaecological Cancers.


Regrettably, time constraints prevent me from listing all the significant milestones of the coalition's numerous achievements for women, both in the workplace and the wider community. However, the coalition's achievements clearly demonstrate that we are committed to improving the lot of women in society, and that includes supporting gender equity in the workplace, because the coalition believes all Australian women and men are entitled to have an equal opportunity to contribute to society in a way that creates benefits for them, their families and their communities. The coalition values women and men as co-contributors to the economic and social wellbeing of Australia. We recognise and value the many roles that women play in society. The genesis of the bill that is currently before the Senate stems from a review of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act, which was announced in June 2009 and conducted by KPMG. KPMG provided the government with an extensive report in relation to the review but, regrettably, even with the benefit of the review and report, more than three years on from the review, the government has yet to be able to come up with a clear and coherent plan of action on what is described in the report as 'matters in relation to each gender equality indicator' and other core issues, all of which were critical elements of the KPMG report. Given the government's failure to address these critical core elements and, regrettably, its very clear failure to understand their relevance and importance to improving gender equality in the workplace, it is the coalition's view that it is premature to be introducing this legislation at this time when these critical issues have not been addressed.


The bill, in its present form, represents another failure by another Labor government in relation to policy and a lost opportunity to improve gender equality, which continues to be a significant disincentive to the participation of women in the workplace. One can only assume that the hotchpotch of disparate issues contained in the bill is a measure of the government's confused and jumbled thinking on the issue of gender equality and is designed as a smokescreen for supposed action in the run-up to the next election. This is given that Labor is good at making commitments in relation to gender equality and indeed made a number of commitments in relation to general equality in the workplace as part of its 2010 election campaign—which it has clearly failed to deliver.


The explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill and the minister's second reading speech indicate that the bill is intended to amend the name and objects of the act; improve the coverage of the act; enhance the agency's advice and education functions; simplify and streamline reporting; and strengthen the compliance framework.


A close reading of the detail of the bill identifies four key issues which are of concern to the coalition.

The coalition's paid parental leave scheme includes superannuation, and those payments will be made at the mandatory level, because, unlike Labor, the coalition believe, that women should not be disadvantaged when the time comes to draw on retirement savings.


As I have stated, the coalition will move in the committee stage a number of other amendments which will seek to amend the bill to remove the inordinate level of discretion proposed to be provided to the minister; re-introduce provisions allowing the agency to waive public reporting requirements for relevant employers; insert a provision for the agency to give public acknowledgement to relevant employers who regularly meet compliance standards; and require the government, despite what it says it wants to do, to remove one regulation for relevant employers for each new regulation that it introduces as a result of this act.


In proposing these amendments, the coalition are seeking to strongly support the principle of gender equality. The amendments are drafted to make meaningful changes to the current bill in the interests of achieving gender equality, improving workplace participation and improving workplace flexibility. I have already provided examples of some of the actions the former Howard coalition government took and examples of the current policies of the coalition that irrefutably demonstrate that the coalition have a strong record in supporting women in the workplace and the wider society. We are proud of our significant achievements over many years and we are keen to continue to support gender equality improvement in the workplace. 


However, I remind the Senate that the minister's second reading speech on this bill is a continuation of the government's policy of promoting spin over substance. A close reading of the detail of the bill indicates that even Labor's colourful rhetoric, which is designed to portray action when there is nothing really happening, is unable to camouflage the fact that the Labor government have failed to address the core issues set out in the KPMG report, and the responses it has received from the employers and employer groups that they will end up paying for the increased bureaucratic red tape that comprises the substance of this bill.


The coalition support gender equality in the workplace. Regrettably, this bill in its present form represents a lost opportunity by another Labor government to improve gender equality in the workplace and, if passed, will be a source of great disappointment to women across Australia. Given the coalition's commitment to gender equality in the workplace, in the event that our amendments are not accepted by the government, the coalition will oppose the bill on the basis that it imposes draconian measures which are designed to increase the level of government interference in the workplace and may well have the opposite effect to what is stated as the bill's aims and objectives.


I urge the government to seriously consider the coalition's amendments, which we believe add considerable substance and value to the bill. Legislation for gender equality in the workplace should be drafted to encourage bipartisan involvement and be drafted in a form which is able to be embraced by employers and employees alike, in the wider interest of our society. The failure of the government to accept the coalition's amendments will confirm to the wider community that Labor see gender equality in the workplace as a party political football able to be kicked around in an attempt to score political points rather than a bipartisan social issue able to be embraced by our wider society.


The reform of EOWA represented the chance for the government to do something meaningful to advance gender equality in Australian workplaces by introducing measures to improve flexibility, productivity and incentives to encourage women back to the workforce after having children. Regrettably this has not occurred. (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:29):  The Greens support the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. We recognise that the measures set out here are quite minimal, but they still do provide some improvements for women in the workplace. I will come back later to some of the comments by the previous speaker, Senator Cash, but at the outset I would like to say that her contribution reminds us of what an Abbott led government would do to this country, in particular to women, and how tough it would be. That is certainly coming forward as a very relevant part of this debate.


When we are talking about workplace gender equality I think it is worth reminding ourselves just how much we need to achieve. Women make up more than 70 per cent of part-time employees in this country and only 35 per cent of full-time employment. The gender pay gap is also an interesting statistic. I pay tribute to our forebears, the women who, over many decades, have worked so hard for equal pay, but we are moving to that at such a slow pace. The gender pay gap is experienced at every level in the workplace, with women on average earning $250.70 per week less than men. Women still earn between 11 and 19 per cent less per hour than men in comparable non-managerial occupations. These trends are very worrying and in some areas the pay gap is becoming worse.


Just last month the Financial Services Institute reported a widening gender pay gap of 31 per cent in the financial services industry compared to the average 17 per cent gap across all industries. That is what we find when we look at the average figures of the difference between male and female pay rates, so in some industries the gap is much worse. It is also interesting to look at how graduates fare. More women than men are graduating with degrees; however, female graduates earn $2,000 a year less than male graduates on entry into the workforce.


I have set out those details just to remind us that we need much stronger legislation than the bill we are considering today. And it is interesting to consider that, from what I can see at the moment, there are 19 speakers listed for this debate and only three of them are men. But the bill before us is still a positive measure and I think we need to see it in terms of the long march to women's equality and equal pay.


The essence of the bill is that, from 2013, organisations with more than 100 employees will have to report annually on gender equality in their workplace and show improvements over two years if they are not meeting industry benchmarks. While this is supposedly already happening, not all companies report or their reporting is not compliant, and compliance enforcement is patchy. This is clearly why the legislation is needed and certainly answers Senator Cash's talk about how damaging the bill is. 


But I would call the current penalty system pretty much a wet lettuce. For example, the current penalty of 'tabling' non-compliant companies in parliament will be strengthened, whereby non-compliant companies may be disqualified from access to government work contracts or government funding or other financial assistance. Government contracts do represent quite a convincing amount—they are coming in at $42 billion—so hopefully that will be some incentive. However, the operative phrase here is 'may be disqualified'—it is only 'may'. The Greens therefore will be watching closely to check that that is enforced. How will it work? Companies will have to report to the new Workplace Gender Equality Agency on two matters. One is the gender composition of their boards and the second, importantly, is their performance against a set of gender equality indicators and outcomes. This is in the context of expecting that there will be ongoing improvement.


The gender equality indicators are a most important part of this bill. They are where we get down to some detail which, if it is followed through, can make a real difference to gender equality in the workplace. These indicators will be explicitly listed in the act to include: gender composition of the workforce and governing bodies, equal remuneration between men and women, flexible working arrangements and working arrangements relating to employees with family or caring responsibilities. Another important aspect is that the bill requires consultation with employees on issues concerning gender equality in the workplace.


The results should be that the reports are real, they represent what is going on within those companies and their employees can have some real and meaningful input. We should be able to get past the situation where companies whack out reports that have been done just at the top levels of the companies and they are able to do a bit of a spin job on how they come forward. Now, management at the highest level must engage with gender equality, with CEOs being required to sign off on the reports. Employees and their representative organisations must be advised within seven days of the report being lodged and they may provide comment to the employer or the Workplace Gender Quality Agency. The reports must be accessible to employees and shareholders, and the agency will have inspectorial powers to verify the reports. So again I put on the record that it is a good start, but there is a long way to go.


One aspect that the Greens are concerned about is that the bill excludes those businesses with fewer than 100 employees. We see that as quite detrimental. It means that about 4.8 million employees, which is nearly half of the private sector employment, are not covered by this legislation. The Greens see this as very unfortunate and we will continue to advocate for its extension to those businesses as well. The reframing of the act to include an expectation that male employees should be flexibly available to provide caring roles outside the workplace finally recognises that women's employment opportunities are limited when men are not available to share family responsibilities is a workplace norm. Again, that is another area where I would like to congratulate the minister who has worked on this legislation. I see that as an important part of the legislation to help change those attitudes within our society.


The explicit reference to pay equity between men and women ensures that this is not just a woman's problem. The new requirement for hard data provides a basis for clear measurement and benchmarking of gender equality in larger companies. Again, I think it is laying that basis for this important work to continue and to be extended. Better transparency is welcomed with employees' access to their company's reporting and an opportunity to comment on that reporting. The ability of government to wield a decent sized penalty for non-compliant companies is one of the positive changes that go some way to addressing the unacceptable fact that equality for women in the workplace has a long way to go.


This brings us back to some of the comments by Senator Cash. She spoke many times and opened her speech noting the strong commitment that she argues the coalition has to equal opportunity to women in the workforce. This is coming from a member of a party that gave us a former prime minister who was so keen to frame his policies around the white picket fence—and we know what that represented in terms of women's rights. A former treasurer, Mr Costello, was out there promoting his three-children policy to women. There is that whole culture within the coalition party that limits the rights of women.


Yes, there are many areas where we have been able to work together but, when you get down to the details, particularly the details of women's rights in the workforce—and there we are talking about the fact that a majority of women are still dominating in those low-paid areas of the workforce—that is where you see the massive failure of the coalition's policy. That comes through so clearly in the amendments that Senator Cash has outlined.


You have to see the coalition's attempt to dumb down the reforms in this piece of legislation as a worrying forecast of what is to come if we end up with an Abbott-led government which would be favouring business over women's equity at work. When we get to the committee stage, I think that Senator Cash has to be open and go into those aspects, because that is the wash-up of the amendments that we have before us. In essence, what the amendments do is return to the status quo of how the present system works. Clearly, when you look at the inequity in pay for women, how women dominate in the poorly paid jobs—jobs where there are few career paths—and the ongoing inequality in our workplace to try and wind back the clock, as the coalition is attempting to do with their amendments, this exposes what their policy stands for.


There are two broad areas which Senator Cash spoke about: she wants to retain the current power of the agency to waive public reporting requirements for relevant employees. Even though the whole point of the bill is that all companies must report on how they are meeting the minimum EEO standards, because they have not been required in the past, the coalition is saying: employers should not have to be held to account regarding minimum EEO and antidiscrimination standards. That is the wash-up of what the coalition's amendments would do, so you cannot therefore be concluding that the coalition is committed to women's equality in the workplace. 


The second aspect of the coalition's amendments is that they would remove the proposed requirement for the minister to set minimum standards in relation to gender. What is wrong with that? Surely if you are committed to women's equality in the workplace, you would want to ensure that the minister had that ability. In many ways, the whole point of the bill is for the minister to set minimum gender equality standards. This is more accountable than the agency setting the standards, which is the current situation. Again, it is a very revealing amendment that helps unpick where the coalition stands on women's rights in the workplace.


I look forward to the debate when we move into committee. The Greens will support the bill in its current form. The Greens will not support the amendments as outlined by Senator Cash on behalf of the coalition but we will continue to advocate for stronger measures to ensure that we move more quickly to women's equality in the workplace. We would argue that the starting place is the need to move this legislation to cover all private sector businesses and not just those with over 100 employees.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (12:43):  I rise to support the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012, a bill that delivers on our 2010 election commitment to retain and improve the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Senator Rhiannon just noted that there were 19 speakers listed to speak on this bill and only three of those are male. I can advise that of these three, two are from Labor, one is from the coalition and there are none from the Greens. 


I congratulate Minister Julie Collins for her work on this bill. Minister Collins is the first female to represent the people of Franklin in Tasmania, a role she has undertaken with distinction since 2007. 


This proposed legislation presents a new framework for promoting and encouraging gender equality in Australian workplaces. It is about supporting businesses to achieve cultural change. It supports improved workforce participation, particularly of women and carers, as well as reducing the regulatory burden on business. In 2009, the then Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, initiated a comprehensive review of the legislation. This review studied the status of both women and men in the workplace. It found that the act needed to be updated and modernised to be fully effective in supporting and driving change, change that is about creating a modern cooperative business environment.


A little over a week ago conservative broadcaster Alan Jones attempted to spark outrage with derogatory comments that women in leadership were destroying the joint.

The only confirmed unfunded promises and the only confirmed targeting for cuts is the $70 billion in cuts to services that the shadow minister for finance and the shadow Treasurer have both confirmed on national television. That is $70 billion of cuts to services, confirmed by Mr Hockey and Mr Robb. The only confirmed unfunded set of promises that we have at the moment is from those from the other side. Of course, the thing that Senator Cormann fails to recognise is that there is actually only one party in this place prepared to honour Peter Costello's Charter of Budget Honesty, despite the fact that Senator Fifield and Senator Brandis constantly tell us what a wonderful Treasurer Mr Costello was and how we should be emulating him. Here they come now, the fan club, but the problem is they are not actually going to honour his Charter of Budget Honesty. So it is up to the Labor Party to honour Peter Costello's Charter of Budget Honesty, but those opposite who claim to have sat at his feet and learnt the issue of fiscal policy—




Senator Brandis:

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to all questions without notice asked today.


Let me start at the end and perhaps move backwards. As I said in my final supplementary question to the minister, the original promise of this government in relation to the National Rental Affordability Scheme made by then housing minister Tanya Plibersek in a press release on 5 December 2008 was that 50,000 new rental properties would be built across Australia by 2012. You really need to have a calendar with you to actually appreciate the extraordinary nature of these figures.


In the current performance summary, the government's commitment is to 25,302 dwellings by April 2013; so already half of the original commitment that was promised by 2012 in 2008. The minister advised us in his response today that the 2014 target was 35,000 dwellings under the National Rental Affordability Scheme. But the reality is that at current rates of construction, which see 9,289 dwellings built and tenanted as at September 2012, it would take the construction of over 2,000 houses per month to meet the target in the performance summary—not per year, per month. And this government says that they are bringing affordable housing onto the market in some sort of much vaunted, holier-than-thou way because they are a Labor government and that is what they do.


What it seems to me that they do is to break promises. It was pretty clear in 2008: Minister Plibersek's commitment was to 50,000 National Rental Affordability Scheme houses across Australia by 2012. So we find ourselves here in September 2012 looking at less than 10,000 dwellings. And so as the costs of this government's budget blow out everywhere else across the country, we are faced again with them not explaining how they are going to fill this black hole—this $120 billion black hole in their budget. Not one answer today actually responded to where those gaping holes will be filled. Not one answer! Not from Minister Wong, not from Minister Evans and not from any of the other ministers who had a role in today's question time. Most certainly not from Minister Carr, who has not gone any way whatsoever towards acknowledging the challenge of funding for the Gonski recommendations in education but who nevertheless can see fit to rail against state governments, which they are supposedly engaged in cooperative federalism with!


It is actually beyond a joke; it is actually verging on farcical. It does not matter if you talk to Frontier Economics, it does not matter if you read the Australian Financial Review and it does not matter if you look at the government's own figures: they will actually need to find $120 billion. That is about $20,000 for the average four-person family by 2020 to pay for their spending promises.


'Promises', though: that is the word one would be using loosely if one had any acquaintance with the housing portfolio, as I have. We have a government which has bet the house on historically high commodity prices continuing into the future, and the reality is that that will not be what happens. Look at the expectations which have been raised in so many sectors of the community and the promises that have been given. We had about 10 days in the last fortnight where if you combined the dental care scheme, worth $4 billion, and the Gonski recommendations, worth about $5 billion a year, and you added to that the unfunded National Disability Insurance Scheme as it currently stands, we had about $20 billion worth of promises just wandering around in the ether. But that is okay, because the implementation dates are—what?—2020! How many of us are still going to be here? Some of us, hopefully, but 2020! How stupid does the government think that the Australian public are? They are over vacuous promises and they are over being told that 50,000 dwellings would be built by 2012 when we cannot even crack 10,000.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:06):  When you talk of so-called 'black holes', you need look no further than the $70 billion of unfunded promises of those opposite. This Labor government has been well prepared to honour its charter of budget honesty, and the Labor Party, as that government, is honouring that charter.


Let us take a look at the facts, which are that government spending under this government is projected to fall to just 23.5 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 and remain there across into the forward estimates. This would be the longest sustained run of payments below 24 per cent of GDP since the early 1980s. That is the kind of thing that those opposite should have been doing when they were in government, when there was room in the economy during the last mining boom to put that money away. But, sadly, I think those opposite squandered much of the last mining boom, and that is leaving the tough decisions for today. But we are getting on with the job of making those tough decisions. We have standards, and this Australian community expects those standards to be met—standards that are really a lot higher than accepting, as the minister highlighted today, a catering company's costings on Nauru or, for that matter, the costings done during the last budget, which did not meet audit standards despite the fact that shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey repeatedly claimed that those dodgy costings were in fact an audit.


So let us take a look at the facts about some of those things that are being promulgated by those opposite and in the media—things like saying that our dental care is uncosted. They have been saying things like, 'It's $4 billion over two years.' It is $4 billion over six years, and it also replaces a different scheme, so it is simply not new expenditure being added to the books. So those opposite cannot continue just to make things up as they have done this question time about the fiscal responsibility of this government. They have no idea where their figures are coming from and no basis for such absurd figures, but what has been well accepted is the $70 billion black hole of those opposite. That is the real question that this chamber and the Australian people need to deal with—the fact that those opposite have simply made up their allegations about the state of the budget.


But what I know is that what this government has done is that, while we were managing the global financial crisis, we still got on with the job of important social reforms in this country like the biggest increase in the pension in its 100-year history, something that the opposition did not deliver and could not deliver even at the height of the last mining boom. So you did not put the money away and you did not give it to the people that needed it. As I say, it is all about priorities, and those opposite do not have a decent set of priorities to put forward to the Australian people.


We will continue to take a robust and solid approach to our budget. You will see from Treasury at each budget update that we have costed and laid out figures there to be judged. So it is laughable for those opposite to be hanging the whole of their question time discussion around this debate, because you do not have a leg to stand on. What you are putting forward is simply not credible. On the other hand, we know that Joe Hockey announced his $70 billion budget crater on breakfast television, not in audited reports or in budget figures. His so-called auditors were found to be in breach of professional standards, and he still refuses to explain how he would fund any policies, except for the explanation that the company tax rate would indeed be jacked up. So I think that this question time the coalition have squandered their questions merely because they continue to go backwards.

Investment about this $120 billion black hole is very important, and we are learning a lot about investments today.

  It is her point of order I am talking on, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I would say Senator Williams is directly on the point of the investment question that was asked of this minister. The fact that she did not answer it does not mean it was not asked.




Senator Wong:
  On the point of order, there was no question on investment.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You can't have two goes on the same point of order!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Williams, this is a session in which we take note of the answers given at question time, so I am going to remind you to direct your remarks to the questions that were given at question time.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I could not agree with you more. We are taking notice of all the questions today, and there were questions on the $120 billion black hole that Senator Wong, I am sure, agrees with. She referred to investments when she answered a question—or made out to answer the question—of my colleague Senator Cormann. I am saying about investments, in plugging that black hole, and there is a lot of money there to be invested in the Future Fund that was put there by the Howard government. I am saying the places you could invest that to get a better return might be companies like Energy Resources of Australia, a uranium-producing company that must be so good since Senator Rhiannon from the Greens actually invested in that company.




Senator Siewert:
  I rise on a point of order. This is not relevant to the debate, and you are just trying to blacken the name of Senator Rhiannon. No wonder we have so many Nats in here today: it's so they can all see you make a fool of yourself!




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, you will understand from the rulings of the President when Senator Conroy keeps talking about Mr Turnbull's investment and the President never takes any of that point of order raised. Senator Williams is quite within his right to continue the way he is.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I have given my response, and that is that, Senator Williams, I am going to ask you to keep your comments directly relevant to the answers that were provided in question time today.




Senator Abetz:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I invite you to take that ruling to the President for consideration. The successive rulings of the Deputy President in relation to taking note of answers is the acceptance that it is a wide, broad-ranging debate, especially in circumstances like the debate today, where it is in relation to every single question asked by the opposition—which, of course, included one question that actually named Senator Lee Rhiannon as well.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, Senator Rhiannon's name was mentioned today, but it was not in the context of ERA. I have said time and time again and will repeat if you like: Senator Williams, your comments need to be related to the questions that were asked today and the answers that were given today. Otherwise, there are other times in the Senate where you can provide a response and a speech along the lines you are suggesting today. I ask you in the 2½ minutes that are remaining to be mindful of the questions that were asked and the answers that were given today. That is what you are taking note of.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I want to bring a point about this black hole today. One of the things we have seen from this government is that, because of this sovereign risk, we are not now seeing the Olympic Dam uranium mine proceed in South Australia. If that mine had proceeded, people would be employed, they would pay tax and that would help build some of the $120 billion hole that this government is facing. But the Australian Greens would shut down South Australia's signature economic project, the Olympic Dam uranium mine, if given the chance. That is the point I am making about where the investment is going.


Senator Rhiannon, as I have said, invests in a uranium-producing company; however, the Greens want to shut down a project in South Australia that could help fill the budget black hole that this government faces.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I can't believe it!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take your interjection. There will be many people who cannot believe this, but that is what has happened here. It has been revealed—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  That can't be on her register of interests.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It is on her register of interests. There it is if you want to look at it. The point I make is that, when it comes to filling this black hole, we know what this government is made up of. It is made up of the Greens, the Australian Labor Party—sorry, Senator Madigan; I almost said the Labor Party—and a couple of Independents. We are now getting closed down projects like Olympic Dam in South Australia, which will no doubt have a distinct effect on the budget revenues for the government in export revenue and profits, where they pay company tax. And part of that government alliance—the Greens—would shut down Olympic Dam tomorrow if it got going. Sadly, it has not got going. It has been put on ice.


So it is quite ironic that we have people wanting to shut down Olympic Dam, it is not kicking off because of lack of faith in this government and Greens senators actually have shares in companies that produce uranium despite their hatred for uranium. The irony is simply amazing.




Senator Cormann:
  Hypocrisy.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will take your interjection. Yesterday we heard 'hypocrisy' from a male Greens senator in reference to Senator Sinodinos. He called him a hypocrite—not a very nice thing to say. Of course, I would not say that this is hypocrisy—well, I suppose it is, yes. (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:21):  It is a bit rich, I think, for the opposition senators to start talking about budget black holes on the government's side which are clearly hypothetical and speculative, not confirmed or based on fact, when they have very much a confirmed $70 billion black hole. They stand for a $70 billion black hole, cuts to services and cuts to jobs. This was confirmed by Joe Hockey and Andrew Robb. It is a bit rich of them to come in here and start talking about black holes and also for Senator Williams to go on some tangent when he should know very clearly by now the standing orders in this place. If not, I suggest to him, as someone who is still relatively new to this place, to read his Odgers', which he would have received, as we all did when we started as new senators in this place, so as to understand the standing orders during taking note of answers. We have to be relevant to the questions from question time which we are taking note of. Even I know that much. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. On your ruling, this senator is now talking about Senator Williams and something he may or may not have done. That was not the subject of any of the questions at question time today. On your ruling, you will tell this senator to move on to the debate before the chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  It is not a point of order, Senator Macdonald. Senator Singh is well aware of what this half an hour is for during the Senate time, and she is taking note of the answers to questions.




Senator SINGH:
  That Senator Williams's contribution to take note focused in part on this new rhetoric coming from senators opposite about a black hole is incredibly rich at a time when they have confirmed a $70 billion black hole on their side.—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  And growing.




Senator SINGH:
  And growing indeed. We all know exactly what that means. I think Senator Payne, who talked about the importance of housing and the growth in housing, needs to have a little reflection on that and what it would mean in terms of a $70 billion black hole and also on the fact of what occurred in housing under the federal Liberal government. The federal Liberal Party ripped $3.1 billion out of the housing budget. It actually voted against the building of 20,000 new homes the last time it had the chance to support affordable housing. I am sure that Senator Payne is a champion of housing. I am sure that she has some concern about the need for social housing, as we very much do on this side. It is why we have implemented a number of policies in relation to social housing. If that is her personal concern, she needs to understand that she is in the wrong party, because the party she is in, as I said, ripped $3.1 billion out of social housing and voted down the creation of 20,000 new homes the last time it had the chance to support social housing. In contrast, our record when it comes to the housing portfolio is a very proud one. It is a proud record of helping to deliver affordable housing to Australian families.


At the broad level, our economic management has delivered a budget into surplus, kept unemployment low, helped to contain inflation and enabled the RBA to keep interest rates low. The current standard variable interest rate for the major banks is at 6.82 per cent—well below what it was when the Liberals left office. Of course, that means more money in the pockets of Australian families. Families are now saving around $4,000 a year on a $300,000 home loan compared to November 2007. Since coming to office, the government has also directly contributed to the construction of one in every 20 new homes through programs like the $6 billion investment in social housing and the $4.5 billion investment in the National Rental Affordability Scheme—a scheme that has really benefited a number of low-income Tasmanians in my home state. In fact, in the long-term, the government has committed to providing 50,000 new more affordable rental homes through the NRAS by 30 June 2016.


So our record is very strong when it comes to social housing, because that is what Labor governments do. They support those in need. They support those low-income Australians who need support to get into the housing market and who need support to get into an affordable rental market. We support Australians who need support through all kinds of social housing; hence, the breadth of our housing portfolio—something that was completely destroyed during the time the Liberal Party were in office, and it is something that Senator Payne needs to reflect upon.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:26):  In the answers to these questions today we have seen another example of Labor's lack of credibility on fiscal matters being reflected in their lack of charity and in their lack of honesty. The simple point is that no-one believes this government on fiscal matters and, in particular, no-one believes it when it attacks the previous government, because the fiscal scoreboard says it all. When this government came to office, $96 billion in debt had been paid off—and more than $80 billion of it had been run up under the previous Labor government. There was $70 billion in the Future Fund—money that has been put aside for the public sector superannuation liabilities run up under governments over 30 years. And there was a surplus of more than $20 million that Labor could bank in their first year. All of this was the result of the policies of the previous government.


The point to be made about Labor's lack of charity is that the previous government and the previous Prime Minister and Treasurer, John Howard and Peter Costello, always gave credit to the Hawke government for some of its measures in liberalising Australia's economy. They always gave it credit for cutting tariffs and deregulating the financial markets, and they always pointed out that those measures were supported by the coalition and by the Liberal Party at the time, particularly under John Howard's leadership. But we never get such charity, we never get such intellectual honesty, from the Labor Party, because in a desperate desire to somehow construct some credibility they must tear down the record of others.


But the fiscal scoreboard is honest. The fiscal scoreboard actually outlines the numbers this government inherited and it tells us where they have taken us now. I am not surprised, after having spent a few years here, that the Labor Party oppose measures to balance the budget. They particularly seem to be focused at the moment on opposing those measures at the state level, where state coalition governments have come to office in order to clean up the messes left by Labor governments. The reason Labor must oppose measures to balance budgets is that I do not think they ever do it. The record of Labor at a federal level and at a state level is one of debt, one of deficit, one of deferring hard times to future generations and one of leaving a mess for others to clean up.


I have seen the confected outrage from the other side, talking about how there are public sector jobs going in certain states. But why do I see no outrage about the 50 jobs that Labor is trying to abolish at the moment—the 50 jobs for the people who were going to work on the Abel Tasman—or about the people who are losing their jobs because of the carbon tax? We never, ever hear Labor being upset about those jobs. We only hear the ALP being upset about public sector jobs. I have to ask myself: is it because the people working on the Abel Tasman are not union members? Is it because they are not organised and cannot march down a street in colourful T-shirts—they do not present a pretty picture for television? But we never, ever hear the outrage over people like that, in this case long-term unemployed people, losing their jobs.


We only hear confected outrage from the Labor Party about public servants losing their jobs.


This government has no credibility when it comes to financial matters. It has been using the global financial crisis that was severe but did not hit Australia as hard as it did other places. There were multiple reasons it did not hit Australia as hard as other places. There was confidence in our fiscal situation, a situation this government inherited; there were solid regulations of banks and financial institutions that meant they did not get themselves into trouble as those in Europe and North America did; and there was demand for our resources, so our terms of trade were going through. But this government still uses the global financial crisis as a veil behind which to hide it its irresponsibility. This government wasted billions on a crisis that did not hit our shores as hard. The number of jobs that Labor claimed they were going to create were suddenly jobs that had been saved, but no evidence whatsoever has ever been produced to demonstrate that.


The second $42 billion stimulus package stands particularly condemned for being some of the greatest waste that this government and country have ever seen. We saw waste in pink batts and school halls and we saw the misdirection of funds, with dead people receiving $900 cheques from the government. The government compounded the problem by not listening and not withdrawing the stimulus earlier when it became obvious to everyone that it was not needed in our economy and was overheating it. This is to say nothing about the fact that there is still a great question about whether such stimulus packages even work. Whether or not we can stimulate an economy by removing or borrowing money and simply spraying it around is still a question that has not been established. The evidence of what is happening around the rest of the world today says that. This is a government whose history and record demonstrate fiscal incompetence. And taxes will eventually go up under this government; it is just a question of when.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (15:32): I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Lundy, in question time today relating to the government's assurances to the Foreign Minister of Nauru. 


The Foreign Minister of Nauru said clearly on the record this week that Nauru would not be prepared to be accepting asylum seekers and refugees in their country where the removal was done by force. The Nauruan government has asked the Australian government for assurance that force would not be used. We have just heard in the response from Minister Lundy that the government is more than prepared to use force to remove refugees and to deport them to Nauru once they have already arrived on Christmas Island or indeed anywhere on the Australian mainland.


It is clear that the Australian government have simply thumbed their nose at the request of the Nauru government to not use force. They are more than prepared to see force used and have justified it because the act that this government and the coalition rushed through this parliament only three weeks ago allows for 'reasonable and necessary force' to be used. The question that I had to Minister Lundy was: what constitutes reasonable and necessary force? I think it is an absolutely fair question, particularly when the country that we are sending these people to have said they do not want forced to be used—full stop!


So what is necessary and reasonable force? I question whether there is any force that is reasonable and necessary to remove a child from a detention centre on Christmas Island to a detention centre in Nauru. I question whether there is any force that is reasonable or necessary to remove a child who is a refugee and has fled war, torture and persecution. What type of necessary and reasonable force could there possibly be for a country like Australia, that is meant to abide by basic standards of humanity, when it comes to dealing with the world's most vulnerable people, refugee children? What type of force could possibly be reasonable to use against those children or the pregnant women currently being held in Darwin who have been told by the immigration department that they will be going to Nauru? What necessary and reasonable force will be used against pregnant women who resist boarding the plane, knowing that their fate at the end of that plane journey is going to be indefinite detention?


The government cannot even tell us how long these people are going to be left in this prison camp in Nauru. They cannot tell us how they are going to get there, what force is necessary, what force is reasonable and then how long these people are even going to be there. In fact, the government cannot even answer and will not answer who will be processing the claims of these refugees. Is the Nauru government going to be making the assessments as to who is a refugee and who is not? Or is it the Australian government who is going to be making the assessments? There are absolutely no answers from the government or the representing minister to any of these questions.


It staggers me that here in the parliament of Australia—a modern country; a country where we have signed the refugee convention and we pride ourselves on looking after each other properly; a country where we have basic standards about how we treat those who are vulnerable—in answer to a question as to whether a foreign country has asked for an assurance that we will not use force against refugees, our minister confirms, 'Oh well, we will be, because as long as it is necessary and reasonable it is all okay.' I do not believe any force used against people, including women and children, who have fled war, can ever be justified as reasonable and necessary.


Question agreed to.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:39):  I present two government responses to committee reports as listed at item 14 on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Australian Government Response to Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report on The Regulatory Standards for the Approval of Medical Devices in Australia





August 2012





Government response to recommendations





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration make a list of the devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods publicly available.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) is a publicly searchable data base which includes all medical devices currently approved for supply in Australia. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is currently working to improve the searchability of the ARTG.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing fully implement Recommendation 8c of the Health Technology Assessment Review regarding the need for increased rigour of regulatory assessment of higher-risk medical devices.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration has consulted publicly on proposals to increase the rigour of regulatory assessment for higher risk medical devices. 


Some reforms will be in place before the end of the calendar year, but the Government notes that timing and approach depends on the completion of the appropriate assessment of any potential regulatory and cost recovery effects, including on patients and the Australian medical device industry.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the level of assessment of Class III medical devices be increased.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees to consult further with affected stakeholders on this  recommendation.


The Government recognises that greater regulatory rigour for high risk, Class III medical devices would allow further evidential review prior to market entry for these devices.


International harmonisation is a critical element in medical device regulation. This harmonisation allows access for Australian patients to the best devices available around the world and avoids costly repetition for industry seeking to enter the market. As such, the Government believes that any increase to the level of assessment of Class III medical devices will be best achieved in harmony with international counterpart regulators.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has begun consultation with key stakeholders in Australia in relation to increasing this assessment. Further consultation with the international community may be required to identify the most appropriate approach. The Government has instructed the TGA to continue this dialogue. It is important to note that any change in pre-market regulation would need to consider the increase in the level of mitigation of risks to patients' safety, as well as the impacts on the Australian medical device industry and on patients' access to medical technologies. The TGA will be required to undertake consultation with domestic stakeholders on any proposed changes to increase assessment, including developing a Regulatory Impact Statement if required.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration investigate whether allowing an increasing number of medical devices onto the Australian market actually improves clinical outcomes; and whether a more judicious approach could improve pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance of higher risk medical devices, for the ultimate benefit of patients.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the intent of the recommendation, to improve the quality of medical devices available in the Australian market place, by continuing to refine requirements for pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance. 


The TGA has no legal power to limit the number of applications made for inclusion of medical devices in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Medical devices included in the ARTG are required to comply with standardised criteria for quality, safety and performance under the Therapeutic Goods legislation. 


Further responses on pre-market assessment are provided in relation to recommendations 2 and 3. A further response on post-market surveillance is provided in relation to recommendation 7.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration continue to consult widely with stakeholders, including consumer health organisations, on the amended proposals related to third party conformity assessment; and weigh carefully considerations of the advantages of streamlined international regulatory frameworks and patient safety.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The TGA will conduct consultation with all stakeholders on the details of any specific proposals to implement third party conformity assessments and will develop a Regulatory Impact Statement, if required.


The Government notes that recent events have raised questions relating to the current framework governing the use of third party conformity assessments bodies overseas. 


The European Commission has announced that it will review the current structure for third party conformity assessment in the European Union (EU) with a view to making amendments and the possible introduction of an accreditation process for notified bodies.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will monitor developments in Europe with a view to identifying the most appropriate arrangements for Australia which adequately balance the advantages of streamlined international regulatory frameworks and patient safety. 


In order to provide certainty for all stakeholders, the Government commits to expedite its considerations, subject to regulatory developments in the EU. 




Recommendation 6 



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration continue its prudent approach to the regulation of reprocessed single-use medical devices, with due consideration for issues of informed patient consent and the need for suitable mechanisms to enable tracing of remanufactured medical devices in the case of adverse events.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation. 


Current approach to regulation


The Australian regulatory framework for medical devices is designed to ensure that the reprocessing of devices that were not originally intended for reprocessing does not compromise the safety and effectiveness of the device. Under these regulatory controls, the reprocessing facility is regulated as a manufacturer, and is required to demonstrate that the reprocessed device is equivalent to the original and will continue to perform without additional risk to the patient. 


Informed patient consent


The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) is responsible for all matters relating to the regulation of medical practitioners in Australia. It has produced Good medical practice: A code of conduct for doctors in Australia which provides guidance to medical practitioners on a range of matters including issues about informed patient consent. 


The Government notes that the National Health and Medical Research Council has published General Guidelines for Medical Practitioners on Providing Information to Patients (2004). These guidelines recommend that doctors provide information to patients about the risks of any interventions, especially those likely to influence patients' decisions. 


The Government undertakes to refer the issue of patient consent, in the context of reprocessed single-use medical devices, to the relevant National Boards and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). 


Tracing of remanufactured medical devices


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has established regulatory guidelines for remanufactured medical devices, requiring compliance with the post-market requirements, such as reporting adverse events to the TGA associated with the use of the device, tracking the number of times the device is remanufactured and reused, tracing the device to the batch/serial number of the original device and recording to whom the device was supplied in case of recall or other regulatory action (Australian regulatory guidelines for medical devices 2007).




Recommendation 7 



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing implements Recommendations 13, 14, and 15 of the Health Technology Assessment Review in a timely manner. These recommendations address the need for improved post-market surveillance by increasing the rate of reporting of adverse events, including by health service providers and consumers; facilitating the expansion and use of post-market surveillance data to inform safety, effectiveness and reimbursement decisions; and establishing further clinical registers for high risk implantable devices and procedures.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation in principle.


Recommendation 13 of the Health Technology Assessment Review (HTA Review) states that in order to improve the contribution of post-market surveillance to patient safety, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) take steps to increase the rate of reporting of adverse events, including by health service providers. The Government's response to this is set out in the response to recommendation 8 of this inquiry (below).


Recommendation 14 of the HTA Review states that, in order to improve the contribution of post-market surveillance to the sustainability of the health system and the longer term regulatory efficiency of HTA Review processes, the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) explore options for consideration by Government in 2011 to facilitate the expansion and use of post-market surveillance data to inform safety, effectiveness and reimbursement decisions for devices and procedures. 


The Government supports the expanded use of post-market surveillance data from adverse event reporting in assessing the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. As set out in the response to recommendation 8 below, the Government will seek to improve the reporting of adverse events by health practitioners and the general public in order to provide greater data relating to the devices in use in Australia. In addition, the TGA will provide reports of adverse events, as well as any relevant conditions the TGA imposes on a sponsor in order to register their device (including the provision of post-market data), to the TGA's newly established Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD). The ACMD will use this data as part of its post-market monitoring responsibilities. 


The TGA will inform the Prostheses List Advisory Committee, through the Department, when a prosthesis is withdrawn from the ARTG, so that the Government may receive timely advice on any consequent changes to private health insurance reimbursement arrangements for that device. 


The Government announced in the 2012-13 Budget that it will remove joint replacement prostheses with evidence of higher than acceptable revision rates from the Prostheses List, so that private health insurers are no longer required to pay benefits for those prosthetics. 


Recommendation 15 of the HTA Review is that registers for high risk implantable medical devices and/or procedures be established.


The Government supports the development of clinical registers for high risk implantable medical devices and has to date supported the establishment of the National Joint Replacement Registry. 


The Government will continue to work with industry and medical groups to identify the most effective ways to track the use and performance of high risk implantable medical devices, balancing benefits and costs to patients, providers and the wider community.


As part of this process, the Government is also currently considering funding options for the establishment of these registers, including the feasibility of the use of cost recovery from industry through the TGA cost recovery arrangements.


The Government further undertakes to review the communication and reporting links between existing registries/registers, the TGA and the Department. 




Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration put in place mechanisms to educate and encourage doctors to report adverse incidents associated with the use of medical devices. The committee further recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing introduce mandatory reporting for health practitioners to the Therapeutic Goods Administration on relevant issues, in certain circumstances including problems with medical devices.




Response
:



The Australian Government agrees that adverse event reporting by medical practitioners is a vital component of a comprehensive system of post-market surveillance, and in that context, commits to the following course of action. 


The Government has recognised that further work is required to encourage greater reporting of adverse events from therapeutic goods (including medical devices). As announced in TGA Reforms: A Blueprint for the Future on 8 December 2011, the Australian Government has agreed to implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the Transparency Review: to more effectively facilitate the recognition and reporting of adverse events by health practitioners and consumers, and promote the adverse event reporting system; and to make the Adverse Events Database available to, and searchable by, the public in a manner that promotes the quality use of therapeutic goods. In this context, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will investigate ways to upgrade the value of individual clinician input and subsequent information exchange. 


The TGA has included additional information on its website on reporting adverse events and published a brochure outlining ways to report an adverse event. This brochure is being disseminated at conferences and other venues where it will reach healthcare professionals. An online reporting form for adverse event reporting for medical devices was made available on the TGA website from mid-March 2012. The Government also undertakes to draw this recommendation to the attention of medical educators and organisations funded to provide training and support to medical practitioners.


On the matter of mandatory reporting for health practitioners on problems with medical devices, the Government undertakes to raise this matter with the Medical Board of Australia (Board) which is responsible for the regulation of medical practitioners. The Government notes that any changes to standards set by the Board, or to codes and guidelines produced by the Board, are subject to requirements set out in legislation, including consultation and, in the case of changes to registration or accreditation standards, the agreement of the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council. 


The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) will work with the states and territories to identify opportunities to coordinate adverse event reporting currently required in the public hospital sector in each jurisdiction. The Department will also work with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care to investigate the Commission's capacity to provide safety oversight of the use of therapeutic devices through the development of standards and indicators. 




Recommendation 9



The committee recommends that the Government implements the Recommendations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration Transparency Review in a timely manner.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The Government announced its response to the recommendations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration Transparency Review on 8 December 2011. An implementation plan for the actions agreed in the report TGA Reforms: a Blueprint for the TGA's Future became available in July 2012.




Recommendation 10



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration consider simultaneously allocating or aligning the great variety of codes used to identify medical devices, in order to facilitate more efficient regulation and more rapid identification of devices when problems occur.




Recommendation 11



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing consider a mechanism for flagging billing codes in order to identify devices subject to an alert or recall; as well as a consequent adjustment to benefits paid, based on industry feedback as to the performance of the device.




Combined Response:  



The Australian Government notes recommendations 10 and 11. 


There are practical challenges in simultaneously allocating codes. Catalogue numbers are established by industry internationally, and Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) and Prostheses List billing codes are allocated through consecutive approval steps. Market approval can occur in advance of any decision to reimburse, and many devices are never considered for reimbursement. To delay the allocation of an ARTG number until a billing code for private health insurance purposes was granted, would unduly delay the availability of the product onto the Australian market. 


Nevertheless, the Government acknowledges that better integration and alignment of identifiers can assist post-market surveillance and device identification when problems occur. A new database is under development to support Prostheses Listing arrangements which will allow the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) to link catalogue numbers with billing codes to assist with identification of specific products. This work is scheduled for completion by the end of 2012. 


The Department and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) are also liaising with the National E-Health Transition Authority on scope to link its National Product Catalogue to billing codes and ARTG numbers to assist identification of devices.


In relation to benefit setting, the Department is implementing recommendation 12 (b-e) of the Health Technology Assessment Review in Australia (HTA Review), to refine grouping schemes and develop single group benefits for clinically similar products on the Prostheses List. Once this work is completed, the Department, with advice from its expert and advisory committees, will review benefit setting arrangements into the future. 




Recommendation 12



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration consider whether custom made dental devices are adequately regulated; and whether the approach used in the United Kingdom of requiring a statement of manufacture to be provided to patients, and retained by the dental practitioner, has merit.




Response:  



The Australian Government notes the recommendation. 


Custom made dental devices are not required to be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. However, there are a number of requirements that must be met. 


The therapeutic goods legislation requires that the importers of custom made dental devices hold certain information about the device including information identifying the manufacturer, the device and any special characteristics of the device. 


The Australian Government will consult with the Dental Board of Australia on this recommendation, as the governing body with the authority to regulate the dental profession.




Recommendation 13



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Good Administration carry out an investigation to ascertain whether importation of medical devices via the internet is adequately regulated.




Response:  



The Australia Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will continue to work with all stakeholders to examine evidence in relation to the adequacy of existing arrangements for the importation of medical devices. 


Under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 and the Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices) Regulations 2002, therapeutic goods are required to be approved and included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be supplied unless there is an exemption. 


It is illegal to import commercial quantities of therapeutic goods into Australia without the goods being entered onto the ARTG. This applies even if the importer is a healthcare provider. If products are imported for on-sale, including for use within a professional practice, they would need to be appropriately entered onto the ARTG by the importer who would be recognised as the sponsor of the product. The importer would need to meet the appropriate responsibilities of a sponsor as set out in the legislation. Therapeutic goods imported directly from international websites and not entered in the ARTG may not meet the standards of quality, safety or efficacy prescribed by the therapeutic goods legislation. Registered health practitioners who import directly need to be aware how their sponsor responsibilities interact with their professional responsibilities for registration within their relevant sector.


It is possible for individuals to import therapeutic goods into Australia for their own personal use (www.tga.gov.au/pdf/access-personal-import-guidelines.pdf). Such importation is subject to various conditions and it is the responsibility of individuals wishing to import unapproved therapeutic goods for their own use to ensure they have complied with all relevant Commonwealth and state/or territory laws. If care is not taken, consumers may inadvertently break the law, waste their money, or risk their health.


The potential consequence of the importation of medical devices via the internet is limited as private health insurance and Medicare benefits are only payable for medical devices purchased and used with professional services rendered within Australia. Consumers and health professionals are likely to choose devices for which benefits are payable.


From time to time, in the course of routine surveillance activity, the TGA becomes aware that Australian consumers may have purchased potentially dangerous therapeutic goods from overseas sources via mail-order or the internet. In these cases the TGA will issue a safety alert via its website advising consumers to cease using the goods and to consult a healthcare practitioner if there are any health concerns.




Recommendation 14



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration, in consultation with the National Joint Replacement Registry, investigate ways in which information provided by the National Joint Replacement Registry can be used and responded to in a more timely way for the benefit of patients, and to inform future evidence based decision making on the listing of prostheses on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation. 




Recommendation 15



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing prepare, as a matter of priority, a comprehensive communications strategy to inform medical practitioners, patients and the general public about the issues associated with De Puy hip and hip resurfacing devices as well as options for treatment, obtaining further information, and reporting adverse outcomes. The committee further recommends that such a strategy be implemented as a standard process for any future adverse event reporting.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation in principle.


The communications strategy


In announcing TGA reforms: a blueprint for TGA's future, the Government has agreed to implement the recommendations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Transparency Review which will make further information available to medical practitioners and the public where any issues arise associated with therapeutic goods, including adverse outcomes and recalls. 


The Government notes that the device sponsors, Johnson & Johnson Medical, working closely with the TGA and the Australian Orthopedic Association (AOA), have put in a place a communications strategy to inform medical practitioners about the issues associated with De Puy hip and hip resurfacing devices. 


Information for the general public and patients has also been published on the TGA website: http://www.tga.gov.au/newsroom/btn-dupuy-recall.htm#patients. The Government notes that patients who suspect that they may have side effects related to their hip replacement surgery were advised to contact their surgeon for further clinical review as appropriate. In addition, following recall of the DePuy ASR implant, the TGA worked with DePuy and the AOA to ensure that all Australian orthopaedic surgeons were aware of the recall and appropriate advice was available to be provided to patients. 


Communication between health practitioners and patients


The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) is responsible for all matters relating to the regulation of medical practitioners in Australia. It has produced Good medical practice: A code of conduct for doctors in Australia which provides guidance to medical practitioners on a range of matters including issues about provision of information to patients. 


The Government undertakes to bring to the attention of the MBA and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency the need to ensure that surgeons are communicating any emerging concerns relating to medical devices to patients in a timely manner, including options for treatment. 


Standard processes


The Department has standard procedures in place to respond to health crises and issues management, including development of appropriate communication strategies. These strategies are tailored to the specific situation as each issue is different and the response required can differ significantly. 


Nevertheless, the Department and the TGA will undertake to review the efficiency, timeliness and comprehensiveness of standard processes to communicate with consumers and clinicians in the event of major recalls of implantable medical devices that may have public health consequences.




Recommendation 16



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing, as a matter of urgency, consider the best way of establishing a process for monitoring the levels of cobalt, chromium, and other toxic metals; and any possible health effects, in all patients who have received metal-on-metal hip replacements.




Response:  



The Australian Government notes the recommendation and will continue to monitor the emergence of evidence on the need for, and most effective approaches to, monitoring effects of metal levels associated with metal-on-metal hip replacements.


The TGA, in consultation with the AOA, has developed advice for healthcare professionals and patients regarding De Puy's ASR metal-on-metal hips. The AOA has notified orthopaedic surgeons of the issues and they have been advised to contact patients implanted with an ASR hip replacement system to arrange assessment and regular follow-up. Surgeons have been advised to follow patients closely, including annual review, for at least five years following surgery. 


Currently, the health effects of increased blood metal levels are uncertain. Moreover, the effectiveness of monitoring blood metal levels to identify suspected problems with metal-on-metal hips has not been established, and such results are generally considered in the context of other clinical findings. The type of monitoring should be determined on a case-by-case basis following a detailed consideration of each patient's circumstances by their surgeon. This may involve diagnostic imaging and blood tests as determined by the treating surgeon in consultation with each individual patient. Chromium testing is reimbursed under the Medicare Benefits Schedule. 




Recommendation 17



The committee recommends that the Government consider the best mechanism for initiating and advancing research on the health effects of cobalt, chromium, and other toxic metals, on the human body. The committee also recommends that consideration be given to ensuring adequate funding for that research is made available.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation in principle.


Australia is participating in a world wide study of patients who have received the ASR Hip. This study will be the largest of its kind in determining the relevance, extent and impact of raised metal ion levels, in patients who have had hip surgery using the ASR prostheses. 


The Department of Health and Ageing and the Therapeutic Goods Administration are also having ongoing discussions with the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry about ways in which the registry may assist in assessing the outcomes for patients who have received other metal-on-metal hip replacement and any potential for ongoing medical problems.


In addition, as the Government's peak funding body for health and medical research, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) invests in research through a variety of funding mechanisms including investigator-initiated research projects and clinical trials, broad programs of research, training awards for scholars and postdoctoral fellows, career research fellowships and special strategic research programs. The majority of these schemes operate according to annual funding rounds and the details of opening and closing dates are available on the NHMRC website. 


Investigator-initiated research proposals into the health effects of cobalt, chromium, and other toxic metals on the human body will be considered as part of annual funding rounds. These funding schemes are highly competitive with each application considered on its merits through a rigorous peer review process. 




Recommendation 18



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing undertake further work to address the issue of inducements paid by pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers to doctors and teaching hospitals, in line with the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 in the United States. The definition of inducements should include a commercial interest in a company or device; any cash payments or discounts offered to medical practitioners; and any other gifts provided to medical practitioners.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation in principle but notes that a legislative framework for ethical conduct of industry in the promotion of therapeutic goods to healthcare professions is not warranted in the Australian context at this time.


The Government is committed to achieving a level playing field in this area. Recognising the need for improvement, the Government established an industry-led working group in 2010 to examine the issues around promotion of therapeutic goods and opportunities to strengthen the current self-regulatory arrangements.


The Government announced its response to the working group's recommendations as part of the TGA reforms: a blueprint for TGA's future. In this response the Government gave strong support to industry's initiative to harmonise their codes of conduct to incorporate the high level principles agreed to by the Working Group. Robust and consistent codes of conduct are a powerful first step in strengthening oversight of the relationship between therapeutic goods companies and healthcare professionals. 


As part of the 2012-13 Budget, the Government will provide $1.4 million over four years to further assist industry to respond to the Working Group's recommendations. The resources provided through this measure will support stronger self-regulation, better communication and shared systems for complaints reporting. 


The Government will work with industry to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and consider the need to provide further support, or changes to the current self-regulated arrangements if the therapeutic goods industry requires greater encouragement to achieve universal adherence to consistent, high ethical standards. The Government notes that a legislative framework for ethical conduct of industry in the promotion of therapeutic goods to healthcare professionals is not warranted in the Australian context at this time. 


In relation to standards for ethical conduct of healthcare professionals, the Australian Government undertakes to bring the recommendation to the notice of the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council, and to refer the recommendation to the relevant National Boards and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.


The Government has also been working with its partners in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to develop and endorse principles to guide business ethics in the medical device and pharmaceutical sectors. These principles clearly set out expectations for companies operating within APEC economies in regard to ethical behaviour and identify activities that are inappropriate influences and inducements. 




Amended recommendations



The Australian Government notes the proposed timeframes and additional considerations proposed by Senator Xenophon and has considered and responded to these matters in the main recommendations. 


 




Response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report





THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF RURAL WIND FARMS





JULY 2012





Introduction



On 27 October 2010, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee (the Committee) was established to consider the social and economic impact of rural wind farms, and in particular:


any adverse health effects for people living in close proximity to wind farms;


concerns over the excessive noise and vibrations emitted by wind farms, which are in close proximity to people’s homes;


the impact of rural wind farms on property values, employment opportunities and farm income;


the interface between Commonwealth, state and local planning laws as they pertain to wind farms; and


any other relevant matters.


The Committee received more than 1000 submissions, many letters and other documents, and had access to much published information.  Public hearings and site visits were held in various capital cities and regional areas.


The Committee tabled its report, The Social and Economic Impact of Rural Wind Farms in parliament on 23 June 2011 making seven recommendations.


The Australian Government welcomes the Committee’s report and thanks the Committee for its considered approach to the recommendations made in the report.


Some of the Committee’s recommendations are directed to state and territory governments, local authorities and professional bodies.  The Australian Government encourages those agencies to respond positively to the recommendations.


The Government recognises that this Senate Committee report has captured a range of issues for many individuals and the wider Australian community with regard to wind farms.  These include noise, health effects, planning laws, property values, employment and farm income.  The Government also recognises that in order to meet the legislated Renewable Energy Target of 20 percent by the year 2020, the number of wind farms can be expected to increase significantly in the next few years.


The Department of Health and Ageing has led the coordination of the whole of government response to the Senate Inquiry.  Input to the response was provided by agencies within this department and by the departments of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPC) and Resources, Energy and Tourism (DRET) where recommendations relate to their respective portfolios.




Government Response to Recommendations



The Australian Government recognises that while the Senate Committee report has captured a range of issues for many individuals and the wider Australian community, there is no strong evidence either way as to the impact of wind farms on the health of Australians.


The lack of evidence therefore makes it difficult for the Government to determine what course of action to take, if any.  The Government recognises it has responsibility for consideration of recommendations four, five, six and seven and these are addressed further in the response.  As for the remaining recommendations, these are areas that lie outside of the Government’s responsibility and should be considered by relevant state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.




Recommendation 1



2.44 The Committee considers that the noise standards adopted by the states and territories for the planning and operation of rural wind farms should include appropriate measures to calculate the impact of low frequency noise and vibrations indoors at impacted dwellings.




Response:



This is a matter for consideration by state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.




Recommendation 2



2.58  The Committee recommends that the responsible authorities should ensure that complaints are dealt with expeditiously and that the complaints processes should involve an independent arbitrator.  State and local government agencies responsible for ensuring compliance with planning permissions should be adequately resourced for this activity.




Response:



The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, but notes that it is a matter for consideration by state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.


It is also important to note the level of complaints about wind turbines and wind farm projects can be aligned with a lack of effective community consultation in the planning and development stages.  As highlighted in the Australian Psychological Society’s submission and in the Committee’s report, early consultation with the community could improve community understanding of wind turbines and could therefore reduce community anxiety and complaints.  In the Committee’s report, it is acknowledged that research on the societal acceptance of wind farms is currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.


It is also noted that the draft National Wind Farm Development Guidelines July 2010 (the draft Guidelines), produced by the former Environment Protection and Heritage Council of Australia and New Zealand, provides extensive advice on how to conduct community consultation.  The draft Guidelines remain a valuable reference document for industry and planning authorities and may assist effective community consultation and possibly reduce complaints.




Recommendation 3



2.69 The Committee recommends that further consideration be given to the development of policy on separation criteria between residences and wind farm facilities.




Response:



This is a matter for consideration by state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.




Recommendation 4



2.101 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government initiate as a matter of priority thorough, adequately resourced epidemiological and laboratory studies of the possible effects of wind farms on human health.  This research must engage across industry and community, and include an advisory process representing the range of interests and concerns.




Recommendation 5



2.102 The Committee recommends that the NHMRC review of research should continue, with regular publication.




Recommendation 6



2.103 The Committee recommends that the National Acoustics Laboratories conduct a study and assessment of noise impacts of wind farms, including the impacts of infrasound.




Response:



The Australian Government accepts these recommendations in principle.


The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is already actively engaged in supporting the assessment of available research on this issue and will shortly commission a comprehensive review of the literature to inform any update to its 2010 public statement.  The review will include audible noise, infrasound and low-frequency noise.  A reference group will be established to advise on the review and will include members of the public, industry, researchers, sound engineers/consultants and planning representatives.


The results of the literature review and the revised public statement will be published on the NHMRC website.


Further, there are a range of funding mechanisms within the Australian Government, in particular within the NHMRC, that could be used to fund additional research on the possible impacts of wind farms on human health, including epidemiological and laboratory studies. 




Recommendation 7



3.99 The Committee recommends that the draft National Wind Farm Development Guidelines be redrafted to include discussion of any adverse health effects and comments made by NHMRC regarding the revision of its 2010 public statement. 




Response:



The Australian Government does not accept this recommendation.


The former Environment Protection and Heritage Council of Australia and New Zealand (EPHC) released the Guidelines in July 2010 for a twelve-month consultation period.  The draft Guidelines outlined best practice for industry and planning authorities and were not mandatory, nor did they seek to change existing jurisdictional statutory processes. 


The Australian Government understands that jurisdictions have developed, or are currently developing, planning application, assessment and approval processes within their own planning frameworks to manage community concerns about wind farm developments such as turbine noise, shadow flicker, electromagnetic interference and impacts on landscapes and wildlife.  The EPHC Standing Committee therefore has decided to cease further development of the Guidelines.  The draft Guidelines remain a valuable reference document for industry and planning authorities and may be used and reproduced for non-commercial purposes.


The Australian Government recognises the important role research will continue to play in informing state/territory planning and development approval processes.  The Australian Government would like to emphasise that the revision of the NHMRC’s 2010 public statement will depend on the outcomes of the literature review, which it will commission shortly.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,16,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:39):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents.


I wish to take note of the two responses that the government has tabled today to the two Senate Community Affairs References Committee reports. I particularly wish to take note of the government's response to the Regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia report. I will try to remember at the end of my remarks to seek leave to continue my remarks, because I am sure Senator Xenophon, who is not in the chamber at the moment, would also like to talk about this report. I chaired this inquiry and, as the chamber may recall, it was Senator Xenophon who made the referral.


We have done two inquiries into this particular issue over the past 18 months. Obviously I am pleased the government has responded, and I would like to comment on a few of the responses to our recommendations. However, I have only just seen this response. I should put on the record that I have been trying all day to get this response after I saw it on the Notice Paper. I have only just received it, which makes it hard for committee members who have worked so hard on these documents to comment. I know it will go on the Notice Paper, but obviously we would like to be able to respond in a speedy manner once the government responds to our recommendations.


The community affairs committee always seems to have references that are particularly emotional. This one was also emotional. We heard some devastating accounts from people who have suffered as a result of faulty medical devices. I am pleased—well, I am sort of pleased—to see the government's response to the committee's recommendation 2, which was about implementing recommendation 8c of the Health Technology Assessment Review. The government says that it agrees with the recommendation and that the TGA has consulted publicly on the proposals to increase the rigour of regulatory assessment for high-risk medical devices. It says:


Some reforms will be in place before the end of the calendar year—


that is good—


but the Government notes that timing and approach depends on the completion of the appropriate assessment of any potential regulatory and cost recovery effects …


The point here is that I think this might be the third time that this recommendation has been made, and people are getting a bit sick of the time delays all the time. When the affected and interested communities see this, I think they are going to be very disappointed that it looks again as if the government is buying itself time, or putting this on, when what these people want is for this recommendation to be implemented as a matter of urgency.


The government also agrees with recommendation 3—partly. I remind the chamber that recommendation 3 was about the level of assessment for class III medical devices and that the level of assessment be increased. The government's response is that it 'agrees to consult further'. Yes, I am always out there saying that you need to consult—but consult further on this? This is another issue that the community feels has been consulted on and consulted on and consulted on, and they have had enough! They want some action taken. 


So it is disappointing that the government says, 'We're going to consult further'. We have now had two Senate inquiries, saying the same thing: that we need to be looking at these class III medical devices. This is not good enough, government; you need to go back, please, and have another look. The government falls back on the fact that you have to have international harmonisation and says:


As such, the Government believes that any increase to the level of assessment of Class III medical devices will be best achieved in harmony with international counterpart regulators.


That is not what the community wants to hear. That is not what Australians want to hear. Australians want to hear that their government has heard that there are concerns here and they want more rigorous action. I urge the government to please have a look at that recommendation because it is one that the community feels very strongly about.


The committee also recommended that the TGA:


… investigate whether allowing an increasing number of medical devices onto the Australian market actually improves clinical outcomes …


We heard quite a lot of information around this, with a number of people being very critical of the numbers on there and that there is not enough pre-market assessment or post-market surveillance of the higher risk medical devices. On this one, the government said:


The Australian Government agrees with the intent of the recommendation, to improve the quality of medical devices available in the Australian market place, by continuing to refine requirements for pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance.


The government also said:


The TGA has no legal power to limit the number of applications made for inclusion …


However, I think you will find that the community will say that, if you actually do the pre-market assessment and the post-market surveillance better, it would improve the situation very significantly. The concern is that those pre- and post-market assessments have not been done.


I am pleased that the government is picking up on recommendation 5, which is 'continuing to consult with various organisations on the proposals related to third-party conformity assessments and to weigh carefully the considerations of the advantages of the streamlined international regulatory frameworks and patient safety'. The government says that it agrees with this recommendation and will conduct consultations with the various stakeholders. You can bet your bottom dollar that the affected community will be looking at that one very substantially.


The government sometimes agrees with the rest of the recommendations but then goes into an explanation about why you cannot actually do it. It seems to me that that is what they are saying. It gets even worse when they say 'agree in principle', because that means that they do not really and that they will find another way of not following through with these recommendations.


The bottom line here is that, if we do not see some changes in the way that medical devices are regulated, I am desperately afraid that we will see a recurrence of the problems we have seen just recently. We heard such emotional accounts of people's lives being absolutely devastated by some of these devices. It is a very important issue and I thank the government for responding in a fairly timely manner.


I would now like to move to the government's response to the social and economic impacts of rural wind farms, which was another substantial inquiry. I want to particularly go to the recommendation about carrying out thorough research—that is, 'A matter of priority for thorough adequate research, epidemiological and laboratory studies and the possible effects'. The government say that they accept the recommendations in principle. They say that the NHMRC is already actively engaged in supporting the assessment of the available research and that a review will include audible noise, infrasound and low-frequency noise. They say that they are looking at a literature review and, further, that there is a range of funding mechanisms within the Australian government, in particular in the NHMRC, that could be used to fund additional research.


I think the community was looking for a broader commitment from the government to actually fund some of that research and not just say that it can get funding from here. It is pleasing that the government is responding to that issue. That is the recommendation I think you will find that the community will be looking for. We need to make sure that those are thorough assessments to ensure that people are comfortable with the science and, in particular, we need to make sure that they are independent.


As I said, I am sure the community will be looking at these recommendations very carefully. I suspect that people will not be totally happy with the government's response and so I am flagging here that I expect to be hearing very shortly from people who will be looking at this recommendation and saying that they do not think it goes far enough, because there does need to be some further funding for looking into these issues. I seek leave to continue my remarks on both the government responses that have been presented.


Debate adjourned.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,16,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (15:39):  I present two government responses to committee reports as listed at item 14 on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Australian Government Response to Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report on The Regulatory Standards for the Approval of Medical Devices in Australia





August 2012





Government response to recommendations





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration make a list of the devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods publicly available.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) is a publicly searchable data base which includes all medical devices currently approved for supply in Australia. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is currently working to improve the searchability of the ARTG.




Recommendation 2



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing fully implement Recommendation 8c of the Health Technology Assessment Review regarding the need for increased rigour of regulatory assessment of higher-risk medical devices.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration has consulted publicly on proposals to increase the rigour of regulatory assessment for higher risk medical devices. 


Some reforms will be in place before the end of the calendar year, but the Government notes that timing and approach depends on the completion of the appropriate assessment of any potential regulatory and cost recovery effects, including on patients and the Australian medical device industry.




Recommendation 3



The committee recommends that the level of assessment of Class III medical devices be increased.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees to consult further with affected stakeholders on this  recommendation.


The Government recognises that greater regulatory rigour for high risk, Class III medical devices would allow further evidential review prior to market entry for these devices.


International harmonisation is a critical element in medical device regulation. This harmonisation allows access for Australian patients to the best devices available around the world and avoids costly repetition for industry seeking to enter the market. As such, the Government believes that any increase to the level of assessment of Class III medical devices will be best achieved in harmony with international counterpart regulators.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has begun consultation with key stakeholders in Australia in relation to increasing this assessment. Further consultation with the international community may be required to identify the most appropriate approach. The Government has instructed the TGA to continue this dialogue. It is important to note that any change in pre-market regulation would need to consider the increase in the level of mitigation of risks to patients' safety, as well as the impacts on the Australian medical device industry and on patients' access to medical technologies. The TGA will be required to undertake consultation with domestic stakeholders on any proposed changes to increase assessment, including developing a Regulatory Impact Statement if required.




Recommendation 4



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration investigate whether allowing an increasing number of medical devices onto the Australian market actually improves clinical outcomes; and whether a more judicious approach could improve pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance of higher risk medical devices, for the ultimate benefit of patients.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the intent of the recommendation, to improve the quality of medical devices available in the Australian market place, by continuing to refine requirements for pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance. 


The TGA has no legal power to limit the number of applications made for inclusion of medical devices in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). Medical devices included in the ARTG are required to comply with standardised criteria for quality, safety and performance under the Therapeutic Goods legislation. 


Further responses on pre-market assessment are provided in relation to recommendations 2 and 3. A further response on post-market surveillance is provided in relation to recommendation 7.




Recommendation 5



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration continue to consult widely with stakeholders, including consumer health organisations, on the amended proposals related to third party conformity assessment; and weigh carefully considerations of the advantages of streamlined international regulatory frameworks and patient safety.




Response:



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The TGA will conduct consultation with all stakeholders on the details of any specific proposals to implement third party conformity assessments and will develop a Regulatory Impact Statement, if required.


The Government notes that recent events have raised questions relating to the current framework governing the use of third party conformity assessments bodies overseas. 


The European Commission has announced that it will review the current structure for third party conformity assessment in the European Union (EU) with a view to making amendments and the possible introduction of an accreditation process for notified bodies.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will monitor developments in Europe with a view to identifying the most appropriate arrangements for Australia which adequately balance the advantages of streamlined international regulatory frameworks and patient safety. 


In order to provide certainty for all stakeholders, the Government commits to expedite its considerations, subject to regulatory developments in the EU. 




Recommendation 6 



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration continue its prudent approach to the regulation of reprocessed single-use medical devices, with due consideration for issues of informed patient consent and the need for suitable mechanisms to enable tracing of remanufactured medical devices in the case of adverse events.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation. 


Current approach to regulation


The Australian regulatory framework for medical devices is designed to ensure that the reprocessing of devices that were not originally intended for reprocessing does not compromise the safety and effectiveness of the device. Under these regulatory controls, the reprocessing facility is regulated as a manufacturer, and is required to demonstrate that the reprocessed device is equivalent to the original and will continue to perform without additional risk to the patient. 


Informed patient consent


The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) is responsible for all matters relating to the regulation of medical practitioners in Australia. It has produced Good medical practice: A code of conduct for doctors in Australia which provides guidance to medical practitioners on a range of matters including issues about informed patient consent. 


The Government notes that the National Health and Medical Research Council has published General Guidelines for Medical Practitioners on Providing Information to Patients (2004). These guidelines recommend that doctors provide information to patients about the risks of any interventions, especially those likely to influence patients' decisions. 


The Government undertakes to refer the issue of patient consent, in the context of reprocessed single-use medical devices, to the relevant National Boards and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). 


Tracing of remanufactured medical devices


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has established regulatory guidelines for remanufactured medical devices, requiring compliance with the post-market requirements, such as reporting adverse events to the TGA associated with the use of the device, tracking the number of times the device is remanufactured and reused, tracing the device to the batch/serial number of the original device and recording to whom the device was supplied in case of recall or other regulatory action (Australian regulatory guidelines for medical devices 2007).




Recommendation 7 



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing implements Recommendations 13, 14, and 15 of the Health Technology Assessment Review in a timely manner. These recommendations address the need for improved post-market surveillance by increasing the rate of reporting of adverse events, including by health service providers and consumers; facilitating the expansion and use of post-market surveillance data to inform safety, effectiveness and reimbursement decisions; and establishing further clinical registers for high risk implantable devices and procedures.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation in principle.


Recommendation 13 of the Health Technology Assessment Review (HTA Review) states that in order to improve the contribution of post-market surveillance to patient safety, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) take steps to increase the rate of reporting of adverse events, including by health service providers. The Government's response to this is set out in the response to recommendation 8 of this inquiry (below).


Recommendation 14 of the HTA Review states that, in order to improve the contribution of post-market surveillance to the sustainability of the health system and the longer term regulatory efficiency of HTA Review processes, the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) explore options for consideration by Government in 2011 to facilitate the expansion and use of post-market surveillance data to inform safety, effectiveness and reimbursement decisions for devices and procedures. 


The Government supports the expanded use of post-market surveillance data from adverse event reporting in assessing the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. As set out in the response to recommendation 8 below, the Government will seek to improve the reporting of adverse events by health practitioners and the general public in order to provide greater data relating to the devices in use in Australia. In addition, the TGA will provide reports of adverse events, as well as any relevant conditions the TGA imposes on a sponsor in order to register their device (including the provision of post-market data), to the TGA's newly established Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD). The ACMD will use this data as part of its post-market monitoring responsibilities. 


The TGA will inform the Prostheses List Advisory Committee, through the Department, when a prosthesis is withdrawn from the ARTG, so that the Government may receive timely advice on any consequent changes to private health insurance reimbursement arrangements for that device. 


The Government announced in the 2012-13 Budget that it will remove joint replacement prostheses with evidence of higher than acceptable revision rates from the Prostheses List, so that private health insurers are no longer required to pay benefits for those prosthetics. 


Recommendation 15 of the HTA Review is that registers for high risk implantable medical devices and/or procedures be established.


The Government supports the development of clinical registers for high risk implantable medical devices and has to date supported the establishment of the National Joint Replacement Registry. 


The Government will continue to work with industry and medical groups to identify the most effective ways to track the use and performance of high risk implantable medical devices, balancing benefits and costs to patients, providers and the wider community.


As part of this process, the Government is also currently considering funding options for the establishment of these registers, including the feasibility of the use of cost recovery from industry through the TGA cost recovery arrangements.


The Government further undertakes to review the communication and reporting links between existing registries/registers, the TGA and the Department. 




Recommendation 8



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration put in place mechanisms to educate and encourage doctors to report adverse incidents associated with the use of medical devices. The committee further recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing introduce mandatory reporting for health practitioners to the Therapeutic Goods Administration on relevant issues, in certain circumstances including problems with medical devices.




Response
:



The Australian Government agrees that adverse event reporting by medical practitioners is a vital component of a comprehensive system of post-market surveillance, and in that context, commits to the following course of action. 


The Government has recognised that further work is required to encourage greater reporting of adverse events from therapeutic goods (including medical devices). As announced in TGA Reforms: A Blueprint for the Future on 8 December 2011, the Australian Government has agreed to implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the Transparency Review: to more effectively facilitate the recognition and reporting of adverse events by health practitioners and consumers, and promote the adverse event reporting system; and to make the Adverse Events Database available to, and searchable by, the public in a manner that promotes the quality use of therapeutic goods. In this context, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will investigate ways to upgrade the value of individual clinician input and subsequent information exchange. 


The TGA has included additional information on its website on reporting adverse events and published a brochure outlining ways to report an adverse event. This brochure is being disseminated at conferences and other venues where it will reach healthcare professionals. An online reporting form for adverse event reporting for medical devices was made available on the TGA website from mid-March 2012. The Government also undertakes to draw this recommendation to the attention of medical educators and organisations funded to provide training and support to medical practitioners.


On the matter of mandatory reporting for health practitioners on problems with medical devices, the Government undertakes to raise this matter with the Medical Board of Australia (Board) which is responsible for the regulation of medical practitioners. The Government notes that any changes to standards set by the Board, or to codes and guidelines produced by the Board, are subject to requirements set out in legislation, including consultation and, in the case of changes to registration or accreditation standards, the agreement of the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council. 


The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) will work with the states and territories to identify opportunities to coordinate adverse event reporting currently required in the public hospital sector in each jurisdiction. The Department will also work with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care to investigate the Commission's capacity to provide safety oversight of the use of therapeutic devices through the development of standards and indicators. 




Recommendation 9



The committee recommends that the Government implements the Recommendations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration Transparency Review in a timely manner.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation.


The Government announced its response to the recommendations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration Transparency Review on 8 December 2011. An implementation plan for the actions agreed in the report TGA Reforms: a Blueprint for the TGA's Future became available in July 2012.




Recommendation 10



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration consider simultaneously allocating or aligning the great variety of codes used to identify medical devices, in order to facilitate more efficient regulation and more rapid identification of devices when problems occur.




Recommendation 11



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing consider a mechanism for flagging billing codes in order to identify devices subject to an alert or recall; as well as a consequent adjustment to benefits paid, based on industry feedback as to the performance of the device.




Combined Response:  



The Australian Government notes recommendations 10 and 11. 


There are practical challenges in simultaneously allocating codes. Catalogue numbers are established by industry internationally, and Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) and Prostheses List billing codes are allocated through consecutive approval steps. Market approval can occur in advance of any decision to reimburse, and many devices are never considered for reimbursement. To delay the allocation of an ARTG number until a billing code for private health insurance purposes was granted, would unduly delay the availability of the product onto the Australian market. 


Nevertheless, the Government acknowledges that better integration and alignment of identifiers can assist post-market surveillance and device identification when problems occur. A new database is under development to support Prostheses Listing arrangements which will allow the Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) to link catalogue numbers with billing codes to assist with identification of specific products. This work is scheduled for completion by the end of 2012. 


The Department and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) are also liaising with the National E-Health Transition Authority on scope to link its National Product Catalogue to billing codes and ARTG numbers to assist identification of devices.


In relation to benefit setting, the Department is implementing recommendation 12 (b-e) of the Health Technology Assessment Review in Australia (HTA Review), to refine grouping schemes and develop single group benefits for clinically similar products on the Prostheses List. Once this work is completed, the Department, with advice from its expert and advisory committees, will review benefit setting arrangements into the future. 




Recommendation 12



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration consider whether custom made dental devices are adequately regulated; and whether the approach used in the United Kingdom of requiring a statement of manufacture to be provided to patients, and retained by the dental practitioner, has merit.




Response:  



The Australian Government notes the recommendation. 


Custom made dental devices are not required to be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. However, there are a number of requirements that must be met. 


The therapeutic goods legislation requires that the importers of custom made dental devices hold certain information about the device including information identifying the manufacturer, the device and any special characteristics of the device. 


The Australian Government will consult with the Dental Board of Australia on this recommendation, as the governing body with the authority to regulate the dental profession.




Recommendation 13



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Good Administration carry out an investigation to ascertain whether importation of medical devices via the internet is adequately regulated.




Response:  



The Australia Government agrees with this recommendation.


The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) will continue to work with all stakeholders to examine evidence in relation to the adequacy of existing arrangements for the importation of medical devices. 


Under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, the Therapeutic Goods Regulations 1990 and the Therapeutic Goods (Medical Devices) Regulations 2002, therapeutic goods are required to be approved and included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) before they can be supplied unless there is an exemption. 


It is illegal to import commercial quantities of therapeutic goods into Australia without the goods being entered onto the ARTG. This applies even if the importer is a healthcare provider. If products are imported for on-sale, including for use within a professional practice, they would need to be appropriately entered onto the ARTG by the importer who would be recognised as the sponsor of the product. The importer would need to meet the appropriate responsibilities of a sponsor as set out in the legislation. Therapeutic goods imported directly from international websites and not entered in the ARTG may not meet the standards of quality, safety or efficacy prescribed by the therapeutic goods legislation. Registered health practitioners who import directly need to be aware how their sponsor responsibilities interact with their professional responsibilities for registration within their relevant sector.


It is possible for individuals to import therapeutic goods into Australia for their own personal use (www.tga.gov.au/pdf/access-personal-import-guidelines.pdf). Such importation is subject to various conditions and it is the responsibility of individuals wishing to import unapproved therapeutic goods for their own use to ensure they have complied with all relevant Commonwealth and state/or territory laws. If care is not taken, consumers may inadvertently break the law, waste their money, or risk their health.


The potential consequence of the importation of medical devices via the internet is limited as private health insurance and Medicare benefits are only payable for medical devices purchased and used with professional services rendered within Australia. Consumers and health professionals are likely to choose devices for which benefits are payable.


From time to time, in the course of routine surveillance activity, the TGA becomes aware that Australian consumers may have purchased potentially dangerous therapeutic goods from overseas sources via mail-order or the internet. In these cases the TGA will issue a safety alert via its website advising consumers to cease using the goods and to consult a healthcare practitioner if there are any health concerns.




Recommendation 14



The committee recommends that the Therapeutic Goods Administration, in consultation with the National Joint Replacement Registry, investigate ways in which information provided by the National Joint Replacement Registry can be used and responded to in a more timely way for the benefit of patients, and to inform future evidence based decision making on the listing of prostheses on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation. 




Recommendation 15



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing prepare, as a matter of priority, a comprehensive communications strategy to inform medical practitioners, patients and the general public about the issues associated with De Puy hip and hip resurfacing devices as well as options for treatment, obtaining further information, and reporting adverse outcomes. The committee further recommends that such a strategy be implemented as a standard process for any future adverse event reporting.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation in principle.


The communications strategy


In announcing TGA reforms: a blueprint for TGA's future, the Government has agreed to implement the recommendations of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Transparency Review which will make further information available to medical practitioners and the public where any issues arise associated with therapeutic goods, including adverse outcomes and recalls. 


The Government notes that the device sponsors, Johnson & Johnson Medical, working closely with the TGA and the Australian Orthopedic Association (AOA), have put in a place a communications strategy to inform medical practitioners about the issues associated with De Puy hip and hip resurfacing devices. 


Information for the general public and patients has also been published on the TGA website: http://www.tga.gov.au/newsroom/btn-dupuy-recall.htm#patients. The Government notes that patients who suspect that they may have side effects related to their hip replacement surgery were advised to contact their surgeon for further clinical review as appropriate. In addition, following recall of the DePuy ASR implant, the TGA worked with DePuy and the AOA to ensure that all Australian orthopaedic surgeons were aware of the recall and appropriate advice was available to be provided to patients. 


Communication between health practitioners and patients


The Medical Board of Australia (MBA) is responsible for all matters relating to the regulation of medical practitioners in Australia. It has produced Good medical practice: A code of conduct for doctors in Australia which provides guidance to medical practitioners on a range of matters including issues about provision of information to patients. 


The Government undertakes to bring to the attention of the MBA and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency the need to ensure that surgeons are communicating any emerging concerns relating to medical devices to patients in a timely manner, including options for treatment. 


Standard processes


The Department has standard procedures in place to respond to health crises and issues management, including development of appropriate communication strategies. These strategies are tailored to the specific situation as each issue is different and the response required can differ significantly. 


Nevertheless, the Department and the TGA will undertake to review the efficiency, timeliness and comprehensiveness of standard processes to communicate with consumers and clinicians in the event of major recalls of implantable medical devices that may have public health consequences.




Recommendation 16



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing, as a matter of urgency, consider the best way of establishing a process for monitoring the levels of cobalt, chromium, and other toxic metals; and any possible health effects, in all patients who have received metal-on-metal hip replacements.




Response:  



The Australian Government notes the recommendation and will continue to monitor the emergence of evidence on the need for, and most effective approaches to, monitoring effects of metal levels associated with metal-on-metal hip replacements.


The TGA, in consultation with the AOA, has developed advice for healthcare professionals and patients regarding De Puy's ASR metal-on-metal hips. The AOA has notified orthopaedic surgeons of the issues and they have been advised to contact patients implanted with an ASR hip replacement system to arrange assessment and regular follow-up. Surgeons have been advised to follow patients closely, including annual review, for at least five years following surgery. 


Currently, the health effects of increased blood metal levels are uncertain. Moreover, the effectiveness of monitoring blood metal levels to identify suspected problems with metal-on-metal hips has not been established, and such results are generally considered in the context of other clinical findings. The type of monitoring should be determined on a case-by-case basis following a detailed consideration of each patient's circumstances by their surgeon. This may involve diagnostic imaging and blood tests as determined by the treating surgeon in consultation with each individual patient. Chromium testing is reimbursed under the Medicare Benefits Schedule. 




Recommendation 17



The committee recommends that the Government consider the best mechanism for initiating and advancing research on the health effects of cobalt, chromium, and other toxic metals, on the human body. The committee also recommends that consideration be given to ensuring adequate funding for that research is made available.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with this recommendation in principle.


Australia is participating in a world wide study of patients who have received the ASR Hip. This study will be the largest of its kind in determining the relevance, extent and impact of raised metal ion levels, in patients who have had hip surgery using the ASR prostheses. 


The Department of Health and Ageing and the Therapeutic Goods Administration are also having ongoing discussions with the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry about ways in which the registry may assist in assessing the outcomes for patients who have received other metal-on-metal hip replacement and any potential for ongoing medical problems.


In addition, as the Government's peak funding body for health and medical research, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) invests in research through a variety of funding mechanisms including investigator-initiated research projects and clinical trials, broad programs of research, training awards for scholars and postdoctoral fellows, career research fellowships and special strategic research programs. The majority of these schemes operate according to annual funding rounds and the details of opening and closing dates are available on the NHMRC website. 


Investigator-initiated research proposals into the health effects of cobalt, chromium, and other toxic metals on the human body will be considered as part of annual funding rounds. These funding schemes are highly competitive with each application considered on its merits through a rigorous peer review process. 




Recommendation 18



The committee recommends that the Department of Health and Ageing undertake further work to address the issue of inducements paid by pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers to doctors and teaching hospitals, in line with the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 in the United States. The definition of inducements should include a commercial interest in a company or device; any cash payments or discounts offered to medical practitioners; and any other gifts provided to medical practitioners.




Response:  



The Australian Government agrees with the recommendation in principle but notes that a legislative framework for ethical conduct of industry in the promotion of therapeutic goods to healthcare professions is not warranted in the Australian context at this time.


The Government is committed to achieving a level playing field in this area. Recognising the need for improvement, the Government established an industry-led working group in 2010 to examine the issues around promotion of therapeutic goods and opportunities to strengthen the current self-regulatory arrangements.


The Government announced its response to the working group's recommendations as part of the TGA reforms: a blueprint for TGA's future. In this response the Government gave strong support to industry's initiative to harmonise their codes of conduct to incorporate the high level principles agreed to by the Working Group. Robust and consistent codes of conduct are a powerful first step in strengthening oversight of the relationship between therapeutic goods companies and healthcare professionals. 


As part of the 2012-13 Budget, the Government will provide $1.4 million over four years to further assist industry to respond to the Working Group's recommendations. The resources provided through this measure will support stronger self-regulation, better communication and shared systems for complaints reporting. 


The Government will work with industry to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach and consider the need to provide further support, or changes to the current self-regulated arrangements if the therapeutic goods industry requires greater encouragement to achieve universal adherence to consistent, high ethical standards. The Government notes that a legislative framework for ethical conduct of industry in the promotion of therapeutic goods to healthcare professionals is not warranted in the Australian context at this time. 


In relation to standards for ethical conduct of healthcare professionals, the Australian Government undertakes to bring the recommendation to the notice of the Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council, and to refer the recommendation to the relevant National Boards and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency.


The Government has also been working with its partners in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) to develop and endorse principles to guide business ethics in the medical device and pharmaceutical sectors. These principles clearly set out expectations for companies operating within APEC economies in regard to ethical behaviour and identify activities that are inappropriate influences and inducements. 




Amended recommendations



The Australian Government notes the proposed timeframes and additional considerations proposed by Senator Xenophon and has considered and responded to these matters in the main recommendations. 


 




Response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee Report





THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF RURAL WIND FARMS





JULY 2012





Introduction



On 27 October 2010, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee (the Committee) was established to consider the social and economic impact of rural wind farms, and in particular:


any adverse health effects for people living in close proximity to wind farms;


concerns over the excessive noise and vibrations emitted by wind farms, which are in close proximity to people’s homes;


the impact of rural wind farms on property values, employment opportunities and farm income;


the interface between Commonwealth, state and local planning laws as they pertain to wind farms; and


any other relevant matters.


The Committee received more than 1000 submissions, many letters and other documents, and had access to much published information.  Public hearings and site visits were held in various capital cities and regional areas.


The Committee tabled its report, The Social and Economic Impact of Rural Wind Farms in parliament on 23 June 2011 making seven recommendations.


The Australian Government welcomes the Committee’s report and thanks the Committee for its considered approach to the recommendations made in the report.


Some of the Committee’s recommendations are directed to state and territory governments, local authorities and professional bodies.  The Australian Government encourages those agencies to respond positively to the recommendations.


The Government recognises that this Senate Committee report has captured a range of issues for many individuals and the wider Australian community with regard to wind farms.  These include noise, health effects, planning laws, property values, employment and farm income.  The Government also recognises that in order to meet the legislated Renewable Energy Target of 20 percent by the year 2020, the number of wind farms can be expected to increase significantly in the next few years.


The Department of Health and Ageing has led the coordination of the whole of government response to the Senate Inquiry.  Input to the response was provided by agencies within this department and by the departments of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPC) and Resources, Energy and Tourism (DRET) where recommendations relate to their respective portfolios.




Government Response to Recommendations



The Australian Government recognises that while the Senate Committee report has captured a range of issues for many individuals and the wider Australian community, there is no strong evidence either way as to the impact of wind farms on the health of Australians.


The lack of evidence therefore makes it difficult for the Government to determine what course of action to take, if any.  The Government recognises it has responsibility for consideration of recommendations four, five, six and seven and these are addressed further in the response.  As for the remaining recommendations, these are areas that lie outside of the Government’s responsibility and should be considered by relevant state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.




Recommendation 1



2.44 The Committee considers that the noise standards adopted by the states and territories for the planning and operation of rural wind farms should include appropriate measures to calculate the impact of low frequency noise and vibrations indoors at impacted dwellings.




Response:



This is a matter for consideration by state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.




Recommendation 2



2.58  The Committee recommends that the responsible authorities should ensure that complaints are dealt with expeditiously and that the complaints processes should involve an independent arbitrator.  State and local government agencies responsible for ensuring compliance with planning permissions should be adequately resourced for this activity.




Response:



The Australian Government accepts this recommendation, but notes that it is a matter for consideration by state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.


It is also important to note the level of complaints about wind turbines and wind farm projects can be aligned with a lack of effective community consultation in the planning and development stages.  As highlighted in the Australian Psychological Society’s submission and in the Committee’s report, early consultation with the community could improve community understanding of wind turbines and could therefore reduce community anxiety and complaints.  In the Committee’s report, it is acknowledged that research on the societal acceptance of wind farms is currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.


It is also noted that the draft National Wind Farm Development Guidelines July 2010 (the draft Guidelines), produced by the former Environment Protection and Heritage Council of Australia and New Zealand, provides extensive advice on how to conduct community consultation.  The draft Guidelines remain a valuable reference document for industry and planning authorities and may assist effective community consultation and possibly reduce complaints.




Recommendation 3



2.69 The Committee recommends that further consideration be given to the development of policy on separation criteria between residences and wind farm facilities.




Response:



This is a matter for consideration by state/territory governments, local governments and planning authorities.




Recommendation 4



2.101 The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government initiate as a matter of priority thorough, adequately resourced epidemiological and laboratory studies of the possible effects of wind farms on human health.  This research must engage across industry and community, and include an advisory process representing the range of interests and concerns.




Recommendation 5



2.102 The Committee recommends that the NHMRC review of research should continue, with regular publication.




Recommendation 6



2.103 The Committee recommends that the National Acoustics Laboratories conduct a study and assessment of noise impacts of wind farms, including the impacts of infrasound.




Response:



The Australian Government accepts these recommendations in principle.


The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is already actively engaged in supporting the assessment of available research on this issue and will shortly commission a comprehensive review of the literature to inform any update to its 2010 public statement.  The review will include audible noise, infrasound and low-frequency noise.  A reference group will be established to advise on the review and will include members of the public, industry, researchers, sound engineers/consultants and planning representatives.


The results of the literature review and the revised public statement will be published on the NHMRC website.


Further, there are a range of funding mechanisms within the Australian Government, in particular within the NHMRC, that could be used to fund additional research on the possible impacts of wind farms on human health, including epidemiological and laboratory studies. 




Recommendation 7



3.99 The Committee recommends that the draft National Wind Farm Development Guidelines be redrafted to include discussion of any adverse health effects and comments made by NHMRC regarding the revision of its 2010 public statement. 




Response:



The Australian Government does not accept this recommendation.


The former Environment Protection and Heritage Council of Australia and New Zealand (EPHC) released the Guidelines in July 2010 for a twelve-month consultation period.  The draft Guidelines outlined best practice for industry and planning authorities and were not mandatory, nor did they seek to change existing jurisdictional statutory processes. 


The Australian Government understands that jurisdictions have developed, or are currently developing, planning application, assessment and approval processes within their own planning frameworks to manage community concerns about wind farm developments such as turbine noise, shadow flicker, electromagnetic interference and impacts on landscapes and wildlife.  The EPHC Standing Committee therefore has decided to cease further development of the Guidelines.  The draft Guidelines remain a valuable reference document for industry and planning authorities and may be used and reproduced for non-commercial purposes.


The Australian Government recognises the important role research will continue to play in informing state/territory planning and development approval processes.  The Australian Government would like to emphasise that the revision of the NHMRC’s 2010 public statement will depend on the outcomes of the literature review, which it will commission shortly.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-09-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:39):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the documents.


I wish to take note of the two responses that the government has tabled today to the two Senate Community Affairs References Committee reports. I particularly wish to take note of the government's response to the Regulatory standards for the approval of medical devices in Australia report. I will try to remember at the end of my remarks to seek leave to continue my remarks, because I am sure Senator Xenophon, who is not in the chamber at the moment, would also like to talk about this report. I chaired this inquiry and, as the chamber may recall, it was Senator Xenophon who made the referral.


We have done two inquiries into this particular issue over the past 18 months. Obviously I am pleased the government has responded, and I would like to comment on a few of the responses to our recommendations. However, I have only just seen this response. I should put on the record that I have been trying all day to get this response after I saw it on the Notice Paper. I have only just received it, which makes it hard for committee members who have worked so hard on these documents to comment. I know it will go on the Notice Paper, but obviously we would like to be able to respond in a speedy manner once the government responds to our recommendations.


The community affairs committee always seems to have references that are particularly emotional. This one was also emotional. We heard some devastating accounts from people who have suffered as a result of faulty medical devices. I am pleased—well, I am sort of pleased—to see the government's response to the committee's recommendation 2, which was about implementing recommendation 8c of the Health Technology Assessment Review. The government says that it agrees with the recommendation and that the TGA has consulted publicly on the proposals to increase the rigour of regulatory assessment for high-risk medical devices. It says:


Some reforms will be in place before the end of the calendar year—


that is good—


but the Government notes that timing and approach depends on the completion of the appropriate assessment of any potential regulatory and cost recovery effects …


The point here is that I think this might be the third time that this recommendation has been made, and people are getting a bit sick of the time delays all the time. When the affected and interested communities see this, I think they are going to be very disappointed that it looks again as if the government is buying itself time, or putting this on, when what these people want is for this recommendation to be implemented as a matter of urgency.


The government also agrees with recommendation 3—partly. I remind the chamber that recommendation 3 was about the level of assessment for class III medical devices and that the level of assessment be increased. The government's response is that it 'agrees to consult further'. Yes, I am always out there saying that you need to consult—but consult further on this? This is another issue that the community feels has been consulted on and consulted on and consulted on, and they have had enough! They want some action taken. 


So it is disappointing that the government says, 'We're going to consult further'. We have now had two Senate inquiries, saying the same thing: that we need to be looking at these class III medical devices. This is not good enough, government; you need to go back, please, and have another look. The government falls back on the fact that you have to have international harmonisation and says:


As such, the Government believes that any increase to the level of assessment of Class III medical devices will be best achieved in harmony with international counterpart regulators.


That is not what the community wants to hear. That is not what Australians want to hear. Australians want to hear that their government has heard that there are concerns here and they want more rigorous action. I urge the government to please have a look at that recommendation because it is one that the community feels very strongly about.


The committee also recommended that the TGA:


… investigate whether allowing an increasing number of medical devices onto the Australian market actually improves clinical outcomes …


We heard quite a lot of information around this, with a number of people being very critical of the numbers on there and that there is not enough pre-market assessment or post-market surveillance of the higher risk medical devices. On this one, the government said:


The Australian Government agrees with the intent of the recommendation, to improve the quality of medical devices available in the Australian market place, by continuing to refine requirements for pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance.


The government also said:


The TGA has no legal power to limit the number of applications made for inclusion …


However, I think you will find that the community will say that, if you actually do the pre-market assessment and the post-market surveillance better, it would improve the situation very significantly. The concern is that those pre- and post-market assessments have not been done.


I am pleased that the government is picking up on recommendation 5, which is 'continuing to consult with various organisations on the proposals related to third-party conformity assessments and to weigh carefully the considerations of the advantages of the streamlined international regulatory frameworks and patient safety'. The government says that it agrees with this recommendation and will conduct consultations with the various stakeholders. You can bet your bottom dollar that the affected community will be looking at that one very substantially.


The government sometimes agrees with the rest of the recommendations but then goes into an explanation about why you cannot actually do it. It seems to me that that is what they are saying. It gets even worse when they say 'agree in principle', because that means that they do not really and that they will find another way of not following through with these recommendations.


The bottom line here is that, if we do not see some changes in the way that medical devices are regulated, I am desperately afraid that we will see a recurrence of the problems we have seen just recently. We heard such emotional accounts of people's lives being absolutely devastated by some of these devices. It is a very important issue and I thank the government for responding in a fairly timely manner.


I would now like to move to the government's response to the social and economic impacts of rural wind farms, which was another substantial inquiry. I want to particularly go to the recommendation about carrying out thorough research—that is, 'A matter of priority for thorough adequate research, epidemiological and laboratory studies and the possible effects'. The government say that they accept the recommendations in principle. They say that the NHMRC is already actively engaged in supporting the assessment of the available research and that a review will include audible noise, infrasound and low-frequency noise. They say that they are looking at a literature review and, further, that there is a range of funding mechanisms within the Australian government, in particular in the NHMRC, that could be used to fund additional research.


I think the community was looking for a broader commitment from the government to actually fund some of that research and not just say that it can get funding from here. It is pleasing that the government is responding to that issue. That is the recommendation I think you will find that the community will be looking for. We need to make sure that those are thorough assessments to ensure that people are comfortable with the science and, in particular, we need to make sure that they are independent.


As I said, I am sure the community will be looking at these recommendations very carefully. I suspect that people will not be totally happy with the government's response and so I am flagging here that I expect to be hearing very shortly from people who will be looking at this recommendation and saying that they do not think it goes far enough, because there does need to be some further funding for looking into these issues. I seek leave to continue my remarks on both the government responses that have been presented.


Debate adjourned.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:49):  I move:


That the Senate notes the Gillard Government’s $120 billion budget black hole.


As I rise to my feet, it occurs to me that I have spent my entire professional life either talking about Labor debt and deficit or helping to repay it. Essentially, my entire professional life has been spent cleaning up after the Australian Labor Party. I was working with the Greiner government, which inherited from Labor debt and deficit, and I should note in passing that the opposition leader for that entire period was none other than current Senator Bob Carr, who opposed each and every measure put forward to repay debt and get the budget back into balance. I worked for the Kennett government, which inherited debt and deficit, and the job was, again, to seek to repay that debt and get the budget back into balance—again without any assistance at any time from the Australian Labor Party. So, in 1996, when I found myself working for the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, it was, as Yogi Berra would say, 'Déjà vu all over again'. There was a $96 billion debt and a budget which was $12 billion in deficit, and we set about repaying the debt. Again, it was done without any assistance from the Australian Labor Party. In fact, the Labor Party opposed each and every measure put forward to get the budget back into surplus. It took us the best part of a decade to completely eliminate that $96 billion of Labor debt—the best part of a decade. It is easy to rack up these bills; it is much harder to pay them down. So successful were we in doing so and establishing what was widely accepted as a new and better fiscal paradigm that then opposition leader Mr Rudd was at pains to ape the Howard government—to present himself as a slightly younger, slightly funkier version of John Howard. He was essentially putting forward the proposition to the Australian people that it was safe to vote for the Australian Labor Party because it would be a status quo situation—that there was essentially no difference. Mr Rudd went to the extent of appearing in those television ads, which I am sure we all remember, where he put his hand on his heart and said, 'I'm often accused of being an economic conservative. It's a badge I wear with pride.' I see Senator Wong smiling.




Senator Wong:
  No, it was your tone!




Senator FIFIELD:
  You are with me and that is the main thing, Senator Wong. But it now seems so farcical to remember him saying, 'I'm often accused of being an economic conservative. It's a badge I wear with pride.'



Senator Wong interjecting—




Senator FIFIELD:
  See, she likes it. The very sad thing is that too many people believed Mr Rudd. Too many people believed that the Australian Labor Party had learnt the lessons of the past—that it was a bipartisan commitment to balanced budgets, to living within your means, to economic conservatism. That is what the Australian public believed. Mr Rudd was guilty of misleading and deceptive conduct. He was elected in effect on the back of a lie. We know Ms Gillard was elected on the back of a lie—that she would not introduce a carbon tax—but the lie that Mr Rudd put forward was no less significant: that he would be an economic conservative, that he would preside over balanced budgets, that he would not rack up massive debt as previous Labor governments had.


So the election came and went, Mr Rudd became Prime Minister and Mr Swan became Treasurer. They were talking a good game, you have got to say. In his very first budget Mr Swan said, 'We're budgeting for a surplus of $21.7 billion in 2008-09, 1.8 per cent of GDP, the largest budget surplus as a share of GDP in nearly a decade.' No. It did not come to pass. It reminds us, as if we needed reminding, that what is in a budget speech, what is in a budget paper when it forecasts a surplus, when it forecasts a lessening of debt, or when it forecasts a smaller budget deficit than the year before, is a forecast—it is nothing more than that.


The global financial crisis came along. It is such an unlucky government, this one: if it is not one thing, it is another! So we had the global financial crisis. If you believe the Australian Labor Party it was the first time in human history that there had ever been economic uncertainty; it was the first time in human history that a government had ever faced significant external shocks and it was of such magnitude that it would not matter what happened—




Senator Wong:
  Oh, come on. You'd be laughed out of town if you went to Washington and said that. Go to Washington and say that—go on.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  Order!




Senator FIFIELD:
  I am noting, in effect, the tone and the language that the government used at the time—that this was something that was completely unprecedented, that they had no option but to go into deficit, that they had no option but to spend massively, to waste massively.


But I do contrast that with the Asian financial crisis. We are much more enmeshed in the Asian region than we are enmeshed with Europe or the United States. In the Asian financial crisis—our region, where we are—our major trading partners were in recession. Despite that and without massive fiscal stimulus, without massive waste, we still continued to grow. It is not automatic that recessions elsewhere lead to recession in your own country.


The global financial crisis, yes, was a real event, but Europe and the United States were the genesis and the epicentre of that. It was not automatic that we would go into recession. What saved us from recession was not the economic stimulus. It was the fact that we have a floating exchange rate; it was the fact that we had strong demand from China; it was the fact that we had the world's best prudential regulatory arrangements, courtesy of Mr Costello; it was the fact that the Reserve Bank cut official interest rates. It was the combination of those factors which led to Australia coming through the global financial crisis in good condition. It was not because of this massive fiscal stimulus. It is important to have a look at the contrast between how we fared during the Asian financial crisis and how he fared during the global financial crisis and what the Howard government did at the time of the Asian financial crisis and what the Rudd government did at the time of the global financial crisis.


But it seems that this government just cannot take a break; luck just never goes their way! Even if you accept the thesis of the other side in relation to the global financial crisis and the budgetary situation in the year or two after that, it in no way explains the fiscal situation since then. We have heard time and again those opposite say that the reason that the budget is in deficit year after year after year is because of revenue write-downs. There have been revenue write-downs—I acknowledge that—but, if you look at the budget papers year by year by year under this government, the overwhelming reason that the budget is in deficit year after year after year is not revenue write-downs; it is because of policy decisions. What 'policy decisions' means is spending decisions by the government. That is the overwhelming reason that the budget is in deficit year after year after year. It is because of spending decisions.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, senators will not debate across the chamber. Senator Fifield has the call.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and we are seeing here that very debate. It is not revenue write-downs that account for the Australian government being in deficit year after year after year, and assertions to the contrary do not make that proposition true. It is because of policy decisions of this government. It is because of spending decisions by this government.


As if it is not bad enough that this government have failed to live up to the promise that they presented leading into the 2007 election, to be good and conservative economic managers, and as if it is not bad enough that each and every budget forecast for deficit has been well and truly exceeded at the time of the final budget outcome, the government have embarked on a new path of fiscal recklessness. That comes in the form of the new $120 billion budget black hole. The genesis of that is a series of unfunded, grandiose commitments, some of them worthy in their aspiration and some of them not.


That which is worthy in its aspiration is the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a scheme—according to Productivity Commission figuring as amended by the Australian Government Actuary—which would cost in a full year about $7½ billion to $8 billion a year. The reason for that figure is it is simply a product of the unmet need for Australians with disability who need aids and equipment, who need supported accommodation and who need respite. That is a worthy aim. But, in the case of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the government have only allocated over the forward estimates $1 billion of the $3.9 billion that the Productivity Commission said was necessary for that first phase. So it has been massively underfunded and the government have given no indication as to how a full national rollout of the NDIS would be funded.


Then we have the dental scheme which Minister Plibersek announced the other week and, depending on who you listen to, it is either funded or underfunded. Ms Plibersek said, when asked how it would be funded, that it was all new money and that decisions would have to be taken as to how to fund that. So she said it was all new money but the Prime Minister, on the other hand, said, 'No, no, no, no, it's not all new money but this is essentially a savings measure.' When you have a Prime Minister and a substantive minister on a multibillion dollar announcement being unable to agree whether something is a savings measure or requires new money, you know that there is absolutely no fiscal rigour left in the outfit.


We then have Gonski. There are some elements of Gonski which are fine and worthy in their aspiration but it is a pipedream, with not a dollar put towards it. We are seeing the emergence under this government of a pattern where a grand announcement is made. In the case of the NDIS, you may have a little bit of money put towards it but there is none in the case of Gonski. You may have a little bit of detail provided—as is the case with the NDIS or none, as in the case of Gonski—just enough to give the illusion of activity and just enough to give the illusion of substance. You will then have the Prime Minister picking fights with the states, demanding things of them through the airwaves—things which are news to them. Then, when the states say, 'Look, we'd like to have a chat about this as this is meant to be a nation where cooperative federalism is the order of the day; could you give us a little bit of detail?' the Prime Minister then seeks to excoriate the states—well, certain states, Liberal states—for being against proper support for people with disability or for being against every kid in Australia having a decent education. We have these fabricated confected fights to convey the illusion that only the Labor Party cares about people with disability or that only the Labor Party cares about quality education.


The final element of this new pattern that we see is that the government will seek to introduce a token piece of legislation. I think we are going to see by the end of this year some legislation with the brand of Gonski. I suspect all that legislation will do will be to essentially say that it is a good thing that kids get a good education. I think that is all it will do, I have got to say. I would suspect, although we have not seen it, that the legislation that the government puts forward for the NDIS may technically formally establish a national disability insurance agency, but we will not have details of eligibility criteria, we will not have details of scheme design, we will not have details of how the scheme will be funded and we will not have a commitment to a full national rollout by 2018-19. What we are seeing is an attempt to deceive the public. We are seeing a systematic, deliberate attempt to deceive the public; that these are sorts of announcements—Gonski, dental and NDIS—constitute a comprehensive policy by this government which will be legislated, funded and introduced. It is nothing of the sort. There are two possible explanations for this scenario. One is that the government have been complete frauds, that they have no intention of introducing the Gonski arrangements, no intention of properly implementing an NDIS and no intention of doing what they want to do on dental—disagree with it though we do; they just want to provide enough evidence of activity to convince people that they are serious.


The other explanation for the situation is that the government really want to do these three things but they are just so absolutely and hopelessly incompetent that they cannot bring forward detail, they cannot bring forward implementation plans and they cannot find the money. They are the two explanations—that they are serious and genuine, but they are also genuinely hopeless; or they are deliberately and systematically deceiving the Australian public. I would be interested if you could hazard a third explanation, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner. But they are the two explanations before us.


The cumulative effect is $120 billion of unfunded commitments. And you can throw into that the amount of money which is required to support the situation with asylum seekers. I think the government are actually pursuing a con, that they are gearing up for opposition, that they have no intention of finding the money for these programs and that they have no intention of actually delivering them. That would be appalling, that would be deceitful and that should be condemned. I hope that the government prove me wrong. I would love that. I would love to see the National Disability Insurance Scheme, but I seriously doubt the government's bona fides.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:09):  I am a bit worried looking across at the opposition because they were all wearing their R U OK? badges earlier in the day but now they seem to have disappeared. It would be a real worry to me if we are to fall into a process of excoriation this afternoon. We need to have a debate around the issues and we are more than keen to have the debate, but I think we should be looking to see that everybody in the chamber are feeling well, positive and moving well into the debate. Senator Fifield, I am worried that the badge has gone. I hope that does not mean that the spirit is lacking on this day.


However, in question time this afternoon we heard the preliminary part of this debate with the series of questions across the chamber to Senator Wong. The opposition started with quite clear assertions about and confirmation of the figures that prove the great blow-out in the budget. Yet again, we have the litany from those opposite—if you say something often enough and loud enough, it automatically becomes truthful. We know where the figures come from that the opposition are using. They come from the Australian Financial Review. With great deference to the Australian Financial Review, a newspaper that is read vigorously by people on a weekly basis to find out what is happening in the economy, it seems that, yet again, the opposition's work is being done through other sources, the media and the AFR's report on the budget. That is worrying because in this place we have processes which work effectively.


As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, because you sometimes sit with me on the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee during estimates, we look at the Treasury figures and the budget process, and line by line the Senate is able to examine exactly what the determinations are across all expenditure in the budget. It is clear through that process that you can identify in the budget exactly what is happening with the forward spending and what the methodologies are and have been for many, many years. There is no new way of calculating the budget. We have not created a new budget process. We have not created a new Treasury. We have not created a new department of finance. Those processes and systems have existed. We work within that infrastructure and we continue to do so. 



I looked at the AFR'sfigures—which I actually found in the media release from the opposition that claims the attribution to black hole, to which they love to refer—and it was clearly listed on the basis of an eight-year forward plan for the budget. I immediately turned to my little book on how the budget process operates to see what we do during Senate estimates. I found that we look at the forward budget and at the way calculations are made, and I picked up almost immediately that the forward budget does not cover an eight-year period. The data and the arguments put forward by the opposition—and I know they will continue to use them next week, because why start with a new line when you already have a good one—were the inflated figures around an eight-year outlying process. That is a technique. It is a proposition into the future but it is not an examination of budget figures; it is a guesstimate. Anyone can have an argument using guesstimates.


The comments made by Senator Fifield we have heard many times before. I knew the way his comments were going to flow and I knew what was going to come next. He waxes lyrical that we must be very unlucky, that we have all sorts of things happening to us and that we hide behind what is happening in our budget figures. It is as though the government have not gone through the process of putting out a budget every year and reviewing the figures midterm—all of which is publicly available—as well as sitting through three weeks of intensive Senate estimates. There is a view in the rhetoric of the opposition that we have not known, or not noticed, that we have run budget deficits over the first years of our government. We have known that. We have planned it. The reasons that those budget deficits have occurred have been put out into the public arena, as well as what we are planning to do as a government to respond. We have been told by the opposition that our government's plan to have a budget surplus going into the next financial year is somehow an unworthy affirmation, that it is something that might or might not happen. What we have said as a government is that we will bring in a surplus, and we are working through the process to ensure that happens. Every time there is an examination of our figures, that is brought into an account. But that is not good enough; somehow it has to be some kind of manipulation or conspiracy or hiding that the government is doing. That is not true. The job of government is to put forward our figures, to justify those figures and to put evidence as to what we are going to do, how we have done it and what factors are impacting on our budget.


I heard Senator Fifield today draw a comparison between the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis. That argument has been made. At the time of the Asian financial crisis I was in this place, and at no time did the then opposition say that there was no such thing as an Asian financial crisis. There was debate about whether the methodologies and responses being put forward by Costello at that time were appropriate, but at no time was there any suggestion by the opposition that it was somehow a made-up exercise and that Australia would be completely immune from everything that was going on. In contrast, from the time that the global financial crisis was identified, to the horror of the world's economies, there has been a view by those now on the opposition benches that it was not having any impact on Australia, that we would be able to sail through without impact and that any good thing that came out was somehow a legacy of the good financial management of the previous government. The view was that there was nothing untoward, nothing major and nothing troubling that would cause the government to make the really strong financial decisions, publicise them and explain why they were being done, which resulted in the economic stimulus processes we put in place, particularly in the first three years of our government.


They were decisions that have been respected and held up by international economists as not just appropriate action but action which could be held up to show the rest of the world's economies a way to make the best response to a significant threat to our financial security. But, no, again that was not good enough for the opposition, who said the government was lucky or unlucky, it fell into decisions, it did not know what it was doing. Many leading economists, including at that stage, I have to say, economists in the Australian Financial Review, said that the Australian economy had pulled itself through the global financial crisis in a very effective way. There has been pain, and we continue to see pain from businesses that were caught up in that process, particularly those involved in international markets. But the economic decisions that were made by this Labor government, using figures prepared by Treasury and the department of finance that are public, have protected to a large extent the integrity of our economy. I think that should be acknowledged. It has been acknowledged by most organisations, most governments and most economic theorists, with the major exception being those in the opposition at the moment. I do not consider it is a matter of luck. I believe it was a series of strategic decisions based on economic theory that led us to the position we are in today.


There seems to be a viral process happening around the country where Liberal-National governments have been elected by the population—and that is the joy of our democratic process: we do not always enjoy the results but we enjoy that democratic process that we have. The process I am referring to where you get into government and you have an independent review, which is run of course by people that you know and appoint, that brings out the astounding finding that there are budget issues and problems from the outgoing government. What a surprise—that has never happened before in history! Nonetheless, we have seen it happen now in Victoria, in New South Wales and, most recently, in Queensland—my own state and yours, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner. What we have is a battle of the black holes, an argument over whose black hole is bigger than whose. What we have now in Queensland is an independent review which has had a responsive independent review. It points out that the figures used in the first independent review, which was chaired by Mr Peter Costello, whilst following economic methodology, were blown out and exaggerated to respond to the worst possible scenario that could occur. I do not think it took into account nuclear destruction, but it almost did.


Various figures have been thrown around in the Queensland parliament and in this place which claim to be the deficit that the Queensland government is facing. Subsequent inquiries and opinions have been sought which say that those figures are not absolutely accurate, that there are other ways to calculate the figures and that that could make a difference. It is much the same as the basis of the debate we have had in this place, where the opposition are claiming significant blow-outs, that the deficit is going to be $120 billion. Again, this has been done using data and a process which the government does not agree with. What a surprise! 


As I said earlier, what we have is a battle where if you say something and then I say it is not right, and yell louder and louder, somehow at the end we are going to reach some kind of agreement. It never happens. It does not happen in any form of debate and it particularly does not happen in financial debates. What we have seen is a clear disagreement from the government, from the Treasury and from the Treasurer with the premise that was put forward in the $120 billion figure.


What we do have is a process where the government releases its figures every month, and the scrutiny takes place through the Senate estimates process and in the midyear figures. We now all know that the building is being done in the government for the next year's budget. It is an important budget. Our government has said that it is going to have a surplus in the next financial year budget. That is not some kind of wishy-washy goal; that is the government's statement. What will happen is all the figures will lead into that—taking into account what Senator Fifield seems to put as some unusual process of policy decision—which is the basis of what we do as a government: develop a policy, develop the financial figures around that and then crunch the figures into a budget which will fund that policy which has been put out. Governments have to make decisions about what they can afford to do and not do. That seems to me to be standard financial management. There is nothing unusual about that. There is no conspiracy about that as is being put forward by people in the opposition. That is how policy is developed and policy is funded through budgets.


Senator Fifield made statements about a number of key areas: the NDIS, the dental scheme and other key policy areas such as the Gonski review into education. One of the things that disappointed me most when I was looking at the Australian Financial Review figures was the way in which in a couple of these key areas there was no differentiation about what was going to be a state funding responsibility and what was going to be a federal funding responsibility. That to me would be quite a basic arrangement because the government has said consistently that, particularly around the areas of education and health and most particularly around the area of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, there is an expectation from this government that they are going to be shared responsibilities between state and federal governments, as indeed always; this is not a new policy. In the areas of disability, health and education, which are three of the very large policy areas about which the opposition has been speaking and to which this government has a commitment, there has always been shared responsibility between the states and the federal government. It is not always an easy relationship. In fact, I am not sure it has ever been an easy relationship and we have lots of great quotes from the past about the terms used by various premiers and various federal leaders to refer to each other in that process. Rather than an attack on state governments by the federal government in developing the budget parameters around which the NDIS scheme would be introduced, there was a clear discussion about what amount, what percentages, what areas the states would be responsible for and what areas the federal government would be responsible for.


At this stage we are not into the core aspects of the NDIS. There has been a policy decision, an agreement to move forward and an agreement to have a series of trials to set the basis on which further action would be taken. All this is public knowledge. Just by saying that you do not agree with it does not mean that it is not true and is not publicly acknowledged. It would seem to me that there should be a clear understanding about who is responsible for what and what expectation there is for budget agreement. However, in the Australian Financial Review figures—the eight-year-into-the-future figures, which have never been a known economic model in Australia—it seems that all the financial responsibility on those figures falls back to the federal government. That is just not true.


It is a standard process for governments to consult on what their policies are going to be. It is the expectation that governments will develop budgets around that and then put that out to the community and show them what has happened. Then it is the responsibility of the parliament to review those budgets to ensure that the money is being appropriately spent. That is standard process. So any view that there is something particularly wrong or different about the way this government is working is just not true. It may suit a political purpose and it does. Throwing figures around this place, throwing figures around the community and throwing figures around the media do not constitute economic argument. They may make really good one-liners and I reckon if you just keep saying billions and trillions and squillions often enough and have a whole lot of zeros in the figures and then accuse them of being wrong then that may give you a couple of moments in the sun or a couple of moments of newsprint. That does not constitute economic argument. And it certainly does not mean that the current government is not effectively planning and working through a budget process.


It seems to me that if the best way to argue is just to consistently say that the others are wrong and not put forward your own case, it will not get you very far. I think it is a sad point that when we get into 'whose black hole is bigger than the other's', we throw up figures about other figures that are incorrect and fall into the same trap. I do not think that is an effective way of moving forward either. I can remember sitting across on the other side of this chamber and being constantly asked by people on this side of the chamber, 'Give us your policies and give us your budget figures. Don't talk to us until you put your own budgets up and show us what you are going to do.' So, with respect, you can make these statements about what this government is doing with our budget; that is what you do. It would be useful if you would justify them. It would be useful if you did not rely on other people to do the calculations, particularly those in the media. It would be useful if when you are talking about policy areas such as the NDIS, the dental scheme and education into the future—those things which are so important to all of us—and as you are making allegations even to the extent of excoriating people on this side of the chamber, you could provide the details of the budgets in opposition that you are wanting to bring in to ensure that once again that battle over the black hole size could be justified and we could see exactly where people are moving into the future—with budgets across the board.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2012-09-13,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:29):  Before I make a contribution to this debate, I would just like to acknowledge some of my Western Australian National Party colleagues up in the gallery here with us today. It is good to see them over here with us on the other side. Welcome to the Senate.


Mr Acting Deputy President, I have to say that Senator Moore is one of those on the other side for whom I have the greatest respect—no doubt about that at all. But I have to say that when Senator Moore was speaking I just tuned out. I think that is like what the Australian people are now doing en masse—they are just tuning out when the government are talking about money, when they are talking about the budget or when they are talking about the economy, because they know that this government simply cannot manage money. And add to that the fact that they simply do not believe anything that the government says anymore. The government cannot manage money, and everybody knows that. We see the same cycle from decades past: Labor gets in, runs up a huge debt, they eventually lose an election, the coalition comes back in and we are left with a giant debt that we have to fix, and we have to put the country's economy back to rights again.


That is not just a fanciful story. When you go back to history it has happened time and time again. It is no wonder, Senator Williams, that the Australian people simply do not believe a word the government says, not a word—




Senator Williams:
  They've given up!




Senator NASH:
  They have given up—thank you, Senator Williams. They have just given up. I apologise to Senator Moore for tuning out. Usually, I listen with great intent to Senator Moore's contribution because she makes very sensible and balanced contributions. But on this particular issue, no go. Unfortunately, as I said, I did tune out, as many of the people across Australia have done and continue to do.


Senator Fifield, in his opening statement, referred to 1996 and the $96 billion of debt that the incoming coalition government had to deal with. I can remember that very clearly; not that I was in this place at the time, but I was very involved in the National Party. I think I was about 16—sorry, Hansard, that was a joke! But I remember it very clearly and I remember hearing from John Anderson about the ERC and what the coalition had to do to get the economy back to rights. And it was really, really tough.


It was $96 billion and it took us about 10 years, give or take, to pay it off. And in that as well there was—let us not go there!—the sale of Telstra of around $30 billion. At the moment we are now looking at this $120 billion black hole from Labor. They glibly try to make it sound as if it is no real problem at all—it is no bother; it is all fine, everything is on track and the economy is going well. You cannot escape the fact that there is a $120 billion black hole under this Labor government's management of the economy.


Again, I refer to my colleague over there, Senator Williams, who has an amazing grasp of economic issues, I must say.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Amazing! It is truly amazing!




Senator NASH:
  I mean that most sincerely! He has a tremendous grasp of economic issues, and I know that he would back me up with everything I am saying. We are left with the situation now where I think that there was around $70 billion in net Commonwealth assets when the coalition left office in 2007. Since then, Labor has delivered the four largest budget deficits in Australia's history and the list just goes on and on.


In 2012-13—and I am going to refer to my notes because I want to get this absolutely right—the government will be spending around $100 billion a year more than in the last Howard-Costello budget. Interest payments on Labor's debt are running at $22 million a day which, interestingly, colleagues, equates to about $300,000 in the 20 minutes that I am going to be speaking. These are facts that the government cannot get away from. Interest payments on Labor's debts since 1 July 2009 are $15 billion; $15 billion—that was a 'b', not an 'm'—'b' for billion. It is interesting, colleagues, isn't it? Labor often talks about budget surpluses but it has not delivered one for more than 20 years. Again, probably back when I was 16!




Senator Crossin:
  Now you are making that up!




Senator NASH:
  They have just increased Australia's debt limit to a record $300 billion—I am not making this one up! I am not making any of this up, Senator Crossin. $300 billion at the last budget debt limit—




Senator Crossin:
  You are making it all up!




Senator NASH:
  Okay, Senator Crossin, let me ask you this: do your budget papers say that Australia's debt limit is now $300 billion? Because if your answer is not 'yes' then you have no idea what you are doing on the other side of the chamber. You have no idea. If I had asked you this a year ago and said, 'Senator Crossin, in the budget in 2011 did the debt limit go to $250 billion?' Again, you would have to say, 'Yes'. You would have to say yes because it is true. It is a fact. And not only that; I love the way, Senator Humphries, that these things get slipped through—




Senator Humphries:
  That's right!




Senator NASH:
  Slipped through in the budget! And remind me if I am not correct: I think that in 2011—or it may have been 2012—that all this was tied into the budget so we actually cannot object to the lift in the debt ceiling because it is all tied in with everything else and we would have to oppose the entire budget. Clever on the government's behalf, of course.


This is like a family going to their bank manager every year and saying, 'Please, sir, may we have some more?' and taking no responsibility for the economic sustainability of their family budget. All they do is just keep coming back here and saying, 'Please, can we have some more?' There is no responsible economic management from this government, and that is just a fact. I am not making it up, that is just a fact. You only have to look at the figures to see. I know that my good colleagues from over in WA would agree with me in saying that, because the mismanagement is appalling, absolutely appalling.


The point is, colleagues, that if the government did not waste so much money they would be able to direct properly the money that they do have to far more appropriate and useful policy measures. When we look at the waste and mismanagement, people are just astounded. And the hits just keep on coming; that is what amazes people. Just when you think you have seen the last possible—possible—bit of waste and mismanagement from government, up comes another one. It is great: the hits just keep on coming! They are just a bit like Alvin and the Chipmunks—there is another one just around the corner, just when you thought you had got through the lot. We should just have a look at the list of waste and mismanagement, because, like Pinocchio's nose, it is ever growing. We have Labor's failed border protection policies that have now blown out the immigration budget by over $5 billion; $650 million of that is in detention costs. We have the Home Insulation Program. Who can forget the pink batts? There was $2½ billion mismanaged, with at least half a billion dollars spent fixing the mistakes. We have the computers in schools blow-out; that is a favourite of many. Mind you, I am absolutely supportive of computers in schools, and everybody would know that I am absolutely supportive of everything we can possibly do to improve education outcomes, particularly for rural and regional students. But there was about a $1½ billion blow-out. We have Green Loans and Green Start. The $175 million Green Loans program was mismanaged and then eventually dumped and then replaced with the $130 million Green Start program, which never started. We have the solar homes program, an $850 million blow-out, with the program cancelled. The program was originally meant to cost $150 million. The list goes on.


What is really impressive is the talkfests that we have seen. I note for Hansard that 'impressive' was highly sarcastic. Labor's talkfests include the 2020 Summit. Who cannot remember the 2020 Summit? Does anybody have any idea of one outcome from the 2020 Summit? Anyone? I did not think so. We—when I say 'we' I mean we the taxpayers—spent $2 million on that. The Henry tax review cost $10 million. The list goes on and on.


Two of my favourites are Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch. They sounded really good, didn't they? 'Let's have Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch to make fuel and groceries cheaper.' Nearly $30 million was spent setting them up, and then they were dumped. Then, of course, we have Labor's NBN, involving Senator Conroy, a personal favourite of the Senate here, with the blow-out to over $50 billion—and that is not even included in the budget. This is extraordinary from this government.


There was spending of $2.1 billion on consultancies over the last four years. Let us just think for a moment, colleagues. If all of this waste had not happened, think of all the things that that funding could have been far more appropriately directed to which would not have resulted in this situation we have with this huge blow-out—the $120 billion black hole. You will love this one, my WA colleagues: the pool tables that used to be in Parliament House here.



Senator Williams interjecting—




Senator NASH:
  Senator Williams remembers the pool tables. I must say that I am not too bad at the old pool table myself, but I had not frequented these ones. The government sold them for $5,000. Fair enough, you might say—very sensible. They were not being utilised terribly much, I understand. The government sold them for $5,000. They then spent $102,000 determining whether or not they got value for money. That is a wise, wise use of taxpayers' money, isn't it? Again, Hansard, that is sarcasm.


This is extraordinary. The list just goes on and on. When we see federal government departments and agencies spending more than $10 million checking what is said about them in the media, I think the Australian taxpayers would rightly be absolutely astounded and would think, 'How much money do you need to spend on checking what it is that you've said and done?' I just go to an article in the Australian on 27 August, and I will quote from it:


FEDERAL government departments and agencies are spending more than $10.3 million a year checking what is said about them in the media.



The hefty monitoring bill from external companies would pay for more than 100 full-time staff each earning $100,000 a year. An analysis by The Australian—


and I have great respect for the Australian and for the author—


revealed the Department of Health and Ageing ploughs more than any other department or agency into monitoring with a bill of—


any guesses, Senator Williams or Senator Humphries?




Senator Williams:
  Five?




Senator NASH:
  No, you need to increase it: $940,000 for press clippings and transcripts in just one year, 2011-12.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Furner
):  Order, Senator Nash! I remind you to address your comments through the chair.




Senator NASH:
  Certainly. I am suitably admonished. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.




Senator Marshall:
  Not suitably.




Senator NASH:
  No, suitably admonished. Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is no wonder that the Australian people are shaking their heads when they look at this black hole. They think, 'How on earth did the government get us into this position?' When we look at all that waste and mismanagement, it is not at all surprising.


As I said, if the government had not wasted and did not continue to waste so much money, they would not need to make the cuts that they have. One cut in particular that I think Australians are very well aware of is the $5.45 billion cut to defence in the May budget. Australians are quite rightly outraged about that. In particular—which I think is just appalling—the government is restricting free flights home for soldiers on recreational leave to those soldiers who are under 21.




Senator Humphries:
  Disgraceful!




Senator NASH:
  Thank you, Senator Humphries. I will take that interjection. That is absolutely disgraceful. So we see the list of waste and mismanagement, yet our defence forces are bearing the brunt of that. That is absolutely unacceptable. I went yesterday to the funeral of Private Robert Poate, who was an old boy of Canberra Grammar School and was an incredible Australia. The fact that other Australians just like him who are continuing to serve are suffering from budget cuts from this Labor government because they have wasted so much money is absolutely appalling and unacceptable.


The list goes on. Let us go to agriculture, because the hits just keep on coming. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry spent $77,627 on consultants to alter its mission statement. What happened then? They removed the word 'agriculture' from their mission statement. So we have nearly $80,000 with all this help and the consultants that they needed to do more than just change the mission statement—though I am sure there was a significant contribution towards it—which was 'increasing the profitability, competitiveness and sustainability of Australia's agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries'. That is what it was. They changed it to, 'We work to sustain the way of life and prosperity of all Australians.' What is that? I am a farmer. To spend all that money on advice and consultants, eventually altering their mission statement to remove the word 'agriculture' from it—what is this government doing? That is absolutely extraordinary. It is not at all surprising that the people of this nation have just about had a gutful. They also spent nearly $80,000 coming up with identity branding to work out how the department projected itself. All of that wrapped up in that $80,000 is absolutely extraordinary.


What is interesting is that, if we had not had all of this waste and mismanagement that I have been talking about, we would not have had to have cuts like the Labor government abolishing Land and Water Australia, cutting $63 million in CSIRO agricultural research and a $12 million cut in funding to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation. In the 2009-10 budget Labor cut cargo screening resources at ports and airports by $58 million, obviously risking our borders when it comes to plant disease and animal risk, and cut the government's contribution to biosecurity by $35 million. When we look at all these things and look at the list of waste, people wonder, not surprisingly, what on earth this government is doing. How dare they put at risk our borders? How dare they cut funding for agriculture for our farmers, who are the backbone of this nation? And yet we see $80,000 going on trying to get identity branding for the department. It is absolutely ludicrous.


When it comes to education, colleagues have already mentioned Gonski and the costs there. Again, if we had not seen the waste and mismanagement, we would not have had to see the cuts that we have seen. The minister has admitted—and I take his point—that, when they made changes to youth allowance, they could not have any greater impact on the budget. What I find absolutely appalling about that is that part of what they did was put a $150,000 parental income test cap on independent youth allowance for students. As the minister said at the time, that was because there is technically only X amount of money to go around in the youth allowance changes and it was a savings measure. So we see this situation from this Labor government where there is a parental income cap for students wanting to get independent youth allowance. How incongruous and stupid is that? These are students who have proved themselves independent of their parents. That is the nature of it. That is why they go and work for a year. They are independent of their parents when they go to university. But this government, which clearly has no understanding at all of the needs of rural and regional students, puts a cap in place saying, 'By the way, if your parents earn that, too bad: you're not eligible and cannot even apply.' That is $150,000 before tax for two parents. We are talking about a police officer and a schoolteacher whose children are unable to apply for independent youth allowance because of this government's stupid parental income cap because they did not have the money to increase the budget for the youth allowance measures.


When we look at all this waste and mismanagement, it is absolutely no surprise that the Australian people have concluded beyond all doubt that this government cannot manage money. They do not believe a word the government say anymore. The government no longer have any credibility. They never had any ability to manage the economy properly. The Australian people are seeing through this government day after day. They are seeing the negative impacts we are seeing right through our communities because of the economic mismanagement of this government, because the government have no vision for the future, and the Australian people will make this very clearly felt at the next election.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Gillard Government</title>,MOTIONS,18,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (16:49):  I thank Senator Nash for her contribution. She was obviously playing to the audience, which I understand is an audience very sympathetic to Senator Nash and to Senator Macdonald over there. I am sure they enjoyed that mixed speech full of slogans and rhetoric. But that was mostly what it was. Every now and again, though, Senator Nash had to confirm that those things were facts as if somehow that actually made them facts. Let me point out a few of the things that she claimed were facts when they were not.


She talked about a number of minor matters which I do not know the detail of, like an $80,000 expenditure on consultancy. That does not sound like good money spent; but, again, I do not know the detail of that. We will have a look at it. But, when we talked about programs worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, she talked about computers in schools and talked about the blow-out. Senator Nash should know—and I think she actually does know—that there was not a blow-out in that program. The government made an extra budget allocation to compensate the schools and states for the extra IT required to implement that program. We ended up with a fantastic program when we finally got a unit cost per computer on an average of $500. The extra budgetary allocation was to ensure that we had proper, powerful IT systems in place to get maximum benefit out of those computers. It was disappointing that some of the states did not step up to the mark to assist in that very generous position that the Commonwealth government took.


Some of Senator Nash's contribution reminded me of the contribution John Howard made in the lead-up to the 2007 election. When talking about interest rates, he said interest rates would always be lower under a Liberal government than they would be under a Labor government. Well, what is the cash rate today? The cash rate today is 3.5 per cent. That is lower than the cash rate was at any time under the last Liberal-National government. Yet we hear this sort of stuff peddled all the time as if there is a problem. If you listen to Senator Nash, you would think that the economy is a basket case. Of course, that is what the Liberal-National parties want you to think. They want to talk the economy down. They want to trash it. 


Let us just look at some of the fundamentals of the economy and acknowledge that the global financial crisis was real. I just refer back to some of the comments I heard Senator Fifield make. One of the things he said was, 'Even if you accept that there was a GFC' and then he went on to talk about some other things. I think there was a GFC. I do not think there is a conspiracy theory group or a GFC deniers group going on. I notice members of the National Party want to accuse the Greens of being involved in conspiracy theory groups. But there ought not to be a conspiracy theory group suggesting that there was no global financial crisis. Maybe Senator Fifield should just look to Europe, to the United States and to other parts of the developing world to see the devastation that is still occurring as a direct result of the global financial crisis. It came here as well but we have not been affected by it so much because of the actions we took as a government to mitigate its effects on our economy and our community. 


Let us just look at the fundamentals of the economy, which is no basket case. Let us just look at our economy as a whole. It is 11 per cent larger now than when we came to office, despite the worst global financial conditions since the Great Depression. Our economy has been growing faster than every other single major advanced economy—0.6 per cent in the March quarter and 3.7 per cent over the year. It is a larger rise than every other economy. Our unemployment rate is 5.1 per cent. It is less than half of what it is in Europe, and it is not quite half of what it is in the United States. But it is significantly below every other advanced economy. Our inflation rate is at a 13-year low, with underlying inflation at the bottom end of the RBA's target band of around two per cent for the year through to June. As I have said, the cash rates are at 3.5 per cent—lower than at any time under the Liberal government. We have got a huge investment pipeline with a record $260 billion at an advanced stage, helping to boost the productive capacity of our economy. Consumption in the country has also been growing by about four per cent throughout the year. We have very low debt. Net debt as a percentage of GDP is peaking at around one-tenth of the level across major advanced economies. 


Let me just talk about debt for a minute, because when figures are bandied around they actually sound like significant figures. When people start to talking about millions or billions of dollars, a normal household would grapple with what that means in reality. Where is it? What sort of size is that? And what does it mean in terms of the overall economy? Net debt peaked as a percentage of GDP at 9.6 per cent in 2011-12. That is around one-tenth of the level of the major advanced economies. I want to make this comparison: this is like someone earning $100,000 a year and owing 9.6 thousand dollars. That is your debt. I know my mortgage is significantly higher than that. It would be like Senator Fifield owing $20,000 on his mortgage based on his wage. That is what it is. So when people talk about those massive figures, put them into perspective. You talk about what that percentage means and you give some real-life examples. Anyone would accept that that sort of debt level is incredibly manageable. Gross debt peaked as a percentage of GDP at 18 per cent for the year 2011-12. We start paying down gross debt as a net debt percentage of GDP from 2012-13. Net interest payments in 2012-13 will be 0.5 per cent of GDP. Again, that is like someone earning $100,000 a year and paying only $500 a year in net interest. If you make that comparison, it takes it back to what an individual might own. 


That is not the economy that Senator Nash and Senator Fifield were describing. This economy is strong, and it is strong because of the actions that this government took. When the global financial crisis hit the world, we were quick to act because we did not want to see the ravages from massive unemployment that would follow. We decided that we would stimulate the economy—and I will talk about that in a minute. But what did the Liberal-National Party do? They actually voted against that. They said, 'Let the market rip.' Let us look to Europe—



Senator Humphries interjecting—




Senator MARSHALL:
  Sure, Senator Humphries reminds me that in the first tranche they were supportive of some stimulation, but of course they rejected the bulk of it. They rejected what was absolutely necessary. We would have seen that stimulus completely wasted if we had not followed what the Reserve Bank governor of the day said to do, which was: if you do not spend enough early you will end up spending much more later. We took advice from Treasury and from the Reserve Bank and spent the necessary money to protect this economy. We know—and all the Treasury modelling shows this; you will only have to look at the graphs—that when the private sector investment was removed from the economy, the stimulus investment filled that gap. We actually saw that. 


I know how many jobs it saved. You can look at the Treasury modelling and see that it was in excess of 200,000 jobs. I know this from personal experience because I have opened many, many BER buildings. This was a fantastic program of $16.2 billion of unprecedented spending in our education sector to support the economy. When I opened those buildings the builder would often be there. I would talk to those builders and say: 'Did this project make a difference?' And builder after builder would tell me that this program actually stopped them putting off staff or stopped their companies from going under completely. That was what they would tell us. That is what they do tell us. We know it had a massive impact. We know it saved 200,000 jobs. That is 200,000 incomes that are spent in shops and other small business that then support other employment. It has an enormous flow-on effect. It is 200,000 people that then would not be on Newstart. The impact of saving this country from the ravages of high unemployment not only has untold economic benefit for this country but also gave workers dignity. It saved people from being unemployed. It saved people the worry of having to scratch out a meagre existence to provide for their families.


At the same time—and only a Labor government would do this—when it came time for the government to reinvest in our economy, we picked education to do it in. We have left a lasting legacy. We have built school halls, classrooms, libraries and science centres across more than 10,000 schools in this country. Those buildings will be there for 20, 30, 50 and sometimes more years as a lasting legacy, a great investment in the educational future of this country and of our kids—and it was something that the opposition voted against. It was a great legacy, a great investment in our economy, and it worked absolutely. And it gives you the opportunity to say, 'Oh, what GFC?'




Senator Humphries:
  No-one said that. Don't be ridiculous.




Senator MARSHALL:
  Well, Senator Fifield said, 'Even if you accept that there was a GFC.' Let me say to you that there was a GFC and most of the developed world is still suffering the consequences of it.


Let me just come back to BER building program for a minute. One would have thought that after the Liberal-National Party members voted against that building program, they would not turn up to the opening of the buildings. I did many openings in different areas in seats that were held by the Liberals or the Nationals and saw that the local National Party or Liberal Party member would turn up, stand up there for the photo and want to be part of it. They wanted to be part of saving their community. They wanted to be part of that spending program that supported local businesses, local industry, local jobs and saved jobs, so that money could be spent in local businesses supporting further jobs. They wanted to be associated with that but, of course, when it came time to put the money where their mouth was, they voted against it. It shows the hypocrisy of the Liberal-National Party when all they want to do is talk down the economy—when, as I have already pointed out, the economy is in the best shape of any in the developed world. We are the envy of the rest of the developed world, but all you want to do is trash talk the economy.


You talk about the $120 billion supposed black hole. That is another statement that reminds me of the John Howard statement that interest rates would always be lower under a Liberal Party than under a Labor Party government. It is just absolute nonsense. It is a fallacy. You have used numbers to manufacture this figure for your own political interests. Let us just look at the inputs you have put into that claim from the carbon price. You have used numbers from Frontier Economics, who happen to be a longstanding critic of the carbon pricing scheme. You have made assumptions on where the EU carbon price is right now and transferred that out into the future as if there is no movement. You have ignored the average EU carbon price over the last five years. You have ignored the fact that the EU is now considering policies to bolster the price. You have put the absolute worst-case scenario in those figures.


In terms of the dental care scheme, it is $4 billion for dental care and it is over six years, not the two years that you have put into your figures. Two years is quite different from six years, just in case you thought that was a minor discrepancy, Senator Williams. That is a significant distortion of the figures. But we also know that the program that that will replace will actually improve the long-term position of the budget as well because it brings dental care back to a sustainable level—again something that you have completely ignored.


You spoke about an NDS in schools. You incorrectly attributed the full cost to the Commonwealth where the states will bear some of the costs and you have also included a much faster transition that will cost significantly more than the assumptions made in the budget and the planning for these schemes. So again you have misled. You have cooked the books to get the result that you want to get. Then, of course, you base your figures on maintaining the Defence White Paper 2009 proposals, but ignore the fact that there is a new white paper coming for 2013. So even though you know there is going to be a different set of figures coming out of that, you have used figures that you know will not be relied upon.


This government is returning the budget to surplus on time as promised and ahead of every other single major advanced economy. We are seeing that, despite what even Senator Fifield conceded: that there has been $150 billion ripped out from government revenues due to global instability. We are very proud as a Labor government of what we have done to stimulate the economy. We are very proud that we have put jobs front and centre. We are incredibly proud that we have saved this economy from falling into the recession. We are incredibly proud that we have done that in the worst financial conditions the world has seen since the global financial crisis. The record of this government is incredibly strong in this respect.


Let us talk about those jobs for a minute. Jobs were front and centre and that is why we acted to support, in the face of the global financial crisis, measures that would support many hundreds of thousands of jobs. We have an exceptional jobs record, with this economy creating around 800,000 jobs since this government came to office while the rest of the world has lost millions. You only have to look at Europe and the United States today, where there are still millions of people unemployed as a direct result of the global financial crisis. Look at their result and look at our result: 800,000 jobs grown since this government came to office; millions of jobs lost in the rest of the developed world. We have an unemployment rate at 5.1 per cent, one of the lowest rates in the industrialised world and less than half of that in Europe.


But what is the Liberals response to that? We can probably just have a little look at what is happening in Queensland right now. Their response is to cut 14,000 public sector jobs. That is their response. There is no commitment to jobs from the Liberal-National Party, and that is a fact. Senator Nash talked about facts, and wanted to reinforce all of her claims as facts. Well the facts are there for everyone to see. If you elect a Liberal-National government, they will slash jobs. They do not care about working people, they do not care about the dignity of work, they do not care about the suffering that unemployment creates. And they certainly do not care about the communities and the small businesses that rely on those incomes for those businesses to grow and survive. They seem to forget that jobs are not just numbers; those wages are spent in local communities, supporting local jobs, supporting local small businesses. Those sorts of cuts destroy communities and provide enormous hardship.


We have also seen the government in Victoria, the Baillieu government, slash $300 million from the TAFE budget—sabotaging the educational future of regional and city kids—and we have not heard a peep out of the National Party about sabotaging regional kids' educational futures. It is an absolute disgrace, and the Australian public would be very well advised to look closely at what newly elected Liberal and National parties are doing with jobs, with education and with their own state economies, because that is what they will get if they actually elect a Liberal-National coalition when the next election comes around. I hope Australians will learn from those lessons, and I believe they will stick with this government.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Gillard Government</title>,MOTIONS,18,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-09-13,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:09):  The Labor Party in government always stuffs up our public finances. It always comes down to the coalition to fix up the fiscal mess that the Labor Party in government has left behind. People across Australia instinctively know that the Labor Party always spends too much, which is why it always has to tax too much, which is why it always drives up government net debt, and that is why it always comes down to Liberal and National parties in government to sort it all out, to pay down debt, to deliver surplus budgets, to deliver income tax cuts, to deliver all of these things that people across Australia have become used to from Liberal-National coalition governments.


Instead of strengthening our economy, instead of making our economy more resilient, instead of making our economy more competitive internationally, instead of focusing on our productivity growth, this government has hit our economy with one new tax after the other, with one new bit of red tape after another—in fact, more than 18,000 new bits of red tape under this government over the past four years. You cannot keep adding more and more lead to our saddle bags and think it is not going to have an impact somewhere along the way. When you have a government that keeps putting more lead into our saddle bags, eventually it slows down even the most resilient and strongest of economies.


It is worthwhile at this point to reflect on a bit of history. Back in 1996 the Howard government, as a coalition government always does, inherited $96 billion worth of Hawke-Keating Labor Party debt. It took us 10 years to pay that off, and not only did we pay off $96 billion worth of Hawke-Keating Labor government debt, but we also delivered surplus budget after surplus budget, we delivered income tax cut after income tax cut, we delivered genuine tax reform through the introduction of the GST, which replaced wholesale sales tax, which was inefficient, and a whole series of inefficient state taxes. We also left the budget in the best shape of any budget in the history of the Commonwealth. When we left government in 2007 the budget was $22 billion in the positive. We had a $22 billion government budget surplus. There was no government net debt—zero—. There was $70 billion worth of Commonwealth net assets, and the government in 2007 was collecting more than $1 million in net interest payments from the net Commonwealth assets that had been invested.


In just under five short years, this government has completely turned that around. In less than five short years, we are now looking at a situation where this government has delivered $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits, where this government is heading for $145 billion worth of government net debt, and instead of collecting $1 billion in net interest payments from the investments in the Future Fund, this government is planning to spend nearly $30 billion just to pay the interest on the debt that it has accumulated over the past 4½ years. Just imagine what the government could do with $30 billion if it did not have to spend it on interest payments to service that debt that it has accumulated over the past few years.


This is not enough for this government—$174 billion worth of accumulated deficits, $145 billion worth of Commonwealth net debt is not enough; they have to go harder. In the few months that might be left for this Labor government, they are thinking: 'We've got to be true to ourselves; we've got to be true to our DNA. We've got to go harder when it comes to the reckless spending.' So in the last few weeks they have been spending like drunken sailors. Spending commitment after spending commitment after spending commitment—all in relation to meritorious issues. We are not questioning the issues. There are a lot of things that would be nice to have but, ultimately, the question is whether we can afford all of the spending commitments that are being locked in by this government right now. That is why we are now looking at a $120 billion budget black hole under this government, which comes on top of the $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits.


We have a government that spends too much, which is why it always has to cast around for more cash, which is why it is always coming up with yet another ad hoc tax grab—some of them retrospective in order to really make sure that it really collects a lot of money—and which is why it is always looking at borrowing more money and pushing up the levels of debt.


On top of all of that, we have a government with a Treasurer who hates success, who hates successful people. Not just through his rhetoric is that blatantly obvious; it is also obvious through the policy initiatives that have been pursued by this government over the last 4½ years that invariably seek to penalise success. The truth of the matter is that, for Australia to be successful, we need the Australian people to be successful. For Australia to be successful, we need Australian businesses to be successful. To hit them with tax after tax after tax and with 18,000 new pieces of red tape is not the way to incentivise and encourage success.


We have a Treasurer in Australia who is somehow inspired by Bruce Springsteen to actually go after people who are successful. This is a Treasurer who does not really seem to like success. That is not the way to take Australia forward. As a result, this is a government that is taking Australia in the wrong direction. We are now less competitive internationally than we were 4½ years ago. The cost of business has consistently gone up and up and up. It is now harder to attract investment into Australia than it was 4½ years ago and, of course, that will have significant medium- to long-term consequences for Australia and for our economic prosperity moving forward if it is not corrected by the next government very quickly.


Under this government, over the last 4½ years we have had 26 new or increased taxes. Obviously, the mining tax and the carbon tax are the most high-profile taxes, but we have had a whole series of others. The first big tax grab, the first big lazy cash grab, was the alcopops tax in April 2008. That was going to fix binge drinking—there would not be binge drinking anymore as long as we put in place a 70 per cent increase in the form of the alcopops tax. We had the condensate tax; we had the increase in the luxury car tax; we had the flood tax, the mining tax and the carbon tax; and we had successive increases in tobacco taxes. Despite all of these increases in taxes and despite the best terms of trade in 140 years, over the last 4½ years this government has not been able to balance the books. So when we are talking about $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits under this government, which are there in black and white for all to see in the budget papers, it comes after and despite 26 new or increased taxes and it comes despite the best terms of trade in 140 years.


We have had ad hoc tax grab after ad hoc tax grab to feed Labor's addiction to wasteful spending. They are still not on top of it and they are still dealing with budget deficit after budget deficit. And, with a $120 billion Labor Party budget black hole moving forward, guess what? There will be more from where the others came from. There will be more new taxes and there will be more new debt in order to fund the spending spree of the last few weeks. One of the things that the Labor Party are particularly bad at is coming up with a tax that actually leaves the budget better off.


You would think that, if a government comes up with a new multibillion dollar tax, if a government has a significant fiscal challenge, if a government is looking at a gaping big hole in its budget—a government that has $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits—like the mining tax, the least it would do is use it to help bring the budget back into surplus. But, no, this government is so good at spending. It spends faster than it can bring the money in, which is why the mining tax—that is, the mining tax revenue minus the cost of all of the related spending commitments and various measures—left the budget worse off than when the mining tax package was announced.


How can you do that? How can you come up with a multibillion dollar new tax which has massive implications for a very important industry for Australia and end up in a situation where the budget will be worse off to the tune of $4 billion over the forward estimates, and even more worse off over time because the revenue from the mining tax was always going to moderate whereas the cost of the related spending commitments was always going to go up? There is much wrong with the carbon tax and the mining tax. Without getting sidetracked by the detail of everything that is wrong with those taxes, the carbon tax package leaves the budget worse off too. The government aims to collect $25 billion over the forward estimates, but it has already spent $30 billion. There are all these new taxes and still the government is going deeper and deeper and deeper into the red. No wonder this government is not able to ever balance the books.


Since the government announced the mining tax and the carbon tax, they have been confronted with a few developments that are further undermining their fiscal position. There are serious doubts over the revenue the mining tax will raise. There is no doubt in our mind that this is because, firstly, the government seriously overestimated the commodity price assumptions and production volume assumptions underlying their mining tax revenue estimates. Secondly, because of the direct incentive the federal government has given to state governments to increase their state royalties on iron ore and coal, given that the federal government is going to credit royalties on iron ore and coal against any mining tax liability, the revenue will again be less than they thought. Since the dodgy mining tax deal was negotiated exclusively and in secret between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the three biggest mining companies, five out of six states have increased state royalties either on iron ore or coal—five! Both Liberal and Labor governments have increased royalties on iron ore or coal since Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard signed that dodgy mining tax deal. Western Australia, of course, removed the concession on iron ore fines, which is an effective increase in the royalty rate. South Australia increased royalties on iron ore. Tasmania increased royalties on iron ore. New South Wales increased royalties on coal. Queensland on Tuesday announced an increase in the royalties on coal. When Tasmania and South Australia increase their royalties nobody takes any notice, because the volumes are actually very low. When New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia increase their royalties, it has a more significant impact. Fundamentally, the way the government have structured their mining tax deal has exposed the federal budget to structural risk, and it is a structural risk of the government's own making, because the government's budget is now hostage to decisions by state and territory governments to increase their royalty arrangements.


They have removed the floor price on carbon. They still want us to believe that their expectation is that in 2015-16 the carbon price will be $29 a tonne. If that is what they truly believe, if they truly believe that the carbon price in 2015-16 will be $29 a tonne, why did they see the need to remove the floor price at $15 a tonne? Because they know what experts around the world know: that the international carbon price in 2015-16 is not expected to be anywhere above $10 a tonne. That is another massive budget black hole, because the revenue will be significantly lower than what the government thought it would be.


Then we have the spending frenzy that has been happening in the last couple of weeks. Everybody knows full well that this government do not have a clue as to how they are going to actually fund all these promises that they are making. It seems that this government have completely given up. They do not actually care whether they need to somehow come up with the money to fund all of the promises they are making—otherwise, you would think that the health minister and the Prime Minister would be on the same wavelength when they explain how they are going to fund the dental scheme. You would think that the Prime Minister going to the National Press Club on a Monday lunchtime to outline the government's response to the Gonski report would actually say where the money was coming from to fund all the promises that she is making in the context of education. But, no, there is none of that. We just get spending promise after spending promise without any indication whatsoever as to how the government are going to fund them.


The government wants us to believe that everything is going to change this financial year, that this financial year is going to be totally different from last year, the year before that, the year before that and the year before that—in fact, that this year's budget is going to be a completely different budget from any Labor budget for the last 20 years. The government wants us to believe that this year we are going to have a $1.5 billion surplus. It ain't gonna happen. It ain't gonna happen unless the government comes up with some very serious spending cuts in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The other alternative, of course—the one the government pursues quite readily—is it goes for some more massive increases in the tax take.


The reason I can say that with a lot of credibility is because I look at Labor's track record. Look no further than the last financial year. Back in July 2010 the Treasurer told us that the deficit would be $10 billion—that we were back on the path to an early surplus by 2012-13. So the deficit in 2011-12 was only going to be $10 billion. But six months later that was $12.3 billion, six months after that it was $22.6 billion, six months after that it was $37.1 billion and another six months after that it was $44.4 billion. Within less than two years the deficit for the last financial year had blown out by $34.4 billion. It has more than quadrupled. And this government want us to believe that they are going to deliver on a $1.5 billion surplus in the context of these revenue write-downs and the spending sprees that we have just experienced in recent weeks! Give us a break—it ain't gonna to happen. In fact, senior economists have been telling us that in their assessment the government are currently on track to deliver a deficit this year of 1.5 per cent of GDP, or in the order of $21.6 billion. It is time for the government to come out with some answers. It is time for the government to come clean.


In the short time that is left to me I want to touch on some of the comments that Senator Marshall made. Senator Marshall was suggesting that debt was low in Australia by international standards. That is true, because our starting position in Australia was very different from the starting position in the countries of Europe and in the US. In Europe and in the US they have been at it for longer—the high spending, the high taxing and the high levels of red tape. They have been at it for longer. This government is working very hard to catch up. But, yes, it is true, even this government in 4½ years has not quite been able to get to the incredible levels of debt that we have seen across large parts of Europe. But do not get too cocky about it because, if you look at where Ireland was four or five years ago and where we are now, it does not take much to actually significantly change that particular proviso. Senator Marshall says that net debt will peak at 9.6 per cent. That was before the latest spending spree. That was before the latest revenue write-downs.


Let me make one more observation about this assertion that Senator Marshall made that somehow the reason the government is in bad shape financially is that the revenue has collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis. That cannot be true for the 2011-12 financial year, because for the first budget after the global financial crisis—the 2009-10 budget—Treasurer Swan estimated that the revenue from 2011-12 would be $310 billion. It ended up being $330 billion. That is a $20 billion increase in revenue for that year compared to what he thought. Just because he inflated his expectations along the way does not mean that revenue has collapsed. It only means it has collapsed against his excessive expectations.


I am going to run out of time. There is much more to be said about the mess that Labor has created and there is much to be done to fix it up. Only a coalition government will fix up Labor's fiscal mess.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-09-13,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:29):  Senator Cormann talks about not getting too cocky. I think there is probably nothing more cocky than a Liberal senator in this place talking about fiscal management and managing the economy when they have a confirmed unfunded promise of a $70 billion black hole. They have very little credentials when it comes to talking about our economy. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, has admitted that he is not interested in economics or the views of economists—as we can all remember. It was not that long ago that the Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that he was not interested in economics or the views of economists and yet, interestingly enough, we have a debate by Liberal senators on the economy, on the budget and on fiscal responsibility when we know that they certainly do not honour the Charter of Budget Honesty of their former Treasurer, Peter Costello. Instead of actually following that charter of budget honesty, they would prefer to have their costings done secretly behind closed doors by nothing greater than some kind of catering company or an accountant or the like so that nobody knows how their costings were worked out—nothing to do with abiding by the principles of the Charter of Budget Honesty, given the charter was something espoused by their former Treasurer, who they talk of so highly.


Well, we are very much committed to that charter of budget honesty. We are also very much committed to returning another surplus, as we have already done this financial year. We know when it comes to surpluses—and we have heard a lot in this place about the issue of surpluses—that the opposition are not interested at all in surpluses. In fact, Tony Abbott has walked away from a budget surplus. He said something like 'we will get back to surplus as quickly as possible' but he will not even put a date on it. Why is that? We know it is because the Liberal Party do not have any real strategy about how they are going to govern this country and about what their real policies are. They do not have any real policies. They do not have any real costings other than black hole costings. They do not have any real savings. They do not really have any leadership when it comes to the issue of the economy or the policies that are needed to drive Australia forward.


We know very much, though, that the first actions of an Abbott government will be to look at things like reversing income tax measures for families, higher taxes for small business—but tax breaks for big mining companies of course—lowering pensions and lowering superannuation for working Australians. These are things that are not good for Australians and Australians are very much aware of some of these things.


As I touched on, we have a confirmed unfunded promise of a $70 billion black hole, something that has been confirmed by Andrew Robb and Joe Hockey, who have both said that the coalition would have to find some $70 billion in cuts to services—a slash and burn approach, of course, just like we are seeing a number of Liberal premiers doing at the moment. Dare I say it, we could be looking at the slash and burn approach of Premier Campbell Newman in Queensland. When it comes to skills, he is cutting the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program of $287 million. They are talking about breast-screening programs as well and the public service is taking a huge cut. Obviously, these are replicated in Victoria when we look at the TAFE cuts that are going on there. That fits very well with the mantra that has been coming out of the federal Liberal Party from the mouths of Mr Robb and Mr Hockey. We know that on 12 August 2011 Mr Hockey said on the Sunrise program:


I will tell you what we are doing. We are going through the budget, line by line and item by item. The government will spend -Liberal or Labor-will spend $1500 billion over the next four years. It is a massive amount of money. Therefore finding 50, 60 or 70 billion is about identifying waste and identifying areas where you do not need to proceed with programs.


Well, before they even start, the $70 billion that they have admitted that they need to find in savings in fact translates into the equivalent of the cost of Medicare payments for four years or halting all age pensions for two years. These are dramatic cuts that the federal Liberal Party are saying that they themselves will need to find. Then they have the audacity to come in here and talk about the economy and talk about fiscal management when that kind of fiscal management is certainly something that this country does not need at all.


I noticed recently the Leader of the Opposition was in my home state of Tasmania and he put out a press release on 25 August this year in relation to the coalition's supposedly forward-thinking working group to grow Tasmania. Part of this working group that the Leader of the Opposition talked about creating will 'create jobs'. He says it is a working group for Tasmania that is going to create jobs. Let us look at the factor that it is going to 'create jobs'. One thing we know is that the opposition is going to turn back the clock when it comes to carbon pricing. What is that going to do? We have a whole new economy and we are creating jobs in this new economy and in this new sector through renewable energy and in my home state of Tasmania the creation of jobs around renewable energy is a really important factor. We have the Mussleroe wind farm and we have another wind farm—they are in the north-west and the north-east of the state—and it is all about creating jobs and creating renewable energy for the future. Of course, it is renewable energy that we can then sell back into the grid of which we are part of in the mainland. So it is about creating jobs around renewable energy for which the carbon pricing's Clean Energy Package provides as big polluters change their behaviour, as the need for new kinds of energy come on board and are doing so through things like the ARENA board approving such new renewable energy schemes. It is all a really important factor that is going to create jobs. But if the Leader of the Opposition is elected to govern this country he will turn back those. His working group that will create jobs is a very interesting piece of rhetoric indeed. 


What is the alternative? The alternative is incredibly stark. We have a very forward-thinking Gillard Labor government that is embarking on the new economy and a whole new agenda, one that we need to embrace like the rest of the globe is doing. In the meantime, we are doing it in a fiscally sensible way, in a way where we continue to ensure that we return the budget to surplus. Our economy is envied around the world because we got through the global financial crisis and with that have come some great benefits for Australians and Australian families—things like the tripling of the tax-free threshold. These are the things that are really at risk here.


We had a tax-free threshold of $6,000 and this government have now tripled that to $18,200. That means many Australians who earn up to $80,000 will get a tax saving, but many also will not have to put in a tax return because they will be under the threshold and will not have paid tax. This is the largest increase to the tax-free threshold in many years. It was not something that we just thought was a good idea, that the Gillard Labor government introduced and thought was a good idea; it was very much embraced and those in the NGO sector knew that this was needed and something that would benefit many low-income Australians, of which there are many in my home state.


This is one of the largest tax cuts for low-income earners that this country has ever seen. What does it mean? It means that a mother with some part-time work will get a tax cut of $600 if she earns $20,000 and $503 if she earns $25,000. That is significant for low-income earners. On top of that, there is the new schoolkids bonus, which has already been automatically provided to many Australian households. In fact, in Tasmania I know that 34,000 families have benefited from that cash bonus—another really important, positive reform by the government.


Through the Clean Energy Supplement, something we know will be rolled back under a coalition government, we have seen a 1.7 per cent increase to pensions, allowances and family payments. All these things will be in jeopardy under a coalition-Abbott government, as it searches hard to find its $70 billion of savings, which Mr Hockey and Mr Robb have said that they need to find. These are the things that will be cut. These are the things that will really affect average Australian families and average Australian pensioners if the disastrous event of a coalition government were to occur. 


We are not just looking at the needs of Australians here and now; we are also looking into the future. Of course that is what the clean energy package is about. Of course that is what carbon pricing is about—which is why so many other countries are doing it as well, to address global warming. We are also looking at the fact that we are living in the Asian century. There have been a number of academic writings on the fact. There has been a lot of debate and discussion about the growing economies in the Asian region. We are in the Asian region. We are neighbours of Asian countries. Not only will we benefit from our Asian neighbours; they will benefit from our relationship with them in the areas of clean energy jobs, technology and skills and so forth. 


Part of being in an Asian century is building a new economy. What does a new economy look like? What are the things that Labor have started to get on with to ensure that we have a strong, robust, new economy and that we embrace the future—not one that looks back to the 1950s and turns back the clock, ensures we do nothing and only protects the biggest mining companies in the country while the rest of the country can find their own way? No, we are looking forward to things like the National Broadband Network to ensure businesses are more productive and that we can deliver better government services to them. We have brought in the minerals resource rent tax to increase retirement savings, provide tax relief to small businesses, which are not in the mining boom fast lane, and invest in the critical infrastructure that this very large country needs—as well as the ongoing upkeep of that infrastructure. 


On top of that, we are increasing our skills base through trade training centres, historic reforms to our skills system and an expanded education system from primary to tertiary with the national curriculum, equipping Australia for current and future jobs, and looking ahead to ensure that Australia builds on the new economy and builds a bright future for ourselves and our children. That means looking at the Gonski review and continuing to improve our school and early childhood education. We know that the research says that the early years are critical to childhood development and that is an area where we have invested heavily. It includes ensuring children's health is kept at a pace that is required through good dental care, something that was neglected under the 11 years of Howard. He abolished the Commonwealth dental scheme—it did not matter that teeth were part of the human body; they were excluded and did not matter, and that cost families a lot of money to ensure that their children were provided with the necessary care. 


We are returning the budget to surplus on time and as promised, and ahead of every major advanced economy. That is an enviable position to be in. It is a little rich for Liberal senators in this place to talk about budget blow-outs, not meeting surpluses and all these sorts of things when they are the ones who need to look in the mirror. Mr Robb and Mr Hockey have said, time and time again, on NewsRadio, on Sunrise, on ABC News 24 and on a number of media outlets that they are going to have find $70 billion worth of savings, that they will not be returning any budget to any surplus any time soon. Of course, that is in stark contrast to the strong economic position that Treasurer Wayne Swan has us in due to the good, responsible decisions we have made in ensuring that we can be fiscally responsible for our country under a new Australian economy. What does that really mean? We have delivered savings of $33.6 billion in the last budget and more than $100 billion over the previous four budgets to fund the important priorities of dental health, education, the NBN, increasing our skills base and so on by looking at our priority areas that really matter for our nation's future. That is what good Labor governments do. They look at the things that matter. They look at the issues that matter for the Australian people and for our country and they act accordingly. And they look ahead, they look into the future. They are progressive, not regressive. They are not looking backwards into the 1950s. They do not say: 'We should put our heads in the sand. There's global warming but we're just not going to do anything about it. Don't mind the rest of the world acting on it; we'll just put our heads in the sand.'


No, that is not what good Labor governments do at all. They look at the areas of reform that are needed for our country, that are needed desperately for the Australian people, for our families, for our newly arrived migrants who are helping build our country, for our refugees—all the people who make up Australia, this great multicultural nation that I am so proud to live in. And I am so proud to be part of a Labor government that is inclusively ensuring that everybody has the opportunity to succeed, to achieve and to have a good, strong, decent, healthy life, an education and all the benefits that we all enjoy so much.


I find it a bit rich that the debate from those opposite is so fixated on issues on which they themselves do not have good standing. Let us look at workplace relations. I could talk all day about workplace relations and the opposition's Work Choices policy. It helped them lose government. Their own Prime Minister could not hold his own seat as a result of their diabolical policy that was going to rip decent wages and conditions away from working families. That still exists somewhere over there in the ether of the Liberal Party. We know that some of them want it to raise its ugly head from time to time; it has not completely gone away. That is just one area of policy. Where do the Liberals stand on workplace relations? No-one really knows, but I know that the future certainly is not bright.


And then we can go to health and look at the areas we have invested in—GP superclinics, increasing hospital beds and mental health. Mental health is an incredibly important area. These days we are happy to talk about it; we find it much more comfortable to talk about than we did in times past. We can look at infrastructure. The broadband network is another area they are not interested in and want to turn back. Even senators from regional parts of the country are not interested in the National Broadband Network.


Of course, I have already touched on how we have such a strong fiscal position compared to the black hole of those opposite. And then there are the really important ongoing factors around the cost of living—family tax benefit increases, age pension increases and the introduction of a paid parental leave scheme. That is something that after 11 years a Liberal government could not do, leaving Australia as one of only two OECD countries to not have a paid parental leave scheme. We can look at our childcare rebate increases, the environment and climate change. We have done so much and they stand for nothing. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-09-13,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:49):  As an accountant, and also having spent five years in banking, I know that, when people spin you a yarn about the marvellous things they are going to do, there is one way you can check the reality against what they have promised, and that is to have a look at the figures. So we can have a look at the figures to see exactly what this government has been like. When people are listening to this they think a deficit is all your debt and a surplus is all your profits. Deficit and surplus are like profit and loss in a government business—and debt is what happens when you keep on making a loss.


Back in 2008-09 this government basically said to the Australian people, 'In 2008-09 our business will make a profit of $21.7 billion.' What actually happened was that they made a loss, a deficit, of $27.1 billion. It was a loss; they went out the back door. And in 2009-10 they said, 'We'll make a profit of $19.7 billion.' But they actually made a net loss of $54.8 billion. Back in 2008 they said, 'In 2010-11 we'll make a profit of $19 billion.' But they actually made a loss of $47.7 billion. In 2008 they said, 'In 2011-12 we promise we'll make a profit of $18.9 billion.' When 2011-12 came along, guess what? They made a loss of $44.4 billion. What you can see here is obviously that what they promise is never what they deliver. They are so far out that you just cannot take them seriously.


The problem we have got lately is their debt. Back in 2008, Treasurer Wayne Maxwell Swan said that they would just need a temporary increase in the overdraft limit—because they are such good business people! He had a $75 billion overdraft limit, and he just wanted a temporary increase. He was going to have a bit of a day at the shops with his mates—a bit of a day at the track—and he said, 'Can you just bump my overdraft up from $75 billion to $200 billion?—but it's only temporary.' You can trust them; they are such good economic managers!


Then, what happened? The reason they said they wanted this increase in the overdraft is that China apparently was going to go into recession. But, as we all remember, it did not; it never missed a beat. And neither did the overdraft. The overdraft for our nation went up to $200 billion and just kept going up. The next thing, they're back: 'We want another extension in the overdraft. This time we want to extend the overdraft to a quarter of a trillion dollars—$250 billion—and then we can talk about our debt just like the Europeans do, in portions and fractions of trillions.'


So then we had a quarter of a trillion dollar overdraft. And that was as bad as it was going to get; it was never going to get any worse than that—but, of course, it did. The next thing, they are back, saying, 'We want another extension on the overdraft'—this time to $300 billion. And the latest we have heard is that their figures are out the door by, in forward projections, $120 billion.


What does this mean for our overdraft at the moment? They said they would never get close to a quarter of a trillion dollars. Well, the prediction is that the overdraft for our nation is now going to be, by 2020—even on the most conservative estimates—around about $370 billion. How are we going to pay this money back? Where is the money going to come from? Every time, for years, they would go to the doors and hear, 'It's out of control', and always we would get the same thing: 'Don't worry; trust us. It's all under control.'


They borrowed an extra $2 billion four weeks ago. The next week they borrowed an extra $2 billion. I'll grant you, last week they paid back one. These are the people who promise us they are going to have a surplus—that this year we will be in surplus. They try to trick you that they have delivered a surplus, but of course they have not; it is just another one of their promises.


And in the midst of this, what did we get, for all that money they borrowed? What did we get? Where is it? We could have bought a couple of Central African republics for that money. What did we get? We got ceiling insulation, and we got school halls. But you would expect that with that sort of money there would be inland rail, massive ports, massive new dams, freeways—but nothing; there is nothing there. They have just put it all up against the wall. And now they are panicking, having to freeze spending to regional Australia. And then Minister Crean comes out and says, 'It's not a freeze; it's a stocktake'—it is like they are running a corner store, and they are going to have a stocktake. But why do you need a stocktake? Don't you know what is in your budget? They say, 'We're trying to get some more transparency on it.' This stocktake sounds awfully like delay to me. It sounds awfully like you are not going to spend any money, to me. And of course it is because the panic is setting in. All of a sudden it has become apparent that they are running out of money, that they are getting towards their next overdraft limit. All of a sudden it really is starting to become a concern.


These people went out the back door when the prices of commodities were at a peak. When it was actually boom times, they went out the back door. How on earth are they going to manage the show when it is struggle time, when there is a peel off in commodity prices? And that is happening right now. How are they going to manage it? What they have done thus far has been an absolute circus, and the circus is never better reflected than in the carbon tax. These people cannot hit one target. If they were a credit paper, you would reject it. They have not been able to hit one target of one promise. They have not come within a bull's roar of delivering one promise—but they are, apparently, able to cool the planet. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Treasurer Wayne Swan can cool the planet.


So we are going to get ourselves a carbon tax, because—you have to understand—it is morally right to be poor! It is morally right that we should make you poorer, that we should go to people and say: 'You know what? We don't think your power bills are dear enough; we're going to jack them up a bit, because we've got to look after the Greens'! They say: 'We don't believe that it's morally right that we should have a competitive price for power to keep manufacturing in Australia, because we've got to look after the Greens. We don't believe it's morally right that you should have the capacity to buy cheap fertiliser—something that has a high usage, and creation of it creates a higher usage of carbon emissions—we're going to make everything dearer.'


And as if it could not get any more insane than what it currently is, the way they are going to do it is to buy carbon permits—of course!—this fictitious market that we are going to indulge ourselves in. So, as you are getting poorer in Australia, you can live in the happiness—in that warm glow—that the money is going out of your wallet and to a trader who is collecting their commission and then sending it overseas to, I don't know, the east coast of Africa, or wherever it goes, so that you can know that you are poorer for the sake of a trader who is buying some fictitious permit from some place that you have never ever been to and will never ever go to! And of course, this all makes sense! In this Wayneonomics world, this all makes sense. It is just another promise that you can believe from the current Labor Party government. But the ultimate test: I do not think they are actually going to cool the planet. But I will tell you what is real: their debt is real. The fact is they are making people poorer: that is real. It is a real fact that they have created this debacle of an economy, when they were given so much. All they had to do was sit down and shut up and smile and they would have got somewhere.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:02):  This provides me with an opportunity to comment on and put the record straight on some misinformation that has been presented in this chamber this week relating to two vessels, the Al Shuwaikh, going into the port of Kuwait, and the Ocean Drover, a ship that left Fremantle, discharged sheep successfully at the port of Mina Qaboos, in Oman, and at a port in Qatar, and, upon arriving in Bahrain, there appeared to be a difficulty associated with the remaining sheep. I can assure the chamber that there was no medical or veterinary difficulty associated with those animals. They were the same consignment that had been offloaded in Oman and Qatar. Regrettably, some time elapsed before those sheep were discharged.


The excellent part about this, contrary to the misleading and mischievous statements that have been made in the media and in this place, is that the stock at all times were very well looked after. Their numbers were reduced by a third by virtue of sheep having already been discharged in the other two ports. There was adequate feed, adequate water and the sheep in fact travelled very well.


What eventually did happen as a result of the Bahrainis not wishing to take these sheep—and I assure the chamber again that it was not because of any animal disease circumstance, but certainly a matter beyond that of the shipper or the vendor—was that the sheep were eventually discharged at the port of Karachi, in Pakistan. I compliment the officers of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I know that it is considered in this chamber that I often do not congratulate or compliment those opposite. On this occasion I do so because they worked very diligently. I also give credit to Minister Ludwig. It is a shame he is not here—he probably would not be able to tolerate his joy! I compliment them for the work that was undertaken by the department to ensure that compliance with the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance Scheme was undertaken so that those stock could be unloaded and discharged in the port of Karachi, further to Karachi being approved for that purpose. It speaks to the excellence of the management of Australian livestock handling at sea, the robustness of the relationship that exists and, on this occasion, the diligence of all those involved to ensure that it did.


In the case of the Al Shuwaikh, the sheep were delayed for some time, but there is a memorandum of understanding in place between Australia and Kuwait, as there are with the other importing countries, and that memorandum of understanding was enacted, so those stock were safely discharged in the port of Kuwait.


This allows me to comment on the excellence of the operations run by Australia, overseen by AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, and contributed to by government and by industry. It allows me to comment on the excellence of the quality of the vessels and of the management of the livestock on those vessels. No other country is anywhere near Australia when it comes to the standards that we have been able to establish for livestock handling.


I saw in my previous employment in the oil and gas world a great movement take place internationally with the quality of oil tankers to the extent that now every oil tanker licensed to cart oil around the world is double-skinned. In other words it has an inner and an outer surface so that any leak from an inner surface is caught before it escapes. I hope that Australia's leadership in ship design and ship construction and in the inspection and oversight may become international so that we will not have another suggestion—as we again had, mischievously, from Senator Rhiannon in this place—that a ship that got into difficulties off Brazil and its loss of stock had anything at all to do with Australia. Indeed, it had none. Again, I urge that, as Australia leads the world in animal welfare and husbandry and in management standards in the Middle East and the other markets, we extend that leadership internationally to the shipping process so that the movement of stock around the world is as safe.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (18:20): This report by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into procurement procedures for Defence capital projects has been tabled and distributed and we are starting to get feedback from a range of people on the report. It is another report in a long line of reports looking at defence procurement. You can go back to Mortimer and Kinnaird and there have been other reports such as the report by Rufus Black, looking into accountability within Defence. There have been a string of reports and people have been asking—indeed the committee asked the question during this report—why, after so many reviews and so many reports, are people not happy with how the system is working. 


One of the issues that came to light, very clearly, was that people over many years have looked at the symptoms of failure or dysfunction within the organisation but they have not necessarily identified the underlying causes of that dysfunction. When I talk about dysfunction it is worth noting that Defence produce many good projects. People working within Defence—this came through very clearly in the committee—in the services, in the broader Defence organisation and within defence industry are all working with best intent and best endeavours within the system they have to produce good results. And many of those results have served people in the field well. But the real challenge at the moment, particularly facing the financial pressures that the department is under, is: is it being done as efficiently as possible? Is it good use of the taxpayers' money—is the capital that the taxpayer is investing in defence through the government being productive? The answer so often is no. Some of the projects that were highlighted during the report, such as the Tiger project, were sold to government as off-the-shelf, non-developmental projects, and they have ended up taking many years. Every time you have a delay there are flow-on effects to the services as the chiefs have to rearrange posting cycles and infrastructure plans and extend the life of legacy capabilities. There are many costs involved with that.


One of the prescient aspects of this report, compared to others, is that it has tried to look beyond the immediate symptoms and look at the cause. One of the causal factors that have been identified is the impact of the savings measures that have been made by governments over the last two decades. The Commercial Support Program, the Defence efficiency reviews and many short-term measures looked at achieving savings on a day-to-day basis. That has led in time to some of the failures that we are seeing, like the failure of the amphibious fleet last year. The Rizzo report that followed identified that Defence no longer retained the competence, the skill sets, that it needed to effectively manage the capability it had.


The report also identified that those same capabilities are often required by the Defence Materiel Organisation or by Capability Development Group to accurately identify and assess where there is risk in materiel or equipment that is being offered to the Commonwealth for purchase. If those skills do not exist then people cannot actually identify where the risk is, cannot take appropriate action and cannot set boundaries around schedules. So we are not actually the smart customer that Australia likes to think it is in the defence space. Many of the failures in cost and schedule overruns and capability shortfalls that have occurred did so because of the growing gap between where we think we are as a smart customer and the actual competencies that we have across the three services.


Much of the feedback I have had from people about this report have been comments on the fact that some of these issues have been identified. Some people have said it is a little disjointed, which is probably a fair comment given the nature of the committee, which heard a very broad and diverse range of witnesses and opinions. It is one of the reasons I ended up writing an additional chapter to the report as additional comments—to attempt to bring together a lot of those threads and to address the fact that, if we are going to have sustainable reform, it needs to be for the whole system, and that includes the interface of executive government with Defence.


There are a lot of people talking about a lack of accountability within Defence. Can I say to the Senate that accountability also flows the other way—back to executive government. Every time executive government decides to defer a decision, delay a procurement or commit the ADF to an activity that was not in its plans, there are flow-on effects. The capability managers have what we call the raise, train and sustain function. Those are the investments that we make in people in terms of individual training, collective training, developing doctrine and doing the deeper maintenance on equipment. All of those things get thrown into some degree of disarray when a government makes a decision. So there has to be accountability from the government back to Defence in terms of its understanding of the opportunity cost of decisions that it takes. Much of the poor capital productivity that we see can actually be traced back to government decisions in terms of deferring, not making decisions or changing decisions within the DCP.


We cannot afford to continue down that path. The inefficiencies within the defence department that have arisen out of those short-term savings measures, whereby the service chiefs have been largely disempowered. They no longer control all of the elements they need to achieve their task, and yet we are happy to hold them accountable for it. They need to have control restored over those things they need to do their job. That came through loud and clear from many of the reviews, from the Rizzo review to the Coles review and the Black review.


One of the challenges is to make sure that we do not lose the benefits of standardisation and of a common approach to things like sustainment, procurement and IT and pay systems which were behind the development of the DER and the CSP. There are ways that we can achieve that. Defence already has some models at work, particularly in the aerospace world, where there is a common regulator who sets standards which apply to all three services, even though the service chiefs operate their own aircraft; they have their own air crew. They are separate organisations with responsibility and accountability but they are held to a common standard, and that model can be applied across Defence more broadly.


People often talk about the fact that Defence should be run more like a company. Well, a company works in a similar way. If you are in the finance sector, you have APRA. Most commercial companies look to the ACCC. If you are in the civil aviation business there is CASA. There is a regulator that sets the standard but does not take away from the CEO the full profit and loss responsibility they have. That same model can be applied across Defence.


The other part that we can apply is the concept of governance. The way to get government more engaged and to understand the impact of the decisions they take is to look at the way the chair of a board of a publicly listed company, a private company or an NGO is engaged in an ongoing manner with the CEO and other stakeholders within the company. The chair of the board does not run it; the CEO does that. But the chair of the board sets the strategic direction and he engages with people to understand what is happening inside the company as well as the impacts of the external environment on the company.


If the defence minister was the chair of a defence board whereby the senior stakeholders within Defence had the opportunity to come on a regular basis and present information about what was happening within the department, considerations around capability development and the various implications of delays, he would be far better informed when he came back to the National Security Committee of Cabinet to inform his colleagues as to why a decision should be made or, if it should not be made, what the cost would be either in terms of capability or financially The British have actually gone down this path. After Lord Levene's review in 2011, the British have instituted a defence board, where the Secretary of State for Defence, the defence minister, is the chair of the board. They have the service chief and a person looking after procurement, as well as non-executive directors who sit to provide some broader perspective on good concepts of governance.


There is a lot in this report that leads to and points to the fact that we do need to have a broader debate within Australia about the scope of reform that is required, and not just within the procurement part of Defence. If it is going to be sustainable and effective, it needs to include the whole of the Defence organisation as well as its interface with government. It needs to significantly change our approach to governance. It needs to re-empower the service chiefs.


I commend the report to anyone who is interested in the defence of our nation, and I encourage them to also read the additional comments at the end of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:31):  I rise tonight to make a contribution on one of my favourite topics, which is the electorate of Grey and the effect of the Trade Training Centres national framework, which is providing some significant funding for the electorate. By way of a snapshot, the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program is providing $2.5 billion over 10 years from 2008. Just four years into the program, over 1,070 schools have benefited from around $1.2 billion of funding.


The rollout of the TTC infrastructure has progressed on or ahead of projections and, as at 7 September, 218 Trade Training Centres had already been built, benefiting over 600 schools; 63 are preparing to commence construction, benefiting a further 125 schools; 64 are under construction, benefiting over 240 further schools; and 31 have in-principle funding approval, which will benefit another 110 schools.


This is an important part of the Labor government strategy to encourage young people to complete year 12. Secondary schools with students enrolled in years 9 and above can seek funding to establish new trade training facilities or upgrade existing facilities. By the schools providing industry standard facilities in partnership with local employers, students are gaining skills relevant to the workplace, helping them on the pathway to work and further training.


Importantly, this will boost productivity, give students more options and give them, very importantly, the opportunity to seek rewarding careers. We are improving facilities and providing more opportunities in further education and training, delivering high-quality vocational training opportunities. This is central to our investment in Australian kids and giving them a chance to learn trade skills firsthand. It is abundantly clear that not all of our young people go on to university, and it is particularly important to have these opportunities to identify early in their career path or early in their school path those who want to progress into trades.


The government is seeking to support an achievement rate of 90 per cent of year 12 or equivalent by 2015, and this is a really significant investment in achieving that target. Since 2008 there have been four rounds of funding so far, and as of round 4 there have been some changes that have been made to process the funding approval. Individual project proposals must now form part of a sectoral plan prepared by each education authority for approval by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth.


New processes will see the Trade Training Centres being rolled out in a more strategic way. We will see projects prioritised by various factors, including relative socioeconomic disadvantage and program objectives and priorities. All eligible schools are on the indicative priority list, and all schools can ask their education authority where exactly they are on that list.


This Labor government is taking the necessary steps to address an extremely important issue, which is skill shortage in this country. For South Australia, this has meant that after the initial round 4 announcement 48 projects over 140 schools have been approved for funding. The total funding of these projects is approximately $135.6 million. From the data collected to May 2012, 26 of the Trade Training Centres are operational. In the latest round, round 4, there are eight projects, covering 15 schools, at a funding of around $16.25 million.


A significant number of Trade Training Centres have been announced for and are operational, most importantly, in regional Australia—in the remote and very remote areas. I have had the honour of going to Eudunda and Cummins, both vibrant rural communities in the electorate of Grey. I am looking forward to the opportunity of going to the APY lands in November of this year. It is very, very clear that this Labor government initiative is putting in place great vocational opportunities for our kids in regional and rural Australia. Twenty-nine schools have been identified in the remote service delivery priority communities and 18 of them have received funding from this program. To ensure that the remote service delivery can be funded as quickly as possible, $16.5 million has been quarantined, covering 11 RSD schools not yet funded, at $1.5 million per school, reflecting their higher-than-average cost structures.


Sadly, before the last election the opposition promised to cut over $1.1 billion from the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, robbing secondary students in approximately 1,000 secondary schools of the opportunity to find better pathways to becoming the next generation of electricians, brickies, hairdressers, chefs, carpenters and all those good tradespeople who are the backbone of the Australian community.


It was my great pleasure to go to Eudunda Area School, one of two cluster schools which had submitted an application, along with the lead school, Nurioopta High School, in round 4 of the program. I was up there to do the Building the Education Revolution stuff—the new library, the new classrooms and the new electronic whiteboards that are allowing science classes to be delivered across a range of schools in that area, with one science teacher and four kids in each school, delivering remarkable outcomes. They were extremely excited to have gained the funding to refurbish, upgrade and replace their trade training centre. They were looking forward to being able to give the kids who were not going on to uni, those kids who wanted to get into trades, that leg-up and that bit of training that was going to help them to realise their full potential by delivering qualifications in the rural, agriculture and automotive sectors. Eudunda is not that far from the automotive plant at Elizabeth. In the food processing sector: the Barossa Valley is around the corner, and wine and food are part of the heritage of that area. In the construction sector: you can get a $10,000 grant in South Australia if you want to build a house out in the Gawler sub-belt. There is building and construction activity. In electrotechnology engineering: there is a lot of that going on around Edinburgh in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, and it has given country kids a chance to get a leg-up and training in a vocational trade and to make something of their lives.


Addressing these skills shortages is something that the Labor government is extremely proud of, and I am ecstatic about being able to go along and witness the enthusiasm that the school communities have for these types of endeavours.


Way over at Cummins, on the Eyre Peninsula, there is a BER project—a $2.15 million library, shade structure and refurbishments. Seventy people from the local community came out, everybody had a cup of tea and a lamington, and they said: 'Thank you very much. No-one cares about Cummins but you have done something really good here.' The person who spoke said, 'This is beyond politics; we are really appreciative of the investment in our community.' There was another interesting sideline to that visit. I actually opened the refurbished agricultural trade centre. The kids there are growing their own crops, they are managing their own pesticides to grow wheat, barley and whatever it is that they require, for their aquaculture and their other endeavours. One of the things that I had not seen before, but I am sure that those in the National Party on the other side who know a bit about it, was a led steer competition. There you had year 9, 10 and 11 kids actually growing cattle—actually growing the wheat, the barley, the feed—putting the cattle into a feedlot situation and getting them from a fairly low weight to 600 kilos. No doubt this week they will take them down to the Adelaide show, they will get them judged on the hoof. Then, I am told, they are also judged on the hook. That might not please everybody, but as a meat eater it certainly does not displease me. The proceeds for those things go fifty-fifty back to the school and fifty-fifty back to the provider of the livestock. It was really great to see.
