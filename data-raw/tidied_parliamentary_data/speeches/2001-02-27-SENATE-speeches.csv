"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-02-27,"—My question is directed to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. Is Mr Ian Donges of the NFF correct in claiming that the government's Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme does not provide a full 100 per cent rebate, as was promised by the Prime Minister as part of the GST package? Isn't it the case that the February 2001 excise on diesel was 39.643c per litre, whereas the rebate was just 38.118c per litre, a difference of 1.525c per litre? Hasn't this shortfall on the excise rebate resulted in Australian farmers losing $1 million over the past seven months, as has been claimed by the National Farmers Federation?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Diesel Tax</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2001-02-27,"—I do have a supplementary question, Minister. I note that in your answer you have rejected the claims by the NFF, and I am sure Mr Donges will note with interest your statement that he is wrong. As I indicated, the figures do show a less than 100 per cent rebate. I ask as a supplementary: when will the Prime Minister honour his promise to Australian motorists that the GST will not push up the price of petrol? When will the Prime Minister honour his promise to Australian farmers that they will get a full 100 per cent diesel fuel rebate? When will the Prime Minister realise that whatever political credibility he had in his tank has run completely dry through his habit of breaking promises time and time again?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Diesel Tax</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-27,"—Let me make the point, firstly, that we noted Mr Donges's extremely positive comments in relation to the changes to the BAS, and we welcomed those comments from the National Farmers Federation. Let me say also, just as some background to your question, that if you look back at the basis of what we have done in tax reform, you notice that the farmers and farming interests have played a very important role. One of the things that the farmers were particularly concerned about was getting the embedded taxes out of exports. Much of our farming produce, as everyone knows, is exported with embedded taxes, and the old taxation scheme which we inherited from the Labor Party included embedded taxes. One of the very big things we have done with the tax reform is to remove those embedded taxes from exports.
In relation to the specific question that was raised, the truth of the matter is that this government has delivered on its promises. We have delivered on our promises to the farmers. In relation to rural Australia, very important changes were made which have particularly cut the cost of road transport. As everybody knows, as a result of our negotiations with the Democrats, there were some changes which did affect the entitlement of some off-road users, but the fact of the matter is that we delivered as far as we could the promises to the farmers. The arrangements for the repayment of the diesel fuel rebate have been in place for quite a long time. I am not sure whether Labor proposes to change those arrangements; if so, I would welcome that to be clarified in the supplementary question from Senator Forshaw.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Diesel Tax</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-27,"—The first point I would make is this: try to stay away from the clever lines, Senator Forshaw. I do not think they suit you very much. If I were you, I would stay away from those. 
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! I need to be able to hear the answer.
—Order! I have just called the Senate to order. It is disorderly in the extreme for you to shout immediately I cease speaking.
—I think the record will show that I have constantly pleaded with this Senate to allow the government to keep its promises. I well remember across a wide range of areas—such as industrial relations, Telstra and tax reform—that it has been the Senate which has attempted to force the government to break its promises. 
—The Labor Party. 
—The fact of the matter is that the Labor Party has attempted right from the day the Senate first resumed after the last election to force the government to break the solemn commitments that it made to the people.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-02-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone) to a question without notice asked by Senator Evans today relating to the indexation of pensions.
In moving this, I want to make it clear that this is not about scaring grannies, which is how the minister likes to refer to it, but about responding to the genuine concerns of pensioners that they will not get the full indexation they would normally have got in March when the government deducts two per cent from the increase that should have been paid. When they should have got four per cent, they will get two per cent. 
The minister tries to say that we are misleading on this, because she does not like the impact that this is having out there with pensioners who are going to get less than they thought they might otherwise get. But yesterday she sought to rely on third-party views to endorse her approach. She was very keen to quote the Council on the Ageing, because she said they supported her position. Today when I quoted to her the press release they put out yesterday talking about this issue, she wanted to attack them about when she got their press release rather than debate the merits of the issue. The Council on the Ageing said that the government was loose with the truth. They claim this, as does the opposition. Third-party groups, accountancy groups and aged care advocacy groups are making it clear that the government has been misleading on this issue, that pensioners do not understand they are going to have this money clawed back from them, that they do not understand they are not going to get the full increase in March and that they are going to be most concerned that their relative standard of living will fall because they will not get the full indexation in March.
As I asked the minister yesterday, what amount of the $485 million the government spent on the tax package was actually spent explaining this to pensioners? There was basically nothing. There were a couple of lines under taxation headings in pensioner newsletters, which most people did not read or would not have understood. None of that $485 million was spent explaining the reality to pensioners. They have received no special advice about it and, as I found out in the estimates process, they are not going to receive any special advice about it. The government is not going to make it clear to them what is happening. Pensioners are just going to get less money than they would otherwise have got.
The key point which the minister tries to skate over is that pensioners will get less money in the March adjustment than they otherwise would have received. Instead of getting a four per cent increase, they will get a two per cent increase. I accept that the government says it paid them more in the previous adjustment, but the point is that they are not going to get the full indexation in March; they are going to get half. That says to pensioners, `You're not entitled to the indexation because we think you're living high on the hog now. You've got life easy. You're doing it okay. Why would you get full indexation?' That is the government's message to them. It is saying that pensioners do not deserve the full indexation because the government views them as doing it easy, as having a comfortable lifestyle. The key question is: why aren't you paying them the full indexation that they are entitled to on that date?
Of course, the reality for people on pensions, like the reality for most people on fixed incomes, is that the cost of the GST has been much higher than the averages calculated by the government. They have not been adequately compensated. Those on fixed incomes have much more of their income going on basic services, which have all incurred the GST, and they are large consumers of other services. A lot of elderly people on pensions employ people to do lawnmowing and other service tasks, which of course now have the GST applied to them. All the modelling on people with disabilities and age pensioners shows that they have been hit much worse than the averages the government has been using. So, when the government tries to hide behind the CPI increase, the reality is that pensioners' lives have been badly hit by the GST. They have not been fully compensated, and now they find out that they are not going to get the full indexation in March.
As I said, there are two issues. One is the misleading information or lack of information provided to pensioners for them to understand what is going on—the fact that the government did not give priority to explaining this and, as the COTA says, was a bit loose with the truth. Secondly and more importantly, they are going to be relatively worse off. They are going to have less relative disposable income come March than they had previously, because they are not going to be fully compensated for the movement in the CPI.
Those are the things they know. That is what they will focus on. They know the government ripped them off on the savings bonus. So many of them did not get the $1,000 they were promised. They were promised a four per cent increase in compensation for the GST. Now they find out that they are going to get that for only nine months and the government are going to rip it back from them. They understand that. They understand that they will have less money as a result of the changes made by the government in March than they should have had and that they will be relatively worse off than they should have been. That is what they understand. That is not about scaring grannies; that is the reality. As COTA and every other independent organisation has made clear, the government have misled pensioners.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-02-27,"—I am very sad to have to rise and speak in this debate because I think that I can claim to have taken, over 13 years in this chamber, an enormous interest in issues affecting older people. But maybe we did something wrong by giving that four per cent up-front payment after the GST came in, because we did not know—although we should have predicted it—that the Labor Party would lie about it and scare older people. It was very clear in all the documentation that there was a four per cent increase which consisted of an up-front advance of two per cent and a real increase of two per cent. It was clear in AgePensionNews and in all the documentation on the new tax system—it was in the tax booklet—that we were increasing the pension by two per cent and advancing two per cent. But we did not know that the Labor Party would go around lying like they did about the nursing homes policy. I was so foolish when I was in opposition: I used to look at the Labor Party's press releases and try and make sure I did not misrepresent their policies. How idiotic of me.
But what did Labor do for older people when they were in government? In 1992, they treated unrealised capital gains as income for the purposes of assessing the pension. They had pensioners' incomes going up and down, and pensioners listening out there now will remember that. They will remember too that in the 1993 election they were told that all pensioners would be taken out of the tax system. What happened? Three days after the election, Neal Blewett came out and said, `We made a mistake. We did not mean to say that. We did not mean to say that we would take them out of the tax system.' Those sorts of things went on and on. So I hope that older people remember how badly they were treated by Labor and how badly they are being treated by Labor now as they are being spun furphies and told lies about how we are not giving them the full increase for the impact of the GST. They were given a real two per cent increase. They were given a two per cent increase in advance. Not only that, we again see Senator Evans peddling misinformation about people not getting the $1,000 bonus. It was quite clear that it would be up to $1,000, based on their savings.
The Labor Party do not talk about the fact that we have increased the pharmaceutical allowance and mobility allowance by four per cent and increased rent assistance by 10 per cent, nor has there been any comment by the Labor Party that there has been a 2.5 per cent increase in the income and asset test free areas for social security and service pensions. The Labor Party also does not talk about the fact that we have eased the pension means test, which means that about 50,000 additional people will be eligible to receive a part pension and a pensioner concession card, nor do they talk about the pensioner rebate amount being adjusted to ensure that maximum rate pensioners continue to pay no personal income tax. In addition, the maximum rebate has been increased by $250 a year for single pensioners and $175 a year for each member of a pensioner couple. The Labor Party do not talk about the fact that some pensioners who have incomes have benefited from the personal income tax cuts. They do not talk about the private health insurance rebate. I had people coming in day after day telling me that they could not afford to have private health insurance. More and more pensioners—
—Most pensioners do not pay tax. 
—Somebody is shouting across the chamber that most pensioners do not pay tax. Some pensioners pay tax and they are the ones—
—You said that most pensioners paid tax.
—I did not say that most pensioners paid tax. I said that those that do have benefited. Let the Labor Party tell the truth about our policies. Let the Labor Party for once not scare older people. Let them go out and say what the truth is: that pensioners got a two per cent up-front increase and a two per cent advance on the first effect of the GST on inflation.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2001-02-27,"—Like the last speaker, I am very sad to rise to talk on this today. I am very sad at the Scrooge mentality that is coming from the other side of the chamber. I am very sad at the deceit that the Howard government perpetrated on Australians before the last election when they issued their ANTS package five weeks late so that no-one could have a good read of it and not enough copies were available. It was hundreds of pages long and there were hundreds of pages of supporting documentation but no-one got a chance to have a good look at it. I am very sad to see some of the ministers and parliamentary secretaries on the other side of the chamber stand up and try and say, `But we did tell them.' The truth is that this Howard government was elected by deceiving the Australian public. 
What were the big lies of the 1998 campaign? One was that Australians would be better off. It is clear from the surveys that have been done in the last couple of months that, after nearly one year of the GST, 72 per cent of Australians feel that they are worse off. It is clear from the economic figures coming out right now that the economy has been mugged by the GST and has been forced into a slowdown. The government have misled Australians time and time again. They said that there would be no losers. They said that everybody would be doing okay and there would not be any problems—the no losers chant.
The first of the cruel attacks on the pensioner community was the $1,000 rebate. The lie the government told to pensioners was that they were all going to get $1,000. John Howard went on radio and said, `Everybody is going to get $1,000,' and then after the election he said, `Didn't you read the fine print? Didn't you go and look at the 180-page document, in which on page 142 in the footnote it said that there was some conditions on the $1,000?' That is what the government have done again. They came up with some dodgy figures which were confirmed by Chris Murphy, whose wife works—funnily enough—in the Prime Minister's office. So what we saw was a so-called independent economic commentator verify the Treasury figures. What have we seen? We have examples in the weekend paper. Mr Bill Osborne of Nepean has kept a detailed diary of everything that he has had to spend money on—every item. It shows that he and his wife Ruth paid $720 GST on goods and services from July to December last year. The four per cent compensation that they were given was only worth $375 extra. Mr Osborne said that he was shocked to find out that he was to lose his two per cent. He said:
Even 4pc would not go anywhere near what we paid out on the GST.
The previous speaker, Senator Evans, made the point that the income profiles that were done by Treasury did not apply in this area. Treasury actually said, `We cannot find enough people to verify these figures at the bottom end, those that are going to be the hardest hit.' And the lies are starting to catch up with you now. The people have woken up to you. They know exactly what has happened to them. They know the rubbery figures from Chris Murphy. They know the dodgy figures from Treasury. They know that when Senator Patterson and Senator Vanstone want to stand up and say, `It is a big Labor lie,' they just get their wallets or their purses out and they open them and they have a look and they know who are telling the big lies. They know that they have been conned and they are waiting for the next election and, as one of my other colleagues said, they have their baseball bats out. 
But there is something much worse than this. David Cousins from the ACCC, the GST price czar in charge of these issues, has actually been quoted as saying that it does appear that businesses took the opportunity to raise their prices before the GST came in—the very thing that the Treasury said would not and could not happen and that the ACCC said would not and could not happen. When they did their calculations on taking back the four per cent, they did not cover the fact that, as everybody knows in this country, businesses put up their prices before the GST came in.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2001-02-27,"—Every time in taking note of answers I seem to stand up here and say incredulously that I cannot believe the lies and the untruths that we are confronted with every day of the week. Sadly, today is no different. For the opposition to come in here today as a party and complain about pension increases and promises that have been kept to the letter of the law is just one pale too far, given the fact that when the opposition was in government they never increased pensions until after the CPI and then only according to the CPI. Let any member of the opposition come in here and deny that fact. They cannot deny that fact. That is the principle under which they operated: pensioners would have to pay the price increases, then the CPI would be calculated, and then the pension would go up according to the CPI. Quite unfair. And yet it seems that Mr Crean was able to understand what the government was proposing. It will be interesting to see whether Senator Gibbs has been able to comprehend it. 
Clearly, Senator Evans was not able to do it and that is a very great shame because he should be smarter than that. But the facts sheets that have been distributed—and here we go again with the opposition saying that no-one told them—say quite clearly that the four per cent increase in all social security and veterans affairs' payments are structured so that pensions and allowances are guaranteed to stay at least two per cent ahead of any rise in the cost of living. Interestingly, Mr Crean came out and said that pensioners would be better off. He knew and understood how it was all going to run as well. For the opposition to come in here and say that those who represent the elderly in the community did not understand this and did not know could not be further from the truth. 
I hope that Senator Gibbs does not repeat the absolute and utter untruths that have been promoted here in this place today and yesterday and on previous days via the media because she has been on the community affairs committee and has sat through the estimates process and knows the answers and has heard the answers categorically. I want to refer to the Age Pension News. Let Senator Gibbs come into this place and say that the information that was handed out in the Age Pension News is wrong. The Age Pension News, the June-July edition 1999, says that a supplement that will be indexed to the CPI and paid on top of the basic pension will provide an ongoing increase of at least two per cent after account is taken of the impact of tax reform on prices—a two per cent advance increase in rates to offset the anticipated first-year effect of the GST on the CPI.
Heavens above, the March 2001 increase will be adjusted to take into account the two per cent advance already provided in July 2000, and the March 2001 index relates to the price increases in the six months after the introduction of the GST. I cannot believe that people on the other side are so stupid that they cannot understand that you have—as Senator Vanstone said in question time—an allocation of money that is going to be paid and if you get half of that in advance then you will get the other half by the deadline. How on earth can they not understand that? Why do they want to go out and simply lie about this whole process? What they are saying is quite untruthful.
Equally, why would Senator Evans want to come in here and quote COTA, the Council on the Ageing? The COTA press statement in 1999 quite clearly said that the government has taken on some of the COTA concerns and brought the compensation up to an ongoing pension increase of two per cent in addition to the cost of living adjustments for the GST. They said that the new offer consists of an ongoing increase of two per cent in the pension instead of 1.5 per cent in the original offer. And there they have admitted that that was what was going to happen. Over time the four per cent is adjusted so that the effect of the increase on top of the cost of living adjustment is two per cent. Therefore, COTA understand it, why can't Labor?(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Pensions</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2001-02-27,"—I cannot quite believe what I have been hearing from the other side. Two speakers have said, `Really you weren't getting four per cent. You're only getting two per cent, so now we've got to take two per cent away from you in March.' When this government introduced the GST, the Prime Minister and all of his ministers went all over the countryside telling pensioners they were getting a four per cent increase in their pensions to offset the GST—four per cent. These people live on a budget. They have budgeted for four per cent, and since the GST has been introduced the four per cent has been absolutely eroded. The official ABS statistics show that inflation from June 2000 to December 2000 was four per cent. Inflation is going up to four per cent; by rights, when they get their increase in March a single pensioner should be getting $15.80, but instead they are only getting $7.90, which is $7.90 less per fortnight. That is a lot to a pensioner. A pensioner couple should be getting $26.40 per fortnight, but they are only going to get $13.20 per fortnight. That is a decrease of $13.20 per fortnight. To a pensioner couple, that is a lot of money per fortnight.
The other side have been saying that we have been telling lies. Quite frankly, it is the government who has been telling lies—lie after lie after lie. It was just like this with the $1,000 bonus that the pensioners were supposed to have—the aged person savings bonus. Everybody over 60 was going to get $1,000. What a diabolical disaster that was. Most people got $1. Very few people actually got $1,000. When it was discovered that it was such a disaster, the government did a backflip on it, but of course it was too late—absolutely too late. I had pensioners ringing me up in my office saying, `I'm supposed to get $1,000. I have a cheque here for $50.' It was absolutely outrageous—just another lie to old people and another way of bashing aged people and people on low incomes in our society.
I concur with everything that Senator Evans and Senator Conroy have said today. I have done a summary of what this government has done to people since they have been in government. First of all, we had John Howard saying that no-one would be worse off under the GST. Since then, the groups falling into the pit of disadvantage have been falling like dominoes. We have had increased petrol prices for motorists, and increased grocery, transport and essential services prices for consumers. And the government promised a bonus to all pensioners over 60, which we now know was nothing more than a disgraceful stunt to woo pensioners—the more vulnerable in our society—into believing the Howard government. There was the failure to adequately compensate in the pension increase for the increase in the CPI, and now pensioners are facing a loss of more than $13 per fortnight. The Howard government has a well-established record of bashing pensioners and easy targets in our society. Pensioners buy petrol. They put petrol in their car; the price of that has increased. Pensioners buy food, and food costs have increased.
—At the next election, you people are going to pay the price of this just like you paid the price in Western Australia and just like you paid the price in Queensland when your party was annihilated. When it comes to the federal election, you are going to be annihilated.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-02-27,"—I table a statement on immigration detention procedures, together with an annex to the statement and the report of the inquiry into immigration detention procedures by Philip Flood, AO. I seek leave to incorporate the statement and the annex in Hansard, and to take note of the documents.
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—
Statement by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, The Hon Philip Ruddock MP
Immigration Detention Procedures 
27 February 2001
Mr Speaker
Members will recall that in November last year the Government's detention policy and conditions in detention centres came under attack by some advocacy groups and sections of the media.  Whilst I have always defended the policy of mandatory detention as part of an overall policy designed to protect the integrity of our borders, I have also always asserted that detention must be humane.  In this context, of major concern to me were the many allegations of child abuse and generally of the treatment of detainees.
I was sufficiently concerned about the nature of some of the allegations, particularly those relating to alleged child abuse, that I decided to set up an independent Inquiry.  I wanted to know whether the procedures for reporting  were adequate and whether processes were in place to investigate allegations of abuse.  If defects were found, I wanted to know how we could go about remedying them.
I asked Mr Philip Flood AO to investigate, examine and report on the processes in place for identifying, dealing with, reporting on and following up allegations, instances, or situations where there is reasonable suspicion, of child abuse in immigration detention centres.  I asked him to report on how well these processes had been followed in cases during the past year.  I particularly asked him to focus on any area where he believed processes and procedures needed to be improved.
Mr Speaker, I am tabling Mr Flood's report today.  He has identified areas where things could have been done better and where I am determined they will be done better. I would like to thank him for his thorough and balanced examination of many complex issues involved in immigration detention and for his constructive assessment of what can usefully be done to improve management and conditions.  I endorse the overall thrust of his 16 recommendations.
I can say today that my Department has acted on some, and will quickly implement the vast majority.  In doing so, some aspects will need further examination by my Department, including resolution of legal contractual issues, and I have asked that this be done quickly.
ACM, the contracted service provider, is revising policy instructions on managing child protection issues.  Training for detention staff is being reviewed.  Cross-cultural training modules are a component of ACM's standard training package.  Negotiation of protocols with state authorities involved with immigration detention is a priority for my Department.  My Department's management arrangements in the Woomera, Port Hedland and Curtin centres are being strengthened by the appointment of Assistant DIMA Business Managers.  Attention is being focussed on refinements to case management of detainees and performance management of the contract with ACM.  There have been significant improvements at the Woomera centre during the last year and plans for further improvements are well advanced.  There has also been significant re-engineering of protection visa application processing to expedite the process as far as possible.  I table a detailed commentary on the recommendations.
I will come back later to Mr Flood's examination of the many allegations of child abuse that surfaced late last year.
Mr Speaker, an important feature of Mr Flood's report is his conclusion that, and I quote:  ""There also needs to be greater understanding of the values and concerns which underlie the policies being managed.  The policies give expression to Australia's long-standing and proven compassion and welcome for genuine refugees.  Policies also reflect the conviction that Australia has the right to decide who enters Australia.  They also reflect other concerns including maintenance of Australia's high health standards, prudence about the escalating cost of providing accommodation and facilities for unlawful entrants, disapproval of smugglers duping people about entry to Australia and concerns about the attempted manipulation of our compassion by criminals and terrorists.  This report also reflects another deeply held Australian value, the abhorrence of abuse of children, indeed of anyone, who is held in a detention centre"".  
Mr Flood is in a unique position to make such an assessment.  He has had a long and distinguished career, including as a former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and as a former High Commissioner in London.  He is very familiar with the complexities of public policy and administration.
His report also recognises the complexities of the international phenomenon confronting the Government and my Department.  We are faced with a global issue - people smuggling.  Populations around the world are on the move.  Sophisticated, highly organised criminal networks ply this lucrative and relatively low risk trade.  People trafficking is estimated to be worth many billions of dollars a year.
Between 1 December 1999 and 3 January 2001, 3,796 people arrived unlawfully by boat from a number of Middle Eastern countries - more than the combined total of illegal boat arrivals in the previous three years. 
Who are these clandestine arrivals?  Many are genuine refugees - that is a fact.  In per capita terms, Australia is one of the most generous refugee and humanitarian settlement countries.  We have settled around 600,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants over the last 50 years.
But, Mr Flood notes that amongst those who have arrived unlawfully there are also former terrorists; former senior officers in repressive regimes; people suspected of crimes against humanity; people with criminal records; organisers of people smuggling rackets; people who have ignored or abandoned protection already available to them elsewhere; and people who have been refused migrant visas and then attempted to enter Australia unlawfully.  Some destroy their documents to avoid being identified or arrive with fraudulent ones.  Some claim a different nationality or to be part of a more vulnerable ethnic group.  Some arrive with pre-existing health problems.  Some have no legitimate protection claims.
Mr Flood also notes that many people openly told him that they had paid smugglers $10,000 to $25,000 each to get to Australia.
The Government's overriding objective in these complex circumstances is to guard the safety and well being of the Australian community, while fulfilling our international obligations by an appropriate response to refugees.  Despite what some say, we cannot tow boats back to sea.
Mr Speaker, Australia is spending close to $200 million this financial year locating, detaining, processing and where necessary removing people who arrive unlawfully or work here illegally.  From arrival to departure, an unauthorised arrival costs taxpayers an average of $50,000.  A day in detention costs an average of $105.
And we are not alone - developed countries spend many billions of dollars assessing the claims of asylum seekers many of whom arrive illegally.
This Government has significantly strengthened Australia's response to the record levels of people arriving illegally.
New detention centres will be established in Darwin and Brisbane and older centres, in particular Villawood, will be upgraded.
We have improved coastal surveillance capabilities and dramatically increased funding for overseas fraud detection, intelligence and compliance activities.  People smugglers are prosecuted, their boats seized and destroyed, and they face penalties of up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $220,000.  Overseas information campaigns reinforce the message.
Unauthorised arrivals determined to be in need of our protection are granted a three-year temporary protection visa and during that time they cannot sponsor their families to Australia.
Has it worked?  We cannot afford to be complacent, but there are some hopeful signs.  The number of unauthorised boat arrivals in July-December 2000 is down by 40% from the same period in 1999.
As well as dissuading unauthorised arrivals, prompt return of those not requiring protection disrupts the activities of people smugglers and maintains the integrity of the asylum process.
Efforts are ongoing to achieve co-operation on the voluntary and involuntary return of unauthorised arrivals to their country of origin; on readmission of third country nationals to countries of first asylum where they have previously enjoyed protection; and on transit arrangements.
Mr Speaker, it was the Labor Government in 1992 which introduced mandatory detention for unauthorised arrivals.  They had bipartisan support and bipartisan support has continued.  I am acutely aware that mandatory detention is tough public policy but it is an essential element in dealing with the complex dilemmas and challenges confronting us from unauthorised arrivals organised by people smugglers.  It is sound policy and, indeed, some other countries also facing this issue are strengthening their approach to detention of unlawful arrivals. 
The length of time people spend in detention is often portrayed simplistically as being a result of processing delays by my Department.
The complexity of this issue should not be understated.  The wellbeing of the Australian public is a critical factor in managing this process.  That's why detailed character, medical and identity checking must be undertaken.  The recent detection and treatment of six detainees suffering from typhoid in detention centres reinforces the need for Australia's detention policy.  Remember also that some destroy their documents and we don't know who they are.
Mr Flood acknowledges the complex range of factors outside my Department's control and, notwithstanding this, the significant improvements in processing times and hence reduced periods in detention.  This has come about by considerable extra resources and very substantial re-engineering of protection visa processing - without compromising the integrity of the process.  He notes that 80% of protection claims made by boat arrivals in late 1999 received a decision within 32 weeks and that this had reduced to less than 15 weeks for applications made in late 2000.
I must stress that the Government expects integrity of the decision making process.  Sometimes that may entail extended periods in detention.  Mr Flood says, ""The range of individual circumstances means that there is a wide variation in the periods of detention"".  Nonetheless, since 1 July 2000, over 3000 people have been released from detention on temporary protection visas.
Mr Speaker, the size and complexity of the task of course does not obviate our obligation to ensure humane treatment of those in detention.  In this respect, the Woomera centre continues to attract much comment and has also been a focus of Mr Flood's investigation.  Let me set the context.
The Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre was established in direct response to unprecedented numbers of boat arrivals in Australia in late 1999.  The 1245 arrivals in November 1999 - 355 on one boat - and the sustained high numbers in subsequent months were a new phenomenon - unpredicted and unpredictable.
Contrast this to 1997-98 when there were only 157 unauthorised boat arrivals.  The Port Hedland centre was close to being mothballed in late 1998.
Why the Woomera site?  It is a Commonwealth site and could be developed fast.  It had available infrastructure and expansion capacity.  There was a fully functioning hospital and an international standard runway nearby.  It was an appropriate response to an emergency situation.  It opened in late November 1999, less than a month after its announcement.
Could it have been done faster, better, differently?  Mr Flood says that ""The Centre began from almost nothing in November 1999 and held over 1400 people from February to June 2000.  The immediate requirements were establishing accommodation, providing meals and setting up basic facilities and amenities"".  ""It was a significant management achievement"", he says, ""for the IRPC at Woomera to have been established so quickly"".
Let's look at the facts.  By June 2000, an additional 2250 beds had been provided at the Woomera and Curtin centres to cope with the unprecedented increase in unauthorised arrivals.  The statutory requirement that they be detained until granted a visa or removed from Australia was fulfilled by my Department - simultaneously with the management of two Safe Haven exercises, Y2K preparations and Olympics planning - and also with ensuring efficient use of taxpayers' funds.
Once basic infrastructure was in place, attention turned more directly to improving amenity and security at the Woomera centre.  Most accommodation at the Woomera centre is air-conditioned and there are a range of services including: English classes; education for children; medical and counselling services and a range of recreational facilities.  All detainees may practise their religion.  There are culturally appropriate menus and detainees participate in menu design and food preparation.
Much has been said of the hostile physical environment in Woomera. Shade structures have already been erected throughout the centre and landscaping is planned with a particular emphasis on screening the centre and improving the overall appearance.
Nonetheless, I acknowledge that improvements at Woomera have taken time.  As Mr Flood recognised, the Woomera centre has been ""both an operational facility and a construction site on a parallel basis for much of its life"".  He notes that it took time for ACM to set up an adequate management team and that the centre was handicapped last year by the higher proportion of ACM staff on short term contracts.  I also note with concern that administrative procedures at the Woomera centre could have been better - an issue which both ACM and my Department are addressing.
He refers to a small number of detention officers who have treated detainees inappropriately.  Regrettably, there have been some occasions when ACM staff have demonstrated inappropriate attitudes and behaviour.  I have made it clear this will not be condoned.  I expect unacceptable behaviour or misconduct to be dealt with promptly and firmly. Where there is evidence to bring charges, I expect this to be done also. 
These are all serious matters for ACM and my Department and I am pleased that Mr Flood has concluded that issues of concern have been recognised and steps taken to address them.
At the same time, we cannot ignore the behaviour of the detainees themselves.  The safety of people working in detention centres and of the broader Australian community must also be assured.  Criminal actions by detainees - assaults, arson, riots and escapes - cannot and will not be tolerated.
Mr Speaker, claims that a `veil of secrecy' surrounds immigration detention are simply not true.  There are multiple avenues of independent inquiry - the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.  The media has visited the Woomera and Port Hedland centres.
Mr Flood's was yet another avenue of independent inquiry.  He has made extensive and independent inquiries, focusing particularly on allegations or situations where there was a reasonable suspicion of child abuse during the 12 months to November 2000.  I asked him specifically to look at the allegations concerning a 12 year old boy at Woomera which was of major concern to me and which has received a great deal of media coverage.
Allegations of abuse against children - anywhere - are serious.  It is essential that they be investigated by competent authorities.  The South Australian Family and Youth Services and the South Australian Police found no evidence to substantiate the allegations involving the 12 year old boy.
Mr Flood's inquiry was to ascertain whether such incidents and suspicions were handled appropriately.  He has dealt with allegations in a thorough, even forensic, manner.  He did not accept allegations at face value; he spoke at length to people concerned; examined files; visited all centres and Woomera twice.  This, dare I say, stands in stark contrast with much of the public debate, the freely made allegations and gratuitous comments based on hearsay and an unsubstantiated body of so called ""evidence"".
Mr Flood examined 35 cases.  He has concluded that in all but one case, allegations or incidents involving a reasonable suspicion of child abuse were handled in accordance with relevant legislation and departmental procedures. 
At Woomera, though, he says, ""a serious incident of possible child abuse and the broad question of policy on child abuse were not properly handled"".  He found the case of the 12 year old boy ""a clear situation where the processes set down in legislation and the administrative requirements of DIMA and of ACM instructions were not followed.  In large part the problems were not with the formal agreed processes but that these were not followed"".  He states that ""ACM agrees with this conclusion"".
Child abuse issues and their handling are of major concern to me - they have been and continue to be addressed as a top priority.  I agree with Mr Flood in his view that the way in which these incidents are handled is nearly as important as preventing them in the first place.
Mr Speaker, today I am announcing two initiatives.
Mr Flood rightly concludes that alternative arrangements for women and children detainees is another highly complex matter.
I asked my Department to examine this matter in detail.  While there are significant legal and practical issues still to be finally resolved, I am going to trial some different detention arrangements than those which currently exist for women and children with a view to implementing such arrangements on a larger scale if they prove effective.  I envisage a small scale trial based on voluntary participation.  Before proceeding further, my immediate priority is to seek the views of the Woomera town community.
Completion of upgrades to facilities at Villawood and Woomera over the next two to three months will provide further flexibility to respond to the needs of women and children.  We will establish an area within the Port Hedland centre for recreational use by women and children only.
Secondly, to assist me in the consideration of these and other detention matters, I am also announcing the establishment of an Immigration Detention Advisory Group. Members will have unfettered access to all centres.  They will visit centres regularly, obtain first-hand information and advise me on the appropriateness and adequacy of accommodation, facilities and services at immigration detention centres.
I am pleased that the Group will be chaired by the Hon John Hodges, a former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.  Membership of the Group includes  Dr Mohammed Taha Alsalami, Mr Paris Aristotle, Air Marshall Ray Funnell AC (Rtd), Major-General Warren Glenny AO RFD ED (Rtd), Ms Ellen Goodman, the Hon Gerry Hand and Professor Harry Minas. 
I conclude in again thanking Mr Flood for his valuable contribution to the continuous improvement of immigration detention processes in Australia.

FLOOD REPORT - INQUIRY INTO IMMIGRATION DETENTION PROCEDURES 
February 2001
ANNEXE TO STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER FOR IMMIGRATION AND MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS   

No.
Recommendation
Comments
1
ACM should be asked to issue revised policy instructions to staff to incorporate the requirements of relevant State legislation on child welfare and sexual assault. The draft currently being prepared by ACM should be completed as quickly as possible and issued in all centres.
SupportedACM advises that revised policy instructions incorporating these requirements are close to finalisation.
2
ACM should be obliged to ensure there is in place adequate induction briefing and orientation before any staff commence duty at a detention centre. In particular staff should be carefully briefed on the Immigration Detention Standards. ACM should reinforce existing guidelines to its Centre Managers that unacceptable behaviour by detention officers will not be tolerated. Staff must receive comprehensive training in cultural awareness and guidance to deal with issues of racism, sexism and religious intolerance.
SupportedSelection and training of ACM staff is a key component of the detention services contract.  Cross-cultural training modules are included in ACM's standard training package. The training program for detention staff is being reviewed to ensure comprehensiveness in the areas Mr Flood has focussed on.
3
DIMA should conclude quickly the negotiation of a memorandum of understanding with the South Australian Police and with the police forces of other states in which detention centres are located, to articulate clearly and unambiguously the role of the state police in any incidents that occur at Commonwealth detention facilities which may require police involvement.
SupportedNegotiations with South Australian police are in progress with a view to prompt finalisation.  Development of protocols with other state police services is being given priority.
4
DIMA should clarify quickly the role of State authorities in removal of a child from a detention centre and conclude appropriate protocols with State child welfare authorities.
SupportedNegotiations with child welfare authorities in South Australia are in progress with a view to prompt finalisation.  Development of MOUs with other state child welfare authorities is being given priority.
5
DIMA should introduce more systematic procedures for assessment of incident reports and take steps to address the current variation in the quality and substance of matters being reported across immigration detention centres and the coverage of follow-up action. In addition to the immediate handling of major incidents, there should be a monthly summary for the Minister's office and senior DIMA and ACM management of all incident reports received in the previous month classified by current categories and indicating action taken, pending or outstanding. DIMA should also review the current Immigration Detention Standards in advance of the renegotiation of the service provider contracts.
SupportedIncreased resourcing and restructuring of functions within DIMA's Detention Operations area will ensure enhanced focus on improved monitoring of incidents and on assessment of the performance of the detention services provider.  This includes the preparation of a monthly summary of incidents for consideration by the Minister and senior DIMA and ACM management.Review of the current Immigration Detention Standards in advance of the renegotiation of the service provider contracts will be undertaken with appropriate legal advice.
6
DIMA should strengthen its management arrangements at the Woomera centre by the appointment of an additional DIMA officer to assist the DIMA Business Manager, and should review the need for similar appointments at Curtin and Port Hedland. DIMA should also expedite production of its proposed Business Manager's Handbook.
SupportedDeputy DIMA Business Managers for the Woomera, Curtin and Port Hedland IRPCs are being recruited.A DIMA Business Manager's Handbook is in preparation.
7
The Detention Operations area in DIMA Central Office should be appropriately resourced to enable it to better manage the substantially increased workload that has been generated by the increase in unauthorised arrivals, both in the case management of detainees and the performance management of the contract with ACM.
SupportedThere are now additional resources in the restructured Detention Operations area in DIMA Central Office.
8
ACM should be asked to ensure that fewer of its staff at the Woomera centre are on short term six week contracts and that more are employed on long term contracts.
SupportedACM advises that employees on long term contracts have recently been engaged at Woomera.  Increased numbers of employees will be engaged on this basis.
9
ACM should urgently review security of detainee data and personal files at the Woomera centre and put in place clear policies and procedures covering authorised removal of documents, classification of documents and transmission, copying and storage of documents.
SupportedDIMA will ensure that ACM has more accountable records management procedures in place in detention facilities.
10
DIMA and ACM should make urgent efforts to improve the physical environment of the Woomera centre with improved landscaping, trees, more garden areas and the installation of playground equipment and shade areas.
SupportedOnce basic infrastructure was in place, attention turned more directly to improving amenity at the Woomera centre.  Shade structures have already been erected throughout the centre and landscaping is planned with a particular emphasis on screening the centre and improving the overall appearance.
11
While acknowledging there may be situations where detainees themselves request that their names not be used, sometimes because they do not wish their identity revealed to others in the centre, ACM and DIMA management at detention centres should as far as possible continue the recently revised practice of referring to detainees by names rather than their registration numbers.
SupportedIt is no longer practice in detention centres for ACM or DIMA staff to refer to detainees by registration numbers.
12
DIMA should expedite its examination of the scope for women and children in certain circumstances to live outside of detention centres, while respecting the fact many women and children, especially but not only from an Islamic background, will be opposed to being separated from other members of their families.
A separate announcement is being made on this matter.
13
In its management of long-term detainees DIMA should seek to ensure children are not obliged to spend very long periods in detention at the Woomera centre.
SupportedSubject to changes in the composition of the caseload, best efforts will be made to ensure that children do not spend very long periods in detention in the Woomera centre.
14
The Contract with ACM should be amended to make it explicit that the reporting as such of allegations, instances or suspicion of child abuse has no impact whatsoever on performance payments. Performance payments should be affected by failure to report, failure to report in a timely way and of course by poor management of an allegation, instance or suspicion of child abuse.
Sanctions already exist in the contract for failing to report incidents within prescribed timeframes.  Contract issues will require further consideration including legal advice.
15
DIMA should expedite its processes for quarterly assessment of ACM performance. In general there should be a more pro-active review by DIMA of ACM management of detention centres, with spot audits of specific issues, including welfare of children, health, hygiene, food, etc.
SupportedAdditional resources already assigned will ensure that appropriate timeframes are met as well as facilitate a more pro-active approach to contract management and monitoring, including spot audits of specific issues.
16
DIMA should continue its efforts to reduce the average processing time for people receiving primary decisions on applications for Temporary Protection Visas.
Supported DIMA has significantly re-engineered  protection visa processing and processing times have been significantly reduced.  Many factors which delay visa decisions are, however, outside DIMA's control.

That the Senate take note of the documents.",SENATE,<title> MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Immigration Detention Procedures</title>,Ministerial Statements,14,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2001-02-27,"—This is a report of an inquiry into immigration detention procedures by Philip Flood AO. Mr Flood had been appointed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, to undertake this inquiry, I suppose you could call it, into immigration detention procedures. In particular, there was a good deal of concern expressed to the minister about the number of allegations of child abuse and generally about the treatment of detainees.
The report has been in our hands only for a very short time, and so really I am not able to express my views in detail about the report, page by page. The report will be forwarded, no doubt, to the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which I am a member. I will be looking forward to reading thoroughly the report at that time. We have, as a subcommittee of the parliament, visited a number of detention centres, including the Woomera detention centre, which gets fairly extensive coverage in the Flood report.
The conclusions and recommendations contained on page 36 and following of the report have been responded to by the minister. An annexure to the statement by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has been provided to us. I am not going to delay the Senate any further, since honourable senators have not had a real chance to examine this report. We will do so, but I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2001-02-27,"—On behalf of Senator Payne, I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.",SENATE,<title>SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-02-27,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 [2001], as we all know, addresses a couple of small technical and typographical errors in the Broadcasting Services Act which have come to the Senate's notice since the passing of the digital legislation last year. Also, it provides two other very important amendments to both the ABC and SBS acts. Those amendments relate to the way in which the datacasting regimes of the ABC and SBS are determined. Rather than the Australian Broadcasting Authority having the power to determine the datacasting services of the ABC and SBS, that power is transferred in this bill to the ABC and SBS boards respectively. It is important to create consistency within the ABC and SBS acts. The national broadcasters already have the statutory power to determine their other broadcasting services for radio, for television and for the Internet, and the provision of datacasting and additional digital terrestrial television services should be no different to that. So I am very pleased to see that these amendments have been put up by the government, and I certainly support them.
The government's additional amendments which it has moved to its own amendment bill allow rightfully the ABC and SBS to develop their own codes of practice and complaints handling mechanisms in relation to datacasting services and then to notify the ABA of those. That approach is consistent with the way in which codes of practice and complaints handling have been developed for radio and television programs within the ABC and the SBS, and we welcome and support those government amendments.
These amendments in this bill by the government are extremely important to both the ABC and the SBS, and they should be passed without delay. They are before us today because the minister—and I give him his due in this—in answering one of my questions during the datacasting debate last year, gave an undertaking to amend the ABC and SBS acts so that the ABC and SBS boards could determine their own datacasting services. I thank the minister for being honourable in upholding that undertaking.
I am also pleased that the ALP has reconsidered its position on this issue. It voted against my amendments in relation to this issue during the debate last year, but it is supporting these amendments because it supports the principle `that the ABC and SBS should be governed by reference to their own respective acts'—and I quite agree. So I am very pleased that both the government and the opposition finally agree with my approach taken last year, and that will go through.
In his speech in the second reading debate, Senator Bishop flagged that he would be moving several amendments to this bill—and I would love to go back to that speech of his and make a few comments on it, but I will probably do that at the end. Senator Bishop said that he would be moving amendments to ensure that the provision of datacasting and online services are recognised within the ABC's charter. But I am not really quite sure why these amendments are being moved now. Senator Bishop may not recall—indeed, most senators probably do not recall—that there is actually a Senate committee inquiring into that very matter, and it is being done at the behest of the ALP as well as the Democrats. The committee tabled a draft report in April last year on the first two of three terms of reference dealing with the proposed content deal between Telstra and the ABC for online content. But the Senate committee has not reported on the final term of reference, the most relevant to this amendment, about whether the ABC Act requires amendment to acknowledge online services. Given that the ALP was instrumental, as I said, in getting this inquiry established, I am surprised that it has moved these amendments before the committee has actually tabled that report.
I even question whether the charter is actually the appropriate place for the inclusion of online Internet or digital services to be located. The charter does not specify radio or television services, as it is; rather, it describes the impact of programs, the desirability of programs and the meaning these programs will have for the Australian and overseas audiences who consume them. The ABC charter is not technology specific and, while the Democrats believe the ABC Act probably requires amendment to acknowledge technological advances, I would prefer to wait for the Senate committee before considering these amendments. I also note that the opposition's amendments do not amend the SBS Act similarly to provide for new technological services to be placed within the SBS charter. I would have thought that it would be the view of the Senate that both national broadcasters should be treated equally in this regard. So I think waiting a bit further on that and refining it, taking our time and getting it right, would be the best way to deal with that one. 
Secondly, the opposition will table amendments designed to ensure that the ABC and SBS have unrestricted multichannelling services, a very interesting point for the Senate. I absolutely and fully endorse those amendments. I do not have the stuff from June last with me but, if I am right, they are the same as my amendments and those of last year that the ALP did not vote for. I must make the point that I am extremely disappointed that the opposition did not see fit to support the amendments to allow the national broadcasters to provide unrestricted multichannelling and datacasting services when we debated the digital legislation package in June of last year.
I hope I am wrong about this, but it appears to me that this is just a case of the opposition belatedly trying to pick up on the community concerns about the ABC by presenting these amendments now when they could have supported the amendments last year, when pressure on the government to pass the rest of the bill would have ensured the amendments' passage. There is no such pressure at all on the government with this bill aside from the pressure that this chamber can put on them. There is no outside pressure. There was last year. It was huge; it was mammoth. It would have meant that these amendments would have gone through. Now there is no pressure. That means that these amendments will not go through. They might go through the Senate but whether they go through the House of Representatives is another question. I can tell you the answer to that question right now, and I am sure the opposition can too.
The ABC and SBS could have been free—and it should have been the case—from the ABA's genre and other content rules for multichannelling and datacasting. Under the digital package, the ABC and SBS will, for the first time, have their services defined not by their boards but by the ABA. This undermines their independence and means that these services may not be consistent with their charters. Because the ALP apparently did not recognise the importance of the national broadcaster's editorial independence until last month—and I am glad they have done so, but it is a bit late—they will not have unrestricted datacasting or multichannelling services.
Thirdly, the ALP will move amendments that they say will ensure that the ABC and SBS will be exempt from payment of a datacasting licence fee. I must say that I am a bit bemused by this amendment. I moved amendments to achieve this last year and they were passed. Absolutely everyone who I have spoken to about this, except the opposition, agrees that the ABC and SBS are now exempt from the datacasting licence fee. All the industry players, the public broadcasters and the commercial broadcasters, have told me that is exactly what they understood. They cannot understand why the opposition has moved it either. I ask the minister now if he will confirm that the ABC and SBS are exempt from the payment of the datacasting licence fee under the current legislation.
Lastly, there is the ALP's proposed amendment to the datacasting regime. I have been through those amendments. They are almost exactly the same as those the ALP put up last time as amendments to the datacasting regime when we were debating this in June. There was extremely lengthy and heated debate at the time; there has been heated debate since about these rules. I must say that I am very surprised that the ALP have put these rules up again completely unamended. The Democrats still believe, as we believed in June last year, that there is a fatal flaw in this datacasting regime of the opposition. None of those arguments have changed at all; the arguments are still exactly as they were. We still believe that, under the opposition's regime, there is one tiny little piece that, if passed, would possibly allow another free-to-air broadcast on Australian television that would go under the guise of datacasting. 
We all know the arguments. We have been through them enough in here and outside. The main argument is that in general it is believed by industry players that there is probably room in Australia—with our current level of population and the current advertising and broadcasting regime—for three commercial broadcasters. If a new commercial broadcaster came into the market either that broadcaster would fail because there is not enough advertising revenue available or, if they did not fail, one of the current broadcasters would fail. We are all aware of the players in the broadcasting industry who have content and money available to them. These are players who currently are already major players in the Australian media market.
If the fatal flaw were taken away and those current players were not able to take over a smaller player and start up their own broadcasting channel—to the detriment of someone with less of a say already in the media market—we would be happy with those amendments. But that is not the case. The opposition have not amended their datacasting regime at all, as far as I can see. I think that, with one small amendment, it would be a very good datacasting regime. I hope the ALP agree. I think they do agree it would be a very good datacasting regime; it is their own. I thought mine was better in June, but there you go. I lost that one. I think their regime is still better than what we have but it has this one absolutely fatal flaw that would, in my opinion, possibly lead to a massive diminishing of diversity in control of Australian media. I just cannot agree to that.
I would urge the opposition to go away and think about it again. If they can find an amendment that will achieve that, I will vote for it. I think it is a very good regime apart from that one small thing that they have not amended. If they are not prepared to amend it, and they do not have any ideas that they think are better than mine, then I cannot vote for it. I could not vote for it then, and I still cannot vote for it for exactly the same reasons.
I should mention also that I have just flagged the fact that I have one amendment to this bill that I intend to put up on behalf of the Democrats. We are all aware that there is a small part of the bill that the government has put in—it is in the original bill—that says the multichannelling regime will be changed for SBS in that SBS will now be allowed to broadcast international news on their second channel. I see the minister asking for advice. I hope I have that correct, but I am sure he will tell me if I do not.
One of my main complaints about the restriction on the use by the ABC and SBS of multichannelling—I thought it was quite absurd at the time; I still think it is quite absurd—was that the ABC was not allowed to broadcast domestic news on their second channel and that SBS was not allowed to broadcast international news. It seemed to me that it was obvious that the ABC is very good at domestic and that SBS is very good at international, besides the fact that both are good at the other as well. It seemed a ridiculous anomaly. I am very pleased to see that the government have apparently seen the light as far as SBS is concerned and are, according to this amendment, allowing SBS to broadcast international news on its second channel. I think it is a great pity, though, that they have not done the same for the ABC. It looks as though—I hope I am wrong in this—the government are just bashing up the ABC again. I am glad that SBS is getting something that it very much wants. I think it is a great pity, though, that the ABC is not getting the same thing. I will move an amendment—it was circulated before question time, I understand—that would include the ABC being able to broadcast both domestic and international news, including analysis of items of domestic or international news. I will move that amendment when we get to the committee stage of this bill. 
In closing, I would like to say that I sat with great amusement through Senator Bishop's speech on this bill when he spoke last time. I am so sorry that I did not get to speak immediately after him, because it does lose some of its impact when you cannot follow on with a few items. I recall—I do not have my notes in front of me; I am very sorry about that—that Senator Bishop did mention how the opposition is absolutely committed to the ABC having a really good multichannelling regime. I am really pleased to hear that. He also said they are absolutely committed to editorial independence. I think that is fabulous. The ALP is also, I think he said, committed to proper funding for the ABC. I think that is brilliant. Somebody has to be committed to proper funding for the ABC besides me because, although it is not impossible, I am unlikely to be the minister for communications after the next election.
—I'll vote for you.
—Thank you, Senator Brown. Senator Brown will vote for me to be the minister after the next election. I am sure we could find him a nice ministry, as well. However, seeing that I am unlikely to be the minister, it would be lovely if, whoever the minister is, they wanted to properly fund the ABC. Unfortunately, Senator Bishop may not have read Mr Smith's press release a couple of weeks ago about this in which he said that he was committed to proper funding. But Mr Smith also put a couple of little terms in there which I think I can translate. One of them was—I have it substantially right, I think—`in a fiscally responsible atmosphere' or something like that. I can translate `in a fiscally responsible atmosphere'. It means, `We're not going to do it.' 
I would be very happy if Senator Bishop were the next minister for communications, if he intends to properly fund the ABC; core fund the ABC—not just give them what they need for digital, not just give them what they need to bring their archives up to date and not just give them the third that they already have for the technical transfer to digital but the other two-thirds for that. At the moment they have zero funding for content. Give them everything they need for content. Give them everything they need for their core funding—their core funding needs to be brought up. Anybody who wants to fund them to that extent I am in favour of. I must say I am willing to do that, so put me in that position and I will do it. However, if I am not in that position, I would rather see somebody there who is prepared to do it. I suggest to Senator Bishop that he go back and talk to Mr Smith and pushes himself as the next minister under the next Labor government—whenever it is—as somebody who would properly fund the ABC. I hope that is right.
Apart from that, I think the bill as it stands is a very good one. I congratulate the government on doing it. I congratulate the minister on carrying through with what he said he would do. He is in fact quite honourable in these things, which some people find quite surprising. I do not, of course. But I do get some comment—in my emails from Friends of the ABC, in particular—expressing amazement at some of his more honourable actions. I congratulate him on this. I am not amazed; I am not surprised; I expected this of him. I am very pleased that he has carried through.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-02-27,"—I suppose I should start by expressing gratitude to Senator Bourne for her complimentary remarks. I am grateful that at least someone understands that there is a difference between fact and the reality as perceived by Friends of the ABC who, I have to say, long ago ceased to be interested in constructive debate on these issues; they simply run political campaigns. The only point I would make—which is as much for Senator Bourne's benefit as it is for theirs—is that the critical issue is to ensure that the ABC is able to continue to deliver high quality content. Judgments have to be made by the parliament about the amount that is necessary in order for that to happen; it is not simply a matter of responding to any claimant's wish list. As far as the government is concerned, the test that I think ought to be applied is to look at the quality of programming and to ask whether there has been any noticeable diminution.  
We all know that programs change from time to time but, as far as the government can observe, apart from the perhaps at times ferocious political debate that might surround some of the ABC's actions and activities, as far as viewers and listeners are concerned they still are receiving the programs that they expect to receive and that they have been receiving for many years. The test is not simply how much Quentin Dempster thinks we should give the ABC or how much the Friends of the ABC think we should give the ABC—I have never deigned to enter that debate. They never want to quantify it; they simply effectively say, `I don't care what it is. Give them more.'
I am grateful to Senator Bourne for her as always constructive approach to these issues. I am very pleased to say that we are honouring the commitment given last year, and I can also inform Senator Bourne that the position is as she says in relation to datacasting charges. The Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Act 1998 was amended by the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Act 2000 to limit the application of the datacasting charge to commercial television broadcasting licensees. These amendments were given royal assent on 3 August 2000 and came into effect by proclamation on 1 January 2001. Therefore, datacasting charges will not be applied to the ABC or SBS. Amendment 14 of the amendments circulated by the opposition is therefore quite unnecessary. 
I think it is appropriate at this point to respond to the second reading amendment, which I understand has been circulated in Senator Bishop's name. The government's position is quite firm on calls for the suspension of the auction of datacasting spectrum. There is no need to suspend the auction pending debate on this bill. If the opposition amendments were passed by the parliament, it is likely that the auction process would need to be aborted and recommence once the policy was finalised. The nature of the product on offer would have changed; therefore the documentation for the auction would need to be revised and republished, and new applications would need to be called for. In addition, consideration would need to be given as to whether the ABA determination process proposed would need to take place before the auction. It is highly unlikely that, under this scenario, the auction could be completed this financial year. In any case, the government does not support the proposed amendments. 
It has been only eight months since the parliament considered these issues and rejected the model proposed by the opposition. Senator Bourne is as acutely aware as I am of the wholly false and phoney nature of the proposal that was put forward by the opposition at that time. Whenever Mr Smith was asked by any stakeholder, be it parliamentary or industry, to elaborate on that proposal, his stock answer was, `There is no need to worry about that. That will not become an issue. Let me explain where we are on other matters.' That made it absolutely transparent to all the players—and I mean all those who have a keen interest in the debate, including print and other media—that the opposition has never been serious about pursuing its option B or plan A or whatever it was called. It was simply a shoddy attempt at grandstanding—a very transparent smokescreen to disguise the fact that they were not prepared to disagree with the government's fundamental proposition, which was that there should not be any backdoor broadcasting. 
As Senator Bourne rightly said, if the amendment had got up, you would have been able to drive a coach and four through that legislation. They were absolutely terrified that they might actually get there. I can just imagine that Mr Smith was as pale as a ghost for 24 hours until he saw what happened in the chamber. The last thing on his mind was to encourage anyone to think that this was a serious suggestion. It was simply designed to appear—to one or more interested parties—that the ALP might perhaps do something if they ever came to government. As we know, they would not have the numbers to do it in this chamber, so any private commitment they might have given then, or might be giving now, would meet the same fate. It was simply a transparent exercise in pretending that they wanted to go a bit further. They were locked in, as were other parties in this chamber, to the proposition that there should not be additional free-to-air broadcasting.  
Just the other night, I was looking at remarks made by Rupert Murdoch when he addressed the National Association of Broadcasters back in April 1996. He said words to this effect: `There are those in the bureaucracy who think that the free-to-air networks'—in the US, and of course Fox is one of those—`could well afford to make this transition painlessly.' In other words, they would have to pay for the spectrum that was being put on offer. That is simply not the case. The costs are terrifying. `Terrifying' was his word. If the costs are terrifying there, they are just as terrifying here. The quid pro quo has always been that if there is $1 billion to be incurred by the free-to-air networks over a period, with no obvious increase in advertising or audience share, then they should at least have that period of time before any further licensees are admitted to the game. That, of course, has always been the case. The number of licensees has been strictly controlled since 1956, when television first came to Australia. The opposition knows that as well as anyone else. 
The opposition understood the cost burden on the free-to-air networks and they understood the logic behind the proposition we were putting; they simply put up a form of words and hoped on bended knee that no-one would be silly enough to hold them to it. And of course, as it transpired, they were able to sleep in peace that night. They clearly thought that there was a bit of mileage in an election year in running the kite up the flagpole again and pretending that they were more serious than they were last time, or equally serious. As Senator Bourne says, we know it is game over and they do too. It is just not a serious approach.
Having said all that, these Labor Party amendments to suspend the auction process now on the chance that the opposition amendments are passed by both houses would waste valuable time in getting the datacasting spectrum auction under way. I note with interest that there are seven applicants, with all the usual suspects—directly or indirectly. We believe that process should be able to get up and running as soon as possible, and therefore the government would clearly not agree to the amendments in the other place. We should work to ensure the speedy consideration of this bill to provide certainty to potential applicants. 
In terms of funding the ABC's transition to digital broadcasting, which is part (b) of the second reading amendment, the government rejects outright the opposition's allegation that we have inadequately funded the ABC's move to digital broadcasting. The facts need to be placed on the public record, as there have been widespread claims in the media that there have been funding cuts to the ABC. I think Senator Bourne acknowledges that the funding that has been provided for the ABC in relation to digital—not just content but equipment, distribution and transmission—has been very much in line with their needs. In relation to that, the ABC has advised the government that it regards that as an adequate arrangement. 
In terms of the costs of additional multichannel services—for which it is now suggested in some quarters that the ABC should get substantially increased funding—the ABC advised the government by way of a submission that it could provide a range of multichannel services itself for minimal additional costs, based on efficiencies derived from its radio content, co-location and low cost digital equipment. As I recall, the submission said, `We're not just saying this; we have our own longstanding experience to justify what we think will be involved.' For reasons that have never been explained by the ABC, in its triennial funding submission, the ABC sought funding for a range of digital content proposals, including one relating to multichannel services, for a total estimated cost of $124 million over three years.
There were a range of competing priorities in the budget context, including the digital capital, distribution and transmission funding requirements of the ABC and SBS. For this triennium, the ABC's funding was maintained in real terms. In the 2000-01 budget the ABC received $642.4 million for operating and non-digital capital expenses. The government's priority in the last budget, however, was to ensure that all Australians will have access to digital television, particularly in rural and regional Australia where access to the media is so important. To ensure this, the government has committed to fund the actual cost of the ABC's digital transmission. The ABC's digital services, when fully rolled out, will match the current analog coverage. The government has thus approved up to $1.2 billion over the next 10 years to fund the ABC and SBS digital transmission and distribution services. This will fully fund all distribution and transmission costs.  
As identified by the Mansfield report, the ABC has utilised some of the proceeds from property sales to fund its phase 1 capital costs. It also received a $20 million contribution from the government. The ABC also received $36.8 million over four years from the government in the 2000-01 budget towards its phase 2 capital costs. This is a significant commitment that has not been appreciated or acknowledged in the debate over the ABC's budget. 
Australia is a vast country and the cost of ensuring that most Australians in regional and remote areas have access to the services that metropolitan viewers take for granted is enormous. This kind of coverage can only be achieved through the use of satellites, and many transmission towers are in remote areas which are expensive to service. This commitment to regional viewers echoes that shown by the government's funding of extensions of SBS's analog television services at a further $70 million and the current black spot program addressing reception issues in regional areas. Despite the budgetary pressures of recent years, the record shows that the government has made a very significant commitment to additional funding for ABC and SBS digital services. At this early stage of delivery of digital services, the government has made access the priority rather than the provision of additional content funding.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Mark Bishop's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000 [2001]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000. I start off by saying that the system we have in Australia is a system which operates on the basis of a cooperative approach between ministers of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments responsible for censorship. It is very much in the public interest for there to be consistent treatment of material across this nation and for classification decisions to be made by a single, independent classification body. In this case we have the Office of Film and Literature Classification.
While it is appropriate for we in politics to take note of community concerns about the range of materials which should be available within each of the classifications, we believe that it is totally inappropriate that politicians be involved in particular decisions of interpretation. The system that we set up when we were last in government ensured that such decisions are best left to a specialist body, a body which can apply guidelines impartially and can do so in accordance with principles of due process. Under the national cooperative scheme, any changes to classification categories—the National Classification Code and the classification guidelines which are required to implement the modification of the X classification—must have the unanimous agreement of the Commonwealth, states and territories.
In the lead-up to this particular legislation, the government initially proposed a new non-violent erotica classification to replace the current X classification. The NVE category was to have considerable overlap with the X classification it was proposed to replace. Many of us are aware of the long battle that Senator Harradine had, both in this chamber and also in the Senate's committees, in which he demonstrated that it was not just considerable overlap; I think it is fair to say that what Senator Harradine demonstrated was that it was almost an identical category which was being set up by the Attorney-General to replace the X classification. However, it has been the government's contention that some material previously permissible within the X classification would not be permitted within the NVE classification. They have argued that this includes `mild fetish' material, the depiction of any violence whatsoever, the use of sexually aggressive language and also the portrayal of persons over 18 as minors.
On 30 May 2000, the Attorney-General unilaterally announced the decision to abandon the NVE classification and to retain the X classification. This was largely in response to concerns expressed by, particularly, a small group of National Party backbenchers. We can all remember that infamous `video night', the `blue movie night' during which three movies were screened, two of them X rated and one which had previously been refused classification.
—Senator McGauran is chuckling away because on that particular night he did not have to go to Fyshwick to get his videos; he could actually see them within the comfort of the house! The member for Dawson, De-Anne Kelly, was subsequently questioned by the AFP over her involvement in organising a public screening of unclassified material. However, after a brief investigation the Australian Federal Police announced that no further action would be taken against her.
Under the changes announced, X will now remain as the designator for sexually explicit material, while the scope of material that falls within that classification will be reduced as per the original NVE proposal. The government has subsequently moved amendments in the House of Representatives to implement this decision. The abandonment of the non-violent erotica video classification was to many people extremely disappointing, as it further delayed the implementation of classification reform restricting the availability of violent and demeaning material currently permitted within the X classification. Australia's system of classification, as I said earlier, depends on a national approach agreed to between the federal government in consultation with censorship ministers from each state and territory jurisdiction. In this instance, the Attorney-General's unilateral decision to shelve the NVE classification, and then to present that decision to state and territory censorship ministers as a fait accompli, placed an enormous amount of pressure on the integrity of that national approach. It was the action, once again, of a bungling, incompetent and insecure government captured by arch-conservatives of the coalition parties who not only impeded but also created the potential for derailment of the national approach. It was another instance of dogma and ignorance prevailing over balance and reason. 
When the state and territory attorneys met with the Commonwealth Attorney in early July to discuss their response to the federal government's announcement, it is fair to say that, though they were not happy, at that meeting a cooperative spirit continued to prevail and the attorneys did not raise objection to the approach unilaterally announced by the A-G. So we have here a situation where the government's handling of the issue has been incompetent, inept and not up to the standards of good administration. We have had the government going in all directions with respect to the fundamental provision of this legislation, the X-rated category. As I said, though a lot of people have been upset by the process and there was capacity for the process to derail a national system, it is fair to say that at the end of the day both the state and territory attorneys and now the opposition in this place are prepared to retain the proposed classification.
The bill also contains a number of other minor amendments to the classification legislation, including expansion of the current range of films exempt from classification, which are typically those of limited market appeal and on specialist subjects, which will reduce the cost of classification for some film producers; allowing for revocation of classifications for interactive films or computer games which contain material not brought to the attention of the censors in the initial review; and streamlining of the classification processes by allowing the board to issue and revoke serial classifications for certain publications. It is appropriate, we believe, that the way in which the act is operating is reviewed from time to time and amendments are made to close loopholes, clarify the operation of the scheme or introduce small but nevertheless useful reforms to improve its effectiveness. So we generally are supportive of these provisions in the bill. 
Finally, I would like to place on record an issue of concern raised by distributors of computer games. This is an ongoing concern and one that should be mentioned in this debate. The Australian Visual Software Distributors Association approached the opposition late last year to raise industry specific concerns with the bill that arise as a result of the practice of simultaneously releasing computer games and DVDs throughout the world. This practice, which is known as the `day and date' release, has developed to combat illegal piracy. Concerns were expressed that, under the provisions of the bill, classification of computer games and DVDs would be delayed as a result of inflexible provisions in the legislation, resulting in a lost opportunity for Australian consumers of computer games and DVD products and a greater window of opportunity for pirate manufacturers. We have referred these concerns to the A-G for examination and, as a result, the Director of the Office of Film and Literature Classification has provided an assurance that he would explore opportunities to streamline the processing of applications for the classification of this material. We welcome that commitment and put that on the record in order to ensure that it is met. So, as I said, the opposition will support this legislation.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2001-02-27,"—The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 before us this evening represents quite a triumph of dishonest tactics to the detriment of sensible public policy and the appropriate balancing of rights and responsibilities in a democratic society. Erotica has provoked and, I suspect, always will provoke public debate and speculation. The proper role for government, however, is to ensure that those extreme elements on both sides of the debate do not assert their particular agenda to the detriment of all other opinions and points of view. In his second reading speech to the original classifications bill, the Attorney-General had the following to say: 
The government has no wish to return to the repressive censorship practices of the past. Some of the features of the great liberal democracies, of which Australia is one, are the recognition given to individual rights and responsibilities, the importance of freedom of expression and thought and of tolerance of the views and rights of others. With appropriate safeguards, the right of adults to choose for themselves what they see, hear or read is fundamental to the maintenance of these traditions.
The Attorney went on:
The government's decision—
that is, their approach on the X classification—
should be seen as a genuine and reasoned attempt to balance conflicting views and to arrive at an acceptable solution to a difficult issue. In this regard I am pleased to note that the government's approach was also supported by the opposition in the policy which it took to the last election.
In other words, the Attorney, with support, cooperation and coordination from all other parties at both state and federal level, had reached the point where, to his credit, he was prepared to sensibly review and amend the existing classifications system. How utterly embarrassing, therefore, for the Attorney-General that his work and balanced consideration could so simply be disregarded, largely to placate the views of people, many of whom have a strong association with what I would call lunatic religious organisations and fringe groups with vilification motives towards minority groups. That is what happened here with regard to this bill currently before the Senate.
I remind the Senate that, in its original form, this bill was intended to eradicate sexual violence in the X classification system, not that sexual violence has been permitted for some time. Rightly, the Australian community does not accept that violence and sex should be an appropriate genre of entertainment. Neither do I. The new and proposed NVE, or non-violent erotica, classification was intended to make this point and to do so unambiguously. In my view and the view of the Australian Democrats, it did that admirably. In text and through its understanding, it could not have been clearer—non-violent erotica. 
The reason this aspect of the bill no longer appears here tonight is because of a series of dishonest, deceitful and, I would argue, illegal activities by the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly. So let us recap for a moment what had happened there. On the day that this bill was originally introduced into the Senate, and with the support of the Democrats, the opposition and the government, Senator Harradine sought to have the debate delayed by requesting a committee inquiry into the subject matter of the bill. Now, in the ordinary course of events, a committee would be appropriate. However, in this instance the issue of NVE had already been before at least two committees, coupled with at least two rounds within the cabinet. This bill and this issue—that of NVE—had been thoroughly inquired into.
But that was not good enough for Senator Harradine. I submit that Senator Harradine's intention to delay the bill was purely political in nature, not academic, and was designed to hijack the cabinet in the process. Due to a failure of communication between the office of Mr Williams, the Attorney-General, and the office of Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the message to deny the committee inquiry and the delay that Senator Harradine was seeking did not arrive. What followed was an extraordinarily dishonest activity, and one which I am sorry to recount that Senator Harradine participated in. As has now been widely reported, Mrs Kelly attempted to usurp the proper parliamentary process by soliciting unclassified material from the Commonwealth Attorney-General. When she was refused, she went to the next best source of illicit material, Senator Harradine.
Let it be on the record that the reason the Australian government, the Liberal-National coalition, reversed a well-established and almost universally supported policy decision was through a single act of dishonesty: the viewing not of just unclassified material but of refused classification material. It raises the question of why Senator Harradine or Mrs Kelly had knowledge and possession of such illegal material. We must seriously question why materials that were illegal and had been refused classification had been passed off by Mrs Kelly and, it seems, Senator Harradine as being materials that would have been permitted under the proposed NVE category. It was utterly dishonest. It was tantamount to claiming that heroin would soon be available at the chemist if the Therapeutic Goods Bill were amended. 
It is also worth taking note of the selection of video titles taken by Mrs Kelly from Senator Harradine and reportedly screened to a gaggle of National Party MPs—who no doubt feigned shock and horror—and the way in which the vast majority of these videos concentrated on anal sexual activity, transsexuality and interracial intercourse. Clearly, the plan by Mrs Kelly was not simply to shock MPs into thinking that such videos—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The senator is relatively new on these issues, and I ask that you draw his attention to the fact that he should not be casting aspersions on people in another chamber. I do not know that he intended to do it, but I would ask you to call him to order.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Greig, you must not impute improper motives to a person in another chamber—or even here.
—Thank you, Chair. I had no desire to do so explicitly. I will rephrase it by saying that it is my belief that Mrs Kelly was attempting not simply to shock MPs into thinking that such videos would be available at the corner store but also to tap into homophobia and sexual discomfort.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. That is not satisfactory. I do not think that is appropriate: that change of words actually does not change the intent. I ask you to call him to order that he should not be imputing motives.
—I accept the point of order, and I ask you to take greater care, Senator.
—I am taking as much care as I can, Chair, but at the same time I am attempting to get across the message.
—No, you cannot impute improper motives. The words that you have chosen are not acceptable. Please continue.
—I make the point that the choice by Mrs Kelly of videos, which were screened to a collection of National Party MPs, concentrated largely on materials that many would consider were shown in such a way as to relate to homophobia and the discomfort that many people feel towards sexual difference and perhaps also towards interracial relationships. Amongst these videos also was one entitled Max Goes South, which was allowed as a X-rated film but which would have been banned under the NVE proposal. For that reason, there had been repeated calls by the adult industry to have it reclassified, and it was a strong argument in favour of the NVE proposal. Yet this was the very material that Mrs Kelly and her colleagues showed to each other, misrepresenting it with the claim that such material would be considered benign and accessible under the NVE proposals.
As a member of the committee that inquired into this issue, I was appalled by the lack of reasonable and substantive evidence that was presented by representatives of what I would call the religious right. Of note were the people from a well-known organisation in Melbourne called Salt Shakers, using—or, I would argue, abusing—Christian doctrine, ably abetted by that other well-known organisation the Australian Family Association, which takes much time in vilifying gay and lesbian citizens.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was assaulted with half-truths and moral judgment dressed up as argument. It is important for the Senate to note that both the Australian Family Association and Salt Shakers have opposed every move to extend human rights to minorities in this country, particularly to those of the sexual minorities and the gay and lesbian, transgender and bisexual communities. Their mantra has always been the protection of the family. The reality, however, is that their activity nurtures the attitudes and laws that lead to violence and discrimination against people who do not reflect their very limited and unrepresentative view of society. Yet these are the very sorts of people who have come to define the final shape of this bill. Australian author David Marr summarised it this way in his book The High Price of Heaven: 
Ours is a very secular country but the Churches remain the most resilient, most respected and the best-connected lobby in the nation. Sin is their business. Heaven is their aim. Government is their partner. There's a certain instinctive generosity in wanting to keep all us sinners on the train, but there's also a bullying indifference to those who count on living only one life—this one. For those who have no faith in the after life, the price we are expected to pay for getting us all to Heaven is too high. Too much waste. Too much cruelty, too much pain. We've inherited a tough strain of Christianity in this country. From the moment the first priest and missionaries were rowed ashore watched by assembled felons—with godless savages hovering at the edge of the timber—these men of God felt called on to perform particularly urgent work for the Lord. They still think that way. One quality we've never lost from those early times is larrikin distrust for authority. Another is Christianity still geared to the task of ministering to human beings at their worst. The churches brought a simplified faith to build a simple society; they worked hand in hand with the governors men to achieve a little civilisation of Sydney cove; and they developed a particular fear that the work of the lord in this new land could so easily be sabotaged by pleasure—by sun, surf, sensuality and prosperity. Without the mercy and humanity of some of these early Christians, Australia would not be the place it is today. But the inheritance of that time is still felt in the mood of today's churches. Catholic and Protestant, old and new, they love authority and suspect pleasure. Nothing much changes with the churches. That's their boast. Each claims to be the authentic expression of values going back a couple of millennia. So as we start into the next one, its perhaps no surprise Christians are engaged—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I regret that unfortunately I was not here because of other pressing business. But I have been informed that I have been impugned by Senator Greig, saying that I had acted in a dishonourable fashion. That accusation has never, ever been directed towards me in all of my 25 years in this chamber, nor in the years that I spent in public life beforehand. I have been scrupulous in ensuring that I have acted with honour. For the accusation to be made that I have been acting dishonourably by providing material which was not X material is a disgrace. I am prepared to table in this chamber the material and the videos that were in fact given to Mrs Kelly. I am not suggesting that we should view these in the chamber, but I am prepared to provide the material to members and senators who are interested in its nature. I am sorry to hear what Senator Greig has said. I would ask him to reflect on what he has said. For an accusation to be made like that, on information presumably supplied to him by the Democrats' ex-chief adviser, who now works for the X-rated video outfits—
—Senator Harradine, I think we may have to stop the point of order. You might like to seek leave, Senator Greig, if you would not mind, to continue your remarks. There is some government business to attend to, and I understand you also have some business, Senator Harradine.
—I am not entirely sure of the proceedings, Chair, but I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-02-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This outlines an aspect of the government's so-called maritime reform program and particularly reports to the parliament the details of expenditure through the Stevedoring Levy Authority, particularly to finance redundancies through the Maritime Industry Finance Company. It is noted in the report that that organisation received $39,561,783 from the Commonwealth, under section 18 of the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Act in this reporting period and drew down $1 million from its loan facility.
It reports by company on numbers of redundant employees and amounts paid. It is interesting to note that, for 821 redundancies, an amount of $102,192,291.40 has been paid for redundancies to the Patrick group of companies, and a total of $62,975,723.02 for the P&O group of companies covering 552 redundancies. It can be seen that over $165 million of the total of $178,394,473.60 has been paid to those two companies and well over 50 per cent of that money went to the Patrick group of companies for 821 redundancies. The shippers in this country are paying levies per container to repay the amount.
While I touch upon the maritime reform issue that is dealt with in that report, I also want to relate another matter that relates to the maritime industry. On 30 May last year I asked the Assistant Treasurer through a question on notice whether Australian seafarers in ships trading internationally qualified for concessional tax treatment under section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act. In response Senator Kemp advised that Australian seafarers are not entitled to this tax concession. He referred me to a ruling by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which he said confirmed the ATO ruling. On 18 December last year I asked a further question on notice on the same matter. I referred the minister to the fact that the AAT case to which he referred had not been settled. I asked whether he was aware that the AAT decision was to be appealed by the taxpayer in the Federal Court. In response the minister said:
The Commissioner of Taxation informs me that this case is considered to be settled as AAT handed down its decision on 29 April 1998 and the taxpayer had not lodged an appeal within the required 28 days.
That answer appears to be wrong and therefore Senator Kemp appears to have provided the Senate with misleading information. It appears that Senator Kemp and the Treasurer were unaware that there was an order made by the Federal Court on 6 October last year granting the taxpayer an extension of time in which to lodge his notice of appeal against the AAT decision. That order said:
By 4 p.m. on 16 October 2000 the applicant may file and serve on the respondent a notice of appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Deputy President Gerber given on the 29th April 1998 at Brisbane.
It appears that neither Senator Kemp nor Mr Costello were aware that the notice of appeal was filed on 6 October. It is No. 805 of 2000. Neither Senator Kemp nor Mr Costello were aware that a notice of appearance was filed on the matter on 23 October by the Commissioner of Taxation, the same Commissioner of Taxation, apparently, that told Senator Kemp that the matter had been settled in 1998. This documentation represents formal acknowledgment by the Commissioner of Taxation of the intention to appear in the appeal. It appears that neither Senator Kemp nor Mr Costello were aware of a letter indicating that the matter would be heard by the full court of the Federal Court.
There is growing evidence that the administration of government is breaking down, whether it is the failure of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to properly report to the parliament on road funding or to report to the parliament on corporate plans of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, or the failure of the Treasurer to declare Sydney airport as a leviable airport in terms required by the Aircraft Noise Levy Act and thereby illegally taxing travellers. They are just a few examples. It is becoming obvious that we are observing a government in decline. (Time expired)

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-02-27,"—I rise to speak on the occasion of the passing of Sir Donald Bradman. It is not often that one is moved to speak on the adjournment on the passing of a sportsman, but I am motivated because Sir Donald Bradman achieved such a remarkable place in the affections of Australians—and, indeed, of many people around the world. He was very much more than a sportsman. 
It is interesting to look at his first seasons—he was playing test cricket by the time he was 20 and making a powerful lot of runs at that age—and then go to the end of his career and look at the last three series—England and Australia, India and Australia and the Ashes series in England—when he was still making runs at a phenomenal rate. If he had had the opportunity to play through the war years or with the frequency that is now available to test cricketers, it is almost beyond comprehension to think about how well he would have done. He was clearly a sportsman who would have dominated any era. One could say that, with an average just a shade under 100, he was almost twice as good as any other test cricketer. There are probably a dozen cricketers who played regularly who would have had averages in excess of 50. I think Graeme Pollock might have had an average of 60, but essentially if you got over 50 you were in the elite. And for someone to almost double those averages speaks for itself. Sir Donald was clearly one of a kind when it came to sporting ability. 
There are many other cricketers one could point to as star performers, but what singles Bradman out, and the reason I felt moved to speak tonight, is the character, values and virtues that he possessed. They made him a very admirable person and a role model—perhaps especially today when people are looking for someone who has principles and does not compromise them. He was a very private man who never sought to cash in on his own celebrity. He understood the obligations of leadership, he had an intense will to win, and he had a determination tosucceed, but, at the same time, he appreciated the responsibilities that go with those roles. Both on and off the field, he gave as much for his country and to his community as he possibly could. To have served as an administrator for so many years at the highest level after retiring from the sporting field is clear evidence of his lifelong determination to put something back rather than simply taking something out of the game.
He wrote very movingly and effectively on cricket. I can certainly remember reading The Art of Cricket, wistfully wishing that it was all so easy. For someone like Sir Donald Bradman, it clearly was not a matter of following a script. In many respects, it was a matter of playing shots that others would not even think of playing in the circumstances. To have a bodyline series which was essentially a brutal `get Bradman' exercise is in itself testimony to the fact that this man was of such high calibre that he had to be got at all costs by his opponents. Whilst that is a very regrettable period in sporting history, it demonstrates to what heights he soared and to what extent some people felt that they had to bring him down at any cost. Yet he was never embittered by that experience. He was always very understated. 
Sir Donald was no-nonsense and very clear-eyed in his approach to life. I know that he was famous for answering every letter he received, and he must have received many hundreds of thousands of letters over the years. I would like to recount the time, about 10 years ago, when my father was approaching his 80th birthday. I thought it would be a very nice thing if my father could receive a card from Donald Bradman, whom he had always admired tremendously both as a cricketer and as a human being. I wrote to Sir Donald and asked him whether he would be prepared to write something to my father. His response struck me as typically feisty but also very appropriate. He effectively said, `It was very kind of you to write to me in those terms, but I did not know your father and I therefore could not write directly to him, because that would be putting more on paper than would be justified. But I am more than happy for you to pass on my best wishes to him, and I enclose a card which I have signed.' I thought that was probably typical of the man. He was not just going to do what someone asked of him. He was always trying to find the most appropriate response, and he was always very willing to respond positively to all those who had such a great admiration and affection for him. 
There are aspects of the lives of others that we all admire, but I have to say that, through all the years that I have been interested in cricket, there has never been anyone to compare with Bradman, particularly off the field. We can all be obsessed with statistics at times, and I remember a fair number of them about Sir Donald Bradman, but I come back to the fact that, to him, character was everything. He lived a life beyond reproach—one I think we should all strive to emulate. Not only the cricket world but society and humanity are very much the poorer for his passing.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Bradman, Sir Donald George, AC</title>",Adjournment,22,1,speech

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2001-02-27,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
(1)	Refer to the answer to question 2869. I am advised that after the original ATO investigation concluded that the release of information was made legally but had not followed ATO processes, the officer was formally counselled regarding the need to follow office procedures.  Following the subsequent conclusion that disclosure was not unauthorised and the officer was acting in the course of his or her duties, a review of the processes used in the area concerned was undertaken to provide clearer supervision and direction in these investigations.
(2)	Parliament has placed the administration of the taxation laws in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation.  I am advised that the Commissioner is satisfied with the adequacy and appropriateness of the actions taken within the ATO in relation to this matter.
(3)	The Ombudsman recommended that the ATO consider compensation.  I am advised that while it does not concede that any unlawful disclosures had been made, nor any liability to damages, the ATO has agreed that it would properly consider any claim for compensation lodged by the agent.  It should be noted that the Ombudsman's investigation was conducted prior to the revision of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution's (DPP) views on the disclosure.  The consideration of any claim for compensation will take into account the DPP's revised view.
(4)	(a) Yes.
(b)	I am advised that that is the stated reason - although the DPP concluded that the disclosure was not unauthorised and the ATO does not concede any liability to damages.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Taxation Office: Unauthorised Release of Taxation Records</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,24,1,answer
