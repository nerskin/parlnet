(1)	 Clause 8, page 6 (line 11), omit ""This"", substitute ""Subject to subsection 20(1A), this"".
(2)	 Clause 20, page 12 (after line 7), after subclause (1), insert: 

	 (1A)	 An Agency Head must not enter into an Australian Workplace Agreement, within the meaning of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 , with an APS employee.
	 (1B)	 The regulations may prescribe exemptions from the requirement set out in subsection (1A), in relation to particular categories of APS employees.
		 Note:	 For example, a particular category of APS employees could include ""SES employees of the X Agency"".
My amendments, as I indicated during second reading speeches, do allow disallowable regulations to determine that certain categories of employees are appropriate to become the subject of Australian workplace agreements, but they ensure that those determinations are reviewable by the parliament.
We think that there is little doubt that AWAs can lead to patronage and cronyism and, of course, it is usually women who lose out under such arrangements, as Senator Margetts pointed out. There is a large gap between executive levels and those further down the hierarchy. This has increased in industry and it is a trend we do not want to see emerge in the public service as well.
I put these amendments again for all of the reasons that I have previously mentioned and recommend them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-04-01,"—I indicate to the committee that the opposition will again be supporting the Democrats' amendments. We note, of course, that amendment No. 1 is simply a consequential amendment reflecting the proposed new clause 20(1A). We believe the Democrats' amendment is in fact entirely consistent with the government's original intention with regard to AWAs in the public service. We do find it hard to understand why the government is making such a fuss about this issue.
We do note that Mr Reith, the minister who previously had responsibility for Public Service matters in his discussion paper, Towards a best practice Australian Public Service, said:
. . . AWAs are likely to be a particularly favourable option for discrete categories of employment . . . for example . . . Senior Executives. 

It went on to say that certified agreements:
are likely to continue to be the most prevalent form of agreement for APS agencies.
The Democrats' amendment, as I see it, will simply ensure that that is the case.
I should point out to the government that the amendment provides for regulations which may prescribe exemptions for particular categories of APS employees and cites SES employees of individual agencies as an example, which is precisely what Mr Reith had in mind. It is for those reasons that the opposition will again be supporting amendments 1 and 2 on sheet 898 that have been moved by Senator Allison on behalf of the Democrats.

(1)	 Clause 5, page 8 (after line 2), after subclause (2), insert:
Merit Protection Commissioner
	 (2A)	 At the commencing time, the person holding office as the Merit Protection Commissioner under the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984  becomes the Merit Protection Commissioner under the new Act, as if he or she had been appointed as the Merit Protection Commissioner under the new Act for a period equal to the unexpired part of his or her term under the old Act.
(2)	 Clauses 6 and 7, page 9 (line 21) to page 10 (line 23), omit the clauses, substitute: 

6  Rights of first- and second-tier persons
		 First- and second-tier persons retain all the rights conferred on them by the old Act, except for rights to reassessment for reintegration or reappointment.
(3)	 Clause 9, page 11 (lines 6 to 12), omit subclauses (2) and (3), substitute:
	 (2)	 A continued determination may be amended or revoked by the Agency Head in the same way as if it had actually been made under section 24 of the new Act, provided that no provision of the determination is diminished or revoked unless that provision is incorporated in an award or certified agreement.
	 (3)	 Unless it is sooner revoked, a continued determination (including any amendments made by an Agency Head under section 24 of the new Act) ceases to be in force on the third anniversary of the commencing time.
The amendments that I am moving to this bill are again those which the Senate supported in November last year. Amendment No. 1 simply reflects the government's belated decision to maintain the office of Merit Protection Commissioner. It provides the same protection to the current incumbent of that office as the legislation provides to all other offices which are being maintained under this legislation, including, for example, the office of Public Service Commissioner.
The second amendment before the committee preserves mobility rights for those who currently have them. As I argued, I hope persuasively in the earlier debate, we regard it as an infringement of principles of natural justice to remove these rights. Many of those who have them, including those who work in Parliament House under the MOPS Act, will have made decisions about their current employment on the basis they would continue to have those rights.
Amendment 3 is designed to prevent agency heads from amending or revoking a determination in a way which diminishes any provisions in an award or certified agreement. It also provides for a sunset period of three years, which will allow sufficient time to renegotiate conditions in continuing determinations. I again commend those three amendments to the committee.

I think that was made clear in the second reading debate. We shall not be calling further divisions on these matters in the committee stage.

Again, the amendments that I am moving here on behalf of the opposition are logical extensions of those which the Senate passed in relation to the Public Service Bill. They are also identical to amendments which were agreed to by the Senate in November last year. There is one small exception to that, so I will perhaps concentrate my remarks around that particular matter.
The committee might recall what was a lengthy debate last year on the amendment—which is amendment No. 22 on sheet 889 now before us—that deals with the redeployment of parliamentary service officers. At that time, the President of the Senate was concerned about the separation of powers issue and the propriety of the Parliamentary Service Commissioner exercising powers independently of the Presiding Officers of the parliament. We have accommodated that concern by slightly altering our amendments to require the agreement of both Presiding Officers in the case of a parliamentary service officer being redeployed from one House to another. So, with that small exception, the package of amendments remains identical to those that we debated at length previously in the committee. I commend those amendments to the committee.

Bills reported with amendments; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-04-01,"—On 26 May 1996 the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into fair trading was tabled in the House of Representatives. The report, known as the Reid report, was entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia  and is one of the better parliamentary committee reports that has been produced for some time.
In seeking to alleviate the burdens on small business, it is permeated by the despair of small business people and their experiences in the areas of retail tenancy, franchising and abuse of market power. It is no surprise that the recommendations in that committee report embrace those issues of concern to small business. It was more than warmly received as a report. It is a landmark piece of committee work and a true bipartisan achievement.
The report got it right about small business and the legislation was eagerly awaited to deliver key reforms to that sector in the unconscionable conduct provisions, a uniform retail tenancy code, and lease renewal—to name just three of the areas of concern. However, somewhere between the reporting of the committee and the drafting of the bill these key recommendations have been omitted. They have vanished into the policy vacuum that has characterised the current government. It is the opposition's view that we should not do a 180-degree turn and say—as the government appears to have done—that the report got it wrong after all.
I foreshadow that it is the intention of the opposition to move substantial amendments to the government's bill which is now before this chamber. Those amendments, which will be examined in some detail during the committee stage, will go to issues of great concern to small businesses in this country; small business people who believe, having examined the government's response to the report, that it amply demonstrates Labor's commitment to small business.
A key part of Labor's agenda for industry must also be to harness the energy, drive and flexibility of small business to provide opportunities for as many Australians as possible. Labor recognises the enormous job creating potential of Australian small business. We believe in strategic intervention for small business to guarantee a fair and competitive economic environment and to address the obstacles the small business community faces, including their market power disadvantage, compliance costs and access to finance and justice.
I also point out that in the document itself, in the section relevant to small business—that is, `Small business creating jobs and wealth'—there is a section dealing with fair trading which states:
Market economies sometimes produce market failures. Ample evidence in Australia suggests that the small business sector has unduly suffered in some unfair trading environments. This is particularly the case in the areas of franchising, retail tenancies and the misuse of market power. Small business must be appropriately protected from unfair business conduct. Labor will utilise mechanisms available to it, including legislation, to ensure that a fair trading environment exists in Australia.
This passage demonstrates clearly the concerns felt by senators on this side of chamber in respect of the fair trading environment, which is not as fair as it should be for many small business operators.
In debating this bill, we can expect to hear the usual shrill chorus of protest by the government that, in spite of its less than elegant U-turn, this bill does actually deliver the reforms that small business wants and that the opposition is being needlessly obstructionist as usual.
Let me deal with that. The Victorian Minister for Small Business, Louise Asher, does not think so. In a direct snub to the coalition government, Minister Asher—herself from a Liberal-National Party coalition government in Victoria—has introduced her own bill into the Victorian parliament concerning retail tenancy issues in an apparent repudiation of efforts by the federal Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, to deliver uniform retail tenancy legislation to the small business community. If Mr Reith's state colleague has found the bill wanting, how can he expect that others will not do so? We, like Minister Asher, do not think this bill will be able to protect the interests of small businessmen and women in Australia without significant amendment.
In providing the backbone to real reform to the bill, it should at all times be remembered that, in seeking its amendment, the opposition is simply implementing the Reid report's recommendation—the wishes of the government's own committee members. These recommendations talk about establishing a body of precedent under which new provisions of amendments to the Trade Practices Act can be measured. It contains recommendations in respect of retail tenancy matters.
There is a range of these that touch on things like underpinning a uniform retail tenancy code by changes to the Trade Practices Act. It talks about dispute resolution, security of tenure and the uniform retail tenancy code having disclosure statements in there. It talks about the disclosure of rents paid. It makes recommendations about rents and rent reviews. It makes recommendations about outgoings and promotions. It makes recommendations about leases and disclosure statements, tenancy mix, redevelopment and relocation and economic and social impact statements. That is just in the area of retail tenancy matters. I have to say that there are substantial elements in this committee report that deal with retail tenancy matters.
Rather than put in place changes to the Trade Practices Act which reflect unfair conduct in a business environment as the Reid committee recommend, the government chose in this bill to use the more difficult test of 
 unconscionable conduct. We believe as the Reid committee did, that the simpler test of unfairness should be in the legislation. The unconscionable conduct test is harsher and costs a lot more money to challenge. My speaking notes are not in the correct order. I will put them aside and go to the other matters of concern.
I have dealt with the first matter of concern to the opposition. Labor will seek to amend this bill to utilise the term `unfair conduct', rather than the term `unconscionable conduct'. A recommendation of the Reid report was that the word `unfair' be used and that is a recommendation of the Reid report that this government has chosen not to follow.
Our reason for moving that, which will be explained more fully when I come to it, is that at law it is easier to prove `unfair' than it is to prove `unconscionable'. As a consequence, the use of the word `unconscionable' is an advantage to big business in standing over small business and insisting on conditions which are unfair. You can meet the test `unfair', but you might not meet the test `unconscionable' and, as a consequence, the advantage not only in the negotiation of contracts but also in the prosecution of the law lies with the big end of town.
The second part of the Reid report that we will challenge by way of amendment concerns a national uniform retail tenancy code. I understand that the Reid report recommended that we institute a national uniform retail tenancy code. If you do not have such a national uniform code, each state will have its own separate code. That means that small businesses around Australia will not have clarity, consistency or security in the legislation. If the government view of the legislation is passed, there will be varying standards of a tenancy code applied in the particular states. That will be to the disadvantage of small business. Labor will move to amend that in the legislation and will be proposing a uniform retail tenancy code.
Thirdly, the government has made the bill useless, in our contention, for a vast majority of small businesses by limiting the application of the bill to transactions which are less than $1 million over five years. In the bill it is 
 unclear—that is, it is ambiguous—whether the $1 million transaction applies to profit or to turnover. That in itself is a fault in the legislation which, in any case, would need to be corrected. But if the figure of $1 million over five years is to be applied, that will affect many small businesses which in that time will, either as a profit or as turnover, find themselves disqualified from the application of this legislation.
Let me offer an example. If this provision were to be enacted into law, it would mean that no service station that has that sort of level of turnover—and, very likely, if it is doing volume trading, that type of level of profit—could ever access this legislation. There are very few people—certainly very thin on the ground in the government ranks, as well as anywhere else—who would contend that service station operators in Australia are not genuinely small business people. So in view of that defect, Labor will move to amend the eligibility criteria when applying the unconscionable conduct provisions for monetary transactions to the Australian Bureau of Statistics' definition of small business.
We do not seek to delay the passage of this bill. The changes that I have foreshadowed will seek to improve it and make it conform more with the Reid committee's report, which was unanimously supported by both coalition and Labor members after a detailed inquiry in the House of Representatives. But we do think this legislation should come into force as soon as possible. We think that because this is important legislation. Labor sought in government to introduce legislation through my colleague at that time, the Minister for Small Business, Senator Chris Schacht. He found great obstacles in this chamber from the then opposition, now government, in being able to succeed in doing so.
Upon the election of the Liberal-National Party government, consistent with our view that small business needed protection on these matters, the opposition, through its leader, Kim Beazley, in the House of Representatives, introduced a private member's bill on this matter as well. It languished for a time on the Notice Paper until it became embarrassing 
 to the government. As a consequence of that embarrassment, the Reid committee was established and it moved to examine this area in some detail. Resulting from that examination, there is of course this legislation.
It is instructive to put the principal dates affecting this legislation on the record. On 26 June 1996 the then Minister for Small Business, Geoff Prosser, issued terms of reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology to conduct its investigation into fair trading issues—that is, the Reid committee. That was in the middle of 1996. In May of last year, the report entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia was completed and tabled in the House of Representatives.
On 22 June last year the Labor opposition's shadow ministry formally endorsed the recommendations in that report. Thus we flagged to the government our support for those findings and, in essence, told the government, `Enact these findings and they will have swift passage through the parliament.' I emphasise that date—June of last year.
On 8 July last year, the Council of Small Business Organisations, COSBOA, and the Australian Small Business Association, ASBA, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Motor Traders Association of Australia, the MTAA, called for full implementation of the report. Less than a month after the shadow ministry endorsed it, the small business organisations that speak for the small business community endorsed it in full as well.
On 11 July that year, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Geoff Prosser, resigned from his ministerial post for reasons of conflict of interest. On 30 September, the government brought down its response to the report in the federal parliament and named that response a `New deal: fair deal'. We think there was an unreasonable delay in responding. However, we note that the resignation of the minister may have had something to do with that. It is now April 1998 and it has been some seven months since the government brought down its response to the report. The Senate now has an opportunity to deal with the report. 
This report deals with substantial issues of concern to small business. The sooner the law is rectified in this area, the sooner small businesses will have a more secure and more predictable legal framework in which to exercise their entrepreneurial skills, build their companies and build their own prosperity. What has hampered that in the past has been the archaic law. This has meant that major companies—the big end of town—have been able to use unfair legal muscle in order to coerce or prevent small business people from getting fair treatment in a whole range of areas—the most outstanding one of which relates to lease holdings in shopping centres—and the law has been biased against the real interests of small business.
One would have thought that a government that has trumpeted from the rooftops its support for small business would have moved quickly to overcome that problem. The fact that it has moved slowly and the fact that, when it has moved, it has only partially dealt with the unanimous recommendations of a bipartisan committee, endorsed by the small business organisations themselves, is the most eloquent tribute to the fact that this government is not dinkum when it comes to performance on issues of concern to small business. It is certainly sincere when it talks about its rhetoric, but its rhetoric is to persuade and garner support. When it comes to delivering on its rhetoric with substantial legislative measures, it is not dinkum. Of course, `hypocrisy' describes the words of one which are contradicted by a person's actions. In this case, that word is an appropriate description of the government in its treatment of small business.
This legislation needs to be improved and properly implemented. One of the undertakings that the government gave to the electorate—which still rings in my ears—on the eve of the last election was to cut down on red tape and the other qualifications and regulations that are the bane of the life of most small businesses in this country. We have witnessed a parade of legislation in this chamber which impacts on small business and affects the amount of time they have to take away from their business activities in order to 
 comply with form filling. We have witnessed a growth of that, irrespective of the bold and heroic boasts of the government to cut down the amount of red tape—to, in fact, cut it in half in the life of this government.
An impartial audit of the amount of red tape that bedevils small business at the end of this government's term, if it runs for a full three years, will show that not only has it failed to cut the amount of red tape in half but that red tape has grown and waxed during that time and that the burden on small business is greater at the conclusion of this term than it was at the beginning. This is another failed promise by this government. It is about time that this government put its actions where its mouth is. It has a lot to say about small business; it does not do very much to help it.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1998-04-01,"—Small business has, of course, long been acknowledged as a vital sector in the Australian economy, a driving force behind our future growth, prosperity and jobs. The importance of the sector can be seen from an Industry Commission report last year which indicates that the small business sector now accounts for 47 per cent of Australian employment—that is, in the vicinity of 3.5 million people rely on small business for their income. Labor did nothing during its time in government to constructively address the problems facing small business. In 13 years it held 17 separate inquiries and produced 17 reports, all of which merely gathered dust. So it is heartening indeed to hear from Senator Cook that Labor does not oppose the legislation.
The coalition recognised that the sector was bleeding, and a major part of its election platform was the commitment to do something concrete for small business. The coalition promised real assistance to help in promoting small businesses to employ more people. To achieve this, the government has brought interest rates down to historically low levels, provided tax relief and reduced that bane of small business—paperwork and compliance. But this government recognises that more needs to be done through fixing the economic fundamentals. There was also the 
 focus of its `New deal: fair deal' package released last year, which aims to level out the playing field for small business.
For many years an area of concern has been that of unfair practices of big business towards small business operators. After years of ineffectual posturing by Labor, small business actually found a voice in the form of the coalition government. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology investigated the area of unfair trading and addressed it in its report Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. This report was commissioned by the government as soon as it came to office and was the fulfilment of the government's election promise to examine the concerns of small business. The report concluded that the concerns about unfair business conduct towards small business was well and truly justified. Just as importantly, it also found that such behaviour could have a heavy impact on the health of the small business sector, the Australian economy and society generally.
The government is acting on the report, and some of the measures contained in the  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  presently before us are designed to do just that. It is important to point out that the proposals for reform in the bill are only part of a much broader package of reforms. That package of reforms in itself is only part of the coalition's small business assistance platform.
This bill deals with unfair conduct in business transactions between companies both big and small. This is a critical factor in contributing to the growth and prosperity of commerce in Australia. At present, many small businesses are disadvantaged in their dealings with big business, and that can only be described as a pretty clear-cut example of market failure.
Small businesses, as was made evident in Finding a balance: towards fair trading, often have trouble in their dealings with big business, particularly in areas such as having little or no ability to negotiate the terms of a contract; inadequate disclosure of relevant and important commercial information, which the financially weaker party should be aware of 
 before entering into the transaction; and inadequate and unclear disclosure of important terms of the contract, particularly those which are weighted against the financially weaker party.
These can occur through the technical wording of the contract; the theatre of negotiations whereby the small business person is under-represented, lacks the legal artillery of the other party and is discouraged, or not given the opportunity, to consider the detail; the terms which act against the interests of the weaker party are not disclosed; when the dominant party seeks to change the nature of a long-term relationship so it is more favourable to them, frequently after the event of entering into the contract; and when disputes arise there is no cheap or quick way of resolving them. These difficulties have very real implications both economically and socially. They cause business failures, lost employment, wasted resources, stress, marriage breakdowns and poor health.
Unconscionable conduct has been addressed by statute over time through a number of measures. The first was the inclusion in the Trade Practices Act 1986 of significantly broader unconscionable conduct provisions to protect consumers. The second step in trying to codify and extend the common law doctrine of unconscionability into Commonwealth law came in 1992 with an attempt to build into the act a general catch-all unconscionability provision. This provision, section 51AA, while well intentioned, failed to provide businesses, particularly small businesses, with the protection they sought. In fact, the reality is that the section is very rarely used despite recent judicial interpretations in such cases as Olex Focas Pty Ltd v. Skoda Export and Pritchard v. Racecage Pty Ltd.
This government believes that the plight of small business operators caught in an unconscionable bargain was not adequately addressed, and the amendments give the legislation some very sharp teeth to use in the form of section 51AC. The difficulty for small business in applying section 51AA is noted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in its publication Small Business and the Trade Practices Act. The ACCC comments:
In practice this is often very difficult to prove . . . because the law has accepted that commercial transactions can sometimes be unfair or hard on one party. If you enter into a contract or arrangement with your eyes open and it later proves to be a hard bargain, the courts are unlikely to interfere with such a transaction.
To prove `unconscionability' which amounts to a breach of trade practices law the weaker party must establish that it was in a position of special disability which the stronger party knew about (or should have known about) and that the stronger party took unfair advantage of the position. If one of these elements is missing then unconscionable conduct cannot be proved even if one business is going to suffer a big loss.
The conventional criteria for establishing unconscionable conduct are well defined and have been developed in such cases as Blomley v. Ryan, and Commercial Bank of Australia v. Amadio, and have found legislative expression in the New South Wales Contracts Review Act. These include ignorance of material facts that are known to the other party; illiteracy or lack of education; poverty or manifest disadvantage; age; infirmity of body or mind; drunkenness; lack of assistance or explanation where these are necessary in the circumstances; and, in some cases, emotional dependence—for example, when a spouse is pressured to sign a guarantee for a partner's business loan.
However, a mere disparity in bargaining power between the parties is not considered as constituting a special disability. Courts have generally refused to intervene in commercial transactions or to relieve parties from the consequences of a hard bargain. The notion of unconscionability is undoubtedly the overarching principle of equitable intervention. Section 51AC uses the expression `unconscionable conduct' in order to build on the existing body of case law, which has worked well in relation to the consumer protection provisions of the act and which will provide greater certainty to small business in assessing legal rights and remedies.
The bill as presented is at variance with recommendations of the House of Representatives committee on fair trading, which cautioned against using the term `unconscionable conduct'. The committee favoured the use of the term `unfair conduct'. But there was the 
 distinct possibility that, although everyone thinks he or she understands what `unfair' means, it will mean different things to different people and was likely to generate further uncertainty and a spate of judicial interpretations.
There was also the possibility that, when applied by the courts, it might have failed to achieve the outcomes desired by small business. The government also includes in the bill the proposal of industry codes of conduct and practice to assist in resolving the potential for disputes and thus avoiding resorting to expensive litigation wherever possible.
So, in looking to provide a legislative basis for intervention in cases of commercial unconscionability, the government was called upon to strike a balance between a small party and a much better resourced party and where the bargain struck was a hard but not misleading one. The resulting section 51AC in the bill gets that balance right, and it will be up to the courts to construe it as such. It sends a clear message to the business community that unconscionable behaviour is not to be tolerated in commercial conduct, just as it is not to be tolerated in consumer conduct. It provides guidance to the courts and the community as to the categories of practices in commercial dealings that parliament regards as objectionable.
Despite concern from legal commentators, these amendments are not likely to spell the end of contractual certainty. This is because the starting point in any commercial dispute is to look at the contractual terms of the bargain. The notions of equity and good conscience already provide a basis for intervention in contracts, including remedies for duress and undue influence.
It is only if the contract is unconscionable that there can be any question of its terms being set aside or varied. The amendment defines and clarifies common law principles and allows parties who have been treated unfairly in commercial transactions a basis for relief under the broad notion of unconscionability, where presently the remedial framework is nothing less than fragmented and unsatisfactory. I commend the bill.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1998-04-01,"—As stated earlier by my colleague Senator Cook, Labor is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Reid report on fair trading entitled Finding a balance: towards fair trading . The Reid report was unanimously supported by both coalition and Labor members of parliament. The recommendations in the unfair trading report were also supported by the Council of Small Business Organisations in Australia, the Australian Small Business Association, the Queensland Retail Traders, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the Motor Traders Association of Australia and many more small business organisations.
However, what is clear is that the Howard government has undermined the intentions of the report in three key areas. The first is that the government has walked away from the Reid recommendations, refusing to adopt the concept of unfair conduct, instead relying on `unconscionable conduct'. The Reid report suggests the use of the word `unfair' instead of `unconscionable', because the definition is widely understood, particularly by people who are running small businesses. Labor believes that fairness is the social value central to the maintenance of social cohesion and the legitimacy of the social system. As indicated by Senator Cook, we will be moving to amend the bill to utilise the term `unfair'.
The second area in which the Howard government is not prepared to follow the Reid report is in respect of recommendations to institute a national uniform retail tenancy code. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has been making a great deal of noise about providing leadership in this area. However, during Senate estimates in November last year, when questioned about what action was being taken in respect of the establishment of a national uniform retail tenancy code for state and territory governments, Mr Grant stated:
Retail tenancies have been traditionally a state and territory responsibility and the Commonwealth does not have any direct responsibility in that area. We recognised that in deciding not to actually introduce a Commonwealth or a federal retail tenancy act. We recognise also that if we had done that it would have created a complexity because we would have 
 had at least two tiers of legislation, hence more cost.
The reality is that the minister's rhetoric quite often does not match the minister's deeds. The reality is that, in respect of this area of retail tenancy codes, it is a burning issue for people in small business.
My in-laws, for example, until recently have been involved in the small business area and there is no subject that has occupied more time at the dinner table than this issue. They have consistently raised it and consistently have been concerned about the impact the retail tenancy code has upon small businesses and their capacity to operate.
This was a golden opportunity for the Howard government to in fact have provided real leadership in dealing with an issue of major concern amongst small businesses and to have provided substantial solutions in this area. The reality is the opposite: the government have walked away from the opportunity to do something of substance in this area and have not sought to implement a national uniform retail tenancy code. As indicated by my colleague Senator Cook, Labor will be moving to amend the bill in order to legislate for just such a code.
The third area in which the government has made the bill useless for the vast majority of small businesses is by limiting its application to transactions which are less than $1 million over five years. In our view, that is totally inadequate and restrictive, and will exclude an area of remedy for a very substantial number of small businesses. My experience as the National Secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union was that we consistently got complaints from small businesses which were dealing with or supplying to large businesses. In many instances they were put in a position where large business arbitrarily instituted cuts to contracts and to pricing arrangements with small businesses which those small businesses had to absorb and for which they had no capacity to seek redress through any area—and certainly would not, under these provisions, have the ability to seek redress under this act.
—Yes, they would.
—No, they would not because it says it has got to be less than a million dollars. A million dollar contract is nothing.
—Come on!
—Over five years? I could point to a range of companies, particularly in the auto component industry, which supply to the major producers in this country and which would not be able to seek redress under those provisions of this act. They have been forced, because of cost cutting within the industry, to cut back their prices. In one instance, they were forced to cut their prices by 20 per cent. The impact of that upon companies and their ability to maintain their profit levels, generate income for re-investment in the company, maintain the wage levels of their employees and, in fact, survive in business was very severely hampered by the decision of those companies to impose an arbitrary cut on prices.
—They are not small businesses if they are doing contracts for five years.
—Many of them are small businesses. Many of them are businesses that employ fewer than 10 employees. We think it is much more consistent to use the ABS definition of small business than to impose a transaction figure of a million dollars to define whether or not you get access to the provisions of the act. In our view, the way in which this provision is drafted will certainly exclude a very substantial part of the small business community from being able to seek redress in areas in which they should be entitled to it.
The reality is that this government has made a big play of its support for small business. We heard Senator Coonan outline some of them in her contribution earlier. She talked about this government's commitment to reducing paperwork and compliance provisions for small business. I have a number of friends in small business. For instance, I have a number of friends who run dental practices and, as I indicated earlier, my parents-in-law have run small businesses. None of them have seen any discernible reduction in paperwork 
 or compliance provisions, despite the rhetoric of the government in this area.
I recall asking Mr Grant at the Senate estimates whether or not this was capable of being measured. I think he rightly said it was not possible to measure whether or not or to what degree the impact of paperwork and compliance had been reduced for small business. I would suggest it is incapable of being measured because out in the business community the reality is that the impact has been negligible. It certainly has not been noticeable to the people out there running those small businesses.
The government has made a big play of its commitment to small business. I suggest that, when you examine the reality of what the government is doing, including what it is doing in this bill—in particular the way in which it has treated these three key issues on which Labor will be seeking to move amendments—you have to say that the reality is that its commitment to improving the situation overall for small business is not matched by what it is implementing in practice. There is a lot of rhetoric, but the reality is something else.
However, as I said at the start of my comments, Labor has not and will not delay the passage of this bill, but we will move our amendments, as is a normal and democratic procedure in the parliament, to try to strengthen support for small business in the legislation. However, what we want is real legislative protection for small business, not the mickey mouse alternative the minister is proposing, which walks away from the coalition's own report on fair trading and from the opportunity to do something of real substance to help small businesses in our community.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-04-01,"—This bill does help small business, Senator Campbell, and I can tell you that genuinely, as a former proprietor of a small business employing around 10 people. I think you have been a little ungracious in your remarks, although I acknowledge the sincerity of your commitment to small business.
The Labor Party which you represent was in office for 13 years. In that time there were 17 reports on small business, and there was absolutely no action taken. The Labor Party put down 17 reports over 13 years and no action was taken! I recall that in the last week before the parliament rose, Senator Schacht, who was then the minister responsible for small business, did bring into this place a small business bill. I acknowledge his sincerity too, but his government, before his term at the helm of the small business ministry, had 13 years to do something.
I have often wished to stand up in this chamber and say, `This bill will help small business.' I have often wished that I could do that, and I can do it today with this  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 . I can say genuinely, `This bill helps small business.' It does not help small business in a small or indirect way; it helps small business in a big way and in a most direct fashion.
One of the greatest problems affecting many of our smaller firms is their relationship with big business, as either competitors, buyers or suppliers. This bill is needed now as it has never been needed before. As the market shrinks, as there are fewer and fewer buyers, whether in the grocery sector, the meatworks sector or in any other manufacturing sector, we are seeing fewer and fewer companies out there, demanding more and more of the market share and leaving small businesses, including small manufacturers and small suppliers, in a more vulnerable situation.
We have to go a bit further than this on section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. I hoped to incorporate that contribution in this speech but, because this bill was brought on very quickly, I have not been able to go down that path. It is my intention in the next couple of weeks to address that issue. This bill specifically addresses that relationship between big business and small business by giving small business the weapon, under the Trade Practices Act, to remedy their lack of bargaining power in the marketplace.
This bill does not reward inefficient small businesses, It is not a panacea for poor man 
 agement, inadequate capitalisation or the external economic situations which affect a market. I would also like to warn small business that it is no good signing leases and then coming running to politicians and saying, `The leases are wrong.' Before you sign a lease, go and seek some sort of assistance from a legal officer. I know that quite often people have made representations to members of parliament and senators about leases. There are unconscionable leases out there, and I warn people to not sign just anything.
This bill goes a long way to ensuring that small firms are not exploited by virtue of being the economic captives of large firms. In Australia today this situation applies to thousands of small businesses operating in markets efficiently controlled by two or three corporate giants. Many of these small businesses are farmers who supply fresh produce to supermarkets. As individuals they have no bargaining power against the might of Coles, Woolworths and Franklins. They are forced into price cuts and into meeting all sorts of demands regarding packaging, presentation and so on. There is a certain amount of fear out there that if any of them are prepared to go and bell the cat they will have their small businesses removed from the buying books of the large chains. I want to elaborate on that further.
Before entering the Senate I was a manufacturers' agent and I saw first hand the way in which big business abused their market power to extract huge discounts from small business suppliers or huge profits from small business customers. I came to the Senate with the aim of fighting for recognition of these kinds of problems facing small business. There has been some success, particularly in the early changes to the Trade Practices Act which prevented mergers from going ahead if significant lessening of competition in a market resulted. The Senate has heard many times from me about the powerless state of competition, particularly in Australian retailing which allows 75 per cent of market power to be in the hands of three major chains. This is in direct contrast to overseas countries like the United Kingdom and the United States, where antitrust provi 
 sions ensure that market power is spread more evenly, resulting in far greater levels of competition.
The horse has gone. We have let this market concentration build up all over Australia to the extent to which, I believe, it has become worse in Australia than in any OECD country. It is now going to be harder to get the horse back in the stable, but I think we do have to address this issue. Today is a particularly happy day for small business because there has finally been a huge jump in recognising the nature of the problems faced by small business in Australia in so many of their markets.
I congratulate the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, and I also congratulate Prime Minister John Howard because I never believed that we would not, and I thought it would always be very difficult not to, bend the knee to the big end of town. Both Peter Reith and John Howard have shown courage through this bill. There is no doubt that the Labor Party's constituency is the unions and the workers, the National Party's constituency is the farmers and the Liberal Party's constituency is big business and business. To go in and do something that would not receive a tick from some of their major constituents shows a lot of courage and shows that John Howard has got the interests of small business at heart. Maybe I am a doubting Thomas but I did not think the Liberals would be prepared to put this bill up. In doing so they have shown that they are genuinely concerned for small business. The government has also been soundly congratulated by the small business sector for biting the bullet on these much needed reforms.
The Reid report on fair trading led to the government's response in a report entitled New deal: fair deal—giving small business a fair go. The government is acting on each of the seven areas identified by the Reid report as needing attention. These areas are unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice, and education. Some of these issues require consultation with the states and territories prior to further legislation.
This bill before us strengthens the substantive legal rights available to small business against unfair conduct. It does this by amending the Trade Practices Act in two important areas: a new provision that gives small business genuine protection against unconscionable conduct and a new provision that will allow industry designed codes of practice to be prescribed as mandatory or voluntary codes to be enforced under the act. Unconscionable business conduct will be prohibited, giving rise to a broad range of remedies.
This bill gives effect to the view often expressed to previous governments that small business should be entitled to similar protection from unconscionable conduct to what consumers are. As well as having the legal rights afforded to consumers under section 51AB, this bill allows the Federal Court to have regard to a wide range of additional matters to establish whether conduct is unconscionable. Together, this means that the court can now consider the following: the relative strengths of bargaining positions; whether the business consumer had to comply with conditions that were not reasonably necessary for the protection of the legitimate interests of the supplier; whether any undue influence or pressure was exerted on, or any unfair tactics were used against, the business consumer; whether the business consumer was able to understand any document; the consistency of the conduct with other small business transactions; the requirements of any code of practice; the extent of disclosure and unforeseen risks; the willingness of big business to negotiate; and the good faith of both parties.
Importantly, small retail tenants will now be able to pursue remedies against unconscionable conduct by landlords. The Reid committee heard example after example of the plight of small tenants forced to move or to pay exorbitant rents because of their small market power in leasing situations. As a result of this bill the courts can have regard to the relative strengths of their bargaining positions. The minister is hopeful that this section will induce behavioural change by big business rather than increased litigation. This bill really does send a warning shot across the bows of big business. It is hoped that they will heed 
 this legislation and not be forced into litigation.
The legislative underpinning of codes of practice is an important new development because it adds teeth to the enforcement of such codes. A new section 51AD will provide that a person bound by the act must not contravene an industry code prescribed in the regulations. A breach of a prescribed code may result in a range of sanctions under the act, including injunctions, damages, requirements to give undertakings and orders to disclose information or publish corrective advertising.
This trade practices amendment bill, while small in itself, says volumes about the kind of society and community we want to nurture in Australia. The bill says that this coalition wants a thriving small business sector able to independently sustain hundreds of thousands of families and in turn their local communities. How many times have we heard that small business creates jobs? How many times have we heard governments playing lip-service to small business? But this bill today is a tangible manifestation of this government's seriousness in their consideration of small business.
This bill gives small business the confidence to stand up for themselves against unconscionable conduct. As I said earlier in my contribution, there is still out in the community, even with this legislation, a reluctance to take the big people on because of perceived retaliation or retaliation. I have heard a number of farmers and small business people say, `Yes, we may have some sort of legislative program that we can act on but we still have a business to run. If we offend any of the major chains, who else do we sell our product to? Eighty per cent of our business comes from four or five customers. We need them, so we are not prepared to take them on.' That is why I said that it is still going to need someone to go out there and bell the cat.
I hope that small business gains confidence with this bill; I hope that they can say that they have some legislative protection there. I hope that that in turn will give them confidence to go out there and boost investment in job-creating enterprise to the overall benefit 
 of Australia and small business in its government-recognised role of job creation.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-04-01,"—This Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  is a most important bill despite its being suddenly shovelled into the Senate program. The Australian Democrats welcome its appearance for the first time on the floor. It is a most important bill and probably the most important bill affecting Australia's small business community to be dealt with since the coalition came to power. Small business is crying out for fairer competition laws.	 Right across Australian industry big business has been steadily engaged in what big business is good at, and that is making themselves bigger. But in the process they have been making life harder and harder for small businesses. And the worst excess of big business results in standover tactics and degrading and unnecessary bankruptcies and stress for countless small businesses.
We also have a problem of concentration. In the retail area Australia now enjoys—although `enjoys' is an inappropriate word—the most concentrated market in the world. The big three retailers continue to dramatically increase their market share at the expense of independent small and medium businesses. That has not just meant fewer small businesses; it has also meant less employment as small businesses tend to be far more labour intensive than big business.
In the period from November 1996 to August 1997, for instance, small business employment growth was 78,000 whilst big business employment lost 1½ per cent of its employers. The triumph of big business over small is also death to competition. The destruction of competitors is ultimately the destruction of competition. Our business sector is increasingly concentrated and oligopolised.
This bill is particularly important to those small businesses whose very livelihood is dependent on the actions of larger businesses. Four areas in particular come to mind. The first and most obvious is retail tenancies. In my travels around Australia and indeed in my international travels in my former life, fair 
 trading and retail tenancy issues always loomed large. Over the last two years, and in the decade previous, dozens and dozens of tenants in large shopping centres have suffered the consequences of the bias in our tenancy law towards secrecy and the interests of property owners and landlords.
Dozens and dozens of tenants of large shopping centres have come to me to outline the serious problems in retail tenancy arrangements in Australia. I have been so concerned about it that I have written a booklet on leases, landlords and tenants, with which I am sure the Acting Deputy President and everyone else has kept themselves awake at night reading. However, it is a serious issue and it is an issue about which we all have to be concerned, regardless of our political parties.
The second area is the franchising industry. This was the industry where the government—initially the Labor government and then this coalition government when Geoff Prosser was minister—rejected calls from small business for national franchising legislation and instead opted for a voluntary industry code. Not surprisingly, at least to us, it did not work and the Franchising Code Council collapsed in January last year.
Again, it was Democrat action in the Senate, calling for all the documents relating to the collapse of the code, which exposed the then minister's real agenda—which was to allow the franchisors to take over the management of the code meant to regulate their affairs. Our public exposure of that grubby little arrangement, combined with the evidence to the Reid committee on fair trading, has seen that proposal shelved—and thank goodness for that—and the call by small business and the Democrats for a mandatory code underpinned by legislation and the ACCC now put into place. This bill attempts to go some of the way to doing that and is essential to that process.
The third area of concern is small business finance. A survey by the Society of Certified Practising Accountants last year showed that small business relies overwhelmingly on the big four banks for their finance; and that finance comes at a cost that is three to four per cent higher than home mortgages. Fortu 
 nately, public pressure is now shrinking these margins and banks are much more sensitive and much more responsive to this issue than they were. But there is a way to go yet. The Wallis inquiry also noted that competition in the banking market has not extended to the small business finance market. Not surprisingly, Australian businesses consequently face the highest real interest rates in the industrialised world. The Economist magazine monthly publishes such statistics, and there is no change in that situation.
Not surprisingly, over 20 per cent of small businesses with growth potential reported in a recent Yellow Pages survey that they are constrained by finance or a lack of cashflow which is often exacerbated by high loan costs. Yet little has been done to improve the captive position of small business vis a vis the four banks. The banking code of conduct is a pathetic document, drafted by the bankers themselves; while small business is still denied access to the banking ombudsman. I think this bill could and should be utilised to improve the standing of small business in their dealings with the banks.
The fourth area is the prime focus of this bill. The history of fair trading legislation is a long and tortuous one, extending back over nearly 20 years and at least six major inquiries. The Australian Democrats, going right back to our formation in 1997—21 years ago—have had an active role in seeking to ensure that small business has a fairer deal from big business. Along with small business, we have campaigned for many years for modifications to the Trade Practices Act to prevent greater encroachment on small business by the power of ever-expanding big corporations.
In 1991, Democrat Senator Sid Spindler successfully launched the campaign to have the mergers and acquisitions power in the Trade Practices Act amended to give the Trade Practices Commission power to prevent takeovers that lessened competition. Since that provision took effect in 1993 under the Labor government it has been of great assistance to small business, preventing Coles-Myer taking over a major independent wholesaler, guaranteeing the rights of independent distributors in 
 the Ampol-Caltex merger and imposing conditions on bank takeovers.
Senator Spindler, on behalf of the Democrats, was the first to move to improve the protection of vulnerable small business from unfair business conduct. In 1995, he unsuccessfully moved to protect small businesses against economic duress. Later that year, the Labor government brought forward its better business conduct bill. While this bill fell short of the level of protection for small business that the Democrats regarded as adequate, we were prepared to support it.
Unfortunately, that bill lapsed with the 1996 election—and that is the story of small businesses' life—and the new coalition government was less than urgent in its determination to take on its big business mates on behalf of its small business mates. Nevertheless, it did honour its promise to small business organisations and set up a House of Representatives committee of inquiry into fair trading, headed by Bruce Reid MP. Then Minister Geoff Prosser made it quite clear that he did not want legislative solutions, but voluntary industry-based solutions, and voluntary solutions do not work.
In a welcome display of fair-minded unanimity between Liberal and Labor members, and in response to overwhelming evidence from small business about the extent of fair trading problems, the committee ignored the minister and brought down a very brave and groundbreaking report which recommended major changes to the Trade Practices Act. The Labor Party, the Democrats and other parliamentarians immediately welcomed the committee's report and called for its immediate implementation.
I introduced a private member's bill into the Senate in June of last year which mirrored the committee's recommendations. In the meantime of course, Minister Prosser fell, over a conflict of interest over what he described as `property of various lots in Bunbury' which turned out to be very large shopping centre developments—thereby explaining to us, at least, his attraction to non-binding fair trading codes of practice.
Minister Peter Reith, to his credit, recognised the scope of the problems in small busi 
 ness and has brought forward this bill. It should be noted that the Reith bill falls well short of the Reid committee recommendations and, as presently drafted, is unlikely to provide the level of protection sought by small business. Indeed, many, including us, are concerned that its wording may be such that it ends up not providing much new protection to small business at all. That does not mean to say it is not a bill that we do not support: in trying to advance the cause of small business, every bill of this kind is worth supporting.
I can understand Mr Reith's dilemma. On the one hand, he serves a Prime Minister who is under a public promise to look after the interests of small business as the backbone of the Australian economy but, on the other hand, the Prime Minister is also under a private commitment to the banks and big corporations who provide the vast bulk of the Liberal Party's $14 million electoral war chest, and they expect him to look after their interests as well. So Minister Reith has a difficult balancing task.
I want to briefly outline the key differences between the Reid committee recommendations—which, I think, represented the minimum necessary level of protection for small business—and what we would describe as the Reith bill before us. Proposed new section 51AC sets into the Trade Practices Act a provision outlawing unconscionable conduct by corporations against persons. Whether conduct is unconscionable is to be determined by examining all the circumstances of a case, including a number of facts outlined in the bill. The term, unconscionable, is problematic. It is the term used in the current section 51AA that has proven useless to small business. It is problematic because there is a considerable body of law in equity defining the very narrow legal understanding of what unconscionability actually means. The judiciary has not shown any willingness or desire to push the envelope in this area of law.
The Reid committee extensively examined the doctrine of unconscionability and concluded that it was not capable of dealing with the types of conduct complained of to the in 
 quiry—remember that this was a unanimous committee who had unanimous findings, with the benefit of six, I think, inquiries before them and the benefit of some very detailed submissions; they did not arrive at a unanimous position lightly and the fact that the government has discarded it is worrying, to say the least. The Reid committee called instead for the use of the term, unfair trading—a much broader test and a much more understood test that avoids the problems of unconscionable conduct. Unconscionability is not a word in wide use; unfairness is.	The Reid committee concluded that the term, unfair trading, would provide a much broader test. This term has been in New South Wales contracts law over 50 years.
The second major difference is in the definition of small business. The Reid report used the ABS's definition of small business. In some ways, that is logical.
—Senator Schacht, resume your seat.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: under what standing order do I have to resume my seat? I went to get some material from Senator Conroy.
—You have been standing there, and I asked you to resume your seat. There is no point of order.
—The Australian Bureau of Statistics' definition is that a small business is any business below 20 employees or, in manufacturing, below 100 employees. The Reith bill does not use that definition. It sets a ceiling of $1 million on the provision of services or goods under the contract. This will undoubtedly exclude many small businesses. If you take the example of service stations, you will see $1 million is easily overcome. It is not unusual for retail tenancies on a standard five-plus-five option to exceed rentals of $1 million over 10 years, and they would be denied any assistance under the bill. The third key difference is in relation to codes of conduct. The committee recognised the importance that codes of conduct will play in defining unfair trading. It has recommended 
 that they should be mandatory and approved by the ACCC; that is also our view. The Reith bill rejected these recommendations. The approvals will be by the minister, and the minister will decide whether they will be mandatory or not. Indeed, the minister makes it pretty clear in his Giving small business a fair go  document that mandatory codes would be the exception rather than the rule and would be approved only if voluntary codes did not work.
Voluntary codes do not work. Self-regulation is always affected by the interaction of self-interest and, if you have big business interests opposed to small business interests, those voluntary codes will simply not work. We think the minister has copped out in this area. It seems the government has learnt nothing from the franchising code debacle, nothing from the banking code of conduct failures and nothing from the crisis in retail tenancies around Australia at the moment. We think the voluntary code solution is an inadequate response in those respects and that it detracts from the likely level of protection that this bill could and should afford small business.
Having identified the weaknesses of the government's preferred approach, I commend the government on bringing this bill forward. The issues of fair trading are urgent issues. They should have been dealt with years ago—at least last year—and every month of delay sees more and more small businesses sent into financial difficulty as a result of the contractual relationships they have with franchisors, with  suppliers, with banks and with landlords.
The Democrats support the general thrust of the bill but we will be moving amendments in the committee stage. I note that the Labor Party have amendments and I understand that the Greens (WA) will have amendments. We will reserve our detailed discussions of those amendments until then.
My concluding remark is not a strange one. To small business, matters of unfair conduct towards them are part of the whole human rights debate in this country. These are issues whereby the weak, the vulnerable and the disadvantaged are stood over by the strong 
 and by those who are privileged to have the support of the law and the chief institutions in our society as presently set. This bill would go some way to restoring some balance, but it is by no means anything other than a beginning. We need to do far, far more to arrive at a situation where there will be far fewer of the heart-rending stories in our society that you read in the Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia report by the Reid committee. People in those situations often lose their wealth, their marriages and their futures. We look forward to a useful and productive debate to advance the cause of small business.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (FAIR TRADING) BILL 1997 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-01,"—I rise to speak to the Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997 . As Senator Cook and other Labor Party speakers have said, we will not delay the bill but we will seek to put a number of amendments to improve it. I suspect they will be very similar to amendments moved by the Democrats and the Greens. We believe the amendments will substantially strengthen the bill in the way it can protect and enhance small business in this country.
There is only one reason we have this bill before us which details, in a number of significant ways, changes to the Trade Practices Act to offer better protection to small business. Above all else, the previous minister for small business in this government, Mr Prosser, made such an unholy hash of his responsibilities when he was the minister that he had to be dismissed by the Prime Minister. We had the extraordinary example of a then minister for small business being a major commercial landlord owning buildings and renting them to small business yet being in charge of reviewing retail tenancies for the small business community in Australia—an absolute conflict of interest if ever there was one. Yet it took nearly two months for the Prime Minister to realise that the conflict of interest was untenable and that Mr Prosser would have to go. When Mr Prosser defended himself—in the parliament and elsewhere—by saying that he saw no conflict of interest, it was the height of the theatre of the absurd.
He had made such a mess of protecting and promoting small business interests in Australia and, when he was finally sacked, the damage done to the government was so extensive that the new minister, Mr Reith, realised that no amount of comforting statements would be accepted by the small business community and that action was needed. In particular, the Reid report and the unanimous recommendations from that bipartisan committee of Labor and Liberal members from the lower house would have to be substantially implemented.
Until the demise of Mr Prosser it was clear that, if Mr Prosser had had his way, the Reid recommendations would disappear into some dusty pigeonhole, never to emerge again. I again congratulate my parliamentary colleague the shadow minister for small business, Mr Martin, for the role he played in exposing Mr Prosser's conflict of interest as small business minister, which led to the government having to take this report seriously.
Senator Boswell has spoken in this debate, as leader of the National Party in this place. As a former minister for small business, I place on record that I think he is, without doubt, the most genuine spokesperson for small business from either of the two coalition parties. When I was small business minister, he was genuine in raising with me a number of issues about how to improve the situation for small business. He raised them with considerable passion at times—in this place, at committee level and in private with me. I have always been amazed because I would have thought that the most relevant person for the coalition to appoint as minister for small business would have been Senator Boswell. But, because Senator Boswell holds true to himself and always speak openly and honestly—even if it is against the dictates of the government's line—he finds it difficult to get a guernsey on the front bench as a minister, and I respect him for that.
—So what do you think of yourself when you didn't speak out when your government did things you disapproved of?
—After your performance in higher education and schools, I think you have paid the biggest penalty of all. The 
 Prime Minister has decided what he thinks of your ministerial performance by comprehensively sacking you.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Madam Acting Deputy President, Senator Vanstone got dumped by the Prime Minister for failing—
—After doing his dirty work.
—to do all the dirty work. After all but destroying the tertiary education system in this country, and many other things, she got comprehensively dumped. But, despite being humiliated, she apparently copped it sweet. She did not whinge or make any complaint. She did not come in here and say, `Mr Howard has been unfair to me.' She copped it sweet as apparently she still could be the Minister for Justice, running around with the Federal Police trying to find Mr Skase somewhere in the world.
Even when I was the minister for small business I put on the record that I thought Senator Boswell was the most creditable figure in the then opposition to speak on small business, because he genuinely spoke about it. When I introduced my Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill—a bill containing many provision similar to those in the bill now before us—Senator Boswell made it quite clear that he supported it. He thought it was a major step forward for the advantage of small business.
That did not make him too popular with the Libs from the top end of town, the Liberal Party from Melbourne—including the now Treasurer, Mr Costello—and other big business interests who were trying at that time to do everything to ignore having to declare a position on whether or not they would support my bill. During the election campaign, right up until election day, Mr Howard would not commit himself on support of my bill.
—But this was three years ago.
—But, Senator, Senator Boswell did. As I say, I acknowledge the fact 
 that he is the only creditable figure to speak on small business, irrespective of whether he is in government or opposition.
The Liberal Party in the end would always give in to the interests of big business. It was only the fact that Mr Prosser made such a mess of defending big business and that his conflict of interest was so palpable that, after two months of slowly rotting on the scaffold, the Prime Minister had to sack him. The only way to recover the standing of the government on this issue was to accept some of the major recommendations of the Reid committee—and that is why we have the bill before us.
Mr Reith has made himself a hero within some sections of the Liberal Party in that he is now prepared to produce this bill. As I say, we support the thrust of the bill, but we will be moving amendments to strengthen the bill even further to the advantage of small business.
As both the Reid report and other people in here have commented, including Senator Boswell—and as Senator Murray, who spoke just before me, eloquently explained: there is no doubt that the economic power of big business, when in dispute with small business, is usually the deciding factor in the determination of that dispute. When I was small business minister I had plenty of evidence that, if there was a contractual dispute, big business was able to use its financial power to drag the dispute out for a lengthy period of time in the courts so that, in the end, it literally starved the small business person into submission.
A provision that I produced in the better business conduct bill was that the Trade Practices Commission, now the ACCC, would have the ability to take the case, if they thought it substantial and significant, on behalf of a small business complainant to the court, and it would fund it so that there would be an equality in the dispute before the court. In that way, the economic power of big business would not be able to always crush the small business operator.
Though we had tried voluntary codes of practice, particularly in the franchising area, it was clear that they were not going to work, 
 unless they were backed by a strengthened Trade Practices Act; that the code of practice would be enforced by appropriate legal remedy that could be quickly taken. This, again, is where the late unlamented Mr Prosser said, `Well, we'll have a voluntary code of practice in franchising'—and, as Senator Murray pointed out, he was quite willing to have that code of practice administered by the franchisors in taking over the franchisees' interests. We would have had what in other cases people would have thought pretty odd: an employer organisation representing the trade unions. This would have been the proposal; he was quite happy if there were a voluntary code of practice for franchising, but basically it would run and administered by the franchisors in Australia.
An inquiry we did in my time as minister showed that something like 20 per cent of franchisors were in dispute with their franchisees. That was an unacceptably high level of dispute, where franchisors were being sued by their franchisees, because the franchisees had been misled because the disclosure levels were not being properly adhered to by the franchisors. It is clear that you will have to have a franchising code that has teeth in it, that is a uniform code and that is actually backed by legislation—and that is administered independently, and not just by the franchisors.
We believe that, rather than relying on the phrase `unconscionable conduct', the bill should be amended to use the phrase `unfair conduct'. This will strengthen the bill. Properly used, `unconscionable conduct' with other provisions would be a strengthened provision. But we believe that `unfair conduct', as recommended by the Reid committee, is the way to go, and we will support those amendments.
But the biggest weakness in this Reid bill is the fact that the minister and the government have not accepted the Reid report's recommendations to legislate for uniform retail tenancies in this country. There is no doubt that this is the major area of continuous dispute between small retailers and their landlords: the contractual arrangements small retailers have to enter into to get access to 
 reasonable outlets in big shopping centres, other shopping centres; this is a continuous matter of dispute. We have all heard the horror stories, as tabled and written up in the report of the Reid committee, of the way in which there is a take it or leave it attitude given to the small retailer who wants access to a shop in a big shopping centre.
We believe that to leave it to the states and territories so that we end up with eight different codes of practice reliant on different state and territory legislation will only create confusion. In that confusion, the big end of town will always have the advantage because they will be able to use their economic power to impose their will on small business. Having a uniform retail tenancy code that is legislated and backed nationally is the way to provide the best and most simplified protection; protection that will be easily understood by all and not be confused by having different codes in different states.
I know that the Liberal Party has an ideological objection and says that this is centralising more power in Canberra. The irony is that, if you really want to help the ultimate small people in this country—small business—there must be a decent code at the national level. If you want to put them in a weaker position in the community, you will have six state and two territory codes operating. That will weaken small business. At times you do need strong, clear, firm, national legislation to protect the weakest in the country. That is the irony. I  suspect the Liberal Party says for ideological reasons that this is a state issue, but in doing so they are inhibiting and weakening the position of the people they profess to support.
We will also be moving an amendment to the provisions in the bill which limit the application of transactions to those of less than $1 million over five years. This could mean that a large number of small businesses would not get the protection that this bill claims it will provide to them. We will certainly be moving amendments that clarify that particular provision.
This is a very important bill. The opposition does not deny that. We are disappointed that the minister did not take the last full step on 
 the Reid recommendations in a number of areas to achieve a bill that all small businesses in Australia would welcome. There is no doubt that, whatever the success of this bill, it will be regularly revisited because the issues that small business are concerned about in the balance of economic power between them and big business will always be a matter of debate.
When I introduced legislation in my time as minister, I did not say that this was the end of the line or that the ultimate peak had been reached for the protection of small business. We have a dynamic economy; one that is always economically changing. Therefore, one should always keep these sorts of legislative requirements under review.
When I was small business minister the support I received from the Small Business Forum was very useful. We had input or advice to government about what issues were of particular concern to small business. The issues that this bill deals with in part, but not completely, were consistently the main issues raised with me as minister for small business. I am sure that in another 10 years when we attend small business forums of one form or another, these issues about the balance of economic power between big and small businesses will still be the major issues discussed among small business people.
Most of the people at the Small Business Forum would not be regarded as natural supporters of the Labor Party, but they were willing to support what we tried to do at the end of 1996. It is with regret that when the election was called we were unable to debate the bill at that time. Nevertheless, the Labor Party at that time put on record in its bill our commitment to help small business.
The present government, which was then in opposition, refused to declare its position on better business conduct in the bill, as it had refused to declare its position all through the 13 years we were in government about the way to improve the Trade Practices Act to help small business.
Senator Murray mentioned Senator Spindler, who was a former Democrat senator on the Legal and Constitutional Committee. He and I made recommendations to change the 
 provision of the Trade Practices Act from `dominance of the market' test to `a substantial lessening of competition'. I was on the committee at the same time as Senator Spindler. I strongly supported that change. I think Senator Spindler and I were the only two members of that committee, and a minority, who even went a step further and said that the Trade Practices Act and the then Trade Practices Commission—now the ACCC—should have a permanent power of divestiture, such as the power invested by the American Congress into the appropriate regulatory bodies in America. That is a standing power of divestiture that I think has been used only two or three times in almost 80 years of history of American trade practices law. But the fact that it is there has meant that on many occasions a big business has decided to step back from some of its more robust activities.
I supported that with Senator Spindler. It was not taken up by my government or this government but that is an issue. As there is more and more concentration by big business in the running of the economy and its influence on the economy, the divestiture issue will be raised again. It is certainly raised by the small business community. There is no doubt that, if the test that we now have of substantial lessening of competition had been available in the eighties, the creation of Coles Myer would probably not have been allowed. Most people—maybe even the shareholders of Coles Myer—might think now that that was not a bad idea in view of all the turmoil that company has been through. In future further mergers of that kind will not be allowed to take place.
We commend the thrust of this bill to the Senate, but we do commend very strongly our amendments. In particular, the amendment I would certainly like to see carried by the Senate is the establishment of the uniform retail tenancy code in Australia. I believe that will help more small businesses than any another matter before us today. I commend my shadow ministry colleague Steve Martin for putting these amendments forward and hope we can win the Senate on them.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-01,"—I am a bit taken aback. We tried to fit in with the speakers list today but I did not know Senator Schacht was speaking. I had lunchtime commitments, and then Senator Schacht spoke for his full 20 minutes. However, that is fine if we had known what was going on. We are trying to fit in with the practice of the Senate in trying to get the program through, but sometimes bills come on more quickly than it is possible to prepare for.
The  Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Bill 1997  is an effort by the government to demonstrate its commitment and effort to the traditional coalition allies—that is, the small businesses of Australia. I think they have slipped down in the estimation of that particular sector. The opposition is also trying to rack up its small business points by heavily criticising the government's approach and proposing a wide range of amendments.
The report, Finding a balance, is the catalyst for this bill. The opposition claims that the government has not gone far enough to truly implement the recommendations of the report. The criticism does hold some weight. The Greens (WA) will be supporting some of the ALP's amendments which attempt to implement the report more fully.
Section 51AC, dealing with unconscionable conduct, has been mentioned. The bill seeks to introduce a substantive action available for unconscionable conduct. The problem is that in order to maintain some form of equity, the government is using a definition which accords with a very narrow dealing with that word. In practical terms, the words are limited to three narrow sets of circumstances which have been clearly inadequate in the situation of a commercial relationship where there are differences in bargaining power. It has been mentioned that the word `unfair' might be a better compromise because then you do not have to match it up with a particular piece of legislation, and it would appear to be a better approach. It is also the approach that was taken in the report.
Under small business definitions I would like to comment on the $1 million transaction cap placed on the access of section 51AC. 
 The biggest problem with this provision relates to the question: what amounts to a transaction? Depending on the scope of a transaction, does it apply, for instance, if a retail shop lease is for five years? Is this each year? Does there have to be that $1 million cap each year or can it be the whole transaction? This might be a limiting factor for very small businesses. Is it the small-purchase expensive items over a period of time that might be all on one invoice—for example, the purchase of cars or machinery for a car dealership?
The Greens (WA) appreciate that a monetary cap of $40,000 is also placed on remedies available to consumers, so potentially there is some guidance from those provisions. It would also be wise to clear up such potential anomalies before the legislation passes.
The Greens (WA) see more potential problems with the insertion of an arbitrary number of employees as the limit to access to this remedy. It appears that the ALP would not allow a business with more than 20 employees, or 100 in manufacturing, to be deemed a small business. This could be problematic in industries where there is a high level of casual employment and hence a larger number of employees—for instance, in the hospitality industry. It may exclude many businesses it is aimed at from obtaining relief. I would think that large organisations such as Westfield may well have supported this definition—in fact, I think they did. So in this particular instance we are more likely to support the government's proposal than the ALP's amendment, though there are problems in the government's proposal as well.
As to the uniform retail tenancy code, the government obviously believes that there are some problems in terms of constitutional limits. We do not think these are major problems. It is interesting that the government finds constitutional limits as an excuse where it is convenient for itself but do not listen to it in such important issues as the debate on native title. They also make claims about uncertainty and possibilities of court action, saying that two layers of legislation may create uncertainty and potential litigation over more procedural issues such as jurisdiction 
 and standing. They also have concerns about competition—whether or not competition in tenancy legislation lifts standards. I find that a bit bizarre.
The committee report and the ALP in this regard support a uniform retail tenancy code in order to implement best practice regimes throughout Australia, including measures to take account of the disparity in bargaining power, independent market rent reviews, pre-contractual disclosure statements and alternative dispute resolution procedures. Maybe the constitutional problems that the coalition identifies are justified. However, the code will lift the standards of South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria to rival the best practices in Queensland and New South Wales. It would also provide affordable dispute resolution procedures. Therefore, we think the constitutional problems and the holes created may not be sufficient for us not to support the ALP's amendments.
We have looked at something in terms of the alternative dispute resolution. The Greens (WA) propose an amendment in line with the committee recommendations, in light of the fact that this remedy of unconscionable conduct is aimed at providing relief to small businesses. The implementation of alternative dispute resolution procedures is crucial because small businesses presumably have less time and resources to spend battling out a long court battle. Thus, the alternative dispute resolutions provide true access to justice in a cost- effective and timely manner.
Often in commercial transactions there is a need to maintain a relationship, more likely to be facilitated by alternative dispute resolutions that offer a wide range of solutions than litigation, which is confrontational, adversarial and produces only one winner. We wish there was equal access to justice but it seems that the more money you have, the more access to justice you have. So the more you can remove that from the courts, the better.

"Colston, Sen Malcolm",IND,1998-04-01,"—Madam Acting Deputy President, this afternoon I raise the issue of a series of questions I intended to ask on notice. After I submitted the questions, I was informed by Madam President that the questions would not appear on the Senate Notice Paper . While the questions are unusual, I do not consider that they break standing orders—
—Order! The matter to which Senator Colston is now seeking to refer in debate appears to be similar to matter contained in a document which he has sought to have laid before the Senate and in questions on notice which he has lodged but which the President has declined at this stage to include in the Notice Paper .
The President has indicated to Senator Colston that she wishes to take advice and to determine whether she should not allow this material to be published through the privileged forum of the Senate because it may violate the Senate's sub judice convention in that it could be prejudicial to the legal proceedings pending in respect of Senator Colston.
The Senate, by its vote on a proposed reference to the Privileges Committee, indicated that it wished to avoid any debate or inquiry on matters relating to the charges laid against Senator Colston until the legal proceedings are concluded.
Having regard to that resolution by the Senate and to past precedents of the application of the sub judice convention, the President wishes to make a considered determina 
 tion on whether Senator Colston should be allowed to publish this material through the Senate. She has sought independent legal advice on whether the matter in question is likely to be prejudicial to the legal proceedings involving Senator Colston. Until she has made that determination, Senator Colston may not proceed, and I so rule. I call Senator Cook.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I wish to disagree with your ruling. I am not quite sure what the terminology is because I have never done so before.
—Senator Colston, I am advised that, if you move dissent from a ruling, it would need to be in writing.
—Can I move that I dissent from your ruling?
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: before Senator Colston does that, it may be appropriate if he were heard on a point of order, because I think it is proper for him to raise a point of order. I do not know what his point of order would be but, rather than getting into a debate at this point on dissension from your ruling, it might be appropriate, if it were possible, for a point of order to be heard first before this happened. I know there are senators on both sides who have an interest in speaking today, and it might save the Senate a lot of time if we were to do that.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: I respect that the President has ruled that there is material that may be sub judice and that Senator Colston may want to table that material or introduce it in his speech and she wants to take a further considered view. I want to ask: does that mean that Senator Colston cannot speak at all in anticipation? Shouldn't it be that if, when he is speaking, he gets to material that may be sub judice, you would rule then that he cannot speak? I find it difficult to accept that he cannot speak at all because he may want to talk about something else that has nothing to do with the court case.
I completely support the sub judice ruling—there can be no argument about introducing that material—but he may want to talk about something else that we have not even thought of, and I think he may have the right to speak on this matter of public importance on other matters. If he does stray into something that is sub judice, you would then rule him out of order accordingly until the President gives a considered reply.
—Senator Colston commenced with a statement with respect to questions on notice, which was clearly the matter referred to in the President's ruling. On Senator O'Chee's point of order, I am not sure that it is a point of order to suggest that someone might seek to make a point of order. I would suggest, at this stage, that we continue with the next speaker in the debate.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. I am afraid that I did not hear your original ruling but, having checked with senators and clerks at the table, as I understand it, Senator Colston began to make a contribution to matters of public interest. He was given the call at 12.45 p.m. by you, but you were handed, by the Deputy Clerk, a ruling of the President that may be related to these matters. I did not have the opportunity of hearing the ruling and I have not actually heard any of Senator Colston's contribution. but I make this point: I think that Senator O'Chee's contribution ought to be listened to here.
I received, by the way, a different order of speakers for matters of public interest—I am actually on the list of speakers myself. If the President cares to make a ruling, then I think that is a matter for the President. I think you have properly called the next speaker and surely the matter can be dealt with when Senator Colston next has the call and the President is in the chair.
I do not know how germane the ruling is that the President has asked the presiding senator to make. It is very difficult for a senator who actually was not present in the chamber at the time that ruling was made to judge that, but I think the point of order I am taking is a sensible one in this circumstance. 
 I think it is pretty similar, frankly, to the point that Senator O'Chee took a little time ago. It is competent, I suppose, in accordance with the standing orders for senators to move dissent if they so desire. But frankly I suspect, on a matter such as this, that the President ought to be in the chair to defend the ruling.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, on the  point of order: as I have understood what Senator Faulkner has said, I think the proposition he is putting is the correct one. The President may have notice of some details of whatever it is that Senator Colston wants to raise. I certainly do not. Madam Acting Deputy President, I do not know whether you are familiar with the contents of those things, and I see by a quick nod of the head that you might not be. Therefore, it is not appropriate for Senator Colston to continue on the understanding that you will call him to order if he breaches the sub judice rule, because you are not familiar with the matters he may raise, and you may not have that capacity—not by dint of a lack of intellectual skills but by not being familiar with the material at hand.
If everybody is in agreement, it would seem that the sensible thing to do is to allow another speaker to go first, ahead of Senator Colston, so that the President can be in the chair if she wants to make an appropriate ruling. She is apparently familiar with this material in a way that I am not. Then, if Senator Colston wanted to proceed and move a motion of dissent from what is the President's ruling, the President would be here to handle that. That seems to me to be the appropriate way to go. Rather than continue with points of order, let people continue with their matters of public interest until such time as the President can be here. Then Senator Colston, if he is agreeable, can proceed with his contribution and he and the President can have such interchange as they choose. In the end, if there is a vote it will be up to us to decide.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I add further to the point of order. It ought to be put on record that you have acted absolutely properly in this regard. It is a point that has not been made by me, Sena 
 tor Vanstone or anyone else who has taken a point of order. It ought to be said that, as the Acting Deputy President, you have properly received advice from the clerks at the table. That is a correct course of action for you to take and for any presiding Acting Deputy President to take. You have made a ruling on advice accordingly, which again is a proper course of action for you to take. That point needs to be made about the good sense and dignity of the approach that you have taken in the chair to a procedural question, which perhaps for you and a number of other senators may well have come from left field.
—With the agreement of the Senate, I propose that we take that course of action. I now call Senator Cook to continue the debate on matters of public interest.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Do we know when the President will be here so that Senator Colston can make his contribution?
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I speak to the point of order. The only point that is being made is that, if for some reason the President is out of the building and therefore there is not the capacity for her to come back in and deal with the issue, time should be provided at another date.
—The same issue will arise whenever Senator Colston makes the contribution, as you are aware.
—That is the point: you should not preclude him from speaking in a matter of public interest which occurs only once a week, on my understanding. If you are going to deny him the opportunity to speak this Wednesday lunchtime—
—We are not denying that.
—No, I am saying that, if the President is not able to be here before 2 o'clock, some other time ought to be made available at a later date which accommodates the President's presence. Then we can have the matter properly resolved.
—Order! On that matter, I propose that we make inquiries to see when the President will be 
 available and in the meantime Senator Cook will proceed.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Senator Colston</title>,Matters of Public Interest,6,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-04-01,"—On 30 March Senator Stott Despoja asked me a question, which I took on notice, about the imprisonment of Commonwealth prisoners. I seek leave to incorporate the answer into Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Stott-Despoja's question had a number of elements to it, as follows:
•	 Are any prisoners convicted of federal crimes incarcerated in private prisons, or are there likely to be any?
•	 Is the Minister concerned about the delay in ambulances getting in to the Port Phillip private prison?
•	 What is the Government doing to resolve these particular problems?
•	 How far will the Government go in allowing the punishments administered by the State to be handed out by the private sector?
•	 Do you acknowledge that there is a federal implication given that some federal prisoners are incarcerated in State prisons? and
•	 Does the Government condone the `paying of prisoners to go to bed'?
The answers to Senator Stott-Despoja's questions are as follows:
I am advised that there is one federal prisoner, and one prisoner sentenced for State and federal convictions, in Port Phillip private prison.
I have no specific information about any delay in the arrival of ambulances at the Port Phillip private prison. However, I would be concerned at a delay in the arrival of an ambulance at any emergency scene, whether it involved a Commonwealth prisoner a State prisoner, or any other person.
Prisons are administered by the States and the Northern Territory. The health and well-being of federal and State/Territory prisoners is the responsibility of the State or Territory in which the prisoner is incarcerated.
The Commonwealth does not operate or control any prisons. Section 120 of the Constitution requires that the States must make provision for the detention in their prisons of persons convicted of federal offences.
The effect of section l9A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) is that State and Territory authorities may 
 move federal prisoners between prisons within a jurisdiction as if they were State or Territory offenders. Those authorities do not notify the Commonwealth each time a federal prisoner is moved within a jurisdiction. To require this to be done would impose an unreasonable burden on both State/Territory and Commonwealth authorities.
The role of the Commonwealth is to administer the sentences imposed on all federal offenders. This involves considering whether to release a federal prisoner on parole (where appropriate), setting parole conditions and determining various applications made by the prisoner (such as applications for early release on licence or exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy). The Commonwealth has no role in the administration of State and Territory prisons, whether they be private or Government run.
However, while the Commonwealth has no role to play in the administration or operation of State prisons, I am naturally concerned that appropriate standards are maintained within the prison environment.
I assume that the Honourable Senator's question regarding the `paying of prisoners to go to bed' is a reference to an alleged incident at Port Phillip prison on New Year's Eve, 1997.
I am advised that this allegation, among others, will be investigated by a Special Task Force to be led by the Victorian Corrective Services Commissioner, John Van Groningen.
The conduct of this inquiry is properly a matter for the Victorian Government. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Prisons</title>,Questions Without Notice,11,1

Appendix 1
Name of bill:
Health Legislation Amendment (Health Care Agreements) Bill 1998
Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
The bill would authorise the Commonwealth to make new hospital funding agreements with the States beyond 30 June 1998.
The bill also makes a number of changes in relation to alleged cost-shifting by the States.
Recent amendments to the bill attempt to put in place protections if the Commonwealth and the States are unable to reach new agreements for tile period 1 July 98 to 30 June 2003.
This bill and the agreements based upon it are the most important single element of Australia's health system and a number of important issues need to be considered by the committee.
Any satisfactory future arrangements for the funding of vital public hospital services depends upon cooperation of the States but the States were not consulted about this bill and have grave reservations about the new definition of `designated health services' and the legality of delivering certain existing services under this definition. The States are also concerned about the way in which the `Health Information Commissioner would operate to police cost-shifting.
The committee mill also be able to help the Senate understand whether or not agreements are likely to be signed, precisely what is covered by those agreements, and whether or not the protections in the bill covering the possibility of no agreements being in place are sufficiently strong.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-04-01,"—I table a statement on the overseas agriculture, resources and energy mission to Europe and Korea by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) and seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The purpose of my address is to provide the house with an up-to-date assessment of relevant agricultural reform and trade policy developments gathered during my recent mission to Europe and Korea between 3-14 March 1998. My visits in Europe included attendance at the OECD Agriculture Ministers' Meeting and a Quint meeting of Agriculture Ministers from Australia, United States, Canada, the European Commission and Japan. Bilateral discussions were also held with US Secretary Glickman, EU Commissioner Fischler, UK Agriculture Minister Cunningham and Japanese Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Shimamura. I also met with industry representatives including the President of the National Farmers Union in the United Kingdom.
In Korea, I met with a range of senior Ministers and industry representatives including Dr Kim-Sung Hoon, Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, Mr Park Tae-Young, Minister for Industry and Energy and Dr Joo Yang-Ja, Minister for Health and Welfare. I also held discussions with a wide range of Korean agricultural resources and energy industry leaders including meat industry representatives 
 and Korean worsted spinners and weavers industry representatives.
The timing of the OECD meeting which was attended by 29 Ministers for Agriculture in the developed world was also particularly relevant because of preparations now under way for the 1999 agricultural negotiations mandated in the Uruguay Round; a prospective new comprehensive WTO round at the turn of the century; and the domestic agricultural policy reform agendas being considered in a number of countries, including the Agenda 2000 reform package being developed by the European Commission.
The OECD meeting focused on a stocktake of agricultural and trade reforms in member countries since the 1987 OECD Ministerial Principles for Agricultural Policy Reform were agreed, and consideration of the need and scope for further reforms. These deliberations were drawn together in a Joint Ministerial Communique at the end of the session.
Australia's main goals at this meeting were to secure recognition of the need for further agricultural policy reform; acknowledgment of the 1999 WTO Agricultural Negotiations as the key vehicle for further reform; endorsement for further analytical work by the OECD to assist forthcoming WTO negotiations and to negotiate a reform oriented communique to progress the removal of support and protection for agriculture through greater market orientation.
Bearing in mind that the OECD is a multilateral organisation of member countries with a strong European Union membership of 15 countries as well as other agricultural protectionist countries such as Japan, Korea, Switzerland and Norway, the above objectives though realistic, were never going to be easy as such countries jockey for position in the context of the forthcoming WTO agricultural negotiations.
In these circumstances Australia with general support from New Zealand and USA (and limited support from some EU delegates such as UK and Sweden) did in my view manage to effectively hold the line and maintain the essential reform principles. This work was reflected in a Communique together with Secretariat background papers which recognised that, while progress has been made in agricultural policy reforms since 1987, more needs to be done particularly since progress in policy reform has been uneven across countries and commodities and that the agricultural sector in many countries is still substantially supported and not sufficiently responsive to market signals.
The Communique reaffirmed the commitment to the long term goal of domestic and international policy reform to allow for a greater influence of market signals as contained in Article 20 of the 
 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and the commitment to undertake further negotiations as foreseen in that Article. Importantly, the Communique also outlined a future role for the OECD to contribute to the achievement of  future goals through analysis and evaluation of domestic policies, agricultural markets and trade developments and the scope for new policy approaches which, as for the Uruguay Round, should provide useful material in negotiations. It will now be necessary for Australia and others to ensure a suitable work program is fully implemented on a timely basis.
Despite these achievements we have a lot more to do. In Paris it was a matter of considerable concern to fair trading country representatives including myself that most European Union and other European countries, as well as Japan and Korea mounted a coordinated and multifaceted campaign to delete and detract reformist goals from the Communique wording at every opportunity, with some success given their numbers.
The extent of the obstructionism which I observed and encountered illustrates the challenge for Australia and other low cost exporters in the next round of WTO agricultural negotiations. Some delegations clearly sought to wind the clock back on reform with diversionary tactics related to matters such as food security and the so-called ""multifunctionality"" of agriculture (rural development, environmental safeguards, regional employment etc), a new approach to ""non-trade concerns"" by the protectionists which, if not tackled appropriately, risks becoming entrenched as justification for prolonging or enhancing production related agricultural income and price supports, rather than the use of targeted and transparent policy measures decoupled from production to achieve these objectives.
It is clear to me that both food security and multifunctionality will need to be confronted in the WTO negotiations context.
The Quint meeting of Agriculture Ministers from Australia, USA, Japan, Canada and the European Union was instigated and hosted by Commissioner Fischler following the OECD meeting. This meeting was explicitly not a negotiating forum but rather an opportunity to exchange views on domestic agricultural and agricultural trade policy reform in a smaller group and to improve understanding of the scope and need for agricultural reform.
The meeting provided a further opportunity for me to explain in some detail both the facts and the underlying policy features of our domestic policy reforms including the integration of deregulated agricultural policy with our wider economic and social policy agendas.
I was also able to argue that such an approach has delivered results in rural Australia despite adverse 
 market and seasonal conditions in many industries and that such a policy approach could have applications in other countries particularly those represented at the meeting. I believe this was a major lubricant for Quint discussion on both domestic reform and the closely associated trade policy action issues.
I was able to directly address the separate issues of multifunctionality and food security which arose at both the OECD and Quint meetings. While no conclusions were reached, the participants were left in no doubt that rural and regional development, environmental improvement and maintenance of the social fabric of rural areas were not only issues in Europe and Japan but were very real political, social and economic challenges in Australia and other efficient exporting countries. This point appears not to be adequately understood in the international arena where the so-called `old' countries seem to feel they have a monopoly on such challenges.
With food security we addressed the scope for more open trading arrangements as a basis for enhancing security rather than protectionist stances which inhibit economic development. We have much further to go in this debate including, I suspect, consideration of the scope for the new round of agricultural negotiations to address how Governments might facilitate supply commitments to importing countries recognising however that commercial operations (not Governments) undertake the actual trade in commodities. Greater recourse to improved long term contracts, joint ventures and more open foreign investment flows are well-known examples of how private commercial mechanisms can improve food supply security.
An important point from my extensive discussions in Paris and London is that while reform of the CAP remains a major challenge for Australia and other fair-trading countries, it is also clear that the pace and extent of CAP reform is a matter of debate within the European Union.
It is my observation that despite the massive sums of tax-payers and consumer funds transferred to European farmers over the years there is still extensive discontent amongst European farmers and wide-ranging demonstrations in which European farmers express their grievances, often in destructive ways. This provides visual evidence that the CAP is not and cannot be the long-term solution to Europe's farming problems and massive transfers which distort market signals will always create inefficiency and distribution problems, creating yet further regulation and distortions, while failing to adequately address the social issues of agriculture directly.
Even within Europe the CAP is increasingly being regarded as a heavy-handed mechanism, restricting farmer enterprise and flexibility and limiting the 
 capacity of the more efficient European farmers to move forward in grasping market opportunities as they develop. It is of some encouragement that forward looking governments and farmers in some parts of Europe are starting to realise the problems of the CAP, but we have much further to go to achieve reasonable and equitable outcomes.
This matter was amply addressed in a recent UK House of Commons Agriculture Committee Report which questions the compatibility of CAP reform proposals with both current and future WTO agreements. It raises the dangerous prospect of new domestic surpluses and intervention stocks and describes EU agriculture policy as likely to be in the moral foothills of the next WTO round.
Korea is Australia's third-largest trading partner and second largest export market. My visit to Korea is at a time of unprecedented change in the Korean economy and I was the first Australian Minister since the new President and Government had been appointed. I believe the Korean government much appreciated an early visit by an Australian Minister to fully demonstrate our goodwill to Korea at this time of difficulty when the new Government is actively pursuing economic restructuring.
Against this background my visit provided an important opportunity to convey to the new Korean Administration and senior industry representatives that we in Australia highly value the strong bilateral economic relationship and the Australian Government and industry are fully committed to working closely with Korea to ensure its successful recovery and long-term future. The visit also allowed me to undertake a first-hand assessment of the changes in the Korean economy and to gain a better understanding of areas of potential concern together with new opportunities for Australian industries and how best the Government in Australia can facilitate these opportunities.
The Australian Government's commitment to assisting Korea has been demonstrated through the IMF contribution and the establishment of a $300 million National Interest export credit guarantee facility which is additional to other credit insurance facilities in Australia. I advised the Korean Government that these combined credit facilities in Australia cover exports worth some $1 billion which is much greater than is generally realised.
Agricultural and resources and energy are major users of these credit facilities, and I emphasised strongly to Korean Ministers that the use of these facilities by Australian exporters should not be constrained by Korean authorities offering preferential treatment to other export countries under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, as is currently the case on some agricultural products. 

I urged the Korean Government to provide a waiver from such regulations for a range of agricultural products to enable them to utilise  National Interest and other credit facilities, and to compete on the same terms in the Korean market with other exporters who have already received a waiver on a number of key commodities, including beef.
Such a waiver should be forthcoming given the goodwill demonstrated by the Australian Government and industries at this time of difficulty, and I am encouraged by the assurances provided to me by the Korean authorities that Australia's request will be given full consideration on the basis of equitable treatment with others.
On industry specific matters, my recent visit to Korea provided the opportunity to discuss the importance to the Korean economy of reliable supplies of agricultural, resources and energy products and to confirm that Australian industries can deliver in all these areas. I stressed the point that ongoing trade with primary, resources and energy industries will clearly help Korea to improve its manufacturing and other export capacities which are essential to the recovery of the domestic economy and to overcoming the present currency difficulties.
I also confirmed with the Korean Government the enhanced need for joint commercial ventures and investments in both countries on a more deregulated basis covering the major primary, resources and energy industries as well as joint research and technology exchanges in these areas.
I am pleased to announce that the Korean Government has agreed that Korea will move to a Manufacturer Determined Shelf Life for UHT milk. This amendment to the food code is very good news for our dairy manufacturers as it substantially extends shelf-life and opens the way for useful market growth in UHT milk which was previously made impractical by the short shelf life.
I also received an assurance from the President of the Korean Livestock Promotion and Marketing Organisation (LPMO) that beef tenders will reopen when present high stocks are reduced to more normal levels. This underlines the importance of the Australian beef export industry having a waiver on credit related regulations equal to that given to other suppliers, and I underlined the importance of competitively priced Australian beef to Korean consumers at a time when their disposable income is  
 declining, and the availability of good quality, reasonable-priced beef is essential.
In Korea, I also addressed a range of quarantine matters of bilateral concern in which we engendered an improved understanding of Australia's position.
In conclusion, let me say that our trade with Korea is dominated by agricultural, resources and energy commodities, including coal, iron ore, aluminium, gold, beef and sugar, and Australia is well-placed to continue to provide Korea with these products which will continue to be crucial to Korea turning its economy around through improving its export performance. Korea is undergoing a period of difficulties and this is a time when Australia will stand by such an important trading partner which is a matter of importance to the Koreans as well as to Australia.
It is encouraging to see the determination and readiness of the Korean Government and industry to face up to the essential disciplines and adjustments in their economy at this stage, which I am sure will pay dividends in the future, despite short term costs. I am confident Korea can overcome its present problems.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,"<title>Overseas Agriculture, Resources and Energy Mission to Europe and Korea</title>",Ministerial Statements,25,1

Recommendation
Government response
Implementation strategy



 No. 1 —The Committee recommends that the Administrative Review Council should remain as a separate and permanent body, provided that it is making a significant contribution towards an affordable and cost-effective system of administrative decision-making and review.
Accepted
Nil required.



 No. 2 —The Committee recommends that, in its annual reports, the Administrative Review Council consider providing performance measures of a quantitative and qualitative kind for the activities that it performs, and discussing past-year performance in terms of these measures.
Accepted
The Attorney-General will request the Council to implement this recommendation in future annual reports by the Council. This will be done immediately following the Government's decision on these recommendations.
 No. 3 —The Committee recommends that the qualifications required for membership of the Administrative Review Council be amended to enable the appointment of persons with direct knowledge and experience of the needs of groups or individuals significantly affected by government decisions.
Accepted
An appropriate amendment will be made to section 50 of the AAT Act (`Qualifications for appointment') in a Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (LAJLAB).



 No.   4 —The Committee recommends that in selecting persons for appointment, the Government should continue to have regard to the need for the Administrative Review Council's membership to contain a broad spectrum of qualifications and to represent a variety of interests.
Accepted
This recommendation is consistent with the Government's practice when selecting persons for appointment generally, and to the Council in particular. No particular implementation strategy is required.



 No. 5 —[However,] the Committee recommends that the Act (ie, the AAT Act) should not be amended to require the appointment of a person having any specific qualification or representing any specific interest.
Accepted
Nil required.



 No. 6 —The Committee considers that the Administrative Review Council may benefit in carrying out a particular project from expertise not available within its existing membership.





Accordingly the Committee recommends that the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975  be amended to enable persons to be appointed as Administrative Review Council members for the purpose of a particular project.
Accepted
An appropriate amendment will be made to Part V of the AAT Act (`Administrative Review Council') in LAJLAB to enable persons to be appointed as Administrative Review Council members for the purpose of a particular project.



The Committee considers that such an amendment would remove the need for the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission to remain a permanent  ex officio  member of the Administrative Review Council.
The Committee's view is noted. It is not proposed to change any of the  ex officio  members of the Administrative Review Council at this time.




 No. 7 —The Committee considers that it is undesirable to place extensive reliance on the incidental power conferred by s.51(2) of the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 .





Accordingly, the Committee recommends that s.51(1) of the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975,  which sets out the Administrative Council's functions, should be amended to reflect more clearly all the major activities that it currently performs, in particular to underpin its current focus on improving primary decision-making.
Accepted
An appropriate amendment will be made to Part V of the AAT Act (`Administrative Review Council') in LAJLAB.



 No. 8 —The Committee recommends that, if the proposed merger of the five main merits review tribunals goes ahead, the amendments to the Administrative Review Council's functions take into account the impact of the merger on them.
Accepted
Amendments to the AAT Act, to give effect to the Government's decisions on the Committee's recommendations, will be initiated once the proposed merger of tribunals has been settled.
 No. 9 —The Committee recommends that the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975  be amended to explicitly empower the Minister to issue directions to the Administrative Review Council and to refer matters to it for inquiry and report.
Accepted
An appropriate amendment will be made to Part V of the AAT Act (`Administrative Review Council') in LAJLAB.



 No. 10 —The Committee further recommends that the  Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975  be amended to provide that Administrative Review Council project reports are to be delivered to the Minister and tabled by the Minister in the Parliament.
Accepted
An appropriate amendment will be made to Part V of the AAT Act (`Administrative Review Council') in LAJLAB.



 No. 11 —The Committee recommends that the Government give an undertaking to respond to all Administrative Review Council project reports within twelve months of their delivery.
Not accepted. The Government recognises the importance of responding to Administrative Review Council project reports and other advice in a timely manner. However, the Government does not accept that it is necessary to bind itself to a response within twelve months.

That the Senate take note of the reports.
On 3 March this year, the Managed Investments Bill 1997  and the Company Law Review Bill 1997  were referred to the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. These two bills represent important steps in the government's drive to modernise the legal structures under which Australian businesses operate. The objective of this process is to create an environment in which businesses can get on with the job of creating wealth and jobs for all Australians.
Managed investment schemes are schemes where an investor purchases an interest in a fund which is managed by a professional manager to produce a return for the investor. They encompass a wide range of investment products and services, including property, equities and cash management trusts as well as smaller schemes such as ostrich farms and pine plantations. These schemes allow investors to diversify their investments over a wider range of investment types than might otherwise be available and to have their funds professionally managed.
At present these schemes are required to have both a manager and a trustee. The manager is responsible for the day to day operations and investment strategy of the scheme, while the trustee is responsible for distributing scheme income and ensuring that investments conform with the trust deed. Unfortunately, the dividing line between the responsibilities of the two parties is imprecise and this has led to confusion. These arrangements have been found to be wanting in a number of cases, especially in the case of Aust-Wide and Estate Mortgage funds.
As a result of concerns about the regulation of managed investments, the Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee were asked to prepare a report on the regulation of managed investment schemes in 1991. In 1993 those organisations tabled a report entitled Collective investments: other people's money. The report was critical of the existing structure and recommended reform. The review's fundamental recommendation was that, for each scheme, there be a single responsible entity in which the current responsibilities of both the trustees and management company are combined and vested. Public discussion about the most appropriate structure for the regulation of managed investment schemes has been going on continuously since that time.
More recently, the need for reform has been supported by the final report of the financial system inquiry, the so-called Wallis report, released on 9 April 1997. That report emphasised the desirability of bringing the structure of collective investments into line with that for superannuation funds by introducing a requirement for a single responsible entity. When the committee called for submissions, it immediately became the focus for vigorous lobbying by interested parties.
Most of the submissions and witnesses before the committee fell into two groups. Those from the trustee industry were fundamentally opposed to the scheme outlined in the bill, while those from the fund management industry generally supported the scheme. These two groups frequently presented the committee with diametrically opposed evidence. The more impartial witnesses were generally supportive of the bill. Unfortunately, little was heard directly from the people most affected by the bill, the small investors who put their savings in managed funds, although organisations representing them gave evidence supporting the bill.
After carefully considering all of the evidence presented to it, the committee was not persuaded by those opposed to the bill that the findings of the collective investments report were flawed. The committee's main conclusions were that: the current arrange 
 ments which divide responsibility between trustees and managers are flawed; the range of measures in the bill for the protection of investors will provide an adequate replacement for the removal of the requirement for a separate trustee; investors will benefit from the clear identification of a single party responsible for all of the activities and functions of a scheme; the bill will allow for a wider range of options in the management structures of funds than do the current arrangements and so facilitate the involvement of managed funds in a wider range and variety of investment options; the new arrangements will generally result in a reduction of management costs and competition between fund managers should result in those savings being passed on to investors; and, finally, the bill will harmonise the regulatory framework for public offer collective investments and superannuation by bringing the structure of collective investments into line with that of superannuation funds. The committee's recommendation is that the bill be passed in its current form.
The  Company Law Review Bill 1997  rewrites the core rules affecting the way a company is run and is largely based on the earlier Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill. The bill redrafts and improves provisions of the law dealing with the registration of companies, company meetings, share capital, financial reporting and annual reports, deregistration and reinstatement of defunct companies and, finally, company names. The bill also introduces rules for managed investment schemes which are similar to those that apply to companies in relation to members' meetings, financial reporting and annual returns.
As with the  Managed Investments Bill 1997 , this bill has been the subject of a very long period of public consultation and discussion. It forms part of the corporate law economic reform program, which was established by the government with the aim of improving the efficiency of corporate regulation. This bill begins that process by simplifying and redrafting provisions of the Corporations Law in plain English. The next stage of CLERP—as its acronym has become know—as foreshadowed by the Parliamentary Secretary to 
 the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, will involve simplifying and redrafting the law's provisions on fundraising, takeovers, directors' duties and corporate governance.
Most of the submissions received by the committee and the discussion during public hearings dealt with issues relating to corporate governance. Many opposing views were put to the committee concerning corporate governance reform and the adequacy of shareholder protection in the bill. Because of the current debate over corporate governance standards and the degree to which all previous drafts of the bill were subject to scrutiny and comment, the bill has understandably aroused keen and intense interest from users of the law, regulators and shareholders.
The committee previously examined the proposals in this bill when it considered the Second Corporate Law Simplification Bill in draft form in 1996. I am pleased to say that some of the recommendations contained in the committee's earlier report were adopted by the government and incorporated into the provisions of this bill. The committee was urged to recommend that additional measures be included in this bill. However, on balance, the committee accepted the approach taken in the bill and considered that more prescriptive law was not appropriate at this time.
The simplification of the present law and the reforms to corporate governance practices contained in the bill are important developments in promoting greater shareholder participation in corporate governance. The committee also welcomes the approach of the bill in regard to the use of electronic technology for communication between companies, their shareholders and regulatory bodies. The bill does not impose—nor should it—an obligation to use electronic forms of communication but rather the bill facilitates its greater use to improve the flow of information in the market. The committee has recommended that, subject to any minor drafting or technical amendments, the bill be passed in its current form.",SENATE,<title>COMPANY LAW REVIEW BILL 1997</title>,<title>Reports of the Corporations and Securities Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-04-01,"—Like Senator Chapman, I congratulate the secretariat of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities on preparing 
 the report on the Company Law Review Bill 1997 . Certainly, it was a long hearings and lobbying process that many people contributed to, some many times, and the volume of paperwork that was waded through by the committee secretariat and the committee members was substantial.
This legislation chose not to include a couple of issues from the previous recommendations of the committee. I want to refer to two in particular in the limited time that I have today. The first, and most important one, could never have been more highlighted than in today's newspapers. It relates to the capacity of a director to call a members' meeting. We have seen extraordinary developments in Victoria in the last few days around Hudson Conway and the Crown Casino because one independent director has not been able to get any satisfaction from the other directors of the corporation to deal with issues of corporate governance. He took the only option that was left available to him which was to resign. Mr Cousins resigned off the board of Hudson Conway, citing corporate governance.
This committee had a chance to take a stand on corporate governance, as it had once before, but when the bill has finally come before the parliament this committee has re-examined its position and decided to squib the opportunity to introduce a situation where Mr Cousins would not have had to resign; he could have said, `I would like a meeting of shareholders to deal with these corporate governance issues.' But, no, this government decided not to include that in this bill.
—You are supporting it?
—It was the original recommendation of Senator Chapman and the members.
—You are supporting this committee's report?
—I am supporting this committee's report. I am simply pointing out that this committee indicated to Labor senators that it would potentially have amendments to this bill.
—What page?
—In the very last sentence. The other issue which I want to 
 speak on is the inclusion in annual reports of remuneration. This government is all about world's best practice. It claims it wants a world's best practice tax system and world's best practice company law reform. We have all these claims coming from this committee and this government and yet, while in America it is mandatory to include remuneration packages in the annual reports, what does this government do? It walks away. How can shareholders make a judgment about the performance of their executives and whether they are worth the salaries that they are paid?
Senator Chapman interjecting—
—The whole package. Maybe they have got some family trusts in there as well and maybe it is all paid in by a family trust service arrangement. I do not know, Senator Chapman; maybe you know more about that than I do.
I am not here to criticise corporate salaries. The people who should be in a position to criticise salary packages, if they want to, are the shareholders. The shareholders have the right to know these things. It should not be a matter of once a year turning up to a meeting and trying to ask a question; it should be there in the annual reports. It is a disappointment to me that the committee decided not to press its view that this bill should include that requirement. It is a disappointment to me that they did not stick to their guns.
As I said earlier, the Crown Casino is a case in point about why this legislation requires amendments from the Senate. Three or four of the core issues in the problems surrounding Crown Casino and its relationships with Hudson Conway, its regulator and the Victorian state government could have been addressed in this legislation. This parliament will be worse off if this bill goes through unamended. I commend the report, and I commend the work put in by the chair and everybody else. The meetings were long and we went late into the night on a couple of occasions. It was hurried to accommodate the government's legislative program, and everyone involved deserves commendation on that process.
But I indicate that the Labor Party is reserving its position to potentially move amend 
 ments to address a number of these corporate governance issues when the bill comes before the chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-01,"—I move:
(1)	 That the provisions of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 be referred to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 June 1998, with particular reference to the following matters:
	 (a)	 whether the proposed accountability regime in the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 is adequate to protect the public interest;
	 (b)	 the impact on public sector finance of the full privatisation of Telstra; 

	 (c)	 the effect on delivery and quality of services for rural, regional and remote areas and for smaller States and Territories;
	 (d)	 whether the provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1997  and the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 provide effective and adequate consumer protection safeguards, including:
		 (i)	 access to untimed local calls,
		 (ii)	 free directory assistance,
		 (iii)	 public telephone facilities,
		 (iv)	 customer service guarantees, and
		 (v)	 price caps;
	 (e)	 the effectiveness of the standard telephone service, as guaranteed under the Universal Service Obligation, in ensuring that rural and regional customers have access to modern telecommunications services and whether the standard telephone service definition needs to be expanded to take account of rapidly changing communications technology;
	 (f)	 the impact of privatisation on employment and economic activity, particularly in regional Australia;
	 (g)	 the impact of the privatisation of Telstra on industry development issues, including research, development and manufacture in the Australian telecommunications equipment and services industry; and
	 (h)	 whether the privatisation of Telstra confers an unfair competitive advantage to it, in detriment to open competition and the involvement of other telecommunications companies and the implications of foreign ownership on these matters.
(2)	 That the committee advertise for submissions in the media and conduct public hearings as and where it deems appropriate.
We believe that this is one of the most significant bills to come before the parliament in this term. It is true that it is a follow-on from the one-third privatisation bill in 1996, but now the government has decided to go the whole hog and sell all of Telstra.
In one sense, this bill is unnecessary because it is a stunt. Even if the bill is carried before the coming federal election, it will not be proclaimed—if the government wins the election—until after the election, unless of course the government wants to use the bill to set up another double dissolution trigger, 
 which means it has some immovable time objectives. I think it would have to have the bill defeated twice, with a three-month gap, by no later than about the middle of October to have that trigger available.
The Prime Minister did not announce this as a double dissolution strategy; he announced it as a strategy to say, `The bill will go through; we want it carried. Then we will have an election. If we win the election, we will then proclaim it so that the people at the election can decide whether they want the bill proclaimed.'
If the bill does not get through by the time of the next election but this is the announced policy of the government, and the government unfortunately wins the election, it will then still be able to proceed and meet its commitment to the legislation in the following term. Of course, that is all subject to whether the government wants it as a double dissolution trigger. I suspect, because of the events of the last week when a number of published opinion polls have shown that, on average, a two to one majority of Australians are opposed to the full privatisation of Telstra—that the Prime Minister will not make it a double dissolution trigger. Some members in the coalition, particularly National Party members, are already on the public record as having grave doubts about this particular bill.
Why does the opposition want this bill to go to the references committee? We believe it is a very significant piece of legislation, with profound implications for Australia's communications system well into the next century. There are issues here which ought to have a chance to be fully debated in the community. I note that the government has given notice of a motion to refer the bill to the legislation committee of ERCA, with a report by 13 May. That is really setting it up to be rushed through. There would probably be a couple of Friday hearings of the committee to avoid public debate and to foreshorten the ability of people to put submissions in, and it would make it very difficult for the committee to hold any public hearings other than in Canberra. That is why they have put the date of 13 May on it, which is only six weeks away.
We believe this bill deserves much wider consideration. We believe there will be lots of people and community groups at all levels—whether they are for or against the privatisation—who would want the opportunity to put their views, now that the full privatisation of Telstra is in the public domain.
When the one-third privatisation of Telstra was before us in 1996, the government swore black and blue that there would be no further legislation in this session. They got around that by saying, `There will be legislation but we will not proclaim it until after we win the next election.' We know that the reason the Prime Minister brought this forward to the Liberal Party council meeting in Queensland two weeks ago is that he was in a fair bit of strife, with difficulties with Senator Parer, Medicare, the state premiers and a whole range of other issues. The Prime Minister thought the best way to get on the front foot was to pull something out of left field: the full privatisation of Telstra.
—Hardly left field.
—Right field, then. It all depends on which perspective you have. I don't often stand corrected, Senator Macdonald. It is out of right field in this case; you are absolutely correct. It is a right-wing ideological policy for the full privatisation of Telstra.
In the terms of reference moved by me on behalf of the opposition, we have tried to list some of the major issues that we think the Australian community would want debated with this bill. I will mention a number of them, and I am not going to automatically prioritise them.
One is foreign ownership. The government has announced that the bill will allow 35 per cent combined foreign ownership, with each foreign owner being limited to five per cent. But that would still allow for seven foreign corporations to have five per cent each. Seven foreign corporations having five per cent each would mean that, combined, there would be 35 per cent foreign ownership of Telstra. Within Australia, much more diversely spread, that 35 per cent, if voted as a block, would have a much bigger influence on the running of the company.
That is an issue of foreign ownership that ought to be more properly and publicly debated—that is, the impact of having no more than seven foreign owners each with five per cent. This is an issue I think the Australian public would like to have a lot more debate about: what are the advantages of having foreign ownership in a fully privatised Telstra? As I have said, that is an issue which we think ought to be publicly available for debate.
There is the general issue of job losses. After the Telstra bill had gone through, Telstra blithely announced that they were going to sack 26,000 people. By the end of this year, as explained to an estimates committee by the management of Telstra—and they do it in a very proud way, I must say—they say that they will have completed the downsizing of the company by 26,000 jobs. There is no doubt that the push for getting the number of jobs down came overwhelmingly from the favouring of the one-third privatisation in order to boost the price.
If you are going to full privatisation, there is no doubt that we would like to know how many more jobs will go, particularly in rural and regional Australia. On any visit to a regional or rural town in Australia, you will find consistently that there are complaints at the Telstra depot, at the Telstra telephone exchange, that jobs are going, and you will be informed of the impact that has on the local town.
We also have in this bill the issue of the universal service obligation. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in a confused way, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in an even more confused way, and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) in an even more confused way than Mr Fischer, believe it or not, trying to explain universal service obligation got confused with the customer guarantee. They confused both—I think, sometimes deliberately—to say that they are providing a whole range of new provisions.
This bill does not put one new universal service obligation requirement on Telstra or the telecommunications carrier. The bill says openly that it reaffirms the existing USOs. 
 There are no additional USOs put into this bill, despite the full privatisation of Telstra.
—Should there be?
—In March last year, when we were debating the full deregulatory bill, we moved and raised issues such as why shouldn't we look at expanding the USOs to ensure that regional and rural Australia would be guaranteed to get equivalent services in the new broadband on-line services—because they will not get them under the USOs that are in this bill. This bill will allow for the development of a two-tiered system of telecommunications in the country. The rich suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne will get the best because they are able to afford it—that will be where the market is—and the bush will get the second level.
However, I hear Mr Fahey say, `But we are guaranteeing the standard telephone.' Communications have moved on from the provision of a local telephone only. They have moved on now to the demand for the new sophisticated on-line broadband services. New technologies, some of them not even thought of yet—not even invented, let alone available—in another decade will certainly be being demanded by people in regional and rural Australia.
The minister has made no provision in any way for those USOs to be expanded—and why not? Because, if you expand the USOs, the cross-subsidy gets bigger and the profit for a privatised company goes down. We believe that services to the Australian people should come before profit, including the profit for the 35 per cent of foreign ownership.
The customer service guarantee—and this is the big change in the bill—apparently is that now you can be fined $10 million. The $10 million fine was already in the previous legislation; but it now is being made clear that, if you do not meet certain service standards, you can be hit with a fine. What we would like to know from the minister—and we would like to get this in the inquiry—is: what are the determinants?  What is the range of where a carrier could get hit with a $10 million fine?
After yesterday's report from the ACA on the quarterly standard of service, Telstra was found to be `guilty'—if I can use that term—all over the place, particularly in regional Australia, of a decline in service. We want to know: is that decline the sort of thing that would guarantee a $10 million fine being imposed? We do not know; it is not clear in the bill. It is not clear at all. It is very indistinct. But the government is trying to use that as a propaganda weapon—that is, explaining that there will be the imposition of a $10 million fine on the carrier if your phone is not fixed within a week.
That is just hogwash. At the moment the best you as a consumer will get is a month's rebate on your telephone rental. The local consumer is not going to get the $10 million fine being paid to him. We will wait years and years, perhaps forever, for a $10 million fine to be imposed on a carrier if they carry out—
—Yes, because they will do the right thing.
—No, they are not doing the right thing in the ACA report. Minister, I ask you to explain to us: is the level of breakdown of service in the ACA report yesterday the equivalent of a $10 million fine? Of course it will not be. If as a weak minister you were still in government, you would never put the heat on the carriers. Despite there having been plenty of opportunities in the last 15 months, you have ducked every time—even over those dreadful CoT cases. You did not even have the gumption to direct Telstra to pay the money to Mrs Garms, with the support of the National Party. Telstra management told you to go jump, that they were not going to pay the $300,000. They told you to go jump; they told the committee to go jump; they told Mrs Garms to go jump. The arrogance of Telstra over this shows why this company should not be removed from the scrutiny of parliament.
There is nothing in this bill about industry development—nothing at all. This, the biggest company in Australia, with $3 million to $4 million worth of public works: what guarantees do we have that a fully privatised company will still continue to make an effort to 
 buy in Australia, to spend R&D in Australia? There are industry development arrangements in the Telecommunications Act that we insisted on in March of last year; how strong will they be in the years to come? This privatised company will think of every way to get out of it and to find ways to buy cheaper off the shelf from overseas.
Today the minister announced with a fanfare of publicity another $21 million to networking the nation, to regional Australia, to help overcome the deficiencies in the infrastructure for telecommunications in the bush—$21 million, part of $250 million over five years, part of the deal to get Senator Harradine's and Senator Colston's vote for the last time round.
—Are you still opposing it?
—No. What I want to point out is that at the very same time he is making a big noise about himself for $21 million, under the privatisation process in this bill the stockbrokers of Australia and the world will take fees of $800 million. The bill says two per cent of the total proceeds of the sale, which is estimated in the bill at $40 million. Two per cent will be the service fee paid to stockbrokers; that is $800 million.
—Why don't you go out and get a job as a broker?
—Here is the typical Liberal comment: go and get a job with a stockbroker. You are not worried about the service in the bush. In five years you will give $250 million to the bush and in one year or even less the stockbrokers of the world will walk off with $800 million. That is where your priority is; helping the big end of town, not helping the people in the bush. That is another issue we would want dealt with under these terms of reference.
We want to deal with the issue of debt reduction. Yesterday in the House of Representatives Mr Beazley put to rest one of the great myths that this would result in a substantial improvement in our debt reduction. He pointed out that Telstra's earnings are estimated by independent people to probably reach around $2.3 billion per annum by the year 2000, of which a substantial amount will 
 be paid as dividend, if not all. `If John Howard's scheme succeeds,' said Mr Beazley, `the $2.3 billion will be there every year, not for all Australians but for fewer Australians, some big companies and 35 per cent foreign interest.'
Mr Beazley quite rightly pointed out that, at the Commonwealth bond rate of 5.7 per cent, retiring $40 billion of Commonwealth debt reduces not $4 billion of savings but $2.3 billion. If you take off the few billion you will give out under what is called the social programs, it will be even less. As it turns out, there is a case to say that the dividend we would be getting in the year 2000 will be greater than the saving on interest in your own bill.
—You haven't read Bob McMullan's press release today.
—Why don't we put that? That is one of the issues we want to put to the public. We want to get experts on all sides. You will produce yours, we will produce ours and include other independent people to have a proper debate on it. That is your major justification for  privatising Telstra: to reduce public debt. Yet the information you have given so far has been scanty, to say the least, if not disappearing altogether. 
What we want is a proper debate. That is why we believe it is appropriate that this bill go to the references committee, not the legislative committee—and to go there with enough time to deal with the issues, report back by the end of June and have the debate on the bill in August when the parliament resumes. This should be no problem for the government unless it wants this bill as a double dissolution bill. All you are saying is, `We want to get it through. If we get the bill through, we will proclaim if we win the election.' If you do not get the bill through, you will still have your election campaign saying, `Re-elect us. Our policy is for the full privatisation of Telstra.' It in no way stops this being a major, significant issue at the next election.
I know why the government does not want to go to the references committee. It will tell us: `Well, the opposition parties have a 
 majority. They will hang it out to dry. They will use every excuse. They will produce a majority report against the government.' That may well be true. What we are after, though, is a proper process. Irrespective of majority or minority reports from Senate committees, the debate will be in here reflecting the numbers in the Senate at the particular time.
I do not know whether I have the support of the Senate for my motion. I will have to test that and see the numbers. I hope the Senate will—as it did back in autumn of 1996 when it carried a resolution to refer the bill for one-third of privatisation of Telstra to the references committee for the arguments that were then sustained—do the same now. Certainly we will be arguing that way. We believe this is a fundamental issue for the Australian people. We do not want to see this railroaded through the Australian parliament as an election gimmick to divert attention from a number of the Prime Minister's political difficulties.
To conclude, the opposition is more than happy to fight this issue everywhere in Australia leading up to the next election—right up to polling day. We are not afraid to fight the election on the issue of the privatisation of Telstra. Wherever we will be, this will be a major campaign issue for us. We will make it very clear that we are committed to maintaining Telstra in majority public ownership in the national interest. We will not sell Australia out; we will not sell the most profitable and successful company that provides over 85 per cent of Australia's telecommunications services to a limited number of shareholders and to foreign interest. We believe the 18½ million people in Australia in public ownership have control of Telstra through the parliamentary process. Therefore, we are willing to fight this issue, and we assure the Australian people we will never privatise Telstra.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-04-01,"—What Senator Schacht was doing was confirming that the whole thing is an absolute charade. His last remarks made it crystal clear that they will campaign up hill and down dale against this 
 legislation. Why do you want to send it off to a references committee, which is quite contrary to the standing orders? Legislation committees deal with legislation; references committees deal with references. Why? He says because it contains significant issues. I would have thought that applies to a lot of legislation around this place. Why do you want to string it out for 12 weeks? Again, because they want to create as much mayhem and distraction—
—We want to give people an opportunity to hear the arguments.
—We will be hearing the arguments between now and the election. You know that. It is a highly public exercise that we are engaged in right now and it has been ever since we made our announcement some weeks ago. You can spend every day between now the next election rabbiting on as much as you like about Telstra. No-one will believe you, given the Labor Party's track record on privatising everything that moves.
The fact is that you will have ample opportunity to canvass these issues with a closed mind. You are not out there to explore them or to test the boundaries or to see why Cuba, Albania, Hungary and Yugoslavia have all gone down the privatisation path. The poor old ALP in Australia! The militant tendency in some remote part of the world might agree with you but I cannot imagine anyone else agreeing with you.
I am not really here to do much more than simply say that this is an entirely spurious exercise designed to waste a lot of unnecessary time. We went through all of these issues in exhaustive detail a couple of years ago. At that time the references committee examined 136 witnesses at 11 public hearings in all mainland state capitals and Canberra over a one-month period and produced a report entitled Telstra—to sell or not to sell. It is a complete and utter waste of public funds to have yet another wander around Australia.
—What?
—Senator Schacht seemed to be under the delusion that all you could have if you refer it to the legislation committee is a couple of Friday hearings in 
 Canberra. That is not my understanding at all. The committee can make its own decisions about where and when it needs to hear evidence and to what extent—
—So you would support holding hearings outside of Canberra?
—Normally you wait and see what submissions you get and then you make a judgment about where you can best accommodate them. Once again, if you have a closed mind on the subject, that is your problem, not ours. You can run your scare campaigns about foreign ownership but, again, I think everyone knows that you were very liberally inclined when it came to foreign ownership restrictions in government. Why should you ever be believed in opposition? You will do exactly the same thing if you ever get back.
All I can say is that we are not going to have any of this. All of Senator Schacht's issues are able to be dealt with by the legislation committee. What he has basically done in his usual sloppy and lazy manner is lift large chunks from the terms of reference of last time around. I have done an analysis, which we will not bore the Senate with. It makes it very clear that the overwhelming bulk of these issues were done to death a couple of years ago. We are not going to change the Labor Party's mind. We know that.
Let us just get on with it. It is a very significant piece of legislation. It deserves to be canvassed at the committee stage. We fully accept that. That is why we are referring it off, essentially during the recess, to allow as many hearings as might be necessary and to allow everyone to put their views on the record—all those vested interests that you represent lock, stock and barrel. Those union movements who are terrified of losing their power base will no doubt be along in droves trotting out the same old arguments they put up last time around. No-one is going to change their minds. We know that. They can do it in a six-week period, not a 12-week period. That is what we say. It ought to go through the proper processes. It is legislation and it ought to be referred to the legislation 
 committee. I move the following amendment to Senator Schacht's motion:
(a)	 omit ""References Committee"" in paragraph 1 and substitute ""Legislation Committee""; and
(b)	 omit ""30 June 1998"" in paragraph 1 and substitute ""13 May 1998"".
I do that on the understanding that normally you do not have specific terms of reference for a legislation committee. The bill itself is able to be canvassed. I am simply making it clear that we have no objection to all of those terms of reference being explored through the normal legislation committee process.
I conclude by saying that as recently as a couple of days ago, the expert in forked tongue speaking, Gareth Evans, was talking about this very bill and said, `Bring on the legislation; let's have the debate.' I could not agree more. Even he knows that there is absolutely no point in referring it to a committee for 12 weeks when you can accomplish precisely the same result in six weeks.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-04-01,"—I want to get the minister's amendment clear, because I have not seen it. I think I have it right. He is effectively moving the motion on the Notice Paper  that Senator Troeth gave notice of yesterday, which was to refer this legislation to the Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 13 May. You have taken what is effectively my (1)(a) down to (2) and added that as the terms of reference. Is that right?
—We are adopting your terms of reference.
—Now that I have seen the amendment and the minister has confirmed it again, it is my motion, with reference to `committee' deleted, `legislation committee' substituted and my date of `30 June' substituted with `13 May'. They are both in Senator Troeth's motion from yesterday on behalf of the government. That means that all my terms of reference stand as far as the legislation is concerned.
I think Senator Alston probably got some information during the last hour or so that I similarly got. In reading the tea leaves of 
 what the numbers may be up here, he knew that my motion was not going to get up and his was not going to get up without my terms of reference being added. Both of us have been around this place long enough to understand that whatever else we may think about these things, that is the best we were both going to get.
I have to concede that I think, on balance, the minister got the better end of the deal than I did on this occasion in negotiations with certain other senators in this place. Be that as it may, to save the time of the Senate, we will not call a division. When you put the question, Madam Acting Deputy President, I want it recorded that we support our own motion and not the amendment.
—The question is that the amendment to the motion moved by Senator Alston be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The question now is that the motion, as amended, be agreed to.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-04-01,"—In rising to speak in this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] , I start by acknowledging the Ngunnawal people, the traditional owners of the land upon which we stand. In doing so, I would like to reflect for a few moments on what this means and how critical the concept of respect is not only in this debate but also in our ongoing challenge, both as individuals and as a nation, 
 to achieve reconciliation with indigenous Australians.
I grew up in inner Adelaide. Within the cultural mix of our community at the time were many indigenous Australians. Not only did some live in my parents' cottage, they shopped at our shop and I went to school with many of them. We are all products of our childhood environment and I learnt much from those times. I was reminded recently by some Aboriginal Australians that, at the time, my parents forsook rent and provided food free to some Aboriginal neighbours. My parents actually had trouble making ends meet but, when asked how and why they were prepared not to charge sometimes, there was a stock reply: `It's not their fault. They're human beings. They shouldn't have to suffer.'
Isn't that the issue before us today? Should not this Senate show the leadership and the generosity of spirit that the Prime Minister is not capable of exercising? Shouldn't we be saying to Australians that we at least are prepared not only to sit with indigenous Australians, as the government has done, but also to show them sufficient respect, to listen to their views and to accommodate them in a balanced and fair outcome, which the government refuses to do?
In my 17 years in this place, I have worked with indigenous Australians on many issues. They have been subjected to constant attempts at legislative thuggery. They have resisted, they have fought and they still stand ready to fight the next fight. Their strength and their courage is to be admired. But they do have their limits. Common decency demands that we treat them with respect and dignity and not as political footballs to be used and abused whenever necessary for base and offensive political purposes.
On Monday, I listened to Ngigli, one of the people locked out of Christmas Creek in the Kimberleys, at a presentation at the Australian National University. She said, in part:
Whatever they say, whatever they do to Native Title, our country, laws, history and land will always stay. Native title is our life.
Native title is more than access to land. It is more than land management. Native title also embodies custom, law and culture. It dictates 
 how indigenous Australians run their lives. It demands respect for law, for custom, for culture and for history. It demands respect for the importance of the land.
At the core of native title is respect for each other and each other's rights. It demands that we deal with Aborigines in the way that we would deal with each other. This entails a right to be consulted and to be listened to. The right to negotiate as an equal goes to the heart of native title. As we come to the last stage of this debate, let us not forget that history will judge us on how we handle this aspect of the debate. We will be judged not on how many vested and powerful interests we bow down to but on how many powerless and dispossessed we defend.
Just over three months ago the Senate engaged in the longest debate on a single bill in its history—the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 . In over 56 hours of debate some 700 amendments were moved, but few of those moved either by Labor or the minor parties succeeded. Indeed, at the conclusion of the Senate debate last year, the government got some 90 per cent of what it wanted. Of the 36 key issues discussed by the Senate, the government failed to get its way only in respect of four. Those amendments dealt with the threshold test, the right to negotiate, the application on the Racial Discrimination Act and the sunset clause.
Despite the fact that the bill that was returned from the Senate was far from Labor's preferred position, we accepted the Senate compromise as a gesture of our goodwill in this debate. But that goodwill that we and other non-government senators showed the government at the time was spurned by them when they set this bill aside. The Prime Minister could have pocketed the considerable concessions at the time, yet he failed to do so then and he fails to do so now.
As everyone knows, the government entered into discussions with the Labor Party, and the National Indigenous Working Group has done so for a number of weeks, to clarify some of the outstanding issues. The talks have produced some productive developments, but only with respect to the procedural aspects of the threshold test, and then only in part. More 
 was not achieved because more simply was not on the table for discussion. The central issues in this debate were resisted by the government.
So, despite the Prime Minister's promise to Gatjil Djerrkura, despite the calls from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, from the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, from the churches, from Kim Beazley and from the Australian people, and despite the growing community movements in support of reconciliation, we have seen no real movement from the government on all the other issues, including the two issues that have always been central to this debate: the right to negotiate and the application of the Racial Discrimination Act.
Let me go to the Racial Discrimination Act. The government's position on the RDA has always been misleading and immoral. Despite consistent advice from all experts that this legislation is racially discriminatory, we have seen no genuine attempt by the government to address this legal and social failure. Despite saying that they want a non-discriminatory bill, the government has continued its support for provisions of this bill which their own Chief General Counsel, Mr Burmester, has told them are racially discriminatory.
Instead, the government rely on the current subsection 7(1) of the act, a clause which they know full well was proposed by the Western Australian Greens in 1993 with the serious intention of addressing this issue but which, as a result of the High Court's decision in Western Australia and the Commonwealth, has no effect at all. Why? Because this government and this Prime Minister know that the only way that they and the states can take away from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the rights given to them by our legal system is if they pass racially discriminatory legislation.
They do not care how they do it. They do not care that this legislation will breach the clear covenant that the Australian people made with their government in 1967, when they said they wanted to give the Commonwealth power to make laws for the benefit of Australia's indigenous peoples. They do not care that, as leaders of the world's most 
 successful multicultural society, they have an obligation to act in a non-discriminatory way. They do not care if the rest of the world sees us as a nation prepared to discriminate on the basis of one's race. Instead, what we have seen is the Solicitor-General submitting to the High Court in the Hindmarsh Island case, on the instructions of the Attorney-General, that the races power allows the Commonwealth to pass Nuremberg or apartheid style laws. Such submissions are simply disgraceful. All we continue to see from this government is the pursuit of a grubby political agenda that they obviously believe will help them retain seats in the bush.
Let us go to the right to negotiate. That is where the right to negotiate comes into this equation. For the last few weeks now, we have seen the trial of the grubby political campaign that this government wants to run in rural and regional Australia. We have had from both the Special Minister of State and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, the insulting proposition that the right to negotiate is a form of racial discrimination against Australia's farming community. They make these claims despite knowing that in Western Australia v. the Commonwealth, for instance, the High Court indicated that the 1993 act, including the right to negotiate, was consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act and was not discriminatory.
They seek to insult the intelligence of the Australian people by stating that indigenous Australians should have the same rights as the pastoralists when they know full well that they are dealing with two very different types of rights created by our legal system—rights which are analogous to landlord and tenant. They do so knowing that indigenous Australians have in a sense traded in the right under common law—a right which has no time lines nor limits, a right which is a right of veto—for a controlled and contained right to negotiate.
But the right to negotiate is not just a statutory right. It is also an incidence of common law native title. It is a recognition of the traditional custom and practice which demands that indigenous Australians be con 
 sulted about their country. To take away that right to negotiate is to deny part of the culture and identity of indigenous Australians. In its own way, it is as destructive a practice as the forceful removal of their children. It is the difference between being shuffled around on the land like cattle and being treated with respect and dignity that any human being would expect.
In respect of the threshold test, talks have been going on and there have been some productive developments. There is considerable agreement on the procedures which should surround the test. In this regard, the government has accepted the mere fact that, if one out of a number of elements of a native title claim does satisfy the test, this should not be the basis for knocking out the entire claim. This agreement on procedural matters hides the fact that, rather than compromising the substantive test, the government's new test would be much harder to satisfy than the one they originally proposed. That is something we will address later on in debate. Rather than accept the spirit of compromise that was so desperately needed in this debate, the government has deliberately made that compromise even harder to achieve on this fundamental sticking point.
In respect of the threshold test, it is important to explain why the scope of the test is important. As people will remember in the previous debate on this matter, we talked about three connections in the alternative. What the government is now seeking to do is to tie together at least two of those connections—the physical one and traditional one—to make it much harder for people to lodge and pursue claims. The government's amendments, as I say, are not only a sign that they are not genuinely interested in seeking a compromise; they are also destructive of all stakeholders involved in the process.
In terms of the ultimate symbol of the government's bad faith in this debate, let us turn to the sunset clause. One thing that we are all agreed upon in this debate is, regardless of what this act says, that native title holders will still have the right that they will be able to seek to enforce through the common law courts. The Native Title Act had 
 never given indigenous Australians native title rights; all it ever sought to do was to help identify them and delineate the scope of those rights that already exist.
It is agreed on both sides that no matter how difficult the processes under the Native Title Act may be, they are infinitely superior to resolving these issues through the courts. The government privately admit that the sunset clause will undermine the rest of their legislation. The stupidity of this sunset clause is that after its six years are up those common law native title rights will continue to exist. They will continue to be determined, yet the mechanism designed to resolve those issues far away from the expense and delay of the common law courts will not survive.
The sunset clause, as I say, is a symbol of bad faith. It is nothing more than a cruel decision for the people in rural Australia, telling them that this threat of native title may well be over in six years. It will not be; it is an ongoing right, and this six-year sunset clause is something that the government ought to ditch in the interests of a fair compromise.
This bill continues to be a recipe for ongoing uncertainty and division. If taken to a double dissolution it will divide Australia, black against white, city against bush, for generations to come. But assuming the government wins and ultimately passes this bill through a joint sitting of the parliament, you can guarantee that it will be in the High Court within days and locked up in the High Court and Federal Court for at least a decade.
There are at least five grounds on which this bill will be constitutionally challenged and could fail constitutional challenge. There were five grounds available to indigenous Australians before today's Hindmarsh Island decision; there are still five grounds available to them now. The first one is under section 57 of the constitution. Before we even get to the substantial legal issues surrounding the substance of the bill, the government, through its cavalier approach to section 57, has guaranteed that this bill will be challenged on the basis that it has not met the requirements for a double dissolution trigger. The government could have and should have—you may shake your head, Senator Minchin—gone down the 
 constitutionally certain route. They chose not to do so and as a result they will have to live with at least a challenge to the bill.
Let us turn to the second ground, the racist power. There are substantive arguments, which were addressed by the High Court in the Hindmarsh Island case, that this bill was unconstitutional on the basis that it is neither an appropriate nor a beneficial use of the racist power, pursuant to 51(26) of the constitution.
We note with respect to that case that two judges said that, for a law to be within the power, it needs to be beneficial; two judges did not address the issue and two judges determined that it could be either beneficial or detrimental, but only under strict supervision of the High Court and not just with respect to the criterion of manifest abuse.
The High Court at best took a middle road in the Hindmarsh Island case today. But in taking that middle road, they have signalled a big yellow flashing light of caution to the government. Four of the judges say that there are restraints on the power. At best, the government legislation's constitutionality is uncertain, for the uncontested and uncontestable view amongst the legal experts is that this bill is discriminatory, that it is inconsistent with the RDA and it is inconsistent with Australia's international legal obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
But, even assuming the bill is otherwise constitutional, the rejection of these international obligations is not without consequence. In the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics, Australia's record on issues such as human rights will be an increasingly important focus of international scrutiny. If this is a government that persists with racially discriminatory action, then all of Australia will suffer in a whole range of different ways.
The third ground is a just terms compensation ground. Even assuming the government's legislation survives the hurdles I mention, we still have grave doubts that the legislation provides just terms for the acquisition of native title, as is required by section 51(31) 
 of the constitution. This is because the bill fails to recognise that the constitutional requirement for just terms compensation is not merely restricted to the amount of compensation ultimately paid. There needs to be timing, there needs to be procedural rights, and there needs to be an important part of notice with respect to validation regimes. The government fails this and the government has enormous problems also in terms of taking away property rights retrospectively. This would be a fourth ground of appeal.
Fifthly, the Commonwealth has the power to acquire land only for Commonwealth purposes and not for the benefit of third parties. Once again, to the extent that the Commonwealth's confirmation of extinguishment provisions go beyond the common law and pass land on to third parties, there is a chance that it will be found to be invalid.
At the start of this process the Prime Minister promised all Australians certainty. Unfortunately, all that he has delivered them in this legislation is an unholy, unbalanced, racially discriminatory, unworkable legal nightmare. We will be left fighting out these matters in the courts for decades to come. If you think that is an exaggeration, just reflect on the fact that we have been fighting these matters in the courts for the last two or three decades in any event.
All Australians will suffer as a consequence and Australia will be diminished. Not only will the relationship between black and white Australians and between the city and the bush have been destroyed but farmers will have lost their hopes of certainty, miners will have lost any chance of reasonable negotiations with native titleholders and, at the end of the day, the Australian taxpayer will be lumped with literally billions of dollars of compensation.
Through all that, because of the pigheadedness and stubbornness of our leadership, Australians and Australia as a nation will have been diminished. We will have become an international pariah, trade will suffer and Australian jobs and national wealth will suffer as well. More importantly, we will have diminished ourselves in our own eyes. In this last year thousands of Australians from all 
 walks of life have begun to come to terms with the past injustices we have wrought on indigenous Australians in the last 200 years. In particular, we have come to appreciate and atone for the atrocities that have occurred in our lifetimes to the members of the stolen generation.
This debate is not about past history; it is about the history we are making today. I do not want my children to have to say sorry for my actions. We should not let ourselves or our children down. In respect of this, the obligation is on all of us. In respect of the Prime Minister, when it comes to the issue of race we know that he has form over a number of years.
But the problem facing him is a problem facing each one of us individually. If an election is called on this bill, history will record that it was John Winston Howard and no other who made the decision. But history will also record all those who were accomplices in this act, which would probably be the most mindlessly destructive act to the nation in the last 50 years. History will sit in judgment on each one of the senators opposite and on this side for their actions over the next few days.
As the Labor Party has already indicated publicly, we will not be moving all the amendments we did when this bill was considered last time. Our commitment to them remains, and they do represent our preferred approach to the bill. However, to facilitate debate on the bill, we will not be moving those amendments which the Senate rejected last time and which we believe, following consultation with other senators, have no reasonable prospect of success. If others move them, we will, of course, support them.
Instead, we will move in their place the second reading amendment circulated in my name. During the committee stage we will be moving all those amendments which were successful last time as well as some clarifying technical amendments and amendments to our amendments consequent upon the 95 or so amendments the government is moving.
I move:
At the end of the motion, add: 

""but the Senate notes that:
(a)	 The High Court of Australia in its 1992 Mabo  decision, found that a system of native title to land emerging from the traditions, laws and customs of indigenous Australians pre-existed the legal system that has been implemented in the time since European settlement, and further found that native title has survived despite later grants of interests in some places, and is merged within our common law;
(b)	 the Native Title Act 1993  was the first attempt to manage native title claims emerging from the High Court finding, and was inevitably destined to be amended in the light of practical experience and further Court decisions;
(c)	 in taking office in 1996, the Government accepted the responsibility of integrating the concept, expression and exercise of native title into the social and legal framework of this nation, a responsibility that was initially taken up in 1993 by the Keating Labor government;
(d)	 the Wik  decision of the High Court in 1996 was an inevitable and desirable part of a process whereby an emerging body of case law gave better definition to a legal concept, and deserved a prudent and measured legislative response from the Government;
(e)	 the response of the Coalition in government mirrored its response when in opposition in 1993, in that it chose a divisive, negative and politically opportunistic approach to an issue of historic importance;
(f)	 the Government, in seeking to amend the 1993 Act, has been driven by a desire to appease sectional interests opposed to the concept of native title, rather than any aim of finding a workable model acceptable to all stakeholders;
(g)	 the Prime Minister's self-styled ""Compact with the miners and pastoralists"" is a betrayal of the compact with the Australian people that is intrinsic to his office;
(h)	 in rejecting the compromise offered by the amended bill passed by the Senate in December 1997, the Government added further dimensions of uncertainty and social division to a process that, to be successful, has always demanded government with insight, leadership and a sense of justice and equity;
(i)	 the Government promoted needless uncertainty and potential economic loss in rejecting the validation provisions passed by the Senate in December 1997; 

(j)	 an ever increasing number of unsustainable multiple, overlapping and ambit native title claims continue to mount up on the Register of the National Native Title Tribunal as a result of the Government's failure to accept the workable threshold test contained in the 1997 Bill.
(k)	 Australia's standing in the international community continues to be compromised by the Government's approach to native title that will see the erosion of the few rights our indigenous peoples have had recognised since European settlement, in a relationship otherwise blighted by their dispossession, the destruction of their cultures and social dislocation;
(l)	 genuine reconciliation with our indigenous peoples will be impossible without fair and decent dealing with native title;
(m)	 the bill before the Senate is fundamentally unsound unless substantial amendments are made, including:
	 (i)	 amendments to ensure fair and constitutional validation, including provisions in respect of notice provisions and compensation on just terms;
	 (ii)	 the enhancement of provisions which, whilst giving validation where necessary and certainty of tenure to all parties, preserve the character of the amended Native Title Act as a special measure for the benefit of indigenous Australians;
	 (iii)	 the amendment of a multitude of provisions which detract from a fair and just balance of the rights and interests of all stakeholders and which compromise the amended Act's capacity to withstand constitutional and legal challenge;
	 (iv)	 the reinstatement of an effective right to negotiate where there is dealing in land with exclusive or coexisting native title;
	 (v)	 a clear and unambiguous provision to subject processes under, or authorised by, this Bill to the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 ;
	 (vi)	 the removal of those provisions that seek to impair or restrict indigenous peoples' rights beyond, or in spite of, the common law;
	 (vii)	 the removal of gratuitous real or de facto extinguishment of native title;
	 (viii)	 the removal of legalistic constraints on the operation of tribunals or courts which have the effect of denying indigenous people a fair chance to pursue native title claims; 

	 (ix)	 the removal of restraints on indigenous people registering native title claims that could be successfully pursued in common law;
	 (x)	 the removal of provisions that would remove processes under the Act from Commonwealth oversight and place them for management and determination in a multitude of State-controlled bodies; and
	 (xi)	 the removal of unreasonable impediments to indigenous people having access to their traditional lands; and
(n)	 in the event of the failure of this Government to proceed with such amendments, a future government will be confronted with an even more complex and demanding task in forming and enacting legislation to address the resulting legal chaos, social division, and economic loss.
In moving this amendment, I indicate that it is put on the table as a draft amendment. We will be discussing it with other parties in this place to see whether we can garner further support for this. I close by saying that during the committee stages of the debate we will be moving those amendments that I indicated earlier. We do not need to go through the whole exhaustive debate again, but we will stick to our principles this time.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-04-01,"—I want to begin my speech by recognising the Ngunnawal people, who are the traditional owners of this area we call Canberra. I also want to acknowledge the Wik people and Aboriginal people from around Australia who are down in Canberra and around Parliament House. Some of them are in the public gallery today.
The Wik people are here as beacons of conscience, to remind the federal parliament that the issue we are about to vote on is about moral choice. So that the government and all of us know that they are real people I will mention their names: Arthur Pambegan, Maxwell Wikmunea, Dorothy Pootchemunka, MacNaught Ngallametta, Gladys Tibingoompa, Stanley Kalkeeyorta, Ron Yunkaporta, Lesley Walmbeng, Nelson Wolmby, Steve Lexton, Joe Ngallametta, Peter Tibingoompa, Anthony Kerindun, Angus Kerindun, Norma Chevathun, Clive Yunkaporta, Francis Yunkaporta, Annie Kaikeeyorta, Martha Koo 
 warta, Denny Bowenda and Jacob Wolmby. These are the Wik people of Aurukun. They are the heart of the legislation we are about to debate. I call on every senator in this chamber to recognise and consider the people I have just named, whose lives will be directly affected by the decisions we make today and in the coming days. I want also to acknowledge the other murris who are down from Queensland to watch this debate. I acknowledge their lifelong struggle, which for some decades I also have been involved in.
One of the most outlandish claims we have heard from the minister responsible for native title, the Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, is that the government wants all Australians to be treated equally. This is a preposterous and meaningless proposition. Aboriginal people would welcome the opportunity to enjoy true equality, but what on earth does this mean? Is the minister suggesting that indigenous people should now try to obtain some equality, to balance out the last 210 years of history in this country? Is the minister suggesting that Aboriginal people would want to murder and rape non-Aboriginal people, steal their children and destroy and devastate their lives for the next 210 years to even things up? I can assure the minister and this chamber that Aboriginal people would never contemplate such behaviour. They are not savages.
Of course the minister is not suggesting that Aboriginal people even things up in this way. I would not even suggest he would think that. But I do know he protests that today's generation should not be held responsible for what happened 200 years ago or even 100 years ago. However, we are responsible for what our generation has done and for what we are contemplating doing in this place over the next few days.
I want to place on the record some of the things our generation is responsible for. In particular, I want to detail the record of the pastoral industry in Queensland regarding its treatment of indigenous workers over many decades. Before I do, I want to point out another myth that goes with the minister's proposition that giving indigenous people the right to negotiate is unfair to pastoralists 
 because farmers do not have the same right to negotiate with mining companies.
But for now I will deal with the myth that white Australians taxpayers are having to contribute vast sums of money to Aboriginal communities. That is just plain wrong. Apart from the fact that Aboriginal people owned and cared for the entire Australian continent prior to European settlement, and we have never paid for it, Aboriginal workers have paid for the maintenance of their own communities for 100 years. Their wages have been stolen and used to prop up consolidated revenue for the white community as well. I particularly refer to my own state of Queensland.
Dr Rosalind Kidd has recently published the results of two years of research on the files of the Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Affairs Department and of various church missions going back to the 1890s. This research formed the basis of her PhD and has been published in a book titled The Way We Civilise. Dr Kidd uses departmental files to show how generations of Aboriginal workers were paid subsistence wages, both for work done on Aboriginal communities and also outside the communities on pastoral properties and at other workplaces.
Aboriginal people's wages, in the first place, were taxed in the normal way. But often those wages were then not paid to the workers; they were given to the so-called Aboriginal protectors who were often the local police. Sometimes wages were not paid at all and police sometimes deducted amounts from the Aboriginal workers' accounts for their own use. Eventually what was left found its way into a fund held by the Queensland government. This fund, incongruously called the welfare fund, was then raided by the Queensland government for generations to pay for expenditure within the Aboriginal communities. I must say all of this is recorded in departmental files in great detail. Much of the fund was also absorbed into consolidated revenue.
Despite the stealing of millions of dollars of the wages of Aboriginal workers in this way, the missions and Aboriginal communities were starved of money for even the basic 
 necessities of life for most of this century in Queensland. The result was the most appalling living conditions, disease and starvation right up until quite recently. You only have to read the reports of the directors of the health departments prior to and during the Second World War and afterwards to be appalled at the lack of humanity of those supposed to be responsible for the health of Aboriginal people in those communities. Just one quote from Dr Kidd's book paints a graphic picture:
The most strident critic and agitator of this period was Raphael Cilento, whose specialties in Aboriginal health and tropical disease led him to concentrate much of his energy in Queensland.
When Cilento took over Queensland's health department in 1934 and shortly after acquired authority over all Aboriginal health matters, he traced a similar path to that of the nineteenth century medical experts who had also battled recalcitrant bureaucracies before finally asserting the centrality of clinical expertise in public health administration.
Within the Aboriginal communities, leprosy was one of Cilento's major concerns. Dr Kidd writes:
Only after further ""emphatic representations"" did Cilento manage to wheedle 500 pounds out of Hanlon in 1937 for a study of leprosy in the Monamona mission population. The study confirmed his suspicions. Out of just two hundred people, thirteen tested positively to Hansen's disease and a further twenty-five showed latent symptoms. Cilento now ordered Bleakley to close the mission to outside access, and to retain and segregate leper suspects within the mission, regardless of the costs of extra facilities. Bleakley passed on the instruction, but not the enabling finances. When a doctor visited two months later, he reported all crops had died in the drought, cattle were too thin to be killed and the people had been sent bush to survive. The superintendent pleaded that without farming land or funding for food, he could do nothing else.
Cilento wrote a furious letter to Hanlon and I quote: ""If an investigation was made with the same care at other Aboriginal settlements, doubtless other leper centres would be discovered."" Queensland's Aboriginal population was dying out because of defective medical care in diseases such as leprosy, malaria and tuberculosis, he remonstrated. Wretched diet was the root cause of Aboriginal debility. ""Diseases that flourish during conditions of food deficiency continue to threaten the survival of the race and to fill the Lazaret . . . No measure of 
 improvement is of any value if he is to die of malnutrition."" Ultimately, wrote Cilento, as he had argued since 1924, ""the medical problem of the Aboriginal is at present his only problem.""
I would like to say that that is the 1930s and 1940s and that it is different today, but we of course know it is not. Aboriginal health in 1998 is still a dreadful scandal.
I now want to turn to the question of equality between Aborigines and pastoralists. It gives me no pleasure at all to put on the record the actions of some sections of the pastoral industry over decades of driving down the conditions and wages of Aboriginal pastoral workers. Again I quote from Dr Kidd's work, and she quotes from letters and files within the department:
The pastoral industry soaked up rural labour, collaborated in departmental controls, taught skills on the job and provided the main private revenue source for the department—
—You're in the 1930s. You've got to get into the 1990s.
—It continues:
It worked both ways. Since 1919 pastoralists had profited from a wage advantage of 33 per cent for Aboriginal stockworkers, who formed the backbone of their industry. Even this level was not secure, being subject to negotiation with the United Graziers' Association. Records show that as late as 1950, when the write rate was 7 pounds and six shillings per week plus allowances, Aboriginal station hands received only 66 per cent of the 1938 rate of 2 pounds and 15 shillings and pay rises to 4 pounds and 17 shillings in 1950 and 7 pounds in 1952 were still well under the 66 per cent parity.
When the department lifted the rate of 10 pounds in 1957 the UGA baulked at the `arbitrary' wage increase, trotting out the myths of the irresponsible Aboriginal workers and the brood of costly dependants: arguing, and I quote: that they do not ""compare with experienced white stockmen"". UGA representatives argued that pastoralists were forced to carry quote ""half the tribe"" of Aboriginal stockworkers. After a tour of the Gulf country in 1956, deputy director PJ Richards dismissed such allegations out of hand. Noting ""the marked and growing reluctance of white stockmen to accept employment in the remote areas of the State"", Mr Richards declared ""it is becoming increasingly apparent that the continuance of pastoral pursuits depends on Aboriginal stockmen.
Unfortunately, it was equally apparent to Richards that graziers were ""more concerned with obtaining Aboriginal labour as cheaply as possible"" 
 than with paying wages in terms of the real worth of native stockmen.
Thank God most in the pastoral industry today take a more enlightened attitude—and I recognise your interjection because I was getting to that, Senator Boswell. Minister, do you really mean that indigenous people should be treated equally with white pastoralists given this history of injustice?
Now we turn to the Australian mining industry's record of dealing with Aboriginal people. During the debate in December I placed on the record the struggle of the Wik people to obtain justice over many decades and the injustice perpetrated against them in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. It is a record which shows the excision of thousands of hectares of Aboriginal land for mining interests. In the 1970s, when the promised economic boom through resources development did not occur, right-wing state governments and mining companies, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland, looked around for someone or something to blame. Aboriginal people were an easy target because of the much publicised disputes over mining on Aboriginal land at Aurukun and Nookanbah. During these disputes there was strong official church support for the Aboriginal people.
The tide of official church support turned when two influential church bodies, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and the Uniting Church Commission for World Mission decided to publish the results of a detailed, professional, joint study into the corporate structure of mining companies involved in the disputes mentioned previously. The study was meant to provide Aborigines with information about the nature of the companies which had oppressed them. The results were published in the form of a comic book, a wall chart and audio-cassettes—in Aboriginal languages as well as English.
Aborigines praised the report as helping them understand what they were up against but the Australian Mining Industries Council objected to the material and lodged formal complaints with all Australian bishops of the Catholic Church and with the national president and state moderators of the Uniting 
 Church. In January 1983, the Episcopal Conference instructed its commission to withdraw the comic-style booklet and the Uniting Church concurred. Church officials and the Mining Council agreed that they would not criticise one another publicly. This left the mining industry free to attack Aboriginal people without fear of being criticised by the church. However, the report done for the church commissions was published as a book in 1983 with the title Aborigines and mining companies in northern Australia. Recently I was given a copy of the comic-style booklet which survived the purge. All the copies of the booklet, posters and tapes were supposed to have been destroyed—apparently some were not. I seek leave to table that booklet.
Leave granted.
—I tell this story to illustrate the lengths to which the Australian mining industry has gone to frustrate the legitimate native title aspirations of indigenous people. The mining industry now seeks to achieve that aim through the Native Title Amendment Bill we are debating in this chamber.
While we are talking about injustice and hypocrisy, I want to point out one of the most blatant examples I have come across in my political career. Throughout the Wik debate conservative politicians have campaigned hard against native title, rubbishing the spiritual and cultural connections that indigenous people have with their traditional lands. That connection is the foundation of native title but conservative forces do not believe in it and do not want Australians to believe in it.
But listen to this little gem from the Queensland Minister for Natural Resources, Mr Lawrence Springborg. He was quoted in the Courier-Mail in an article on the 27th of this month defending his government's decision to pay as much as 20 per cent above market value compensation to farmers whose lands will be flooded by the proposed Nathan dam in North Queensland—I have to say that I would support him. But why, you ask, is he proposing that?
Mr Springborg says that the higher compensation is to recognise the farmers' emotional and physical attachments to their land. Un 
 believable! But the government will not give Aboriginal people more than the market price for their native title land under the Wik ten-point plan we are to vote on. I wonder if Mr Springborg would recognise that indigenous people have those same emotional and physical connections to their land. After all, it is his Premier, Rob Borbidge who has led the anti-Wik campaign in my own state of Queensland.
I want also to make some reference to the Labor Party. I do thank the Labor Party for the daily personal assurances that I have been given that the Labor Party will not cave in to political expediency. But I keep reading reports in the daily press that worry me and confuse me on this whole issue. Certainly I was worried when I got hold of a press release from the Leader of the Queensland Opposition, Peter Beattie, in which Mr Beattie practically performs victory laps around Queensland parliament for his success in getting the ALP to cave in, he believes, on the Wik legislation.
Mr Beattie's release indicates that he has a commitment from the Federal ALP to allow mining leases to be automatically renewed without going through the processes of the right to negotiate. This has been widely reported so you can understand my confusion and concern. However, I accept the assurances given and I do believe that the Labor Party will support the amendments which it moved in this place last time. My only regret is that even with the bill that was passed in the early part of December last year it is still only half a piece of legislation. In terms of what it does for Aboriginal people it is a certainly a compromise on top of a compromise.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-04-01,"—In the next four sitting days, the national parliament of Australia has the historic opportunity—and I believe the last realistic opportunity—to respond to a challenge which is the result of acts and omissions of the past. I believe that there are signs of hope that we will be able to achieve such an outcome on this occasion. We were faced with the opportunity in December and we attempted to address that in this chamber. I 
 believe that we went as far as was possible on that occasion, but of course we know the result in the House of Representatives. On this occasion, however, the signs are that we might end up with a piece of legislation from this chamber with which all of the stakeholders can live and with which the government majority in the House of Representatives should live.
Unless we rise to this occasion, the result will be unconscionable. The alternative is mistrust, division, hatred, endless litigations and, of course, it will be costly for leaseholders and miners because, unless we come up with a solution in the next four sitting days, we will not have the measures in the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  which will confer validation on the hundreds of leases that require that validation for certainty. Unless we rise to the occasion, I believe our national pride will be at stake. I know that there are large numbers of people who are looking to some resolution of this matter in the next four days and that they are not confined to the shores of Australia. There is interest right throughout the world in what we, as a national parliament, are going to do over the next four days.
What outcome should be achieved in the next four days? I believe the desired outcome is a fair, just, reasonable, honourable and certain outcome. This is what we seek to achieve. I believe this is what the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) seek to achieve. I do not impute bad faith, as some do, to the minister and to the Prime Minister. I know that the minister has been working long and hard on this particular issue over a long period. Things have certainly not been easy for anyone who has been involved in this matter for so long.
I say that the outcome should be such that the principal stakeholders should be able to live with it—and I am referring to all of the stakeholders: the indigenous, the pastoralists, the miners, the local communities, state governments, the Commonwealth government and the people of Australia generally—because we have all got a stake in a just, reasonable and honourable outcome.
Yes, I do have an empathy with the indigenous people of Australia. This goes back a long way to my schooling, to a person who shared the Harradine name. There are many indigenous persons in Australia who do share that name, one of whom is in this Parliament House today. Whilst some of the people phoning my office were saying that I was undignified yesterday in taking off my shoes and socks and dancing on the lawns of Parliament House with the Wik and Thaayorre people, so be it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I know the view of honourable senators around the chamber, as to my dancing capabilities, is that I would make a fine politician!
—Don't give up your day job.
—I won't give up my day job. I was honoured to receive the invitation—if I can put it that way; some of the people in the public gallery might think that I was rather pushed into it—to join a dance of welcome. It was a dance of welcome to other indigenous groups and it was one that had been developed over hundreds of years. I felt very much involved and welcomed on that particular occasion.
Let me remind the Senate that it was in fact the Wik people who accepted and stated to the High Court that if there was coexistence of native title with pastoral leaseholdings, then the interests of the pastoral lessees would prevail. Let us not forget that it was they who said that. That is an indication of the attitude that they exhibited to ensure that there would be peaceful coexistence and to recognise the rights and the interests of pastoralists.
On the other hand, I have a large number of Aboriginal people who share the Harradine family name—and I am proud to have an indigenous person as a son-in-law. I also have relatives who are pastoralists and they have not been tardy in coming forward and contacting me as to what is going on over here. I have been able to allay their fears. Unfortunately, truth has been a casualty throughout the bush and that is not the fault of the government; it is something that has occurred and, I believe, is most unfortunate. I am personally well aware of a situation where the mother was in an isolated farm household 
 with numbers of children and the father was required to find a job in the city. This is the case in many districts throughout Australia today because of the drought. I am very conscious of the interests of pastoralists.
As for miners, obviously, we have had a great deal to do with miners in the state which I have the honour to represent in this parliament. I had much to do with them in my trade union days so I am conscious of their views. I have listened to what they have been saying and I have listened to what local communities and the various states have been saying since the Senate debate last December. Since then, of course, there has been a huge, public response to my office: letters, faxes and telephone calls, a huge volume of communications. Most of them have supported the stand which the Senate took in December last year.
Others have pointed out a number of things which have led me to further consider the matters. I have spoken to many persons and, of course, I have listened to what the Commonwealth government has said about these issues. It seemed to me that the key thing that appeared to be coming from the Commonwealth, the states, the president of the NNTT and a number of others was that the threshold test was a crucial area of concern.
I want to say in a general sense that the content and purpose of Australian laws about indigenous people are close to the core of our nation's definition of justice and equality. It is with that view of the law that I will be approaching this situation in the next four days, as I have been doing for some considerable time. Enhancing and maintaining justice and equality for all our people, both indigenous and non-indigenous, is at the heart of reconciliation. I have promoted and supported the reconciliation process and have approached all legislation on these issues bearing in mind these purposes and standards.
I do so in regard to the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No.2] . I want a genuine outcome that will be certain, fair and decent. As I indicated, the Prime Minister is on record as wanting that too. For this reason, not only we here but all Australians should 
 have an open and positive outlook about the debate that is going to take place in the next few days.
I believe the principles and framework for a fair, decent and honourable outcome can be stated shortly as follows. Common law native title rights, as recognised in the historic Mabo decision, should not be further eroded, reduced or rendered valueless. They should not be so rendered valueless because the end result might mean huge litigation—because it will—but let us do things in this chamber out of a recognition of principle.
The second point is that governments, corporations and individuals must take into consideration, in a genuine and open manner, these native title rights and interests when their activities may affect or reduce them. Thirdly, the system for the recognition and determination of native title rights and interests must be workable and fair to all involved. Fourthly, the recognised weaknesses and shortcomings in Australian native title law must be reduced or eliminated. I am working for such an outcome, which I hope all Australians, including the Prime Minister, may recognise in the bill as finally determined by the Senate and, I hope, accepted by the House of Representatives.
It is not a matter of anybody caving in since December. The debate has moved on since December. The government's Native Title Amendment Bill is essential, but so is the government's foreshadowed list of amendments—over 90 in all, and not all the key issues have been addressed. There have been considerable discussions with key players, particularly over the last month or six weeks, and I want to acknowledge the hard work that has been done by the advisers and others who have been very much involved in the hard work of discussions and negotiations.
Of the government's 90 amendments, I have ticked off on probably 90 per cent to 95 per cent of them, and I believe others around the chamber are looking at them and have probably done a similar task. Further amendments, however, are still necessary for fairness and decency, and I will be moving a number of amendments—certainly not the number that 
 I moved on the last occasion—to improve this bill.
All Australians should know that the processes since December have resulted in a substantial convergence about the essential issue in any workable and just system for native title, and that is a genuine, workable and fair threshold or registration test. The elements for this test have emerged with, I believe, widespread support. It is not a matter of me or anybody else backing down; I believe it has got widespread support. There is now a proposed system in which both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians can have full confidence that genuine, valid and provable claims will be presented which are appropriate and will attract the right to negotiate.
Everyone has recognised the problem of bogus claims and claims which do not reflect the title of real indigenous communities. Credibility is at stake here. Everyone involved in native title—from state governments to the president of the NNTT to leading indigenous spokespersons and representatives of miners and pastoralists—has cried out for this weakness in our system to be eliminated. I believe the foreshadowed government proposal on the threshold test substantially meets the substance of complaints and restores integrity to the system. There are elements which must be strengthened in respect of claimants who belong to the stolen generation or who have suffered from the locked gates experiences of previous decades. I do not believe that the proposals for these claimants are completely fair and just as yet, and I will say more about that in the committee stage of the debate. Otherwise, there are now the elements widely agreed for a clear, clean and responsible system for native title claims, which will give fairness to indigenous Australians and a genuine and certain basis of determination and settlement to other stakeholders.
With regard to the right to negotiate on pastoral leases, the Prime Minister has said that there should be equality between native title holders and non-indigenous land-holders. There is no true equality unless the essential interests of native title holders are specifically addressed. It is not sufficient that only those 
 matters that affect the economic interests of non-indigenous land-holders are taken into account. (Extension of time granted)
Equality of treatment must be measured against people's essential needs. Pastoralists' needs relate to their grazing business and native title holders' needs relate to their native title rights and interests. There is no equality of treatment if the legislation does not reflect the essential difference between the pastoralists' interests and the native title holders' interests.
There is much to do in the next four days. We must apply our minds to achieving an outcome which is fair, reasonable, honourable and with which the principle stakeholders can work amicably. I believe this is an occasion which will not come again. If we do not get it right this time, I cannot foresee the occasion arising again where we will get it right. I acknowledge the great deal of work that has been done by all parties concerned, but I believe that we have a little more to go in the next four days before we achieve that result. I ask honourable senators who follow me to consider this and hopefully not take a predetermined stand, particularly when it comes to the committee stages of the debate. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-04-01,"—The 10-point plan is important for jobs, investment security and native title. It provides for a regime where the rights of all land stakeholders are recognised and respected in the national interest. The Native Title Amendment Bill before the Senate gives effect to the 10-point plan.
Throughout the long and intense debate on native title, I have tried to act in the national interest as I see it. I have been greatly concerned about how our nation would move forward to provide both black and white Australians with hope for a sound economic future.
I see in the gallery today representatives from Aboriginal and grazier groups. When we talk about native title and its complexity, let us keep in mind that it is those two groups who have to make it work. They are the inhabitants of the bush. We city folk must 
 remember that, for all our talking and politicking, what we do here today will determine how those two groups get on together in the future. It is our duty as parliamentarians to provide them with a clear and workable system in which they can both pursue their rights to live harmoniously under the law.
I would like to remind not only the Senate but all Australians that black and white Australians on pastoral lands have a unique combined heritage. For generations they have coexisted. The Senate committee heard this said by both Aboriginal and farming leaders: they have worked and lived side by side. They have shared love of the land, knowledge of sacred sites. They have attended each other's weddings and funerals. They have gone to the same schools and played on the same football teams. They have worked as one in the emergencies which rise up regularly in the bush, whether flood or fire or personal injury.
So today we must be careful that we do not tear apart this living legacy of a genuine coexistence—far deeper, enduring and personal than could be imagined by city people. It is a fact that the High Court's decision has been made at the expense of coexistence in the bush. It has set one group against the other, causing confusion, suspicion and bewilderment on both sides.
I support the view that the High Court has exceeded its calling. It is said that `by your fruits, you shall be judged'—and the fruits of both Labor's Native Title Act and the High Court's ruling on Wik are despair and division in rural Australia. Black and white families have been put in a competitive position. Ambit claims have intimidated. Hasty words and name-calling have been cruel. Church leaders have thrown stones from glass houses.
We must remember that leaseholders have wanted a great deal more than the government was prepared to give. They know that life will never be the same again. On top of all the other hurdles to rural life, they must now become familiar with formal mediation, lawyers and courts, and all the associated costs. They are reluctantly resigned to their part, as set out in the bill before us and as 
 guaranteed by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) at Longreach.
But I urge the Senate to consider what will happen if this bill is not passed. The simple desires of both those groups in the gallery for a peaceful coexistence will be dashed against the rocks of an election fought on native title. This debate has already provoked so much hurt in the bush between black and white. An election fought on Wik could degenerate into a polarisation of extremes. The middle ground would be left floundering amidst sensational reporting of extremist sentiment.
A united way forward would fall foul of the divisive elements in our society—those who hope to capitalise on, and exploit, the differences rather than the commonalities. Australia could become a battleground for the politics of prejudice; the winners would be the generals, and the casualties would be those two groups in the gallery—ordinary black and white Australian families.
Whatever the perceived flaws in the bill before us, we must consider the consequences if it were to fail to pass this chamber. Where lies the greatest danger for us as a nation? We must also ask: where lies the greatest hope? That hope at this time is an economic one. How do we address the dire need in our society for jobs and their prerequisite—investment? If we do not have a manageable regime to work through native title, we will be putting up insurmountable barriers to investment and jobs and family financial security. And then we will be confronted with far greater social problems than we have today.
What moves our country forward? What is the source of growth and jobs? It comes down to the `belt and braces'. It comes down to being able to lay a pipeline, commit millions to mining ventures, get permits for irrigation pipes and use stock routes for livestock in drought times. It comes down to being able to cut up blocks of land to sow cotton, cane or grapes. It comes down to building dams to expand land under intensive production.
From these initial steps come the downstream processing jobs in their hundreds and thousands—jobs for mill workers and abattoir workers. These underpin the self-sufficiency 
 of regional towns, security for local council work forces, rural schools and regional police officers. The snowball continues, rolling up city services like insurance and banking and transport. It rolls on and on, taking our produce to overseas countries in return for export dollars and self-sufficiency as a country.
What we cannot afford, therefore, is to melt the snowball at the very beginning. We have to be able to make those initial steps—to build the dams and the mines and the infrastructure—without interminable delays, deadlocks, court hearings and appeals. This is to the benefit of all Australians, black and white. This recognises the rights of all those Aboriginals who work in abattoirs and mills in country towns, on properties—grazing properties—farms, and so on, to an economic future.
Economic empowerment for Aboriginal families is through development. It is through setting up Aboriginal companies like the Koutha Aboriginal Development Corporation to tender and to win road haulage contracts. There is a company run by Aboriginals in Queensland, and we now have Aboriginal women driving massive dump trucks taking ore from the mine in Ernest Henry to Mount Isa. Economic empowerment does not come through the ability to make open-ended, overlapping ambit claims; engage in the right to negotiate at every stage of a development process, including for associated private infrastructure; and, in general, hold up planning and decision making for these job creation projects for years.
All this does is transfer potential wealth of black and white families in the bush to courts and city lawyers. Jobs are needed now. Diversification is needed now, not just by rural Australians but by many thousands of blue-collar workers around the country—not just by white Australians but by black Australians who suffer high rates of unemployment. Barriers to jobs are not some fantasy plucked out of the air by farmers or by the National Party; they are very real. The ATSIC State of the nation report on native title outcomes supports us. This report stated:
Key problems were identified which were detracting from improving outcomes including the large number of overlapping claims in the goldfields and the poor performance of some representative bodies.
It further stated:
As at January 1998, there were 703 applications of native title lodged with the tribunal and 22 claims before the Federal Court.
But, as ATSIC noted in its report, in reality, however, after four years of operations, the Federal Court has made only two determinations on native title. In Queensland ATSIC notes that there is currently one claim a day being made, increasing the total number by 20 per cent in the last two months.
The ATSIC report talks in terms of some serious problems emerging with the use of the right to negotiate. With reference to WA, ATSIC states:
The fact is that mining leases are being held up in the right to negotiate process—some 1,913 out of the 2,094 tenements submitted to the process remain subject to negotiation.
It further states:
Furthermore, the rate of objections by native title parties to the grant of exploration licences is starting to increase significantly, which will mean further delay delays.
It goes on to state:
The bottom line is that before the WA government started using the right to negotiate process about 2,800 tenements were in the system at any one time waiting for approval. After using the process the number has increased to 7,400. This must be a potent message for the electorate of WA which perceives its wellbeing to be based on the mining industry.
I could not have said it better myself. The taxpayers have sunk over $210 million so far into the native title process to arrive at the situation today with massive delays and lack of proper outcomes. The total amount of taxpayer funds committed to the Indigenous Land Fund is $1.3 billion. Then there is the annual funding of $45 million set aside each year in perpetuity for indigenous people to buy and manage land. We should realise also that the area of Australia's mainland owned or controlled by or on behalf of indigenous people is 15.3 per cent.
Earlier this month Senator Parer told the Senate that there is a major impediment to the continued growth in the resource sector, citing the existing Native Title Act. He referred to a survey of exploration companies which rated Australia the worst in the world in terms of land claims. He said:
Simply because of the Native Title Act, it is riskier to explore in Australia than in countries like Peru, Ghana or India.
The minister added:
One estimate is that the Native Title Act is costing Australia about $30 billion in mining revenue, delays and lost investment opportunities.
The number of people directly and indirectly employed by mining in Australia is currently around 300,000. How many jobs has that lost $30 billion cost us? How many thousands of families could have been looking at a brighter future? How many Aboriginal families could have shared in that brighter future had the $30 billion not been forfeited because of an unworkable native title regime?
The total value of our agrifood industry is some $64 billion and accounts for around 540,000 jobs for Australians, including 20 per cent of our manufacturing work force. Exports are $11 billion a year and annual investment is $3 billion. That investment depends fundamentally on what comes out of the farmgate. That investment depends on international competitiveness, efficiency and flexibility to market demands and new technology. Without the dams, without the irrigation pipelines, without sector confidence, that investment cannot be guaranteed. It is all right for the big mining and processing companies; they can take their money elsewhere, and they do. We owe it to Australians to keep investment and jobs here. Most Australians realise the importance of that priority.
Research conducted by AMR Quantum Harris for several state governments reveals majority support for key elements of the 10-point plan. Sixty-four per cent of people surveyed believe that there ought to be a six-year limit on native title claims. Sixty-one per cent feel that a spiritual connection alone should not be considered as sufficient basis for making a claim and that a physical connection should be required. Seventy-one per 
 cent believe that pastoralists and native title claimants should have equal rights in deciding whether mining should occur on leasehold land. It was clear that most of the people surveyed believed that neither parties should have more rights than the other; that there should be equal treatment. Seventy-one per cent agreed that a stricter test than is now used should be applied to native title claims. Sixty-eight per cent feel that the nature of the rights claimed under native title should be specified up front.
The unidentifiable nature of native title has been one of the most difficult parts of this debate, particularly for farming families as they begin the mediation process. A month or so ago some 150 people gathered in the Mitchell Town Hall for mediation. There were representatives from nearly a dozen local governments, the state government, several Aboriginal groups and farming families. By the end of the day family graziers still did not know what native title interests and rights were being claimed. They thought they would see evidence for the native title claim itself. They felt intimidated by the process and by the legal counsel engaged by Aboriginal interests. They were suspicious that the legal counsel would only get paid if there was a financial settlement at their expense. They are worried because they can barely support themselves.
Farming families felt that they were put on trial for all the injuries and hardships faced by Aboriginal people in the history of this nation. They felt the mediation was not on native title or coexistence but compensation for the past wrongs. It is not right that we sit here in Canberra and ask remote farming families to bear that on behalf of all Australians. That is really not what native title is about. These rural families took land from no-one. All they own, they have paid for—and in most cases are still paying for at freehold prices—through rolling up their sleeves and working hard. They established their own water supplies, roads, fences, power and telephone connections, sewerage facilities and so on. Now they are faced with claims from people who have never been near their properties, claiming the undefinable. 
Country people heard a tribunal member on the radio recently say that a continuous connection may mean that a claimant remembers a song about a claimed country—perhaps 100 kilometres from where the claimant now lives. It is little consolation to leaseholders, black or white, to hear the mantra that pastoralists' rights prevail. There is firstly uncertainty about how the test of inconsistency will be applied. Native Title Tribunal documents themselves have suggested that it may be appropriate for the grazier to stop grazing in parts of his lease. Aboriginal spokesmen have claimed a variety of economic rights on top of traditional hunting, camping and ceremonial rights.
The subjection of everything in this bill to the Racial Discrimination Act would create havoc if everything done under the Native Title Act were able to be challenged. We have engaged in countless hours of debate over hundreds of amendments. Now is the time to look at the big picture and how we best serve the needs of all Australians.
At the moment in Australia we have a situation which encourages deep divisions between black and white, between black and black, between city and country and between church and flock. We have a bad unemployment problem in our regional centres. They are dying, particularly when they cannot diversify. We must be decisive, act in the national interest and pass this bill. It may not solve all the problems but it is a lot better than we have now. The alternative is no way to finish off a century, let alone begin a new millennium.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-04-01,"—I would like to start by seeking leave of the Senate to table the advice given by the Clerk of the Senate on section 57 of the constitution with regard to the nature of the double dissolution trigger. I also wish to table the response from the Attorney-General and the Clerk's notes in relation to that response.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. Towards the end of last year's debate on native title a very wise Nyungar elder called Robert Bropho left this building saddened by 
 what the government was doing to the last vestiges of Aboriginal land rights. As he left, his final words to me were, `Walk tall and tell the truth.' Now that we are being forced to reconsider this despicable piece of legislation, I remember Robert's words and will remember to attempt to live up to his rightful expectations.
The recent public and parliamentary debate around native title has highlighted many flaws in contemporary Australian society, not the least of which is the way our information revolution often serves to confuse rather than inform. Despite all the modern communication methods available to politicians and the media, last year's marathon Senate deliberations on native title left the community more bewildered and insecure after the parliamentary proceedings than before the entire debate began. To be fair, the media had a tough job. Even the most experienced journalists in the Canberra press gallery were struggling to grasp the 300 pages of native title legislation, 800 overlapping amendments and complex implications of the Mabo and Wik High Court judgments. However, what does deserve criticism is the way in which the debate so quickly degenerated to the lowest common denominator.
In the information haze of legal claim and counterclaim, what has come to characterise native title perception quickly becomes far more important than reality. Those who convey the simplest messages are those most likely to be heard. No matter that these messages play on racist sentiment, no matter that so-called compromises remain manifestly unjust, no matter that the facts are just plain wrong, something has to be broadcast and the easier it is to digest, the better.
Those of us who thought claims over backyard scaremongering had disappeared to the back rooms of One Nation meetings were horrified to see it trotted out by federal government ministers. They made these claims despite knowing full well that native title was only claimed over government or crown land which had been transferred into freehold by devious state governments. Western Australia is a tragic example of that. They made these claims despite the fact that the 
 High Court has twice ruled unanimously that private and commercial freehold extinguishes native title. The old parlance that people fear what they do not understand was used as a political tool rather than something that should be constructively avoided. As Phillip Adams identified during the debate in 1997, there is something far worst than racism—that is, exploitation of the racism of others for short-term advantage.
In addition, when members of the government present such a view, it deliberately ignores the fact that the right to negotiate was a trade-off for widespread validation in the Native Title Act. And if this government has adopted the Hansonite view that Aboriginal people have been afforded special privileges which must now somehow be stemmed in order to preserve some warped view of equality, it stands condemned for ignoring both the history and the current reality of Aboriginal oppression and fourth world standing in our society.
Unfortunately, very few of those who followed the mainstream coverage of this bill last year would be aware that many more of the government's own amendments to the bill passed than those of the `meddling' Greens and Democrats put together. Still fewer in the community would know that not a single non-government amendment was passed which actually increased indigenous rights beyond those contained in the original 1993 legislation. Sadly, public understanding of the most important debate in our nation's history disappeared in the yawning gap between the reality of the legislative proceedings and the sideshow that is the haggling over the margins of dispossession. This is why the government could confidently bluster at the conclusion of the debate that the bill was rendered unacceptable by an interfering Senate, despite the fact that Senator Harradine provided between 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the government's desired outcome.
Indeed, what still shocks me is the widespread fallacy that Senate amendments to the government Native Title Amendment Bill achieved something for Aboriginal and Islander people. In fact, all the Senate amendments do is slightly lessen a tremendous loss in 
 indigenous rights. These losses included: validation of tens of thousands of mining tenements which potentially breach the Native Title Act 1993; extinguishment of native title on thousands of non-freehold leases and tenures where it may have still existed; upgrade of pastoral leases to full primary production, quarrying or forestry status—and therefore bringing about de facto extinguishment of native title without the right to negotiate; establishment of indigenous land use agreements which can occur without proper scrutiny and safeguards; allowing acts which involve the management or regulation of water to displace native title rights, such as fishing, without the right to negotiate; allowing acts on reservations—for example, national parks—to remove native title rights without the right to negotiate; allowing acts in offshore places to displace native title rights, such as fishing, without the right to negotiate; approving gold, tin, opal and gem mining without the right to negotiate; excluding the right to negotiate on native title land which lies in Australia's enormous intertidal zone; ensuring strict rules of evidence in Federal Court proceedings; significantly increasing the threshold test for making and registering native title claims, including the exclusion of overlapping claims; striking out claims which do not adhere to onerous and expensive evidentiary requirements; automatically reassessing all native title claims made since June 1996 and allowing state governments to have any claim ever made reassessed using the increased threshold test; forcing every Aboriginal representative body to go through a process of reregistration and to adhere to accountability procedures stricter than those for any government department; restricting access rights for Aboriginal traditional owners; diminishing the independence of the President of the National Native Title Tribunal against the express wishes of the Aboriginal people; and allowing a variety of government activities to override traditional hunting and fishing rights.
I have to repeat that the Native Title Amendment Bill as amended last December already represents a tremendous loss. Any further compromise will amount to complicity in dispossession. I urge other senators to say, 
 `Enough is enough.' Not only must politically expedient compromise amendments be rejected; this entire piece of legislation should be voted down and meaningful negotiation should begin at once with the many indigenous nations of this continent.
Most of the amendments passed in the Senate last year and which the government found unacceptable were related to the right to negotiate. This is hardly surprising, given that the right to negotiate is about the only effective land right indigenous people have been left with after 210 years of European occupation. In particular, the retention of the right to negotiate about mining on native title land covered by a pastoral lease and the retention of the right to negotiate at the exploration and commencement stages of mining prevented the government from completely removing the last vestiges of native title rights.
It seems that this whole debate has come down to the government's determination to see the short-term self-interested aspirations of the mining industry extinguish the millennia-old rights of indigenous people. Over the last 12 months, the mining industry has spent millions trying to convince the public as to the unworkability of the Native Title Act. Their agenda has very little to do with the High Court judgment in Wik. It has been a deliberate and opportunistic attack at the very heart of native title rights. Their calls have confused the community, shaken the resolve of the Labor Party and have been taken up with glee by the government.
Over the last few weeks, we have seen the mining industry once more take out full-page advertisements in support of the government's legislation. What the advertisements do not reveal is that, while Aboriginal people have continuously demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and reach compromise, many mining companies, in conjunction with hostile state governments, have deliberately sought to sabotage the native title process. So used to getting their way behind closed doors and being able to ride roughshod over indigenous rights, they have only come into the native title process kicking and screaming. In Western Australia the Court government has joined 
 in, spending millions of dollars on ludicrously unsuccessful High Court actions rather than accepting the reality of native title.
Conservative governments have made much of the burden of the right to negotiate provisions, especially when negotiation is required with multiple claimants. However, it is difficult to establish on what basis these complaints can be considered genuine, because the act's regime has barely been implemented according to the law of native title as established by legislation and the courts. The thousands of potentially illegal future acts granted on pastoral leases since 1994, which this government now wishes to validate, provide a graphic example of the way in which state governments have gone about flagrantly breaching the Native Title Act. And guess what? These acts get rewarded. The indigenous people are punished for their concerns and difficulties.
Until two years ago, when the state of Western Australia was ordered by the judiciary to negotiate in good faith, the Court government's strategy simply was to wait until the negotiating period under the Native Title Act had lapsed and then apply for a tribunal determination. Since then, the resources which have been allocated to processing right-to- negotiate applications have been farcical. I am told that there are just four people processing all such applications in the state government bureaucracy.
In spite of this, the mining industry in Western Australia is highly prospective. Areas subject to mining tenement applications to the Department of Minerals and Energy in 1996-97 have increased by more than 10 million hectares since 1991-92. With this kind of prolific development, it is difficult to sustain the position that the existing Native Title Act has resulted in an unworkable system. We will get to the point where we have run out of Australia to claim, and that will affect the figures. Would the whole of Western Australia need to be subject to mining tenements before the advocates of amendment considered there was a workable system?
Apart from the right to negotiate, the other major sticking points for the government were the replacement of the strict physical connec 
 tion test with the so-called Mabo test and the rejection of the sunset clause on claims and what has now become known as the Racial Discrimination Act amendment.
I would like to spend a few moments considering the RDA amendment because in many ways it epitomises the entire debate surrounding this bill. In the face of a manifestly unjust bill, the RDA amendment has been viewed as the safety net, the clause which would see this legislation raised at least to a level of non-discrimination. Typically, the government took its usual two-faced approach, refusing to allow this basic protection in the act, despite also claiming, with hand on heart, that the bill was not racially discriminatory. Typically, in the face of the government's openly discriminating agenda, the Senate compromised and compromised again until we passed an RDA amendment which now seems to do very little. Typically, on this fundamental issue, we were effectively given one hurried lunch break to consider the issue of such enormous legal complexity. The process was appalling, and in the end we agreed to an amendment which acts more as a sign post to dispossession than a safety net for land rights.
Also typically, this meagre achievement was characterised as a major imposition on the government and a major victory for indigenous rights. It now seems that nothing could be further from the truth. I for one am ashamed of compromising away indigenous land rights. It is time for the non-government parties in the Senate to draw a line in the sand and say, `No more.' It is time to walk tall and tell the truth.
History will record that the Aboriginal and Islander people of this continent have a sovereignty they have never relinquished and native title which existed long before European invasion. History will record that in the High Court's Mabo judgment, these rights were partially recognised. Likewise, history will record that in the Native Title Act 1993 these rights were largely taken away. It is now up to this Senate to decide whether history will record the near completion of Aboriginal dispossession in 1998.
As I did last year, I would like to quote from the Ngarinyin Kamali Council, who hail from the Kimberley. In just a few words they have captured the true meaning of the extinguishment contained in this bill. They said:
We are realising that people in Canberra and Perth and Brisbane don't want us to continue our culture in our country, so are making paper laws to outlaw recognition of who we are, and our relationship in our birthright country.
You see, we didn't come from anywhere else. We don't belong anywhere else. We can't go anywhere else.
Our tribe of Ngarinyin--maybe 600 people--belong in that country where those 12 small newcomer families are trying to grow their cattle. These families keep changing because cattle don't grow enough money for them to stay there.
Now the families are growing their money from tourism. Tourists who want to learn about Ngarinyin culture visit our sacred waterholes, photograph our living images in the rocks . . .
They are taking tourists to our cultural sites where we are not allowed to go with our visitors, where we are not allowed to create employment for our young people, where we are not allowed to grow money for our communities, our people who are dying from boredom, despair and alcohol in reserves.
This is what `extinguishment' really means. It means killing off our chance to survive as a living culture, as a people, as participants in the future of Australia. It means extinguishing our birthright and meaning.
We Ngarinyin are developing up a bush university to take people into our country, to teach them the meaning of relationship in land. We are doing this because we are sorry for people who are looking for meaning in their lives and are lost to their identity. We want to share our knowledge with them. We are doing this because we want their lives to be enriched with meaning they can get from learning how to receive identity from the land. When they are grounded in the real world which is Earth, they become happy. They stop wandering around lost to themselves. This is our gift.
If our identity is extinguished, instead of receiving this gift, Australia will live with the shame of our extinguishment.
This whole debate has been characterised by an inability on the part of government to recognise the distinct and unique relationship between Aboriginal people and the land. It has been characterised by a government that views native title purely as an inconvenient 
 property right to be read down in line with the narrowest possible interpretation of common law. There is one word for a policy approach which seeks to absorb Aboriginal cultural imperatives: assimilation. It is really only a euphemism for cultural genocide.
This entire traumatising episode in Australia's history could have been avoided. With no representation in federal politics, indigenous Australians should have been offered a comprehensive process of consultation from the grassroots community to the representative bodies in which to resolve native title issues with the European dominated parliament.
It is highly ironic that, while there was wide support for negotiated agreements forming the basis of resolving native title issues on the ground, there was no support from the government or the ALP to use this same method to resolve the disagreements with the bill itself. It is a sad indictment on the nature of Australian parliamentary politics that the most sensible option for dealing with the native title issue was dismissed out of hand in favour of adversarial conflict, which effectively excluded Aboriginal people from the moment the legislation was drafted.
The solution is as ancient and as certain as Aboriginal culture itself. It is only when non-indigenous communities take time, in an organised way, to listen to indigenous people and their requests to be acknowledged and consulted as custodians of this continent that the healing and conciliation will begin. The process should not have been seen as utopian or intimidating. Time and again Aboriginal people have proven themselves to be amongst the most generous, forgiving and compromising people on the planet. Only when we enter such a process will it become clear that native title is not some sort of affirmative action property right manufactured by the High Court to provide Aboriginal people with special privileges. Only then will native title be seen for what it is: an acknowledgment that this land was inhabited long before European settlement and that up to six years ago our nation was built on denying this fact. It is an acknowledgment that for indigenous people this land is not merely property which 
 can be bought and sold, but goes to the very heart of their culture and existence. It is an acknowledgment that this connection with the land is not something to be feared, resented or derided, but rather it is to be respected, nurtured and protected. It is this acknowledgment that is necessary for the healing to begin.",SENATE,<title>NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-04-01,"—The first time the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996  was before this chamber I spoke about how this legislation, more than any other, will be seen as defining the Howard government. In the same way that the Australian community sees this issue as a defining moment in our history, so too does the international community. Australia is under the international spotlight and the focus of international attention is directed towards us, particularly on this issue. For the past two years this government has turned back the clock with respect to Australia's international and national obligations, first in Kyoto with greenhouse emissions and now with respect to the Native Title Amendment Bill . Australia is slowly returning to a 1950s mentality; consequently, a 1950s style role in world affairs. This is the legacy of the Prime Minister, John Howard.
If the volume of correspondence I have received about native title is any measure of public opinion, then it is obvious that the majority of Australians are demanding fair and just legislation for indigenous Australians. This bill is of momentous importance because we have so few opportunities to reconcile the needs of indigenous people with the needs of the wider Australian community. Labor recognises that the Native Title Amendment Bill [No. 2] is a unique opportunity for the parliament to make a decision of profound historical significance. It is deeply regrettable that the Liberal and National parties are more concerned with short-term political point scoring than with the future of race relations in this country.
If the government is interested in Australia's long-term future, then they should make reconciliation a priority. It is not surprising that some people get the impression the Prime Minister keeps wishing that Wik 
 would go away—but it will not. It will not disappear because people want this issue resolved. For two years the voting public have waited for a vision from the Prime Minister, a vision for this generation and for future generations. It has not been forthcoming. Younger Australians in particular are hoping that the parliament will grasp the native title bill as the unique opportunity it represents to pursue genuine reconciliation. They are hoping the parliament will do that because they know the government does not have the will or the political intent to do that.
It must be heartbreaking for many young Australians to discover that the only vision of the Howard government is to recycle a 1950s style Liberal Party and a 1950s image of Australian society. I find it deeply regrettable that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs chooses to completely ignore the damage being done to the reconciliation process. I believe the minister has a duty to represent the interests of the people who come under his portfolio. This has not occurred. These people, indigenous Australians, have no voice in cabinet because the minister has chosen to completely abrogate that responsibility. It must indeed be marked down as the low point in race relations when the minister for Aboriginal affairs proclaims it as a badge of honour to be censured by ATSIC.
Rather than producing real policies that will propel Australia into the next century, the Prime Minister and his band of short-sighted bandaid waving ministers are prepared to sacrifice Australia's future in terms of racial harmony and reconciliation in the interests of a few offshore pastoralists and overseas mining companies. Their interests are being placed before the interests of Australian people. Talk about a conflict of interest.
In relation to the provisions contained in this bill, the right to negotiate is seen by the government as some kind of obstacle to development. I have heard Senator Minchin rant on about how mining operations are being jeopardised by native title claims. However, the same mining countries alleging that the right to negotiate is a burden on their Australian operations have a history of suc 
 cessful negotiations with indigenous peoples, both here and overseas. There have been a number of highly successful agreements made under the Northern Territory land rights act between mining companies and tribal communities. What is more, some of the multinational countries currently operating here in Australia have negotiated far better royalty rates with overseas indigenous groups. The Ranger uranium operation, for example, pays approximately five per cent in royalties to Aboriginal people. Yet the same companies that are involved in that operation pay Canadian aboriginal people between 15 and 50 per cent for similar activities.
The right to negotiate will not hinder mining activities, because almost every multinational mining organisation is well versed in negotiating fair and just agreements with Aboriginal groups. The only obstacle in this process, as we have seen in Queensland and the Northern Territory, is conservative politicians, who would like to legislate away the rights of the indigenous population in Australia.
Speaking of rights, the amendments to the registration test and sunset clause are plainly a case of discrimination towards indigenous people. Two hundred and ten years of dispossession, stolen children, land grabs, racially discriminatory laws, disenfranchisement and genocide has destroyed a great deal of Aboriginal culture. To then turn around and severely restrict which claimants have a right to negotiate clearly demonstrates a rejection by this government of Aboriginal society and history.
The tragedy of forced removals and dispossession means that some Aboriginal groups have not been allowed to enjoy unrestricted access to traditional lands. Along with the sunset clause, this forms part of the amendments that were proposed in the interest of equity and fairness. If this bill is passed without amendment, Australia will no longer be in a position to judge other countries. If we are incapable of providing justice within our own society, how can we possibly question with any credibility at all the actions of other governments? If we cannot extend the same common law rights to all Australians, 
 what right do we have to comment on the human rights practices of other nations? The government's legislation will prevent people who have had continuous occupation of this land for centuries from carrying out their traditional customs and rights.
Native title rights will not stop pastoralists from using the land for pastoral purposes. Native title will not prevent mining nor will it stop a pastoralist constructing gates, fences or dams. Labor's proposals will not prevent a pastoral leaseholder from using the trees or the soil for land improvement. Our amendments seek to do something Mr Howard is incapable of doing; that is, looking after the interests of indigenous Australians.
The Labor Party's approach to native title stands in complete contrast to the racially discriminatory proposals contained in the government's bill. In the future, when our children and grandchildren study Australian history, the actions of this Senate at this point in time will be recorded, and we will stand to be judged by them. I remind those senators opposite that the very people you are refusing to listen to are the same people who will write and tell the history of how the Howard government set Australia back 40 years, particularly with respect to race relations. Church leaders, historians, academics, unionists, actors, lawyers, musicians, artists, teachers and, of course, our indigenous people have written to their members and senators. They will hold this government in complete contempt.
When this bill was first presented, I commented that you do not have to be a redneck to be a racist. Racism is now found in the guise of this Liberal government. This is strong language, but how else can you describe legislation that is about taking away the rights of one group in our society simply because of their Aboriginality?
I mistakenly believed that even Liberal philosophy represented an acceptance of some degree of equality and fairness. I thought that protecting the common law rights of Australia's indigenous people was a fundamental belief. We often hear the Liberal rhetoric about fundamental common law rights and individual rights. In this case, there 
 is clearly a double standard. I was mistaken when I believed that former Liberal ministers like Fred Chaney and Ian Viner were typical of Liberal party politicians. Then again, when you hear a former Liberal minister expressing dismay at the misleading and divisive campaign being waged by the current Liberal and National parties, you know that this government is far from liberal in the true, small `l' sense of the word. It is not liberal, it is discriminatory.
Even the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has sold out his constituency simply for some perceived electoral advantage. Instead of defending a High Court decision that offered some sort of future for indigenous people, Senator Herron is supporting foreign pastoral lease holders and mining interests. As I said before, he is not even taking the fight to cabinet. There is no voice for indigenous Australians in the cabinet room.
As we approach a new millennium, Australia is at the crossroads. Do we go forward and progress and face our future, even if that means acknowledging that the past contains many horrific acts of prejudice, racism and even genocide? Or do we go back in time to the 1950s and continue the myth that Australia was uninhabited before white settlement? We have moved beyond that in this country, and I stand proudly with my Labor colleagues in refuting the proposed changes contained in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] . I will let history judge the actions of my party in regard to native title, because our commitment to providing true equity to indigenous Australians is unquestionable.
Today is one of those occasions where our behaviour will be remembered long after we are gone from this place. How ashamed must the government senators be if they should vote to support this bill unamended. How ashamed must they be if they are to go down in history as being part of the government to wind back the clock, returning to a view of Aboriginal administration and the rights and lives of our indigenous population held in the 19th century.
I, like so many other Australians, want my children and my grandchildren to grow up in a society capable of bestowing justice and 
 recognition towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Accepting our amendments to this bill is the first step in rebuilding Australia's future. It is the first step in rebuilding what has been a declining international reputation. Cutting the heart out of what it is to be a proud Australian is what this bill does. This country is crying out for leadership. It is crying out for someone of some strength and compassion to take hold of this issue and to move forward. The Prime Minister is not providing this service; he is not worthy of the job.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-04-01,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I must apologise from the very beginning because I have not had the opportunity to examine in the detail required this very important report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Preliminary report of the detention of boat people . I was about to say in commencing my remarks that it is a timely report; however, I have some doubts about that now. I noticed that the covering letter which presented the report to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams AM, QC, from Mr Sidoti is dated 7 November 1997—quite some considerable time ago. I also note on the Senate red today:
As recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, the dates listed at the end of certain annual reports indicate the date on which the report was submitted to the minister and the date the report was received by the minister, respectively.
Those dates according to today's Senate red are 7 January 1998 and 7 January 1998. It appears that it has taken two months for this report to get from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission through to the Attorney-General's Department or office here in Parliament House in Canberra.
I must commend the Attorney-General's Department: it has only taken them three months to get this report from the office of the Attorney-General, which is down the corridor, to this chamber. People might say that I am being too kind, but if one had anything to do with the estimates committees 
 that deal with the Attorney-General's Department, one would know that it is quite a considerable achievement for the Attorney-General's Department to get matters into the chamber in three months. In drawing attention to that I hope perhaps that the department or the Attorney-General himself might notice the fact that there are still some outstanding questions on notice from the last round of estimates committee hearings. Perhaps even the Minister for Justice, who represents the Attorney-General in this place, Senator Vanstone, will also take note of it.
I want to move on to the report itself. I repeat the apology I made at the beginning of my remarks. I have not had the time to study the report in the depth and detail required. I note from the document that the commission hoped to present a draft full report on the detention of boat people early this year. We are already in April and we are only now receiving a copy of the preliminary report, which was sent to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs way back in March of last year. If reports of this nature are going to be of any use either to the departments, the parliament or the community as a whole, they are going to have to be delivered in a more timely fashion than has happened with this particular report.
The report is very timely because of what is happening in our region. There have already been a number of warnings through our media that there is a danger that we might be inundated with people from our near neighbours seeking refuge on our shores. They might arrive by way of boat—it is more difficult to arrive by aircraft. There are, as this report proves, a considerable number of people—many thousands in fact since the last wave of boat people began—who are willing to risk their lives to come to these shores seeking refuge and protection or, in many cases, a better economic future for themselves. Those warnings have been out there and I hope that they are being heeded by those in power and that certain steps are in place to protect our borders and our migration program from the threat of another much larger wave of unauthorised boat arrivals to this country.
I look forward to reading this report in depth and detail. If no other senators want to speak on this matter I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1998-04-01,"—I propose tonight to make the second speech in a series of three relating to world trends in information technology and Australia's place in this development.
One of the fastest changing areas is digital broadcasting. This government has geared up for the introduction of this new technology and, from my observations, we are well in line with developments in advanced countries overseas. Last week, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, released our policy on digital broadcasting. This is a hot topic at the moment because all over the world this technology is about to come in, particularly in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.
Digital television uses computer technology to deliver crystal clear vision and sound that is cinema quality. This week in the parliament, a group of us had the opportunity to see the first demonstration of digital television in Australia. It was incredibly impressive. What people will have in their living rooms is something that is of much higher quality, much larger size and with much greater effect. For example, one of the scenes that we saw in digital television was of someone with a brush and a powder jar. The powder flew out of the jar and the very clarity of these fine points of dust showed how impressive this new vision is. We also saw very spectacular sports and travel scenes. This type of quality, as I mentioned before, brings the cinema into your living room.
In addition to cinema quality, digital television basically gives much more effective use of the spectrum on which we broadcast. It requires much less transmitter power than analogue. It is highly resistant to ghosting and allows the same channel to be reused at closer distances than analogue. Digital TV can actually be delivered by satellite, by cable, by multipoint microwave distribution and by even the copper twisted pair cables that normally form the basis of your telephone line in your home. With digital television comes the potential for what we saw in the parliament this week—high definition television.
This government sees the introduction of digital television as the chance not only to improve picture quality but also to enhance and increase the number and variety of broadcasting services. Because you can actually squeeze the television signal into half the bandwidth, it opens up the possibility of more channels or a new type of service called datacasting. Datacasting helps deliver into the home things such as home banking, home shopping and a whole range of computing activities. Services that are normally delivered on a computer through the Internet can actually now come through your television screen with this new technology.
This government has set up a framework which will see the introduction of digital television in metropolitan areas by 1 January 2001. So this is less than two years away. In regional areas, digital television will become available in the major centres at that time and all regional areas will have access by 2004. That further delay is created by the fact that, in the regional areas, you need to build more transmitters to cover the area.
The government is committed to ensuring that regional Australians with an analogue service will have access to a digital service of at least the equivalent quality and coverage. We have set an eight-year simulcast period where we can actually transmit both the current signal and the new digital signal. So people will not have to throw out their TV sets in two years time. There will be a transition period of eight years and, during that time, the actual costs of the sets will come down very quickly with mass production. 
 Commercial broadcasters, the ABC and SBS will actually be loaned the spectrum they need during the simulcast period. After the eight years, that extra spectrum has to be handed back to the government. The government can then auction that for use by other providers on a whole range of technologies that are coming to us in this new information age.
The United Kingdom and the United States are following a similar system of providing the spectrum on a loan basis without any up-front charge. The reason for that is that the conversion to digital television is enormously costly. It is calculated to be between $500 million and $750 million, and this will be covered entirely by the TV stations. So this is a quid pro quo for putting up that extra cost. We are creating the possibility of simulcast and high definition television and, with this, getting this cinema quality picture and sound.
Other spectrum will be available for digital transmission of data services, and there will be new opportunities in entertainment, education and information services. These data services will commence at the same time as digital television, on 1 January 2001, and we will have a level playing field fee regime that does not advantage the commercial stations over new players. This means there will be maximum competition in the new system. Commercial broadcasters will be able to offer data services as well.
As this process goes on, this government plans to conduct a review to determine whether further television datacasting services will be allowed. The reason for this is that we are moving into a totally new technology, and we are not too sure how it will actually pan out over five to 10 years in terms of the sorts of services that people want to offer. We feel there should be a review period in order to have the opportunity to modify the policy in accordance with technological developments at that time. Also at that time, the government will consider any necessary legislative changes that might be needed because of the convergence of broadcasting and non-broadcasting services.
With the spectrum that is being offered, free to air broadcasters will be able to provide information links to television programs. This means that, while you are watching your favourite footy game, you can actually bring up—like you do on a computer—information about the players and information about the history of a particular club. You can do this with a whole range of programs. If you are watching, for example, a travel scene dealing with Argentina, you can pull up—like you would on a CD-ROM—information on that particular country. What we have here is computer technologies merging with broadcasting technologies, merging with telephone technologies and, in this new era of convergence, a whole range of exciting possibilities are available.
One of the most important changes will be that, compared with television of the past where we have been passive viewers, the new world that we are coming into will offer a whole range of interactive opportunities. Not only can you bank and shop via this medium; you can also take part in game shows, seek information and do a whole range of things that are interactive in nature. It is in the interactive area where this sort of technology holds its greatest potential. The consensus now, for example, with things like home shopping is that probably people will not shop for a full range of products. What seems to work best in test marketing overseas are niche products like books, clothes and real estate.
From my study of the situation in London, I found that comparatively Australia is in a very strong international position when it comes to these sorts of datacasting services and digital broadcasting. We are keeping up with the developments overseas and in some respects we are ahead. It is obvious that this government is determined to make decisions about digital broadcasting now to make sure that Australia does not fall behind the rest of the world. In London I was told that, on regulatory issues, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission places Australia in a much better position than Britain, which has an oversupply of regulatory authorities and no single convergent act. Also, Britain has decided not to give broadcasters access to 
 enough spectrum to allow high bit rate transmission, such as high definition television. So Australia is looking very good by comparison. As I am near the end of my time, I seek leave to have the rest of my speech incorporated in Hansard.
—Is leave granted?
—We would need to have a look at it before granting leave.
—Is leave granted?
—No, I cannot grant leave until I have seen the document.
—Senator Tierney, would you mind speaking to Senator Carr and perhaps that may be sorted out later.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Digital Television</title>,Adjournment,37,1
