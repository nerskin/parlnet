"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-03-03,"—So many in this chamber, in our parliament and in our community agree with the focus of the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010. This is a major issue for our community. However, at the beginning of this speech I have to say to Senator Brown and the people who are supporting this bill that, though we have great sympathy with their desire to make change in our community, at this stage we do not accept the need for the regulation which is spelled out in the bill.
I do note that the bill before us today is not the same bill that the Standing Committee on Community Affairs considered in 2008. There have been changes, and I think they certainly reflect some of the discussion that happened in the Community Affairs consideration at that time. That shows the way the debate must continue. The way we view these things, the way we respond, will evolve as more people come into the discussion and as more evidence is provided. As the National Preventative Health Strategy called on all people and government to do, we must have a key comprehensive strategy on the important issue of obesity in our community.
The strategy stated seven key objectives, the first of which is that there must be shared responsibility. We must develop effective strategic partnerships across the community to ensure that, at all levels of government, industry, business, unions, the non-government sector, research institutions and anywhere else, anyone who wants to be involved in this process should be involved in sharing the response and sharing the knowledge.
The second strategy is that we should act on these issues early and throughout life. This is not a problem that is related to age, location, process or family—it is something that we must consider across all of life. We need to work with individuals, families and, most importantly, within the community.
That leads onto the next objective, which is to engage communities. We need to actively engage with people where they live, where they work and where they play—at home, in schools, in workplaces and in the community. We have to inform, enable—most particularly enable—and support people to make healthy choices: healthy choices for themselves that they can own, not things imposed from outside, not from listening to experts who in many ways in their informing processes lose the audience. Too many words, too many rules and too many directives sometimes lose the battle. I think we have heard a few times that there is a battle. We have to engage, we have to identify and then we need to work together.
The fourth objective is to influence markets and develop connected and coherent policies—for example, through measures such as taxation and responsive regulation. This is one of the key recommendations, because that adjective ‘coherent’ is one that we need to take note of. Very often, in our need to make change, in our responses on something which we feel is important and we value, there is a tendency to leap forward quickly, to take an action that we might think will be positive, we might think will add to change, but we end up not having a coherent set of policies and, most importantly, forgetting to bring people along with us.
You cannot have a coherent policy, one that crosses all levels of government, without engaging with people and making sure that everybody is with you, understands the issue fully, and is prepared to listen and to conciliate and negotiate. Sometimes, in our need to be seen to be doing something, we forget that in making real difference, as I said on another of the objectives, we need to work effectively together.
The next objective is to reduce inequity through targeting disadvantage. We have heard that many times. Government policy has made an attempt to identify areas where there is particular disadvantage and clearly target those people and areas to ensure that the response is effective and not one size fits all. We understand that in working to develop a policy—in any area, but I think most particularly those who engage with families and communities on an issue such as obesity—we need to be sensitive and to understand that there are different needs and issues in different parts of our community. As I said, the directive ‘this will be the response and it will apply across the board’ is sometimes not the most effective response. The National Preventative Health Strategy did pick that up.
When we were looking at the Preventative Health Strategy, we also—as this government does across all elements of social policy—looked at the particular needs of Indigenous Australians. That must be brought into any discussion or debate that we have.
The last recommendation of the strategy, which is also part of the government’s response, is to look at our current primary healthcare process and refocus it to a clear understanding of prevention. We have heard the figures. There is no argument about the fact that if we can identify and prevent the cause of illness, if we can ensure that people understand that and put strategies in place cooperatively to address those major changes, we will have a healthier community across the board, which will inevitably lead to cost savings in the medical system. There have been many studies on that across the globe. The real push, apart from our need to respond to our citizenry in making sure that there is effective health care, is to look at the health budget. We need to refocus the health budget to ensure that prevention, understanding and education have a high profile and we are not completely reliant on extraordinarily expensive emergency care.
Developing the National Preventative Health Strategy took a number of years. In 2008, when the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs had its inquiry into the previous bill on this issue, the task force was still working towards bringing forward its final report. The report was produced, the government made an initial response and we continue to respond to those very important principles as we develop health policy and reform health across the country. That means engaging with industry, responding cooperatively and taking a whole-of-life approach to health issues. Most important, and I think a key aspect of the discussion we are having this morning, is working within community to engage within community. As I said earlier, that is not to impose from outside, to rush in with one element of a response, but rather to work cooperatively so that we have—I requote the strategy—a cohesive response that makes people feel as though they are involved, they own the policy and they have a role in it.
I congratulate the Australian Greens for putting this issue clearly on the agenda. They have led over many years in this area of advertising reform and linking it to process. I do not accept that the way to move this forward is to have a simple advertising ban. We had debate in the community and among our committee about how it should work with other areas, and I think that is important. But what we have in the bill this morning is leading with a ban, leading with a direction, leading with legislation, rather than working with industry and community to bring forward processes from those areas. I think that should be the response to the seven principles of the strategy that I outlined.
No-one could doubt that if this piece of legislation went through there would be a change. There would be no advertising of these products between early morning and late night. That is an element of change that we have had between 2008 and now. The bill that went before the community affairs committee in 2008 did not have such a wide range. This one is a wider response. It says there should not be any advertising, of any kind, of what the bill refers to as junk food—and there was quite a degree of debate among the community affairs committee as to how you define the term ‘junk’—on the TV networks between those hours. I believe—and certainly I will be arguing it today—that response is too wide-ranging. It does not bring industry along with it. It says, ‘This is what we’re going to do and this is how it’s going to work.’ While there should always be a wide range of options on the table, in our community now, as a result of the work that has been done on the national health strategy, we have the Preventative Health Agency, which has been given the authority by this parliament to monitor the effectiveness of regulations and initiatives. It will continue to engage with community and bring together the expertise, knowledge and commitment of people in the Australian community and internationally to analyse, work effectively with and disseminate the latest evidence. That will lead to a coherent and cohesive connected policy framework.
We know that efforts have already been made across a range of communities and industries to ensure that the issues of obesity, protection of our community and protection of our health are moved forward. It is important to note that that has occurred. Sometimes, I think, people who are caught up in the need to make change, people who are committed to a principle, do not always acknowledge work that has been done, because that work may not have reached the point that those people want to get to.
Through our community affairs inquiry and through ongoing discussion with industry, we know that there have been a range of changes in the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, in industry responsiveness in the areas of healthy food and lifestyle and in ensuring that there is an understanding by the advertising industry and by the communications networks of the best ways to respond both to the needs of the market and to the needs of the wider community and health base.
An example is the Responsible Children’s Marketing Initiative, a voluntary code developed by the Australian food and beverage industry. The code requires that advertisements targeted at children help promote healthy dietary choices and lifestyles. Linked with that healthy choice in lifestyle component of the initiative is a truth in advertising process. This prohibits advertisements shown to any members of the community—it is not limited to children—from portraying something which is wrong, which is misleading or which can lead to false expectations. When you put those things together, you see the cooperative way that the Australian Food and Grocery Council, the Australian Beverages Council and the various bodies involved in communications, TV and advertising are approaching this issue. They are not running away from this issue; they are not moving away from the argument; they are not excluding themselves from a commitment—one we all know we need—to the health of our communities. People have chosen to be involved.
There was certainly some discussion during the hearings of the community affairs committee about the level of trust in industry self-regulation. In some ways I share in that concern. But I always believe we should allow people the opportunity to be engaged and then, should their participation, their cooperation and their actions not meet our requirements, we can pursue options to move in different directions. While the cooperative arrangement is being pursued, however, and while the industry is voluntarily changing its practice and while it is showing a willingness to listen and to be involved, I think we should be encouraging that. As the strategy pointed out, we should attempt to make sure that industry is involved in the process rather than seeing it as the enemy or taking a punitive approach to it. The needs of the industry should be recognised as should its achievements in addressing this issue. The community affairs committee hearings had a number of really positive discussions. That is how we like to work in the community affairs committee—we like to have open discussions so people can share their views and be involved in working towards a genuine outcome.
At some stage—it is in Hansard—I did say that my own childhood was actually enhanced by some of the advertisements for products that were important to me at the time. I hope there is no commercial problem here, but I did refer to Cherry Ripe advertisements and the beautiful images that were in them. As part of that discussion, I talked about the fact that there was, at that time, no doubt in my family and in the families I knew that those sorts of advertisements were about luxury foods. Those products referred to in this bill as ‘junk food’—unnecessarily in my view—were products that were openly available in the community. While they were openly available, people knew and understood what those products were. The key responsibility, when looking at those sorts of advertisements and sharing them in family and school communities, was knowing what was appropriate at what time.
One of the things we talked about was the role of parental responsibility and the role of effective community education. Effective education is needed to ensure that the people watching the advertisements understand that the kinds of foods being promoted, the ones which are the target of this bill, are not your staple family meals. We are not saying that everybody should eat the foods referred to in this bill—they are not your standard meal. One of the key aspects of the government response to the whole health strategy is community education. People need to understand the necessity for a good basic diet and that the kinds of things we are talking about now are add-ons—they are not core diet, but they are part of life.
The way you work effectively in, live in and survive in the community is to know boundaries. Very often people forget that there must be personal accountability and personal responsibility. Advertising has a role and industry has a role, but the final decision must be with individuals, families and society. I believe that part of the preventative health strategy in our community must look at appropriate education—support for people so that they understand health, they understand diet and they understand the importance of advertising. The government needs to work effectively in that space.
So responding to people in their own lives and their own schools, as we have already done with the various programs aimed at encouraging increased physical activity, to enable them to work out for themselves what is best is a strategy that should be part of our response. We should take that approach rather than immediately moving to a blanket advertising ban. I am not saying that there is no role in this debate for discussion of the regulation of advertising. What I do say is that we need to look at all the options and engage with all the people who have a definite interest in this area. No-one can just decide to move away from this debate—it is the responsibility of all of us. But if we are going to say that our key response is to ban advertising on what is defined as junk food—and I am not quite sure whether that definition is particularly clear—and that everything else will fall in around that, we are not giving the appropriate message, that each of us has a responsibility, to the community and to every individual. We work within our community to achieve a result.
The debate on this issue will continue. The way it should occur is through the Australian Preventative Health Agency, which is calling upon all of us to be involved and work with them so that we have a response that engages, informs and results in an effective policy that we share and own.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING (BROADCASTING AMENDMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-03-03,"—I rise to speak on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010. The overarching issues that we deal with in this topic are very important and Senator Moore has reflected upon the significance of the overarching issues of obesity, particularly childhood obesity. Obesity is a serious problem. As the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs quoted in its report on the predecessor to this bill:
It estimated the total financial cost of obesity in Australia in 2008 was $8.3 billion and suggested that by 2020 the number of obese Australians will have grown to 6 million.
These are significant figures. Whilst I have some general concerns about the often bulking-up of these epidemiological studies into enormous economic costs, the figures on the number of Australians who are overweight, the growing trend of obesity and the impact that has on the health of those individuals, and the costs to our health system and other flow-on economic costs, are quite real. What is also quite real is the known link between childhood obesity and adult obesity. It is a fact that children who are obese are more likely to end up being obese adults. However, I do not believe that this bill presents a serious solution to this problem; in fact, this bill does not really present any solution to this serious problem of obesity.
As Senator Moore expressed, this is very much a cultural problem. People genuinely know and understand that eating badly is bad for them, but they still do it and they still promulgate that habit to their children. People know that not doing enough exercise is bad for them, yet they still fail to do enough exercise and they still fail to encourage and facilitate enough exercise in the lives of their children. These are things that are known and it is a cultural issue that we have to try to change and redress.
I see in the gallery today that we have some visiting school groups. I am sure all of those students know that eating badly is bad for them and that they need to do more exercise in their lives in order to have a healthy lifestyle in the future. But there are a range of pressures on this—from time pressures to what is served at the family table. All of those types of issues are there, but advertising is by no means the driving force.
If you look at the evidence in this debate, it is quite clear that banning junk food advertising really has no impact whatsoever. If you go through study after study, you will struggle to find any genuine causal link. In a 2004 lead editorial in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine it was argued:
… there is no good evidence that advertising has a substantial influence on children’s food consumption and, consequently, no reason to believe that a complete ban on advertising would have any useful impact on childhood obesity rates.
It continued by saying:
The claim that food advertising is a major contributor to children’s food choices and the rising tide of childhood obesity has obvious appeal, but as an argument it does not stand up to scrutiny.
Indeed, it does not stand up to scrutiny, and research study after research study has continued to say so. Just last year the Productivity Commission released a staff working paper on childhood obesity that concluded:
… while research shows that television viewing and childhood obesity are related, the direction of causation and the magnitude of the contribution of food advertising to obesity is uncertain.
That is a fairly logical point. Research shows that there is a link between the extent of television viewing—a fairly sedentary activity—and childhood obesity, but it does not show there is a link between the products that are advertised on television and childhood obesity. The Productivity Commission report went on to say:
While research shows correlations between advertising and children’s preferences, there is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between advertising and children’s food preferences and weight outcomes. It is also difficult to isolate the effect of advertising from other factors that affect the television viewing and obesity relationship, such as the sedentary nature of television viewing.
If, as the evidence suggests, the link between television viewing and childhood obesity is tenuous or, at most, small in magnitude, it is unlikely that banning the advertising of energy-dense foods would significantly address the prevalence of childhood obesity. This was a study done only last year by the Productivity Commission—in their usual way, it is very well-sourced and researched—into all of the findings of different experts during that time. The Productivity Commission and the Royal Society of Medicine are not alone in that regard. Frontier Economics released a bulletin in January 2008 in which they tried to assess some of the evidence and analysis in this debate. They found:
Most studies could not identify a clear relationship between advertising and consumption, and those that did indicated the impact was small – a mere 2% of the variance that could be related to different influences such as family meal habits, exercise levels and so forth. Moreover, recent studies of Canada and Sweden indicate that obesity does not diminish where advertising to children has been banned.
I emphasise the last sentence because this is the key point of this debate. We are debating a bill put forward by the Greens proposing to ban and restrict certain types of food advertising, doing so under the premise that it will somehow have an impact on obesity, yet I am unable to find clear-cut evidence, research, studies or data that suggest it will. What you can find are suggestions that there are better ways of tackling childhood obesity. The PC report, which I referenced before, highlights other alternative community based interventions. In Australia, it highlighted the Be Active Eat Well program, saying:
The intervention was designed and implemented by parents and local organisations (such as schools and community agencies). The strategy includes nutrition strategies, physical activity strategies and screen time strategies to promote healthy eating and physical activity. This long-term intervention ran for several years.
This is the type of intervention program which is far more likely to succeed. Firstly, it is built from the grassroots up. It involves parents, school communities and local people who can impact what happens in day-to-day lives. It involves the correlation and combination of what you eat and how you exercise. This example has, indeed, worked overseas. The Productivity Commission report went on to highlight examples in France of similar community based intervention programs:
In each town the intervention is led by a committee, and suggestions are received for different community initiatives, activities and diets. Initiatives may include organising games at school playtime, walk-to-school groups and learning about vegetables in the classroom.
                …            …            …
Half of the towns showed a statistically significant decrease in overweight and obesity combined between 2005 and 2007.
So we have evidence to say that a holistic approach similar to some of the measures Senator Moore was talking about can work, can deliver change. This is where the focus of this debate needs to be. Talking about advertising bans is a distraction to the main game of tackling this issue. Even if there were any evidence that it would work, frankly there is every chance that the horse has bolted on this because children are now viewing less free-to-air television. Children are accessing information from a far wider variety of sources and different media and the internet. If Senator Conroy gets his way, obviously they will be accessing a lot more internet. There are varieties of ways by children will get information.
Advertising is often highlighted as a great plague on society, but that is not the truth. Advertising does not kill people. Advertising does not make people fat or drunk. For all the claims and desires of different people, especially the Greens, banning advertising is not a solution. We need cultural change—things that bring people back to healthy lifestyles. Cultural initiatives are the answer; this bill is not.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING (BROADCASTING AMENDMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-03-03,"—One would wonder why advertisers bother spending millions of dollars on advertising. Given the two speeches I have just heard in this place, it is obvious that advertising has an impact; otherwise, advertisers would not be spending millions on it. The Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to encourage healthier eating habits among children and to prohibit the broadcasting of advertisements for junk food during certain times. The bill is not the sole thing we need to do to address obesity and associated diseases in our children, our juveniles and our adult population. The Greens have never ever said that—not once. This is part of the comprehensive approach we need to take to manage the obesity epidemic in our community. Some people are saying that we are going to be the peak of the healthiest generation and that life expectancy will in fact decrease from now because of our unhealthy habits. We have to do something about this epidemic.
The current restriction on advertising to children—people under 14 years of age—set out in the Children’s Television Standards 2009, applies from 7.00 am to 8.30 pm. The bill amends these times to cover the period between 6.00 am and 9.30 pm. A range of key stakeholder organisations, including the Obesity Policy Coalition, have argued that the existing time frame does not represent the actual viewing times of children in this age group. Those organisations support the extension of time to ensure the advertising restriction is effective.
In Australia, 62 per cent of men and 45 per cent of women are considered overweight or obese. High body mass contributes 7.5 per cent to the overall health burden in Australia, with type 2 diabetes at 40 per cent and heart disease at 34 per cent as the major risks. Obesity rates in Australia are generally increasing, so we quite clearly need to address this issue.
Currently in Australia the potential cost saving to the health sector would be $812 million—if we are able to eliminate, for example, just obesity issues. Those statistics give a brief snapshot of why it is so important that we address this issue. Not only are there some very important economic considerations but, most importantly, this is about the health of our community and future generations, ensuring that we have good health programs which generally improve the health of the Australian community.
Successive governments have run advertising and information campaigns to improve diets and increase physical activity with the aim of preventing or reducing obesity and improving our health. Despite these campaigns, obesity rates have continued to rise—the latest figures were released last week. This suggests that to date some of these programs may well not have been effective and that, if we are going to change behaviour, we need to provide different information. A lot of these campaigns have been undermined directly by advertising of products on television to our children. We need to refocus our social marketing campaigns, deal with economic incentives and, in some cases, change our legislative base—for example, by banning junk food advertising, an approach the Greens have been advocating for some considerable time as part of an integrated approach to dealing with this issue.
We need a greater understanding of consumer interaction. This conclusion is supported by research in behavioural economics which has shown that, in many cases, even when consumers have ready access to understandable information, they still fail to choose the products or the services which best suit their needs—because people may ignore or misinterpret relevant information or fail to act because of other barriers to them changing their behaviour.
Biases in consumer decision making are well known to traders of goods and services. They have large marketing budgets and present their products in the best possible light within the limits of the law. They may also exploit consumer biases to increase demand for their products. That is what advertising is all about—let us face it. The large amount of advertising generated by the manufacturers of junk food, for example, makes it very difficult for healthy eating messages to be effective. Again, it highlights the need for strong programs and a variety of programs to tackle this problem from a variety of angles. It also highlights the need for consumers to be involved in assisting in the advisory process, particularly talking to parents.
In marketing to children, advertisers have encouraged the phenomena of what has been called ‘label pester power’. This has been defined as the constant demand for parents to purchase items, be they clothes, toys, gadgets, or various other goods—in particular, food. Pestering consists of persistent nagging—that is, pleas which are repeated consistently for parents to purchase an item. This type of pestering is not as effective with parents as ‘importance nagging’. Importance nagging represents a more sophisticated means by which children claim that something is necessary for their educational or sporting progress, or for their general wellbeing, which is where the issues concerning food come in. Importance nagging takes advantage of parents’ desire to provide the best for their children, and plays on any guilt they may feel about not spending enough quality time with their children.
According to the Australian Centre for Science in the Public Interest, pestering strategies undermine parental authority, which is where we come to this business of ‘It’s all about parental authority’. Parents are forced to choose between being the bad guy by saying no to junk food, or giving in to incessant demands. This conflict in negotiation between parents and children is recognised as ‘co-shopping’, which is when children are in the shopping centre with their parents. Parents describe this as extremely stressful because of the constant purchase demands made by children. Anybody who has been in a shopping centre with children will understand exactly what I am talking about.
An increasing number of overseas findings agree that television commercials for sweets, snacks and fast foods are the mainstays of advertising which targets children. According to a 2007 study by the American Kaiser Family Foundation, half of all advertising time on children’s television is devoted to food advertising. What does that say about what advertisers want to do? They know their market. They spend an enormous amount of money advertising their products very creatively to children. That is why they advertise these products to children so that children will want to pester their parents to buy them. It is quite obvious. Product makers could save an enormous amount of money if they thought advertising was not working. Many advertisements associate physical activity with the products and highlight the health benefits to be gained by their consumption. It is often stressed that they contain ‘essential nutrients’.
The British Heart Foundation’s Children’s Food Campaign concluded that food marketing to children is almost always for unhealthy products, and this plays an important role in encouraging unhealthy eating habits which are likely to continue from childhood into adulthood. Further, evidence suggests that advertisements affect food choices at both brand and category levels—that is, a McDonald’s hamburger advertisement is likely to not only make it more probable that a person will buy a McDonald’s hamburger in preference to another brand but also that person will buy a hamburger per se. In other words, they will go out, they want a hamburger, but they will then go and buy a McDonald’s. In other words, there is evidence that advertising unhealthy foods to children influences not only which brands children choose but also the overall balance of their diet, encouraging them to eat energy-dense, salty, sugary or fatty foods in place of those which are more nutritious and wholesome.
The advertising industry introduced self-regulation—the Responsible Children’s Marketing Initiative—in January 2009. However, research including the Australian Food and Grocery Council report just this year—January 2011—found that one in five food advertisements in children’s programs were for high-fat, sugar and salt products. The self-regulation is clearly not working to effectively protect children.
One aspect of the responsible marketing and consumption argument is that, unlike tobacco, junk foods can be enjoyed in moderation without causing undue harm to children and adults. The Cadbury company maintains, for example, that its products can be enjoyed as a treat. However, at the same time as the Cancer Council of New South Wales points out, Cadbury has spent millions of dollars creating a new internet cartoon series featuring Freddo Frog. The marketing features puzzles, games and activities embedded within the cartoon and from which children can be involved in the cartoon’s development. The company claims this represents responsible marketing and does not have children featured. That is simply not responsible marketing and we believe we need to take action. (Time expired)

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I am very pleased to contribute to this debate on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010. I was smiling to myself as I was listening to Senator Siewert talking about pressures on parents shopping. I had my two grandchildren in the supermarket on the weekend and went through the painful process of finding the checkout that did not have the lollies at the checkout to tempt them. Trying absolutely to teach two children aged under four that ‘no’ means no is no mean feat, but it is an important role for parents to be able to do that. The real issue that we have today is that while we commend this effort and this debate around childhood obesity and the issue of television advertising that targets children, the government does not believe that this is the way to actually achieve effective change. Just banning advertising to children does nothing about changing parenting skills, understanding behaviour modification, understanding the complexities of obesity and actively developing good habits.
Since the inquiry took place, following the bill’s referral to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs in 2008, the debate has actually moved along quite a lot. One of the purposes of such an inquiry is to push the debate on, to move public opinion, to move the responsibility of the industry and for it to step up to the plate and do something about this issue. The government has some role to play. The work that we are doing in addressing childhood obesity involves ramping up our investment in research and development, supporting organisations like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and looking at the whole healthy children’s initiative through the COAG process. All of this is part and parcel of addressing the fundamental issues of unhealthy practices, unhealthy foods, food additives and junk food marketing.
One of the things that I have noticed is that food is quite a challenge for parents whose child is attending a childcare centre. They have to observe so many rules and regulations around the child taking their food with them. There are so many specific obligations on parents around packaging their children’s lunches and ensuring that, for example, their lunch materials are not contaminated by peanut butter or other things that might create allergies in children. What we are seeing is a real shift to pre-packaged food. As Senator Siewert said, when things are marketed as very healthy products—such as fruit bars, which are concentrated fructose; or a juice box, which has 15 per cent juice, lots of sugar and plenty of water—the challenge for us is to understand that those things are not necessarily marketed to children; they are actually marketed to parents in the guise of being healthy foods. So the challenge here for us is to understand what so many people who made submissions to the inquiry said—that is, that we have to take a much more comprehensive approach to these things. Food marketing is just one element of a very complex debate.
In the dissenting report from Senator Siewert and Senator Brown, the issue was about acknowledging the growing challenge of obesity in this country, especially childhood obesity and how that sets people up for a lifetime of poor health outcomes. So the government has decided to try to do something far more constructive in this way by investing through COAG to bring together a national approach through our national health ministers and our national sports ministers and through trying to understand the regulatory environment that we are in and to engage in health prevention rather than health control. We all know that our health budget is only going to grow exponentially unless we start to address these fundamental childhood issues and set people up for a healthy adulthood. A most comprehensive investment of $872 million into that COAG process is just the tip of the iceberg.
If you look at the agreements that underline all of those COAG initiatives, you will see a raft of things. There are issues around research. There are issues around prevention. There are issues around activity. There are issues around education for parents. There are activities around education for community workers and for those who are engaged with and who support families. There are great initiatives around our health workforce in helping parents and children to deal with these issues. We are trying to be far more interventionist at an early age and to look at prevention rather than cure. When you think about that and about what is happening in targeting at-risk groups—Senator Moore has been very concerned about the growing levels of obesity in Aboriginal children—and when you look at what is happening in the Closing the Gap initiative, which is about trying to get fresh foods to community stores and alternatives to deep fried, pre-packaged foods, you see that none of that has anything to do with advertising. It is really about making sure that people have access to a variety of healthy food options, and I think that is a much more sensible approach, and we have worked very hard on that.
An initiative we funded is the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program, which is part and parcel of a growing community garden program across Australia. This program is really vibrant and dynamic. It goes to the heart of children and families having access to fresh foods. There are lots of conversations about food miles, farmers’ markets and social enterprises that are being developed around ensuring that children from low-income families have an opportunity to access fresh foods of all kinds. We have a revitalised health and PE curriculum in our schools that focuses on educating children at the pressure points of the targeted marketing that Senator Siewert and Senator Brown are so concerned about. We are really trying to find some healthy options. We have school breakfast clubs. We have all of those things happening that are about children educating themselves and each other about healthy food choices.
Going to the nub of this debate, the government have strengthened junk food advertising restrictions. We are limiting the use of popular characters and proprietary characters in advertising during the children’s programming hours. I remember the Milky Bar Kid from my youth, which was a very early challenge in this whole debate. The Milky Bar Kid was very healthy because it was milk. We know the subtle pressures that come into marketing. We know the subtleties of advertising. We know the skills that advertisers use in targeting their markets. Whether it is about junk food, whether it is about environmental programs or whether it is about something else, it is consumer advertising.
The Children’s Television Standards were reviewed in 2009 and they now require food product advertisements to not mislead or provide incorrect information about the nutritional value of the product. In May last year we released our response to the National Preventative Health Taskforce, noting the recommendation to reduce the exposure of children and others to marketing, advertising, promoting and sponsorship of junk food. We believe our challenge is in educating parents. Our challenge is in ensuring that we do not take the easy option—the fast food option that parents, children and adults and grandparents like me do not go to the cupboard and try to reward. That is another whole issue—a mentality about rewarding children for good behaviour. What we really have to do is take up the challenge and teach children that no means no.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING (BROADCASTING AMENDMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2011-03-03,"—Australia is one of the fattest nations on earth. The latest research shows that more than 60 per cent of our adults, 25 per cent of our children are either overweight or obese. Obesity leads to poor health outcomes, as has been indicated already in this chamber during this debate on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010

Obesity leads to an imbalance between energy consumed and energy expended. A more active healthy lifestyle is the answer, but it is easy to say and it is hard to do. In 2011, in this era we live in, we live in an obesogenic environment where sedentary lifestyles are encouraged rather than discouraged. Our children, for example, are spending more time watching television, being involved in computers on the internet, Facebook and other media like than ever before. Incidental exercise has declined due to urban design, transport arrangements, safety and for other reasons. We eat more, including more energy-dense, nutrient-poor food. Hereditary factors are also very important. While there is much that parents and individuals can do, as has been indicated by a number of speakers in this place already, there is a collective response from all levels of government and in particular the federal government to address the needs of our broader community.
What can be done? I have some suggestions and they are as follows: firstly, targets—they are used for cutting carbon emissions, they should be used to safeguard our children’s health; secondly, children’s health and fitness should be benchmarked, just like we do for literacy and numeracy. These results will be vital for designing healthy and active initiatives in response. When it comes to changing behaviours, we need to go beyond the fear as a motivator, which is now accepted as increasingly ineffective. Encouraging children to enjoy sport and physical activity is a key part of the solution to achieve better healthy outcomes. I also suggest mandatory PE in schools. Years ago, I was banging my head against a brick wall here saying that PE must be mandatory in schools. But in 2004, I am very pleased to say, the Howard government announced at one of my healthy lifestyle forums in Launceston that it would be mandatory and that it should be 120 minutes of mandatory weekly physical activity. But in my view that is not enough. We should now set a higher target and increase that to 180 minutes over time.
The federal government has dropped the ball with respect to the Active After-school Communities program. Minister Mark Arbib unfortunately has extended the program for only one year. So we will see the conclusion of this program, unless the government has a change of plan. We know that the program works. Everybody loves it. It is popular. In Tasmania, for example, 5,000 students benefit from this program. Around Australia, 3,270 schools and 192,000 students participate, based on the last reports from the Australian Sports Commission, who have done an excellent job, including in Tasmania. It is a fantastic program. It was a program announced by the Howard government in 2004 in Launceston and it should continue. The government has dropped the ball.
Now to healthy eating habits—what about the eating side of things? They are critical for our children. In my view, only healthy food should be sold through our schools. We are creating an environment in which our kids grow up and develop habits to be the best they can be. If we are offering unhealthy food in canteens it should be removed. For example, sugary fizzy drinks should not be there. Educational programs on nutritional health and improved advertising standards are essential to address the obesity epidemic in Australia and to create better eating habits across the board.
Other initiatives, for example, should be the establishment of a voucher system encouraging participation in sport across the community; more healthy school breakfasts; veggie gardens across the country in schools and in childcare centres as well; and healthy cooking classes are recommended. If vending machines do not offer healthy options, they should be removed—and this should include in the workplace as well. Workplace health systems and procedures should be put in place. I was speaking about that only this week with an expert in the field, Ruth Colagiuri, who was in the parliament together with others for the forum on non-communicable diseases, NCDs. There is UN meeting coming up on 19 September on this issue. Let me put on the record my strong support for that resolution and my strong encouragement for the government to do whatever it can to support a greater focus on NCDs across the globe. This is not an issue just for the First World; it is an issue for the Third World. Chronic disease is becoming out of control and it needs more resources and a more dedicated focus. I draw that to the attention of the government and I hope that they will follow it up.
I called for obesity to be a national health priority back in 2006 and prior to the 2007 election Labor, to its credit, said, yes, it should be—a good announcement. However, very little has happened since then in terms of the extra resources which are needed. To summarise the cost of obesity, at my instigation Access Economics completed a report some years ago and released it at my Healthy Lifestyle Forum to Help Combat Childhood Obesity in Hobart. The report said that obesity costs the community in Australia $58 billion a year. That is a huge cost to our community in both direct and indirect associated costs. For the Tasmanian economy it is estimated to be $1 billion a year. So obesity leads to higher health costs and is a dead weight on our economy.
The fact is that with two million more Australians having become overweight or obese in the past decade, the obesity epidemic is upon us. If we do nothing, an estimated 6.9 million Australians will be obese by 2025—that is not a record. I hope that in a decade’s time we can look back and say, ‘Yes, we’ve been proactive; yes, we saw that it was a problem and we addressed it,’ in the same way that we can look back at our initiatives to combat tobacco and smoking, where we have got the rates down, and say, ‘Yes, well done. As a community, as a government—across the board—we did have success.’ It is not total success; there is still to work to do in that area. But I hope we can look back and say, ‘Yes, obesity was nominated and identified as a problem and we progressed towards fixing it.’
A lot has been said about the fast-food sector. My call on them now, as it has been over many years, is for them to be part of the solution not part of the problem. I know that moves have been made in the right direction in that regard and I congratulate McDonald’s and others in moving in that right direction. But in terms of the bill before us and the definition of junk food, the bill is simply too strict and too rigid and it is not a bill that I can support in its current form. The AANA, the Australian Association of National Advertisers, have made progress in improving their advertising standards and I know that the Australian Food and Grocery Council are working on reforms amongst their members.
There is certainly a lot more we can do in this area. I would encourage the government to take up the recommendations in the report of the National Preventative Health Taskforce. I know that Professor Rob Moodie was in Parliament House yesterday and that Professor Paul Zimmet is in Parliament House today. Other members of that taskforce put in so much effort and time. For the government to continue to sit on the report and let it get dusty is an absolute national disgrace. They should act on it fast and implement the report’s recommendations, because it is very comprehensive and well thought through.
I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make these points on this bill. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING (BROADCASTING AMENDMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I, also, rise today to contribute to the debate on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010. I have listened to a number of speakers this morning and have to concur that a number of points have been raised which are relevant to this particular issue—and they are good points. They are points that need to be considered in advance. The government is in a position where we recognise that obesity is a serious issue, but at this particular time we are not in a position to support this bill. If we reflect on some of the speakers who have risen this morning, they have made the relevant point, a point that I can relate to—that is, parental responsibility.
I have three children—I would not call them children any longer; all three are of adult age—and I have had to grow up in a society in which my wife and I have had to meet challenges as parents. I think Senator Stephens made the point about walking through the halls of supermarkets with her grandchildren and having to deal with the challenges of lollies and chocolate. I can relate to that. I have met those same challenges. You have to deal with all those variables when you are shopping with children or grandchildren or when you are driving down the road past fast-food outlets, whether it be the golden arches or others. They are the attractions and the challenges that parents need to meet; it is not necessarily about a bill enshrining the issues that associate obesity with the environment we are in. We need to focus on those sorts of challenges as well and look at better ways to equip parents and grandparents—there are all sorts of family make-ups these days—to deal with the issue of obesity
This year on McHappy Day I spent time at McDonald’s at Albany Creek, on the north side of Brisbane—a day that I attend regularly each year now. I must say that I was very encouraged by the number of healthy lifestyle Heart Foundation ticks on their menu and their advertising in the store. There is definitely an attempt being made by fast-food outlets and the food industry as a whole to try and educate people so that they understand the need to eat healthily. That is another positive area; it is an area that needs to be encouraged. I am sure that over time, as we have seen, more and more examples like that will appear in both supermarkets and food outlets.
If you reflect on the times, and I think Senator Barnett made the relevant point, you note lifestyles are changing. People, in particular children, are involved in different lifestyles. I can recall going to school by riding a pushbike and riding the bike home and going out and playing with friends. But these days children seem to be driven either to or from school or, in some cases, they catch the bus. Generally, when they arrive home it is a case of their sitting in front of the computer and being on the internet, on Facebook or other types of programs, and doing their homework as well. So I think these sorts of issues need to be examined and considered.
There has been some discussion around tuckshops and veggie gardens in schools. As a senator for Queensland, I have opened new halls and libraries and other facilities under the Building the Education Revolution program and I have noted on just about all occasions that there have been vegetable gardens, quite successful ones, put into operation by the children in those schools. I think over time such children are adopting a better lifestyle and are certainly being educated at the same time on how to eat better and appropriately. It is the same for tuckshop venues where there has been some significant change in terms of the types of food and drinks provided in them.
Food marketing is but one element. Obesity and this particular problem is a really complex challenge to address. If we look at some of the stats out there, we see something like one in four children is overweight or obese. That really is not acceptable. That is why, in relation to COAG, the government have made investments to tackle this particular health challenge. So far we have made the largest-ever health investment of $872.1 million for prevention over six years. That is a huge investment and demonstration of how committed we are to tackling this particular issue. That includes up to $325.5 million for the Healthy Children initiative to increase physical activity and improve nutrition in settings such as schools and early childhood sites. Up to $366 million is available for programs in the workplace—Healthy Workers, and there is Healthy Communities—that target adults as well. There is $52 million for Australian health surveys to provide valuable information on rates of those overweight, obesity, healthy eating and physical activity. In addition there is $59 million over four years to extend the Measure Up campaign, to increase its research and to target at-risk groups.
I want to focus on one of the initiatives, the national Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program, which received $12.8 million to be established, and up to 190 primary schools will receive grants of up to $60,000 to commit to bringing better lifestyles and healthy eating alternatives into their schools. One of the opportunities I had in opening a BER project in Chevallum, up in the Sunshine Coast hinterland, which is close to Palmwoods, was to witness firsthand the great success of the national Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Program. Part of the money had gone towards a kitchen in the multipurpose hall and I was fortunate enough to taste some of the fruits of their labour, the things the students cooked in that kitchen with the ingredients and things that came from their garden. It was such a pleasure to be there on that day and see the joy and satisfaction on the children’s faces in being able to serve those types of food thanks to the school in an area such as Palmwoods ensuring that their students are living and surviving in a healthy environment. Currently 19 schools in Queensland are actively participating in this great initiative. I will not rattle them all off but they include Cairns, Farnborough, Biggenden, Proston, Rosedale, Benarkin, Jandowae, Kulpi, Lowood, Golden Beach, North Arm, Inglewood, Rockville, Bulimba, Geebung, Wellington Point and Nerang. It really demonstrates the capacity and the volume of those schools in Queensland where they have grasped the opportunity of this program with both hands and are making a difference for the children in those school communities.
One other particular area, and I think Senator Moore might have touched on this in her deliberations on this particular issue, is Indigenous communities. I was fortunate to participate in regional, remote and Indigenous committee hearings throughout Queensland. One of the points I made in those hearings was to do with the concerns about nutrition particularly in the far remote Indigenous communities. One of the issues and challenges we face—and that certainly the people in those environments face—is the cost of getting fresh fruit and fresh vegetables to those locations. It is a near-impossible thing to do properly given the tyranny of distance and the issues associated with flooding and rain in those particular areas. So on some occasions there is always a sizeable issue to be dealt with in getting fresh fruit and fresh vegetables out into some of those locations. Taking that example, it is not just an easy fix to whack a ban on television advertisements to satisfy issues associated with obesity. In 2008 a Senate standing committee also dealt with this issue with an inquiry into a former bill, the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertisement (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2008. At that stage the government did not support it on those grounds.
In conclusion, we do not believe this bill is the right way to address this problem of obesity in children. (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2011-03-03,"—I rise to discuss my proposed amendment to the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010

Researchers from the University of Otago, in Dunedin, studied 1,000 children and adults, aged from three to 26. It was a longitudinal study, from childhood to early adulthood. They found that those who watched television for more than two hours a day had higher levels of obesity, blood cholesterol and tobacco, as well as lower levels of physical fitness when they reached adulthood than kids who watched fewer than two hours of television a day. Why? Part of the reason is that, while kids are watching TV, they are not exercising. The study found that another key factor was that, whilst kids were watching TV, they were constantly being bombarded with ads for drink and foods full of fat and sugar. They take advertising as truth and they do not have the ability to unpack a message to critically analyse why the ad exists and how the advertiser is trying to influence them. There is no doubt that we are facing an obesity crisis in this country and that we are gorging our way to a time when our children, maybe the first generation in a long time, will have shorter life expectancies than those of their parents. Some argue that junk food advertising does not contribute to obesity. I have also listened carefully over the years to the arguments that advertising, especially junk food advertising, is not designed to get children to eat more junk food. To these claims I would simply ask: why advertise then?
Why would these multinational junk food corporations spend billions peddling their unhealthy products if the advertising did not rope in the kids? I support the Australian Greens bill but, in its current form, I feel that it is too broad. The ban times, in my view, are simply too long and do not realistically reflect the demographics of viewers and their viewing habits. I believe the ban should target the times when kids are actually watching TV and, more importantly, watching without parental supervision. That is why I seek to amend the bill to make the junk food advertising operating ban between 6 am and 10 am and between 3.30 pm and 7 pm.
This will protect children without threatening network revenues, to the extent that I fear the proposal will never see the light of day. It is a proposal with a lot of merit. We need to stop these unhealthy messages being sent to our kids. I believe that the amendment that I have circulated is a realistic way to achieve this. But I want to make it clear that I will be supporting the second reading stage of this bill because I believe it has a lot of merit.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING (BROADCASTING AMENDMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I rise to offer some remarks on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010. It is undoubtedly the case that obesity in general is having an increasingly adverse effect not only on the physical and social health of our community but also on our economy and the future productivity of our nation. Childhood obesity is a matter of particular concern to this government. In fact, I have visited schools in my home state of South Australia and have had discussions with many of the teachers in those schools. They also have concerns regarding obesity and the importance of eating healthily and also exercising for our young people.
The government understands that obesity is an issue which, if left unaddressed, could have the capacity to burden our health system, with an explosion of preventable diseases. Disturbingly, Bureau of Statistics survey figures indicate that well over 50 per cent of the adult population is now classified as overweight or obese. Even more alarmingly, one in four Australian children is now considered to be overweight or obese. What does the future hold for these children, these present and potential contributors to our society?
The World Health Organisation reports that obesity is a global epidemic. Certainly, obesity has reached serious epidemic proportions in Australia. According to an Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study report, ‘Physical inactivity and television-viewing time have been shown to be the strongest correlates with measures of obesity.’ I think it would be fair to say that many parents have concerns about the number of hours that young people are actually spending on computer games and other times where they are actually just sitting rather than being involved in activities. So what is the government doing to help alleviate childhood obesity and encourage increased physical activity and healthy eating? The government is continuing its preventative health investment through COAG—a massive investment of more than $872 million over six years.
Other programs include our Healthy Children initiative, with funding of up to $325.5 million, which aims to encourage and increase physical activity and to foster healthy diet in early childhood centres and schools. And of course the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden National Program has been a resounding success, where many schools are benefiting through the program that has been implemented. It encourages children to experience the pleasure of growing their own fresh fruits and vegetables and preparing and eating them. More than $12 million has been allocated to the rollout of this particular program in Australian schools. I have visited many schools which have that program in place and the children are enthusiastic towards growing their own vegetables and, in many cases, developing their own recipes and then cooking them. It would have been great if we had had that program when we were younger.
The government are also acting in tandem with our food and beverage producers and manufacturers, by engaging in the Food and Health Dialogue, increasing the availability of healthy foods and educating consumers about the connection between the choice of food and future health outcomes. The government have taken intelligent, considered steps to reduce the appeal of junk food to children. We have listened to the 2009 Children’s Television Standards review and we have strengthened junk food advertising restrictions by limiting the use of popular characters during children’s programs on TV. We have also toughened the law on misleading or incorrect information on the nutritional value of these foods, so parents can make an informed choice when purchasing these products for their children. I am always pleased when I come across parents who are looking at the contents of the food that they are buying—breakfast cereals, in particular, come to mind—and I do that with respect to my child.
In May last year, the government took heed of the National Preventative Health Taskforce and took real steps to help reduce exposure of children and others to the marketing, promotion and sponsorship of junk food. We have done this by working with industry under the existing framework that governs Australian media content and, as a result, change is now being achieved through a combination of government regulation and industry self-regulation. I am pleased to report that the commercial television industry code of practice now requires that advertisements should not encourage unhealthy eating or drinking habits. The importance of that cannot be underestimated when we are talking about them appealing to children.
Among industry initiatives, seven of the biggest fast-food chains have come up with a voluntary code of conduct and have agreed that marketing must encourage a healthy lifestyle and physical activity and that advertising targeted at children must meet industry sugar, fat and salt limits. In another positive move, the Australian food and beverage industry have developed the Responsible Children’s Marketing Initiative—a voluntary code aimed at giving children healthier options. This code requires that advertisements targeted at children help promote healthier lifestyle and dietary choices. The government will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these industry initiatives. We will watch to see if the codes and standards meet the objectives and whether they can adequately address community concern without a need for further government regulation.
Tackling obesity and childhood health in Australia will, of course, require more than just industry self-regulation. It really does need industry to work with the broader community, including families and individuals. It needs a collaborative effort to create a healthier mindset and to try and encourage children to enjoy these foods in moderation and with a healthy physical lifestyle. That is why the Gillard government launched the Australian National Preventive Health Agency on 1 January this year. The agency is designed to consider any and all initiatives to help monitor the effectiveness of current regulations and initiatives and to also bring together some of the best expertise in Australia to gather and analyse evidence.
I need not remind senators of the disinterest of the previous government in tackling childhood obesity. Former Minister for Health and Ageing Tony Abbott consistently dismissed the idea of any decisive role for the Commonwealth in this area. It is fair to say that the Gillard Labor government have not done that. We are very much interested and concerned and we are addressing the issues that we are facing with our young people today. By contrast to the masterful inactivity of the previous government, Labor are demonstrating our commitment to action, elevating this very serious matter to the front line of our National Preventative Health Strategy. So, while we cannot support the bill at this stage, we can express our appreciation of those who join us in putting childhood obesity front and centre.
It is equally the case that we know that it is individual choice that is the essential element in making responsible decisions when it comes to diet and lifestyle. On the issue of choice, this government feels that parents need to make those decisions for their children, and healthy decisions are the way we really should be going. The government commend the Greens’ commitment to targeting obesity in children. We do support the issue. We think it absolutely is important. We understand the significance of it, but the government do not support this bill. We know that food marketing is just one element of a very complex challenge in addressing obesity in our children. As I have already said, the government will continue its investment through COAG to tackle this critical health challenge. So far we have made the largest ever investment in health prevention through $872.1 million over six years through COAG. This includes up to $325.5 million for the healthy children initiative— (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING (BROADCASTING AMENDMENT) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-03-03,"—in reply—I thank Senator Siewert for her presentation of the reasons why this bill, the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010 should be passing into law today and I thank all members who have contributed to this debate and Senator Xenophon for his flagged amendment. But it is very clear that the bill will not pass the second reading because we have here the classic alternative in this period of nobody dominating the Senate of the government and opposition—the Labor Party and the coalition—combining to have the numbers to block a piece of legislation coming from the crossbench. We will see much more of this. I flagged this very circumstance on George Negus’s program on SBS last night. It is something that some members of the gallery have some difficulty in getting their heads around. I will come back to that in a moment.
This piece of legislation was brought forward by the Greens three years ago. It was then held over to await a taskforce reporting back after the Senate inquiry. The task force effectively endorsed the parameters of this bill. We have extended the time of prohibition for children’s TV junk food ads. I will quote from that task force report which, in turn, quotes the World Health Organisation. It says:
The World Health Organization has recognised that food marketing to children, particularly television advertising, is an important area for action to prevent obesity and has called upon governments to implement policies and strategies that reduce the impact of foods high in fat, sugar and salt and promote the responsible marketing of foods and beverages …
The general tenor of the argument from Senators Moore and Birmingham, and other contributors, was that this is a cultural problem. It reminds me very much of the now Leader of the Opposition saying that the issue of petrol sniffing was a cultural problem and should be a matter left to parents in Central Australia to deal with—and this at a time when it was known that 400 Indigenous children were addicted to petrol. Subsequent to that the national alarm about the permanent damage petrol sniffing caused to those children became so great that it became mandatory to get rid of the injurious petrol and replace it with non-sniffable petrol. Action was taken by the federal government.
We have a similar situation here—we hear it is a matter of parental responsibility; it does not cover the field; there are other things that should be done. But when it comes to a specific and very important contribution based on medical advice on what we should do if we are going to lessen the rate of obesity—which is increasing in our community and which Access Economics estimates is costing the Australian people $58 billion per annum—the government and the opposition say no, we cannot do that because something else needs to be done; it is a cultural problem. I reject that outright.
This is a clear opportunity to put a restriction on junk food advertising. As Senator Siewert made clear, $400 million to $500 million is being spent on advertising each year but more than that is coming back in profits to junk food advertisers. It is kids and parents who have to contend with that. As Senator Siewert said, why would you spend that money if you were not getting a dividend from it? We know from repeated reports in the Age and other newspapers that the junk food purveyors serially breach so-called commitments to not push their junk food to children during children’s TV hours. But, still, we have this ennui, this inability of government and opposition, the big parties, to act. There is a degree of fear of taking on the all-powerful advertising industry and associated food industries. So be it.
This is a good piece of legislation and it ought to pass the parliament, yet we have this decision by Labor, the Liberals and the National Party to reject the advice of the experts to support the legislation. It would have brought us somewhat into line with Norway, Quebec, the UK and other places which have banned exposing children to such advertising. It will come back to be revisited down the line, when more damage will have been done because of the failure to act now. The Greens will continue to advocate legislative action in this area, because it is the right thing to do. We are proud of this legislation and will continue to foster it in the public arena, where the polls show us that more than 80 per cent of people—in fact some polls show 90 per cent—want this form of legislation. But, of course, we are not going to see that support reflected here today.
This is time for private senators’ legislation, and we are engaged in a very healthy parliamentary process here. I want to comment on an article in today’s Daily Telegraph which talks about the territories legislation which I brought before the Senate and which it was agreed by the Senate yesterday would go to a committee. Simon Benson and Steve Lewis have commented in the Daily Telegraph in a way that misrepresents—with some deliberateness I would think, because they did not speak with me about it—the process of this parliament and Senate deliberation. I would ask the President to look at that misrepresentation and the matters I now draw to the Senate’s attention. The article says:
... the Greens claimed to have Government backing for a Bill to pave the way for gay marriage and legal euthanasia.
I would ask the President to see whether any such claim was made. What we do know is that an AAP report issued at 12.56 pm on 1 March publicly announced:
Labor will back the Australian Greens’ push to restore the rights of territory governments to legislate on such issues as voluntary euthanasia.
That report was wrong, because the legislation would not do that. The Daily Telegraph report says:
The Greens had ambushed the Government by quietly introducing amendments to its own private member’s Bill late on Tuesday night.
Those amendments were circulated on Friday night. I ask the President to look at that matter.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Brown, we are actually dealing with the protecting children from junk food advertising bill.
—Yes, but we are in private members’ time and I am wanting to ensure that bills, whatever they might be, are properly dealt with in the public arena so that the public is not misled about this parliament and its proper processes.
—The question before the chair is that the second reading be put on this bill. I remind you of that.
—Thank you. The Telegraph says that these amendments were quietly introduced on Tuesday night, but they were introduced on Friday night and circulated. A press release went out on 1 March headed ‘Brown welcomes government support for Greens push to grant territories power’. That press release announced exactly what we were doing—there was no ‘quietly’ about it. I do not know why Benson and Lewis were asleep when these reports went out. What did go out on Tuesday night was an explanatory piece of information which went to every member of the Senate. The article goes on:
The amendment made the Bill far more radical and turned a “machinery” bill into one that would pave the way for the territories to allow legal euthanasia and gay marriage ...
That is quite wrong. The amendment did nothing of the sort; it simply extended to the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island the same provisions that applied with the ACT. It did not alter or make more radical in any way the legislation that was before the Senate.
This is a very important piece of the political process. We cannot expect to have an honest public discourse if we have journalists who deliberately deceive the public about processes which are on the record, which are honestly put, by transmogrifying or misrepresenting those processes. The amendment did not turn a machinery bill into one that would do something else; it did nothing of the sort. I do not expect that the Murdoch press would have the honesty or the probity—with their readers, let alone with themselves—to correct this matter, although I will ask them to do so.
The story says that the bill would limit the Commonwealth’s ability to overturn territory legislation. It does nothing of the sort. It cannot do that. Section 122 of the Constitution provides for that. So it does not limit the Commonwealth’s ability. It certainly took away the executive’s ability, but the Commonwealth is this parliament. Mr Benson and Mr Lewis, who are bottom feeders when it comes to reporting the political process, should lift their game if they are going to be seen historically as fair players in letting the public of Australia know, in fact, what is happening in this parliamentary process.
Of course, behind this, in the reporting of the Senate by these particular reporters, is a political motive, which is to attack the government and the compact made between the government and certain Independents and the Greens. But the only compact I entered into in the last 24 hours was one with the opposition. I spoke to Senator Brandis about this yesterday. That was to agree to allow the committee—which the opposition had, three years ago, not wanted to take place—to look at this legislation. I have not seen this compact between the Greens and Senator Brandis and the coalition turned into news by the Murdoch press, because it has a very clear political intent, which should be kept to its editorial columns but which is written up in this most mischievous and unfair-to-the-public report in today’s paper.
I thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for allowing me to make those comments and I finally come back to the innovation we have today, which is private senators’ time here in the parliament. The Greens have worked very hard to achieve this outcome. It was first used by Senator Nash in this house in the last week of sitting. There is much more private senators’ legislation coming through here. As Ralph Nader—indeed, it goes back to Jefferson—commented, ‘Information is the currency of democracy.’ But there is a responsibility for those people who express as much ignorance as Benson and Lewis did today to catch up with the people’s vote in this great country of ours and the new arrangement that allows all parties to take part in legislating in the parliament, in fact for the first time in a century.
We are doing no more or less than happens in New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, Germany or Ireland. The feedback I get is that people like it. The Murdoch press may not like it but the people do. The feedback is very positive indeed. I am very proud to be part of that and very happy today to be putting forward this legislation to protect children from junk food advertising, even if it is not going to proceed. I accept that that is the way the democratic parliament of Australia, one of the four oldest continuous democracies in the world, proceeds. I thank all senators for their contribution to this debate and I commend this bill to the second reading.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I rise to make some comments on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. Again, I say that it is really important that this issue, which has been on the agenda for a considerable period of time, is given the opportunity for open discussion in this place. I am not quite sure whether Senator Bob Brown will be speaking as fulsomely on this bill as on the previous bill, but nonetheless the principle of having the opportunity for us to have the discussion must be supported and must be, in many ways, rewarded.
As with the previous bill, this bill was actually given the opportunity to be discussed by a Senate committee in 2009. At that time the Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee did have a series of public hearings around the process. The interest of the public in the area was evidenced by the number of people who provided submissions and who actually came up for the public hearings. There continues to be an issue in that there needs to be awareness of the issue to which the bill relates. As I said in relation to the previous bill, there must be full engagement of all those people who are stakeholders in the process—and, in the end, through a cooperative arrangement, with an understanding that the end result must be to the benefit of all Australians, we will be able to reach an outcome.
In that sense, I think the legislation we have in front of us actually cuts through, to an extent, and cuts off the kind of involvement that we are seeing taking place in industry and also across the states—because the issues around this bill actually need the full engagement of all state governments, and the ministers at that level, to commit to having a process that will work, that will be effectively costed and that will come up with an arrangement in which people can have confidence and through which the knowledge and the clarity of the process can be shared.
The bill seeks to establish a government run—and, in this sense, a Commonwealth government run—container deposit scheme that will collect a deposit from importers and producers of beverage containers under four litres. I do not actually have the product in front of me, Mr Acting Deputy President, to show you what up to a four-litre container means, but people in the area know, because they are the ones who are making the purchases on a regular basis.
The bill provides for a full refund to a consumer when containers are returned to the collection point. The actual amount of the environmental deposit could be varied by regulation, so it follows the standard process in this chamber. As we see regularly in Commonwealth legislation, it will start at a certain amount and can then be increased by regulation through the parliamentary process.
According to the bill we have, the scheme will be implemented and run by a Commonwealth department. I do not think Senator Ludlam has actually created a name for the new Commonwealth department, but the process would be run by a Commonwealth department.
—You can give it a name!
—We might be able to have some kind of contest, Senator Birmingham—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—to develop an effective name for a new Commonwealth department. The department’s functions would include—and these are the preliminary functions as set out in the bill—collecting the container deposit, authorising premises as collection depots and transfer stations and providing grants or other financial incentives to encourage the use of recyclable and reusable containers. The bill goes on to say that the department could fund and support the creation of markets for collected beverage containers and materials, provide financial support for kerbside recycling services, help to offset the collection industry’s costs under the scheme—and that was an issue under discussion at the environment committee’s hearings—and fund product development into the future.
The scheme proposed by this bill is far broader than the current container deposit schemes that are currently in place in a number of states as we speak. We know about the South Australian scheme, because it has been much lauded and talked about in many public meetings that I have attended. A container deposit scheme has been in place in South Australia since the 1970s. I am sure that Senator Birmingham can tell us exactly how it came into being and how it is working. It is a matter of fact that when people talk about this issue they regularly refer to that which is operating in South Australia. The Northern Territory parliament recently passed legislation for a similar scheme to be introduced there.
The scheme that is in this bill, though, is not the same as that which we see working in South Australia and hopefully in the NT. The scheme in South Australia and the one to be introduced in the Northern Territory are based on an industry run arrangement. Industry are fully engaged and are organising, running and owning the scheme. The bill before us would introduce a different mechanism over the top of these two existing arrangements, which would increase the regulatory complexity and possibly the potential cost to industry and the community.
It is not absolutely clear in the bill or from discussions that have taken place how exactly the scheme presented by this bill would be funded. This is an important point when considering a piece of legislation that would if passed immediately create responsibilities for government. How this would be funded and the budgetary implications are not clearly spelt out. In fact, as we have heard, the bill proposes the creation of a new entity that would have particular functions and would need—as we always say in this place—to be effectively resourced so that whatever the purpose of that organisation is they would be able to confidentially commit to completing the task before them.
It is suggested in the bill that the proposed scheme be funded from unclaimed deposits and revenue from recovered resources. Under the bill, the deposit is returned in full. The bill does not provide any funding for the operation of the scheme, including administrative infrastructure for the collection and refund of the deposit and capital investment in collection, transport and recycling infrastructure. As we know, the infrastructure basis of any legislation is critical to its effectiveness. Consistently in Senate estimates, when we talk about the implications of and activities under legislation already in place, we have ongoing discussions about whether the infrastructure resources have been effectively planned and implemented. Key to any effective system at a national level must be an understanding of the funding implications and the infrastructure needs, particularly when we have quite specific duties spelt out in a bill. One of they key aspects of this is that it is not clear if any shortfall between the income that is generated by the scheme in the bill and what needs to be expended should be covered by the Commonwealth. That is something that any government would be concerned about looking to the future.
The Environmental Protection and Heritage Council, the EPHC, has been as we know investigating national options for addressing package waste and litter formally since 2008. It initiated a regulation impact statement in July 2010 to assess a number of options, including the national container deposit scheme. Because of the complexity of the task, we need to ensure that there is effective consideration given to a range of options. One size will not fit all. It rarely does for any issue, but that is particularly true for the ever present and growing issue of waste and recycling issue and how our community will respond. It is most important that we look at a range of operations and that variations in area and need are reflected in the government response.
As I said, the Senate inquiry into this bill when it was introduced in 2008 found that there was insufficient information to assess whether a national container deposit scheme would increase recycling and decrease litter at the least cost to the community. That is a core point and one which is part of consideration through the regulation impact statement. The need is clear and agreed. Public interest is clear and agreed. The effective response must be carefully considered, planned and implemented. The bill we have before us is but one option out of a range. That is not to say that there should not be consideration given to Senator Ludlam’s bill. But my belief is that we need to look very carefully at the regulation impact statement that is being developed and be aware of the ongoing evolution of knowledge and awareness about this issue.
This is not an issue that is peculiar to Australia. The fight to ensure that human beings do not further damage the planet through their waste is very important and the subject of much discussion internationally. Part of the role of the EPHC is to ensure that that knowledge is assessed and reflected in the Australian environment so that we can get the best result.
The government’s product stewardship bill—currently under development, I trust—will enable the establishment of national product stewardship schemes, including schemes addressing packaging, such as container deposit schemes. The Environment Protection and Heritage Council have agreed to undertake a consultation regulatory impact statement on the options. There has been agreement from the EPHC to consider a range of options in the regulatory impact statement, one of which will be the kind of process that is before us in this bill. Only then will we be able to ensure that the issues have been effectively responded to by the government. I have spoken about the cost, and that is one thing that needs to be taken into account when we are looking at any changes.
I certainly think we can, through the debate we are having now, focus in even more on the issues and ensure that people have the clearest understanding of the shared concerns. As I said earlier this morning in relation to another bill, no-one can self-select out of this debate. It impacts on all of us. If we are going to maintain our environment and maintain our community health we need to effectively find, through all levels of government—engaging with the states in particular, through COAG—ways of ensuring that we have a scheme that is owned by the community, that is effectively resourced by government and that will make a difference to what we do on a daily basis.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (BEVERAGE CONTAINER DEPOSIT AND RECOVERY SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-03-03,"—It is a pleasure to rise to contribute to this debate on the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010. I thank the Greens for bringing this bill forward and ensuring continued discussion on this important topic. As a South Australian Senator, which Senator Moore alluded to, I have grown up with container deposit schemes. They are part of day-to-day life in South Australia and have been in place since 1977. Many, many people in South Australia, including Senator Hanson-Young, have grown up with such schemes and in many cases have known nothing other than the container deposit scheme.
But it is important when we consider this legislation that we remember the genesis of that scheme—what brought it about—and how things have changed and moved on since 1977. Indeed, at the time the scheme was introduced it was very much an anti-litter provision. It was a littering initiative and it was designed to ensure that we reduced the amount of roadside waste and rubbish from beverage containers. Yes, it had recycling principles underpinning it, but recycling was not at that stage the primary objective of the scheme. Over the years, the recycling principles and benefits have in some ways come to provide a more significant benefit than perhaps the anti-littering principles do in the South Australian scheme. It is certainly a scheme that operates to the benefit of both of those areas.
Since 1977 we have seen, in South Australia and in all states and territories, a great surge in recycling activity. No longer do we require householders to take their waste to a depot to have it recycled. Householders in metropolitan areas in every state of the country can recycle simply by sorting their containers at home and putting them out on the kerbside. Thankfully, that is what most people do. Local government has done a very good job in promoting and developing kerbside recycling initiatives that have in many ways reduced the recycling benefit of initiatives such as container deposit legislation.
That said, the recycling industry still faces some real challenges, in particular the away-from-home recyclables—those resulting from things consumed in the workplace, in public places and in other areas where people consume food, beverages and a whole variety of other goods, but especially in workplace situations. It is in those places where recycling rates are far lower than they have been in households, and it is in those places that we need to see some focus on change and changed behaviour.
Container deposit legislation, as introduced in South Australia and applied there, has had some benefit on the littering front and therefore on public places and roadsides. As I said, that that was its initial intention, and it certainly has provided some opportunities to reduce the littering in those community areas and spaces. Again, we have seen local and state governments really up the effort in public spaces to provide for recycling of recyclable materials. We are now seeing an increasing effort in many public places to enable, as you do at home, the separation of those recyclable materials that are the focus of this bill.
In the workplace, much more remains to be done. I do not see particular efforts of container legislation having any real impact in workplaces in most instances. As I see it, container deposit legislation has not changed many workplace practices. Indeed, although workplace recycling has perhaps made some steps in the area of paper recycling, it has to make many greater steps in areas from industrial waste in industrial workplaces right through to consumable waste in office workplaces and the like.
This is where we need a comprehensive approach to recycling and product stewardship. Senator Moore certainly highlighted the need for such a comprehensive approach. Getting a better approach to product stewardship has been talked about for some years. In the electronics area we see huge challenges of what to do with electronic waste and how to make sure that that waste is actually recycled—the roles and responsibilities of the manufacturers, the importers, the wholesalers and the retailers in line with the householders, the businesses and the consumers. These are the issues to be decided. Who pays is always a very significant issue.
But, again, in electronic waste we have seen some progress—not enough, but certainly some. I hope the work of the Environment Protection and Heritage Council can bring some more progress over the next few years than it has over the past few. I know it was a commitment of the Labor government prior to the 2007 election to take issues of container deposit to the Environment Protection and Heritage Council and to try to get them resolved at that council. Unfortunately, the government failed to satisfactorily progress these issues at that ministerial forum. I think it is important that if we are to take steps forward they are done in unison with the states for a national approach in all of these areas of product stewardship and waste management.
I note that there have been moves and steps, some of which Senator Moore alluded to, in other states and territories than South Australia, and the Northern Territory parliament is currently debating a container deposit legislation scheme. There are discussions in other states, and indeed I see news reports today of the New South Wales coalition being open-minded to the adoption of such a scheme, but again highlighting that if it is to be adopted, especially in a state like New South Wales with its close borders to the ACT and Queensland and the significant flow of people across those borders, it needs to have some decent national management protocols in place. So there is every reason to be hopeful that these issues can be constructively and productively discussed and addressed at these ministerial fora.
Equally we should not overlook the fact that these schemes come with costs, and those costs are passed through. That is why I highlighted the significant change that has taken place in South Australia. The reality is that in every other state and territory household recycling rates, and therefore the recycling rates of beverage containers, have increased dramatically over the years, without the need for a container deposit scheme such as this bill proposes. So we need to be confident that, if this is to be implemented in other states or if it is to be implemented at a national level, it is going to provide some level of net benefit.
In noting the work that has been done already by the ministerial council there are questions as to whether the net benefit is actually there. The ministerial council commissioned some research and it was provided in May 2009. It is highlighted in the committee report into this proposed bill. That report, prepared by consultants BDA Group and Wright Corporate Strategy, has attempted to quantify the costs and the benefits of introducing a scheme of this nature. In its quantification of these costs and benefits it has reported a total national annual net economic cost to government, industry and the broader community when it takes into account all of the compliance and administrative cost, some of which Senator Moore mentioned, and highlighted some of the questions as to exactly how the proposal in this bill would work. The BDA report estimates those costs to be around $492 million per annum in net terms. Overall it sees economic costs of $763 million versus economic benefits of $294 million. Those costs stretch from the administrative costs of operating a scheme like this through to the costs for the packaging industry and others involved in its implementation.
On the other side of the ledger, the benefits do relate to the fact that you will get some level of further increase in recycling rates, but it is a case at the margins whether that level is going to offset the costs involved. It is important to understand that there are consumer costs at play here as well. Broadly speaking, the South Australian scheme that has operated since 1977 is subsidised by consumers across the rest of the country. The national producers of goods which sell within South Australia in that scheme tend not to vary their prices for South Australia and tend not to pass through the increased container deposit to consumers in South Australia. They actually absorb them at a national level but South Australians enjoy the opportunity to reclaim that deposit. That is a nice situation for consumers in my home state but a national scheme would, of course, remove that cross-subsidisation that occurs at present. In removing that cross-subsidisation it would mean that all consumers would end up paying more for these goods. Yes, they are deposits, yes, consumers get them back, but there are other economic costs built into the way it operates, costs that manufacturers will pass through in the pricing structure and costs that consumers will have to pay. So these are things that we need to bear in mind in debate about the costs and benefits of a scheme such as this one.
I am sympathetic to the objects the Greens have in presenting this bill. I do believe that so far as possible we should be seeking to ensure that all recyclable goods are recycled. We should be ensuring we have the right strategies in place. I am willing to consider with an open mind the best discussions that can be had around container deposit legislation. But it does appear at present on the evidence that the costs of implementing such a scheme nationally, given the extent to which the recycling industry has moved and motivated itself and developed over the last few years, may well outweigh the benefits of such a scheme. We need to be clear that there will be distinct benefits if we are going to go through the cost and the time of implementing something along those lines. We need to ensure that all the states and territories are willing to sign up to it. We need to ensure that local government, which has a very significant role in the way recycling works in this country, is on board and sees benefits in this. There are concerns from local government and from recyclers generally that a container deposit scheme incentivises households to take the beverage containers out of the waste stream and return them to get the deposit back. In particular with aluminium products that has a real impact because some of those are the most profitable products that go through the waste stream and that provide a return to those councils and to those recyclers to make kerbside collection viable.
These are factors that will need to be considered. I know full well that in my childhood growing up, in the shed out the back there was a hessian bag and in the hessian bag all the cans and bottles would go. I am sure Senator McEwen’s children have done the same over the years. Indeed, it is a great source of pocket money for children growing up in South Australia.
—I am jealous.
—Senator Ludwig is jealous. The government could do with all the extra pocket money it can get as well, Senator Ludwig. Whilst it is great for young people and it is a great incentive, what happens is that those cans and those bottles do not go into the kerbside collection. When they do not go into the kerbside collection there is a cost there in terms of the operation of that kerbside collection and there is a duplication of resources as well. Let us not forget that if we are incentivising people to be making separate drop-offs of recyclable goods, rather than going through the one kerbside collection scheme, there are other flow-on costs to having people divert their activities and their resources to do that when there is a far more efficient mechanism at work. All of these factors will have been considered in the BDA report. It is why it shows there is a net economic cost to this proposal and it is why it needs to be treated with due caution.
But I do encourage the Greens and welcome the fact that on this they are ensuring the discussion continues. They are holding the government to account in this area. As I said, it was a 2007 election promise of the government to look at a scheme like this. We are now in 2011, but we have not seen much progress. We have seen some of the modelling which I have referenced. We will now see a newly structured ministerial council, some of the members of which have indicated their openness and willingness to look at these issues. I hope we can address these issues. If this is not the way to go forward, I hope we can see the ministerial council outline alternative strategies for how we actually get the right product stewardship in place for all products of recyclable standard, including beverage containers. I hope we see the ministerial council progress that with industry to a point where we have appropriate standards and, importantly, we can ensure that we get the same types of recycling returns outside of residential households that we have managed to develop as a country inside residential households. The growth in residential recycling is something of which all Australians should be proud. Let us strive to get recycling done better throughout the rest of the community. I am not convinced as yet that this legislation is the way to do that, but we certainly look forward to seeing more discussion, more analysis and, importantly, more action in the next year or two to ensure that all of those areas that have potential are addressed and fixed.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (BEVERAGE CONTAINER DEPOSIT AND RECOVERY SCHEME) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2011-03-03,"—I rise today to speak in favour of the Environment Protection (Beverage Container Deposit and Recovery Scheme) Bill 2010 put forward by Senator Ludlam on behalf of the Greens. I thank the government and the opposition for their contributions. Of course, everyone thinks this is a great idea. This is a wonderful idea. Why wouldn’t we want to put in place a scheme that would allow us to recycle things that are recyclable? In South Australia we have had a successful scheme in place for 30 years. I say this as a South Australian senator. Senator Birmingham spoke about the positive contribution that this scheme has made by ensuring that South Australia has a lower litter rate than it otherwise would and the positive contribution that this type of scheme makes to the community. I remember being woken up several times over the years early on a Saturday morning by kids knocking on the door asking if we had any cans or bottles that they could cash in to put the money towards their community organisation. There are a variety of different reasons why this scheme is positive. It is positive for the environment and for the community. A government which shows some leadership and makes this happen will show that it takes a long-term and responsible view of the types of products that are out there being consumed.
In the time it took Senator Birmingham to give his speech, 62½ thousand beverage containers were thrown out. Over one year, nine million recyclable containers are put into landfill or simply thrown away as litter. The scheme as proposed under this piece of legislation would ensure that we deal with that litter. The scheme would also include a revenue-positive aspect, producing $90 million annually in surplus which could go directly into community based organisations to promote the necessity of preserving our environment, keeping our communities clean and ensuring that things are not simply thrown onto the kerb.
Both the government and the opposition spoke about this being a great idea. We need to move on this. We need to do things. Yes, it was a promise from the government back in 2007, but what have we seen happen since then? Not much. We have seen the South Australian scheme continuing along very well. We have seen the Northern Territory adopt a similar scheme. I must congratulate the Northern Territory government for having a mature, bipartisan approach and ensuring that legislation similar to that in South Australia is now being initiated in the Northern Territory. That is a wonderful thing to see. But at the federal level, despite the promises from the government in 2007, we have seen very, very little action. ‘We sent it off to COAG and we’re now sending it off to a ministerial council.’ We all know that, if there is one issue that you know you need to talk about but you do not really want to act on, you send it off to COAG, otherwise known as the black hole of government bureaucracy.
Let us face it: if we think this is a good idea, we need to get on and do it. Thankfully there are states that are seriously considering the need to take further action and to move on this. But really this is something on which we should be seeing some leadership from our federal government. This bill puts on the table the opportunity for all sides of parliament to say: ‘You know what? This should not be a very controversial issue.’ This is about recycling cans and bottles. It is about ensuring that we clean up Australia not just once a year but every day. It is about ensuring that there is a process by which people can easily participate, whether they live in South Australia, the Northern Territory, the ACT, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, WA or Tasmania. It is about ensuring that, as a country, we believe that picking up after ourselves and making it easy for people to do that is not that bad an idea—as both the government and the opposition agree. It is just too hard to get there, it seems.
We really need to see some leadership at a federal level. A lot of effort is put into programs like Clean Up Australia Day. When we look at the statistics of the types of things that are collected just on that one day, beverage containers make up the overwhelming bulk. Sixty per cent of glass items, 47 per cent of metal items and 33 per cent of plastic items are beverage containers.
I would like this parliament to seriously consider this; it should not be a hard issue. This legislation puts in place a revenue-positive scheme. Ninety million dollars annually would be collected through this scheme that could be put directly back into our local communities. We would be engaging with the public. We would be engaging with local governments. We would be engaging with community groups. We would be working with the states. And we would be showing under that leadership umbrella of the federal government that, yes, we care about what Australia looks like, we care about our environment and we care about taking responsibility for the things that are left behind. That is exactly what this legislation is about. Everyone wants to talk about it; let us get on and do it with a revenue-positive scheme such as that outlined in Senator Ludlam’s bill on behalf of the Greens. What a good way forward. Let us not see the excuses of things just going off to the black hole of COAG; let us actually take some leadership and get something done.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2011-03-03,"—I support the bill.
 (Senator Hutchins)—Order! The time for the debate has expired. Yes, Senator Xenophon?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the second reading debate in Hansard. I thought I was going to have a chance to deliver it. It is a very short speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
For decades we’ve been espousing the importance of recycling and this Bill introduces measures which encourage this.
Container deposit legislation has numerous benefits.
It encourages recycling, it reduces litter, it provides economic incentive to clean it up and it provides income to individuals and organisations who collect bottles and cans.
In 1975, South Australia passed container deposit legislation and, in 2003, amended the legislation to expand the scheme to capture an even broader range of beverage containers.
This scheme is working effectively.
It has a recovery rate of over 80 percent of containers, with 1.5 tonnes per person recycled per year.
Last year, the Northern Territory Government announced plans to implement its own scheme by the end of 2011, similar to that in operation in South Australia, and it’s time for the rest of the States and Territories to follow suit.
This legislation is a national scheme that all States and Territories can sign up to, where a 10 cent deposit would apply to the sale of each eligible beverage container, with the deposit paid to the department.
Upon ‘return’ to an authorised collection depots or transfer stations, the recycler would receive 10cents and the Department overseeing the scheme would refund the money to them.
And any unclaimed deposits or funds would be retained by the Department and used to invest in infrastructure for the scheme.
On all accounts, this is a good proposal.
This Bill will reduce litter and waste and the amount that goes into landfill, it provides economic incentives and it’s proven to work not just in South Australia but in countries around the world.

SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITTEE


Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill:

Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Dividend and Other Measures Bill 2011)

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

There is nothing in this Schedule of the Bill that requires urgent passage. This is unlike the situation regarding its predecessor, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010, which during its final passage in the Senate on 24 June 2010 required to be passed for the Mildura / Sunraysia analog switch-off to go ahead just 6 days later on 30 June 2010.

Schedule 1 of this Bill is likely to represent the only time for Parliamentary scrutiny of the principles guiding the most important spectrum allocation for broadcasting for decades. The guidelines to ACMA governing the process of this reallocation and subsequent sale of freed up spectrum were withdrawn from the previous Bill on Opposition pressure on 24 June. The Government’s reaction to this was to ‘house’ the vital policy objectives for the Digital Dividend in a Directions Instrument to ACMA not subject to any Parliamentary scrutiny. Schedule 1 of this Bill represents the last opportunity for such important guidelines, which will dominate broadcasting for the foreseeable future and quite possibly fixed wireless aspects of the NBN, to be considered and, if necessary, have them altered and enshrined in legislation (rather than housed in a Ministerial ACMA Direction) for the public good.

Schedule 2 - In essence, the provisions in this section of the bill deserve further scrutiny as they raise significant issues on the future balance of terrestrial versus satellite services for regional viewers. A Senate Committee provides a unique opportunity for the parliament to scrutinise more broadly the progress on digital switchover to date as well as consumer safeguards for digital switchover in regional Queensland and beyond.

Proposal to refer a bill to a committee


Name of bill:

Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011
Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood and Cyclone Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011

Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

These Bills requires a quick reporting date as it is crucial that it be passed asap to provide certainty to taxpayers and allow adequate time for software providers, businesses, employers and the ATO to prepare their systems for the new financial year.
While the legislation does not commence until 1 July 2011, the ATO, employers and their software providers need to have certainty ahead of time to get systems in place, such as new withholding schedules and updated software. Delaying passage could mean these systems are not in place for the commencement of the levy. Taxpayers also need to have this certainty.
All of the affected parts of the community will have to come to terms with the workings of the levy, adjust their payroll systems (in the case of employers, many of whom will rely on payroll software providers), and understand whether they may qualify for an exemption (for flood affected taxpayers) before 1 July 2011.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-03-03,"—The purpose of the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2010 is to correct technical errors caused by drafting and clerical mistakes and to remove references to specific ministers and departments which would require amendments to legislation following changes to the Administrative Arrangements Order. At present when the names of departments and ministerial titles change or when responsibility for legislation is transferred between ministers and departments, substituted reference orders must be made under sections 19B and 19BA of the Acts Interpretation Act. This then requires relevant legislation to be read in conjunction with the orders. The amendments will replace the specific legislative references with generic ones. This will make Commonwealth legislation easier to use. The bill also makes amendments to ensure consistency of language and to correct technical errors. A number of obsolete acts, contained in schedule 3 of the bill, are repealed. They are principally acts for the payment of state grants for rural adjustment arrangements which are no longer payable, those schemes having expired.
There is also a reference to correct a clerical error in the Water Act. The current word used in the Water Act is ‘meditation’. The amendment substitutes for the word ‘meditation’ the word ‘mediation’, which was the evident intent of the draftsman.
—Om.
—What did you say, Senator Fifield?
—Om.
—The interpretation of the Water Act has of course been the subject of some controversy recently. Until now, I was not aware that a dispute arising under that act could become transcendental—or perhaps that is indeed what has been happening!

The bells started ringing in the course of a welcome to country in which there were loud didgeridoo noises and most people were unable to hear the bells. When some of my colleagues with better eyesight than mine noticed the red light, a number of us turned and ran out during the course of the welcome to country by Australia’s Indigenous people—not a good look for those who were in there. I know nothing can interrupt the workings of the Senate and this is what we are here for, but when there are official dinners on could I suggest to those in charge of voting that perhaps voting should be done at time when—
An honourable senator interjecting—
—The point I am making is that there was a welcome to country by Australia’s Indigenous people with loud didgeridoo music which, quite frankly, cut out all other noise, including the bells ringing and including the beepers ringing. It is not a good look when two or three people turn and run out of the hall during a welcome to country ceremony. I know the business of the Senate cannot be interrupted for dinners and social occasions, even though it was an official dinner called by the Prime Minister of this country, but I just suggest that when these things happen perhaps closer consideration might be given to when the divisions are called. Perhaps they could be delayed until some later time.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-03-03,"—The amendments that we have circulated have the effect of providing a slight broadening of the definition of ‘journalist’ and what it actually means. I will take the chamber through this in a little bit of detail, because I think it is quite important. At the moment we have some definitions in schedule 1 of the bill which provide that ‘journalist’ means a person ‘who is engaged and active in the publication of news in the normal course of that person’s work’. The reason I am raising this issue is that we have some concerns at the moment that the bill is effectively drafted for a 20th century interpretation of who qualifies as a journalist, that it is intended to apply—probably quite correctly, in the original sense—to people working for regular media organisations in the distribution of news, whether it be a newspaper or electronic media. I think this goes back to the original definition of ‘journalist’ as someone who might be a member of the MEAA, or who has signed up to the Journalists Code of Conduct—or whatever definition of journalism you might wish to adopt.
One of our amendments proposes to delete the words ‘in the normal course of that person’s work’. That just means that, if you are engaged and active in the publication of news then you might have put yourself in a position where an informant would have contacted you and expected the kind of protections that this bill seeks to provide, and as far as I am concerned it should not matter whether you work for the Age or for the ABC, whether it is a piece that you put on Crikey, or whether it is a piece that you have even put up on your own blog, for that matter. What we are trying to do here is make sure that it does not matter who you work for, or whether you were paid; if it is an act of journalism you should be offered the protection of the court and it should be up to the court to decide, not necessarily whether the protection applies but whether it is in the public interest that the disclosure should occur or not. We are not seeking to simply apply blanket protection to anybody who adds a comment to Facebook.
I understand I have government support for these amendments, negotiated towards the end of last year after a little bit of back and forth. I would very clearly like to put on the record that we are not seeking to have any comment or any piece of work that might be put out in the name of journalism protected by this power. What we are very strongly seeking to do, though, is make sure that the door to the court is not closed in the first instance—based on, for example, an interpretation such that, if you were not paid for that work, should you and your source be offered the protection that this bill seeks to provide. That is effectively the important distinction that we are seeking to draw here. If the court decides that it is in the public interest that your source be protected then it should not depend on whether you were paid or not.
At the very last minute the government has introduced a certain amount of ambiguity into the precise nature of their support for the amendments that we have circulated, so what I might do at this stage is give the minister an opportunity to clarify that ambiguity. I was told, just for the record, that the government was satisfied with the form of words that we had ended up with late last year. I confirmed that with the Attorney’s office earlier this week. If there has been some confusion, or if the amendments did not turn out quite the way the government was anticipating, then obviously we will negotiate right here on the floor of the chamber, which would be very interesting. But I first seek some clarification from the minister as to exactly what the government proposes to do with the Greens amendments when I move them.
—Before we go to the minister, Senator Ludlam: do you seek leave to have all three amendments put at once?
—I do not think I should do that until I have heard from the minister.
—Okay. Senator Ludwig?",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2011-03-03,"—To make it easier, you could put amendment (1) separately and amendments (2) and (3) could be dealt with together. The government does not accept (1). It recognises that (2) and (3) are worthwhile amendments and can be accepted. I will go through the detailed reasons for that—it will not take long.
The bill was always intended to ensure adequate protection for journalists and their sources. The amendments clarify these protections and therefore the government supports them. They fit within the objectives of the bill and are consistent with the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1995. The definitions in the bill are modelled on the New Zealand journalist shield provisions. The definitions of ‘journalist’, ‘informer’ and ‘news media’ rely on their ordinary meaning to allow the court to take a case by case approach. These amendments address concerns expressed as to whether the New Zealand definitions are technology neutral and cover all of those engaged and active in the publication of news. I hope that that assists.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Brandis, Sen George (Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)",LP,2011-03-03,"—The opposition does not support any of the three proposed amendments. I note what Senator Ludwig has said in relation to amendment (1). I will deal with amendments (2) and (3). In particular, I express the concern that by broadening the definition of ‘journalist’ and the activities that are captured by the bill by removing ‘in the course of that person’s work’ and substituting ‘is engaged and active in the publication of news’ the bill expands it reach beyond that which a journalist does. In the opposition’s view it is appropriate and desirable to protect journalists, as the title of the bill indicates. ‘Anyone engaged or active in the publication of news’ could mean any person who, for example, publishes material on the internet or contributes to a blog—any citizen who by any medium publishes something that might be considered to be newsworthy.
Our concern is reinforced by amendment (3), which substitutes for the words ‘a medium’—’news medium’ being a defined term in the bill—the words ‘any medium’. If these amendments from the Australian Greens were to be adopted, the whole purpose of this bill would be expanded massively beyond its original conception, which is to protect journalists’ sources in defined circumstances. It would not merely protect journalists and it would not merely protect news media; it would be carte blanche to anyone who wanted to publish anything anywhere that might be considered to be news.
I ask honourable senators to pause to reflect on what that would mean, for example, for the operation of the law of defamation. There is a case, and it is a case that I on behalf of the opposition made for several years before either the government or indeed the Greens interested themselves in this matter, for protecting journalists’ sources in the derivation and subsequent publication of news. If you break the nexus between the privilege and the work of a journalist, what you have is a blanket protection, albeit subject to rebuttable presumptions, of anyone publishing anything anywhere that might be considered to be news. That is not the purpose which this legislation ought to be serving. It is certainly not the purpose in the opposition’s alternative legislation, which we seek to serve. We seek to protect the work of journalists as a profession in the course of their ordinary work, which is the language of the bill in its existing form. We acknowledge that the protection of sources is in appropriate circumstances an appropriate aspect of that protection of the work of journalists. But adopt these amendments, and particularly amendment (2), and it ceases to be legislation that protects journalists at all. It creates a free-for-all in the publication of anything, with no limitations at all. It would extend a protection meant to facilitate the work of journalists to anyone engaged in whatever form of opportunistic activities. So we counsel very strongly against the adoption of these amendments from the Greens. At their most extreme level, they would entirely defeat the purpose, which is a narrow and specific but important public policy purpose, of the bill.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2011-03-03,"—My position is similar to the government’s in relation to these amendments. I will support amendments (2) and (3). Senator Brandis is going to put forward a bill. This is the government’s bill, the bill that I have worked on with the member for Denison. As I understand it, the amendments from Senator Brandis will in effect turn this bill into his bill—I think that is fair summary. But for the purposes of these particular amendments, I support amendments (2) and (3). Amendment (1) is somewhat too broad. Amendments (2) and (3) would clarify the definitions. I understand the concerns of Senator Brandis, but, given time constraints, I am prepared to live with those amendments. But I am also comfortable with the bill in its current form. But I do not have an issue with amendments (2) and (3).",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-03-03,"—I know it is a little unorthodox to put a question to a shadow spokesperson, and I should apologise to Senator Brandis in this instance because this bill has come on fairly suddenly and I have not had the opportunity to speak about the intention of these amendments with Senator Brandis. Irrespective of the views he might hold I apologise that I was not able to speak to him about them before we found ourselves in committee.
I wonder whether Senator Brandis would care to address the issue of the government’s drafting of the bill. The bill has been through quite an exhaustive committee process over the last couple of years, but it would appear on my reading to exclude the protection of the courts from people who were not being paid. That is quite an important distinction that I do not necessarily know that we want to draw. This does not go to the definition of whether or not you are a journalist; it hinges on the language around ‘in the normal course of that person’s work’—and I think a commonsense reading of that text would indicate that you would need to be drawing some kind of payment for the publication of the work.
The case that I put and the reason that I strongly support this amendment being passed is that I do not think that is a distinction we should draw. I think there is genuine public interest journalism in Australia, on the most sensible definition of how people would understand the term, that is not necessarily paid and does not necessarily appear in the early pages of the Sydney Morning Herald but is nonetheless journalism and should be afforded the protection of the courts that I think we are all in agreement should be applied and updated. I wonder whether Senator Brandis would care to address this issue in the context of the remarks he has just made.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-03-03,"—My concern is that Greens amendment (2) goes beyond that; that Greens amendment (2) would attract the protection, which it is the purpose of the bill to afford to journalists, to anyone engaged and active in the publication of news—not just someone who, doing the work of a journalist, may be acting without remuneration but anyone purporting to do the work which journalists commonly do; in other words, publish news.
The opposition’s attitude, and this is reflected in the way in which the opposition bill is structured, has always been that the professional confidences which apply to a range of professions—for example, the legal profession and the medical profession—ought to be applied to the protection of journalist sources as well. With respect, we approach this from an entirely different frame of reference than Senator Ludlam does. We see this reform as an extension of the law that protects professional confidences and we accept that, because reliance on sources in the bona fide investigation and subsequent publication of news is integral to a journalist’s work, the relationship between a journalist and a source ought, at least presumptively, be a privileged relationship.
The amendment that Senator Ludlam proposes is not so limited and does not really approach the question from that perspective. As I interpret his amendment it says that, as long as something is news, it does not matter who publishes it or publicises it. That is why I said in my earlier contribution that, if we expand the definition of ‘journalist’ as widely as he would have us do, this ceases to be legislation which provides this protection, which privileges a particular kind of communication in which journalists are engaged in the course of their professional activities. It says to every person in society that, whether they are journalists or not, if they are seeking to publish or bring to public awareness a fact which they assert to be a newsworthy fact, they should have a presumptive privilege. That is not the protection of journalist sources; it is a much more extensive thing which we do not think is good policy—it is the protection of a communication between any person and a source which might result in the person deriving the information choosing then to publish it in any form on the basis that it is news. That is the reason for our caution here and our opposition to the Greens amendments.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-03-03,"—I thank Senator Brandis for that clarification. I cannot do too much more than commend these amendments before I move them. Effectively I suppose I will just have to respectfully disagree and say that we are not seeking to do exactly as Senator Brandis has stated. It is important here to remember exactly what this bill intends to do. It intends to allow the courts, when these kinds of cases come before them—as they do quite regularly in my home state of Western Australia—to consider the public interest in deciding on disclosure of a source or not. The balance I think we have been able to strike here is to say that the plain English definition of ‘journalist’ is still here in the bill—and if somebody is going to be receiving confidence from a source, and that source would expect that kind of protection, I do not think we want the doors of the court to be closed based on those kinds of criteria. We are trying to leave those judgments to the court—is it in the public interest that this particular source, this particular confidence, be disclosed or not?
The bill as drafted at the moment would have the effect of potentially either closing the doors of the court or tying courts up in sequences of arguments about to whom the protection should apply. In my view, and in the view of the folk we have taken advice from in the course of drafting these amendments, that is the wrong kind of argument. We do not want to be tying the courts up in long debates about whether the door should be open or not; whether you are a journalist or not. The argument that we want heard in the courts is: should this protected confidence be protected or not? Is it in the public interest that this be disclosed or not?
That is why I am pressing the point, Senator Brandis. I am not sure that we are quite as much at cross-purposes as you have indicated in the remarks you have put this morning. We are not seeking to have vexatious confidences or other material protected that it is not in the public interest to protect; we are simply seeking to have the court’s doors open so that those kinds of arguments can be heard in the small number of cases where a source has given some kind of confidence to somebody for publication in a news medium and expected that their identity would be protected. We potentially would have people who have the expectation of protection—and people who may feel as though they have the ability to offer that protection—and then, when push comes to shove and it comes before the courts, find those doors are closed. And then we never get to hear the argument as to whether or not it is in the public interest that the source be protected.
If Senator Brandis wishes to speak again, I will yield and then move the amendment in a moment.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-03-03,"—Thank you, Senator Ludlam. I would like to respond to that. The point I make to you and other senators, through the chair, is this: do you want this legislation to be about the protection of journalists’ sources or do you want this legislation to be about the protection of any confidence which might subsequently be published in some medium by a person, whether a journalist or not, on the basis that it is claimed to be news? A law which presumptively protects anything said to anyone in confidence which might subsequently be published by the recipient of the information on the basis that it is news throws a cloak of privilege over a vastly wider range of information and a vastly greater number of persons than a law which merely protects journalists’ privilege.
Let me make two points about the courts, if I may, Senator Ludlam. First of all, remember that this is about withdrawing information from a court. The basic proposition on which courts of justice work is that all of the relevant evidence should be placed before them so that they can arrive at an adjudication of a dispute, whether a criminal prosecution or a civil dispute, fully informed of every relevant fact. That is integral to our notions of justice. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances we withdraw information from courts because there are other values served which are regarded as being more important in the scheme of things than the principle that courts should have access to all relevant information. For example, we respect the privilege against self-incrimination. For example, we respect lawyer-client privilege, so that what a person says to his lawyer cannot be used against him in court, even though it might be that if the court knew what the person had said to his lawyer that would relevantly influence the court’s deliberations on the particular case. There are other values that qualify the general principle that the court should have before it all relevant information so as to resolve a dispute justly.
What this bill does is create a new category, only by a rebuttable presumption of course, of information which may be withdrawn from the court—that is, the identity of a journalist’s source—so that if the bill in its original form were to be passed, and the presumption were not to be rebutted, there would be something which under the law today the court can insist on knowing about (namely, the identity of the source) which it would not know about. And certain consequences follow from that—for example, the capacity fully to test evidence in cross-examination knowing who the source is.
We the opposition agree—and here we agree with you and with the government, although the government are the latest to the party here—that in certain limited circumstances there is a case to be made for the protection of a journalist’s source which acts as a qualification on the general principle I have recited that courts should have access to all relevant information. You expand that as widely as this amendment would and what you are saying—subject of course to there being a rebuttable presumption rather than an ironclad rule—is that the range of information which may be withheld from the court is vastly greater. The range of information that can be withheld from a court is anything which is given to someone in confidence which might by the recipient of that piece of information subsequently be published, on the footing that it is said to be news. So you are, to that extent, inhibiting far beyond the extent to which it is necessary to do so the capacity of a court to be fully informed of every relevant material or material fact.
Senator Ludlam, I say to you with great respect, when you are proposing to amend the law to create circumstances in which otherwise relevant or material information may be withdrawn from the eyes of the court, the way to approach it is to do so as conservatively and narrowly as possible so as to serve the countervailing public policy objective, not to do so in an expansive way which impinges too much on the general rule that courts should be able to resolve disputes fully informed of every relevant fact. That is the first point.
The second point is this. You say do not close the door of the court to this. For the reasons as I have just explained, it is your amendment that would close the door of the court, but it does not completely close the door of the court because this legislation acts on the basis of rebuttal presumptions. What you would then be doing, though, by expanding very significantly the category of information caught by the legislation, is to engage the court in a much more prolix and complicated inquiry, an inquiry which would give rise to a multiplicity of additional issues of fact as to whether or not this particular sort of information should be protected, and therefore you will prolong proceedings vastly. So for that reason as well, it seems to me, if I may say so with respect—I understand your intention and there is no doubt about the good faith with which the intention is expressed—you pass this amendment and it will, in fact, defeat the objective you have recited. In particular, consider this Senator Ludlam. Consider the injustice of a person being convicted by a court not fully possessed of every relevant or material fact. Consider the injustice of a person having a civil dispute resolved against their interests by a court not possessed of every relevant or material fact. If you approach it that way, which is the way I approach it, then you would say, where there is a powerful reason to qualify that rule, qualify it as little as possible, which is what the opposition’s proposal would do, but that is an objective which your amendment, perhaps unintentionally, would thwart.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-03-03,"—I do not propose to prolong this issue too much further, except to indicate that I respectfully disagree with Senator Brandis. Having listened very carefully, you contemplate an amendment which reduces the amount of information available to courts. With the greatest circumspection and respect—and we do certainly agree on that principle—before the circumstance arises which Senator Brandis just sketched for the chamber, the court would have heard a public interest argument as to whether or not that information should have been withheld from the court. That is the essence of our disagreement, while agreeing in principle that you treat with great caution any proposition to curtail the rights of a court to hear whatever evidence it pleases. So I do understand the objection Senator Brandis is raising. I simply believe that before the circumstance he describes for us arises, the court has satisfied itself that there is a strong public interest argument, as the rest of this bill is intended to create, for that information not being produced in court. I thought, in essence, that is the purpose of the bill—that the public interest test is what is important here. I realise that muddies the debate around whether it should be applied to a Facebook comment or to some sketchy blog somewhere out on the internet—and bring us back to the foundation of this bill which is about source protection and the expectation of protected confidence. I have to respectfully disagree with Senator Brandis.

Division 1B—Journalists’ privilege

The Commonwealth and New South Wales evidence acts have departed from uniformity in their treatment of professional confidential relationships. The Commonwealth act confines the definition of ‘protected confidence’ to ‘a communication made in confidence to a journalist’. The New South Wales act defines the same term as arising in the course of a relationship in which the confidant was acting in a professional capacity under an obligation not to disclose the confidence. The continued restriction of the privilege claim is anomalous. The coalition’s bill therefore adopts the formula of the New South Wales act. Not only would it restore uniformity but it would avoid arbitrarily confining the circumstances in which claims of privilege may be justifiably asserted and as well it brings this area of the law more closely in conformity with equity courts’ protection of confidential relationships. The amendments retain the existing subsection 126A and make the appropriate extensions.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I am trying to determine whether the first part of the submission on (1) was narrowing it, while now we are widening it—I am trying to reconcile that difference. But I do not particularly want to go there. I do understand the point Senator Brandis makes.
The government do not support the amendments proposed by Senator Brandis. While the government support the objective of the model professional confidential relationship privilege agreed to by the Standing Committee of Attorneys General, we do not believe it should be included in this bill. Any further consideration of the general professional confidential relationship privilege should not delay the introduction of the important journalist provision contained in this bill. The government, I foreshadow, will be introducing provisions in a separate package of evidence reforms which will ensure consistency with model provisions agreed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. That will be put before this parliament and there will obviously then be the opportunity of debating it.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-03-03,"—The Australian Greens will also not be supporting these amendments, although perhaps I will make that conditional on further remarks from Senator Brandis, if he cares to make them. I just apologised to him for circulating amendments which we had not had time to discuss, but now he has done exactly the same to the crossbenches. I am therefore not entirely clear about the effect of these amendments and I would greatly appreciate Senator Brandis going into a little bit more detail. My reading of these amendments—and they were not necessarily reflected in the comments Senator Brandis just made—is that they would have quite far-reaching impacts. This is not merely a technical amendment. I believe that it goes to, in some measure at least, the objectives that Senator Brandis was pursuing with an entirely separate bill—to expand the matters that we are referring to. I reserve my judgment on the opposition amendments pending any further explanation Senator Brandis might give us about what these amendments will actually do.",SENATE,<title>EVIDENCE AMENDMENT (JOURNALISTS’ PRIVILEGE) BILL 2010</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,22,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2011-03-03,"—I advise the Senate that the amendments were in fact circulated last November. As I said in my earlier remarks, the approach of the opposition has been to attempt to incorporate appropriate journalists’ privilege within a broader and more consistent framework for the protection of professional confidences. The difference between our approach and the approach reflected in Australian Greens amendment (2), which has just been passed, is that we limit these protections to professional relationships—the sorts of confidential relationships which have traditionally been protected by the courts in other analogous areas, but most commonly professional relationships.
We say the profession of journalism and the confidences of which journalists are, in the course of their work, the recipients, ought appropriately to be brought within that class of relationships, but brought within that class of relationships in a way that seeks to achieve consistency with the law’s protection of other acknowledged confidential relationships. That is the approach of the New South Wales Evidence Act, which guides our approach here.
Without revisiting the debate we just had a few moments ago, our concern, as I said, was that the Greens amendment, which has now been adopted by the committee, would expand very significantly the scope of the protection and hence the scope of the material which might be withdrawn from the court, not by reference to a new category of professional confidence but by reference merely to the activity in which the person seeking to invoke the privilege was engaged—that is, the act of being ‘engaged and active in the publication of news’.
In answer to the charge that we were seeking to narrow but are now seeking to expand, what we were in fact seeking to do was to develop a rational scheme for the protection of confidences which does not regard the nature of the activity as the key criterion or point of discrimination, but which rather identifies one discrete and specific form of professional confidence—that is, a confidence given by sources to journalists—and seeks to accommodate that within a rational scheme which reflects, by and large, the current law but which protects confidential relationships.
Courts acknowledge the availability of confidentiality in these circumstances not by reference to the activity but by reference to the nature of the relationship. That is the point of distinction. What you seek to do, Senator Ludlam—and the government has gone along with you—is to define whether a confidence should be protected by reference to the nature of the activity. What the opposition say is that that goes far too far. What we should do, in an orthodox way, is continue to extend the privilege by reference to the character of the relationship and, by taking one further step, bring the relationship between a journalist and a source into the existing categories of professional relationships which the law protects.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2011-03-03,"—I rise to speak to issues surrounding the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010 and some amendments associated with the bill. I can remember the very first year I got here, in 2001, and there was still an amount of controversy over the placement of a national radioactive waste repository. As a Territorian, I recall this issue being particularly difficult to deal with in this place as it appeared that there were no good reasons for this repository being placed in the Northern Territory rather than in places that were more scientifically suitable.
I can remember, along with Dave Tollner, putting in a series of amendments that dealt effectively with the issues of concern for Territorians. Those amendments dealt with issues such as the storage of overseas waste, the waste from states and territories, ensuring the regulation and appropriate transport of liquid or particulate matter, and that private land could be volunteered. There was a suite of amendments at the time. I firmly believed that the nation needed a storage facility to appropriately store waste, including the waste from Lucas Heights.
I will speak briefly about the importance of the waste from Lucas Heights. I had the opportunity to visit not only Lucas Heights but also the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where products like technetium-99m are produced. I think technetium-99m is used in around 80 per cent of the radio-pharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine. I will use it as a stark example of what the nature of the health services available in Australia would be like if technetium-99m was not available.
We are still dealing with issues like breast cancer and I will use it as an example because it is so well known to most Australians. If you have a breast tumour it will drain to some 19 lymph nodes on the inside and the outside of your chest, particularly under your armpits. It is very difficult to know the state of the tumour and whether or not it is draining to one or all of those lymph nodes. An injection of technetium-99m, followed by a scan, will tell you exactly whether that tumour is draining and exactly which lymph node it is draining to. This enables us to forensically and cosmetically remove a tumour. I do not think anybody disagrees that this is very important, but I think it is important to know what this was like in the bad old days.
The bad old days provided women with a full mastectomy that affected them not only physically but also emotionally because it is an extremely traumatic intervention. Of course, it is something that should be avoided at all costs. The capacity for Australia now to produce its own technetium is a fundamental part of our health system. The need for a national repository is not in question because our capacity in this country to produce technetium is reliant on having a facility like Lucas Heights, which in turn makes us signatories to the arrangements under the International Atomic Energy Agency which are run by ARPANSA in Australia. Under those arrangements, if we have such a facility then the fuel that we use to make medicine has to be reprocessed to take out the plutonium as part of our obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons—and, as Australians, we have agreed that that is an important treaty—and that is coming back because that is an obligation. I think Australia was coming to grips with this during that difficult time, but luckily there were storage facilities at Dounreay in Scotland and at Cogema in France that we could use—no doubt due to the negotiations by the department. I would like to commend a couple of the people I can see on the other side who have been involved in those negotiations for a long time.
It is very important to look at the history of this. All Australians agreed for all the reasons I have put forward, except for the Western Australian government, which said, ‘If you don’t mind, we are going on our own; we are going to build our own repository.’ At the time there was a bit of argy-bargy, but basically Western Australia was not included in the agreement to go out and do a survey right across Australia. All states and territory governments, apart from Western Australia, had agreed fundamentally that that would be the case, such that in September 1991 under the Minister for Science and Technology, Simon Crean, that became so.
We went out with good science and we found what we considered was the perfect site, notwithstanding the safety of the material that was to be stored. I emphasise that we keep talking about safety and it gives this impression of needing to be concerned about something. That is not the case. I have had a very close look at and examined the details and descriptors of all of the material that could be stored on this site and I am convinced that it is eminently safe. I commend those who do not read the same sort of material to apprise themselves of the facts.
We found section 56 in the Officer Basin, or around about there, was the ideal location. That was to be the address—we would all agree to it. Right at the last moment, after the South Australian government had agreed that we should do this, when it came to deciding that the preferred site was indeed in South Australia, and notwithstanding that its government had agreed that the site would be selected on the science, the Premier, Mike Rann, in what is probably an all-time low of political expediency, put the health system of Australia behind his own political aspirations. He used this as a political ploy in the election campaign. He said, ‘Not in my backyard,’ and ‘Don’t worry about this nasty nuclear waste; it won’t be in your backyard in South Australia. I will fight for you and you should all vote for me. We won’t talk about the impact on our international obligations.’ I do not think that anybody who was involved in this debate would have had a problem had we had a good scientific process to establish it in the best place available. There is no doubt that we have to have the materials that we have. We were all very disappointed when it was challenged in the High Court in January 2004 and, sadly but probably appropriately, the South Australians won.
As I understand it, with the reprocessed fuel rods that I mentioned before, the year 2015 has been bandied around, but we have an obligation soon to take those fuel rods back. To be in breach of that obligation puts us at risk of not being able to produce more fuel rods to ensure the further production of these essential radiopharmaceuticals that give us the health system and the standard of living that we assume in Australia. I was particularly unhappy about the Howard government’s decision at the time, as those people who were around at the time could understand. We in the Northern Territory do not have the same powers of the states to resist Commonwealth decisions. We do not have the same powers as other states to say, ‘You can’t do it here.’ We did not have the same power, for example, as South Australia, which decided to resist the Commonwealth in this enterprise and make it go somewhere else.
I was convinced, after seeing all the material, that there was a higher goal—that is, to ensure the provision of a health system in Australia. Unlike Mr Rann, I lost a lot of bark. Making a decision in the Northern Territory that I was going to support the radioactive repository—notwithstanding a suite of amendments that met most of the concerns of Territorians—was a little bit like getting into a shower with an angle grinder. It was not a lot of fun and it was probably pretty unsafe politically. For quite a long time, there was a major campaign led by the Labor Party to ensure that I would meet the full force of odium from the Northern Territory.
The not-in-my-backyard protests continued—they continue to this day. We had some hope that, when the Howard government left office, all the Labor states and territories—and, of course, with a federal Labor government in power—would have said, ‘Let’s go and have something done on science.’ It was in fact the federal government here today that made the promise when they came to office after the election that stated categorically: ‘If we are elected we will throw this legislation out,’ which they have done, technically—I acknowledge that—‘but we will replace it with something that is based on sound science.’ We already know what the sounder science says. It says that the new address is ‘Section 56, Officer Basin’. That is the new address, and we knew that was the case. Therefore, one would assume that, when the government made that promise, that was where it was going to put it or at least readdress it—that is, go back and have another crack at it. Of course, this government has got form in what it promises before an election and what it is prepared to deliver afterwards.
I can only assume that none of the other state governments really wants to cooperate, none really wants to play the game, and that we are back now to where we started. But this is a very important point. It is terrific that my colleague and good friend Senator Crossin on the other side is in the chamber, and I assume she is going to speak, because I can recall for years and years Senator Crossin and Mr Snowdon in the other place standing and saying, ‘Scullion, how dare you let this go in the Territory.’ I think there were 18 media releases—I do not want to misquote Mr Snowdon but it was about that—and I am not sure how many of those Senator Crossin put out, but she was pretty scathing of me. For the entire time she said, ‘How dare you actually allow it to go into the Territory.’ It is going to be very interesting to see how Senator Crossin votes on this. People no doubt will be looking very closely at that vote. I, however, Senator Crossin, whilst bearing the political scars to this day, will be consistent in ensuring that we maintain the boast that we have one of the best national health systems in the world.
There is still a great deal of injustice, and the injustice for Territorians is quite clearly that we are still decision takers. The most significant amendment that I put to the previous bill—or current; I am not really sure—was that the site would be on a voluntary basis. Somebody who owned land could put their hand up, and it was the Northern Land Council who did that. They had a full council meeting about it. The Northern Land Council and I have not seen eye to eye over everything but I have to commend them for the incredible task they undertook. They held a meeting of the entire land council and made a decision on whether or not to support an application for the site. That decision was then considered through a full process, and it was decided that that would be the case. That gave me great relief because at least someone had put their hand up. There was capacity for someone to put their hand up. Don’t worry, there were probably better sites outside of the Northern Land Council’s lands. The site could have been on the Northern Territory government’s land. There is plenty of that around. But that day—
—I bet you were relieved.
—Thank you, Senator Crossin, for your interjection. Again, based on the science, the Chief Minister was able to assert that same day that there were no suitable sites on government land anywhere in the Northern Territory. The government took a position that was all about politics. They were not worried about the health benefits that the responsible people who supported this measure would provide. So, Senator Crossin, I hope you do not injure your back today. I am looking forward to seeing whether or not you fundamentally support the exact same legislation that you deplored for so many years.
I would like to take a very short amount of the time that I have left to foreshadow an amendment that was circulated today. I will discuss it in committee, but before I do I would like to frame some of the history around it. Another of the very important amendments that I put to this legislation and fought for, as one normally does within government, was that the choice of site be down to individuals. It was terrific that the Northern Territory government put their hand up. However, we needed to ensure that overseas waste was not stored there because the Northern Territory people were saying, ‘What’s going to be stored there?’ We said, ‘It’s okay.’ They said, ‘What about someone else’s waste? We don’t want to be a dumping post.’ That was absolutely reasonable. The amendment reflected that the site could not store overseas waste. One thing that I remember saying to our leader at the time was: ‘For all these states and territories, it has been pretty bloody convenient to tell us in the Territory “not in my backyard, but we’re going to put our waste, however safe, in your backyard.”’ So we provided an amendment that in effect said that the only people who could keep their material there was the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory. But, of course, that has now changed because of a little deal that was done.
I am not sure whether you had anything to do with this little deal, Senator Crossin, but it involves your mate Mike Rann in South Australia. He put us in this position because his political aspirations come far ahead of his electorate. He said: ‘What about we call it “Commonwealth” and give it to you? What about that, Julia? If I give you my waste—be a bit tricky—and you can call it “Commonwealth waste” and then you can keep it in the Northern Territory.’ It was a terrific move!
—Chair, I need to take a point of order. I am assuming that the person Senator Scullion was referring to is in fact our Prime Minister. I think rather than call her by only her Christian name, she should be referred to correctly and reverently. Thank you.
 (Senator McGauran)—Yes, ‘correctly’ but I am not sure about ‘reverently’.
—I withdraw. That is quite fair. Mike Rann said to the Prime Minister: ‘Prime Minister, we’ve got this bit of legislation at the moment that won’t let me store my gear in the Northern Territory. If you can just give me the material I will call it “Commonwealth” and then it sort of fits in.’ Senator Crossin, I do hope you will support my amendment. My amendment ensures that all of the states and territories are charged because, except for the Northern Territory, all of them have decided ‘not in my backyard’. Every Territorian should agree that if the other states and territory are not storing waste in their backyards and want it to come to the Territory—they have all had an opportunity to provide a site, particularly South Australia because it does the best science—then they should be charged. It is not a penalty; it is simply a charge. If this service is to be foisted onto the Territory—except in terms of the land being provided voluntarily—then it is very, very important that that be the case. This is why I flagged the amendment that is being circulated.
We may not get to the committee stage of the bill; however, the amendment is about the creation of the Northern Territory Oncological Services Fund; it will establish that. So we will be able to say to those people who seek to get around the very good amendment that was placed before them: ‘You can’t just give waste to the Commonwealth and then it become Commonwealth waste. What you have to accept is that that is the mischief that the Scullion amendment intended to prevent.’ Hopefully, this amendment will provide the Northern Territory with funds that will go specifically to oncology. We do not have a very big invoicing base. Whilst we now have a very good oncology unit in Darwin, it is difficult to ensure sufficient staff or the provision of scholarships. We have a whole range of important cancer services there.
In closing, I make the following points. It was Labor who decided that we needed a process based on science. It was Labor who pulled out of the process based on science. It was Labor who said: ‘We’ll destroy the process when we are elected. We’re going to throw it away and we’re going to start again on science.’ Today, we are looking at a piece of legislation which Labor have introduced and which is still not based on science. I do not know how you rationalise this position. I cannot for the life of me understand where Labor are on this, apart from where they started. They are all about political expedience. The government do not care a fig for the health system of Australia. This is a very serious matter and they stand indicted for forcing this site onto the Territory. I am one of the ones responsible enough to take it on the chin, because we do need those very important health services. But the government stand indicted for promising that they would go away and withdraw the legislation and restart the process based on science. They have simply taken out one piece of legislation, slipped in another and said, ‘What about voting for this?’ The legislation is almost identical. Once again, the only thing they do better than waste and mismanagement is promise something and never deliver on it.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I rise in my contribution to this debate on the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010. I will not be able to finish my contribution before we get to question time. Let me start with a few preliminary comments. Some of Senator Scullion’s contribution is accurate, the last few minutes of diatribe are totally inaccurate. If I get a chance, I will try and place some facts and figures on the record.
There is no doubt that this piece of legislation is immensely difficult and has been so for decades for this country and this parliament successively—for previous Labor governments and then a federal coalition Liberal government and now back again to a Labor government. It has been a very difficult and very hard process to manage. Some of the history that Senator Scullion outlined is accurate. Some of that history has been recorded time and time again in not only House of Representatives reports but also Senate committee reports. But what we have before us today is fundamentally a different bill to the one which the Howard government sought and succeeded in getting through this parliament. Thank goodness that following the 2007 election, when we were elected into government, this bill delivers 100 per on part of the promise leading into that election. This bill delivers on our 2007 election promise and if it did not—
—Where is the science?
—I will go to what our election promise was and that is part of it. That is why I thought I would take the opportunity to provide you with some facts about this debate. If this bill did not deliver on our election commitments, I would be reluctant to get out there publicly and talk about this in the Northern Territory or federally or with my colleagues.
Let me tell you that what we did in the lead-up to the election. I welcome the arrival of Senator Kim Carr because he was the shadow minister at the time. Senator Carr and Minister Snowdon now and myself went to the election saying that we would repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 and replace it with something else. This legislation does that. We said that we would restore transparency, accountability and procedural fairness. This bill does that because it ensures that the decision to select a site for a national facility will be guided by procedural fairness. The Howard government bill—your bill, Senator Scullion—never did that, never went anywhere near that. The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act—the AD(JR) Act of 1977—will ensure a higher level of accountability for decisions than is currently available. Transparency in this process will be important. So we have delivered on that.
We said that we would ensure that any proposal for the siting of a nuclear waste facility on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory would adhere to the requirements that exist under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act—the LRA act. This bill reinstates that act. This bill reinstates those rights. The other thing we said was that we would restore the balance and, pending contractual obligations, we would not proceed with the establishment of a nuclear waste facility on or off Aboriginal land until the rights removed by the Howard government were restored and a proper and agreed site selection process was followed out.
What does that mean? There was a pending contractual obligation. As you well know, that obligation is between the Lauder family and the Northern Land Council and your then current Minister for Science which was Minister Julie Bishop. We have said that we would honour that contract. We know that the contract is the subject now of a federal court case and I am not going anywhere near the claims of that case—as a politician, as a member of the Senate, as a member of the federal parliament, as a chair of a constitutional committee, even as a member of the executive government. It is not up to us to decide whether or not the right people have signed that contract. That is a matter for the courts and that is where it now lies.
We also said that we would ensure that the site is based on science. You cannot have science unless you choose the site. You have to choose the site first. And, as you well know Senator Scullion, your government contracted Parsons Brinckerhoff to undertake an extensive assessment of the four sites that you had nominated. In my further contributions to the debate, I will talk about those other three sites. But you well know that the initial science assessment has been undertaken. The Parsons Brinckerhoff report is available publicly. It was released publicly by the Minister for Resources and Energy Martin Ferguson. That is a transparent process. That is an accountability process. That document did not have to be released. That could have sat on Minister Ferguson’s desk ad infinitum.
This government is responsible and accountable, and has released those documents. I imagine, Senator Scullion, you have not had time to read them all. There are many and varied appendices of the Parsons Brinckerhoff report. I think the largest one of the eight or nine volumes is about 1,200 pages. That initial site assessment, in terms of the suitability for selection, has been done. Is that the only science process that will be undertaken in the course of building this facility? The answer is no. Of course it will not be. This site selection will be subject to the EPBC Act and a whole other lot of contingencies that are now in this new piece of legislation—and I will continue my remarks on this in the next sitting week.
Let me just state again before I need to end for question time: Senator Scullion, this is a vastly different piece of legislation. This is a piece of legislation that ticks the boxes for our election in 2007, provides judicial review, provides fairness, reinstates the Land Rights Act and ensures that other contingencies such as a regional consultative committee will be established to guide us and the communities concerned and the government during this process. I shall continue my remarks when we resume the second reading debate on this bill.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I have two answers to questions I took on notice during question time. The first relates to a question asked by Senator Ludlam on Tuesday, 1 March. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
In March 2010, the Minister met a large delegation of Ngapa Clan members and executive members of the Northern Land Council in Darwin where unanimous support was expressed for the nomination of a potential radioactive waste management facility site on Ngapa land at Muckaty Station.
In October 2010, the Minister wrote to the Traditional Owners opposed to the construction of a radioactive waste management facility.
Recommendation I provided that the Minister should consult with all parties with an interest in selecting the site at Muckaty Station as soon as possible.
As indicated by the Minister for Resources and Energy on 21 February 2011 during the House of Representatives debate on the Bill:
“if I were to undertake consultations as the Minister at the present time, it would have to be pursuant to the terms of the existing Act, which we seek to repeal … I am not prepared to enter into negotiations with third parties on the basis of an Act that does not allow procedural fairness and other protections”.
Far from being an “unorthodox arrangement” as suggested by Senator Ludlam, locating the radioactive waste management policy function with the resources policy function has been the prevalent arrangement over the last thirty years.
Radioactive waste policy has been the policy responsibility, successively, of the Department of National Development and Energy, the Department of Resources and Energy, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and now the Resources Division of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.
Only in the period 2001 to 2007, when this function was located in the Department of Education, Science and Training, has it been separated from the resources policy function. Regardless of the location of the radioactive waste function, it continues to have access to the advice of relevant expert Commonwealth agencies including the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research Portfolio and Geoscience Australia in the Resources, Energy and Tourism portfolio.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Radioactive Waste</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,28,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2011-03-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cormann and Bushby today relating to a proposed carbon tax
Senator Wong’s contribution today was a terrific demonstration as to why the Australian public have stopped listening to this government. Legitimate debate on the subject of a carbon tax is characterised by this government as an activity of denying. Whenever the coalition poses legitimate questions, the word ‘denier’ is hurled. It is hurled across the chamber like a clove of garlic to ward off the evil ones who dare question any element of this government’s policy, who dare question a carbon tax.
Labor have a positively medieval approach to debates and inquiry. They use the words of belief when it comes to public policy. Labor members and senators often say, ‘I believe in an ETS,’ or ‘I believe in a carbon tax,’ not, ‘I think the best policy response to the challenge of climate change is an ETS or a carbon tax.’ They say, ‘I believe.’ It is a perverse and bizarre way to express concepts and policy positions in public debate.
But when Senator Wong and her colleagues hurl the word ‘denier’ at the opposition when we question the value, efficacy and cost-of-living impacts of a carbon tax they also smear millions of Australians who think that action is required but who doubt the government’s plan. They smear millions of Australians who are worried about cost-of-living pressures. They smear millions of Australians who think the government already tax the community and business enough, and they smear millions of Australians who are only too aware of the government’s chronic maladministration.
When the government are not talking about deniers and accusing people of being deniers, they talk about scaremongers. It is really not the fault of the opposition that Prime Minister Gillard took the public and the opposition by surprise by coming out and saying she was going to introduce a carbon tax, exactly what she said before the election she would not do. That is not our fault. And it is not the fault of the opposition that the government released a completely half-baked climate action plan. We know that it would have been the case that that day in the courtyard there was a gap for a media opportunity and so the government thought, ‘Let’s come out with a half-baked climate action plan.’ That is not our fault; that is theirs. They have left a vacuum and the opposition is duty-bound to fill that vacuum by asking legitimate questions and by talking about the parameters of the price effects on Australian households.
The government can pretend all they like that their carbon tax plan is in some way analogous to the GST and the new tax system, that it is some great economic reform. Just calling something an economic reform does not make it so. The contrast between the way the coalition government went about the new tax system and the GST and the way that this government is going about this carbon tax plan could not be more different. When the coalition decided to introduce a GST and a new tax system, we took it to the Australian people. We took it to an election and got a mandate. But, before doing that, we produced a complete plan. We produced 500 fact sheets going into every possible effect on every sort of business and every sort of household. We released cameos about the net impact on families. But this government have not done that work. We saw the evidence of that on Q&A when Bill Shorten was asked what the effect would be on a birthday cake if the carbon tax were introduced. Bill Shorten blathered and blathered until Gretel Killeen could take no more and, for many of us, said, ‘This is just blah, blah, blah.’
This government do not have a plan for climate change, unlike the coalition. The government have no-one to blame but themselves. They should stop blaming the opposition and start explaining their plan to the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,29,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I rise to rebut and provide a contribution to this motion to take note of answers in question time. We have announced a broad framework to deal with climate change, and that is what sets us apart so dramatically from my colleagues opposite. We have tried three times in this parliament to get some legislation passed to deal with carbon pollution reduction in this country, and three times we have not been successful because of the climate change deniers sitting opposite me.
We have outlined our plan to cut pollution, to tackle climate change and to deliver the economic reform that we as a country are going to need to move to a clean energy future. But what do we hear from the other side? On the other side, we hear from deniers, people who still do not believe climate change exists. These are people who up until late 2009 stood behind leaders such as Mr Howard and Mr Turnbull because they did believe in climate change and wanted to do something about it. But suddenly there was this case of the jitters—so much so that the opposition moved to actually replace a good leader in order to prove that this country does not need to do anything about climate change.
They are still in denial about it. They think we do not need to move at all. The global economy is already shifting to a clean energy economy and, if the people opposite me had their way, they would sit back and let that all happen. They say, ‘Let’s see what the rest of the world does first and we will lag behind.’ Thirty-two countries and 10 US states are already moving to emissions trading schemes. We in this country have the highest emissions per capita in the world, higher than the United States. Australia’s households and businesses are at risk of being left behind in this global economy that is already moving to cut pollution.
We have introduced a plan with a number of stages, and we will move through that plan in discussion with businesses, industry and a number of stakeholders in the coming months. The plan is clearly outlined. I want to highlight that yesterday colleagues opposite me on national television—in fact, the world wide web—showed off their dancing attributes to try to prove their point about how desperate they are to block, skewer, deride and criticise any move this country might want to take to tackle climate change.
Can I just say—and I hope the national press gallery is listening—that it is not dancing that comes to mind as I provide my contribution today; it is a song, a famous song by Renee Geyer: ‘Stares and Whispers’. What we have opposite us now is a party of stares. We all remember Tony Abbott’s contribution on national television, and of course Ms Bishop’s contribution day after day in the House of Representatives, trying to stare down our leader, our reformist, our Prime Minister, who is pushing this country forward to be part of the debate and part of the action internationally to tackle climate change—and, of course, don’t mention the words, ‘Mr Turnbull’. He could not even admit to this country on Q&A on Monday night that he could not find one economist who could back their plan, their ‘direct action’ plan. So, in the Liberal Party, it is stares and whispers. How does it go? It goes:
They just stare and whisper wherever I go
They just stare and whisper, now everyone knows
That the dream I thought I had found
Has come tumbl’in’ down
Well, Mr Turnbull, it did—and it is unfortunate, because under your leadership we would have bipartisan discussions. Under your leadership, Mr Turnbull, we would be moving this debate forward in this parliament. But, under Mr Abbott’s leadership, we still have deniers, we have people who are embarrassed to tackle this hard policy issue. And when they do, they produce a policy, a ‘direct action’ policy, that is going to cause a $30 billion hole—not million; I know the difference between billions and millions, Senator Joyce—and that will cost working families $720 a year. They are a party of stares, whispers, deniers, defeatists; a party that is not going to be bipartisan in pushing the climate change agenda forward. (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-03-03,"—That was quite a contribution from Senator Crossin, and quite a rewrite of history along the way—and a particular ignorance of history along the way. There is a particular ignorance of history on her side of the chamber and in the politics of her side of the chamber. She seems to have forgotten that there has been a Prime Minister go by the wayside, that they lost somewhere along the way of this journey of the climate change debate. Somehow your government executed a Prime Minister in the midst of all of this, in the most extraordinary of circumstances—but it is okay, because, although Senator Crossin has forgotten that, not all of her colleagues have forgotten. They are quite happy, it seems—
—Kevin Rudd hasn’t forgotten it!
—Kevin Rudd certainly has not forgotten it. Indeed, nor have some of those who appear to still be loyal to the former Prime Minister, because they are happy to still talk about it. In fact, they are happy to consider what the Prime Minister is doing now, against what she told the former Prime Minister he should do. They are very happy to consider that. One of them is quoted in today’s newspapers as saying:
If Julia says she believes that the scheme she is proposing is the right policy, why didn’t she believe that last year when she told Kevin to dump his scheme?
Well, that is a fine question, isn’t it!
—Oops!
—Oops indeed, Senator Fifield! That is a fine question posed by a Labor MP. Another went on to say:
When Kevin took her advice, that was the beginning of the end for him. Now it’s her problem and she’s proposing the same thing.
There is trouble in the ranks over there, quite clearly, as they worm their way through this issue yet again. It is so difficult for them because, not just is their policy flawed, not just can they not get the politics of it right, but their greatest problem is that they are carrying this laggard of a Prime Minister along with them, who has deceived the Australian people. She has flip-flopped on this issue so decisively. If you can flip-flop decisively, that is what she has done. She stared down the barrel of every possible television camera she could find in last year’s election campaign and told the Australian people, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead’—words that will haunt her day after day after day throughout the life of this parliament, because she said it so emphatically, because it was the most solemn promise that she made. As Senator Fifield rightly pointed out, if she wants to break that promise, if she wants to institute her carbon tax, then she should have the courage to go back to the Australian people and ask them for endorsement to do it. She should seek a mandate to actually introduce it, because she can claim absolutely no mandate from the last election for the things that she has done.
Contrast this with the reality that, on this side of politics, since the direct action plan was released in January last year, we have had a clear, consistent policy, a policy we stand by today as much as we stood by it then. During that entire time, the government has had Prime Minister Rudd back down from having a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme; Prime Minister Gillard assume the throne; Prime Minister Gillard rule out a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme; Prime Minister Gillard cobble together a government; and Prime Minister Gillard come out and say, ‘We will now have a carbon tax’. All of that has happened in the time that our policy has been locked in, so the hypocrisy of those opposite to want to talk about our policy knows no bounds, when we have had a very clear and consistent approach.
The important difference is that our policy, our approach, works on exactly where and how you can most efficiently and effectively reduce emissions. We will subsidise actions to do so and we will focus on that five per cent target in doing so. That is how our policy will work: focusing on the five per cent of emissions and subsidising them to get them abated and reduced. The government’s policy, the government’s carbon tax, is a tax applied to 100 per cent of emissions. That is why it costs so much more than the coalition’s policy. That is why it is so much more expensive: because it applies to 100 per cent of emissions as against incentives targeted to five per cent. That is why, of course, it has such spin-off effects on the rest of the economy. As it applies to every tonne of carbon emitted in electricity, to every tonne emitted in the transport sector, it all flows through to everything else in the economy and pushes the price of everything else up. And do you know what? Ours is guaranteed to reduce emissions, because we are targeting reductions; their’s is just a tax applied to everything, with absolutely no guarantee whatsoever it will reduce even one tonne of emissions.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I am somewhat disappointed that Senator Birmingham did not give us a bit of a Macarena, but he did use a party trick, and that party trick was done through smoke and mirrors. He indicated to the Senate that somehow the Labor government previously had a different policy. The Labor government has always been committed to taking action on climate change. That has not changed. Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has had at least eight different positions. Senator Birmingham actually knows perfectly well the history of Mr Abbott’s policy changes, with him at one time supporting an ETS, then coming out against it and then saying that climate change is ‘total crap’. But I want to go through the whole history of Mr Abbott’s positions on climate change. The fact is that this opposition has no coherent policy.
Mr Abbott supported former Prime Minister Howard’s decision to take an ETS to the 2007 election. On 24 July 2009 he supported passing Mr Rudd’s ETS. Then on 27 July he opposed an ETS. Then he supported a carbon tax. And then we have his famous comments from October 2009, in which he called all politics on this ‘absolute crap’. Then he said that an ETS is a sensible policy; then he challenged Mr Turnbull on the ETS. And we all know what happened there. It was a close-run thing. Since then, he has been against a carbon price. There is no coherent policy from the opposition. The Labor government has given a commitment to taking action on climate change. The Prime Minister outlined the government’s plan to cut pollution, to tackle climate change and to deliver the economic reform Australia needs to move to a clean energy future.
This is in stark contrast to those opposite. The Labor government has a plan for the future. We recognise that the cost of climate change will be far greater in the future if we choose to not act now. After the election, the government set up the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, which included members of the government, the Greens and Independent members of parliament, who examined the options for a carbon price. Members of the opposition were invited to participate but have not yet taken up that invitation. The committee was advised by leading experts in the fields of economics, climate science and the social sciences. This is not a policy on the run or inaction. This is a strategic, well-informed plan for tackling climate change.
The Prime Minister, along with members of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, released a paper for public comment on a two-stage plan for pricing carbon. If the legislation is agreed upon by parliament, a carbon price will begin on 1 July 2012. The carbon price will be a market mechanism, commencing with a fixed price for a specified period of between three and five years. Following the fixed price period, there is the intent to transition to an emissions trading scheme. The fact is that pricing carbon is the most efficient and cost-effective way of reducing carbon pollution and supporting Australia in the transition towards a low pollution future. It is an important economic reform that is in our national interest. A carbon price is crucial to maintaining our prosperity and competitiveness in a carbon constrained world. Without certainty over a carbon price in the economy, investment in our energy market and low pollution technologies has stalled, costing us more in the long term. We have been talking about action on climate change for decades. It is time to stop the talking and the inaction. (Time expired)

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2011-03-03,"—All I can say is that the answers given in question time today to the questions that were asked by the opposition and the comments that have just been made by those on the other side confirm without a doubt that this is a government that, when it comes to the issue of the carbon tax, is devoid of any moral compass. This is a government that, by its announcement after the election that it will be imposing a carbon tax on the Australian public, has completely, totally and utterly betrayed the Australian people. But the thing is that you would expect nothing less from those on the other side, because the Gillard government will always take the cheap political option when it comes to making policy in this country rather than taking decisions that are in the national interest.
When Senator Carol Brown refers to comments that have been made by those of us on this side of the chamber in relation to the carbon tax, she needs to be very careful. Let us have a look at the comments that the Prime Minister of Australia made in relation to the carbon tax. Julia Gillard claimed, ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ That was on Channel Ten on 16 August 2010. The now Prime Minister could not help herself. The day before the election, the Australian newspaper quoted the Prime Minister as saying, ‘I rule out a carbon tax.’ Does it get any more blatant than what the now Prime Minister said?
Having categorically ruled out a carbon tax before the election on 21 August 2010, lo and behold, she has now done a deal with the Independents and the Greens—and guess what? The promises she made prior to the election are all off the table. The promises she made to the people of Australia, the promises they went to the ballot box and voted on, are all off the table. She is now introducing a carbon tax. That is without a doubt one of the greatest betrayals that the people of Australia have ever been, and will ever be, subjected to. But you would expect nothing less from those on the other side.
The reality is that the imposition of this tax is one of political choice and certainly not of environmental necessity. Australians understand that Prime Minister Gillard, consistent with left-wing ideology, has never seen a tax she does not like or one that, if in existence, she cannot hike. The reality for Australians is that during the Labor Party’s time in office it has whacked onto Australians 13 new and increased taxes, and the Labor government has been in office for only about three years. That is a new tax every quarter. That is the way policy is made on that side of the chamber. The option of first choice always has to be to tax the Australian people. The Labor government forgets that it is not actually spending its own money; it is spending taxpayers’ money. Taxpayers have a right to be informed before they go to the ballot box if a government, when it is elected, is going to impose another tax on them.
Australians are now faced with the reality that the price of the Prime Minister’s betrayal will be paid by them every single day once this is implemented—every time they turn their lights on, every time they go to the petrol bowser, every time they use their gas, every time they go to the shop to buy groceries, every time they touch anything. Everything in this country that the mums and dads of Australia touch will be tainted by this tax.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-03-03,"—On behalf of the Attorney-General, Mr McClelland, I table a ministerial statement on the Universal Periodic Review, together with a draft report of the working group on Australia’s Universal Periodic Review.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Universal Periodic Review</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-03-03,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
I must admit I was disappointed to see the government’s response to the UN Universal Periodic Review where they did not respond in a comprehensive manner at the time of the review at the committee. A lot of what was contained in that Universal Periodic Review report, 145 recommendations, was in fact hardly a surprise to the government that these recommendations were made. I am focusing in particular on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues and note some of the main recommendations were about, firstly, fully restoring the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act in Australia. Again, that is hardly a surprise. It is an issue that the NGO report certainly raised. Other issues included withdrawal of its reservations to the CERD, which is the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and implementation of the UN Special Rapporteur reports on the rights of Indigenous peoples from 2009. Those issues have been on the table for a long time. Then there were issues around strengthening the efforts to combat family violence, especially against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children; review of all deaths in custody; increased Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander access to legal aid, especially for women; issues around compensation for the stolen generation; and reforms to the Native Title Act. The issue around the stolen generations and reparations was raised a long time ago in the Bringing them home report. I myself have a bill in this very place to address many of those issues, but those issues have been raised for a very long time. And in particular there were the Social Justice Commissioner’s report on native title in 2009 and the issues around implementing the DRIP, which is the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and including those into law. In other words, there were a lot of recommendations that were made. These issues are hardly new.
The government did acknowledge the issues around the significant disadvantage that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders face in this country. What I find distressing is that that seems to equate with the government in some way justifying reducing the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, for example as happened in the Northern Territory emergency response, the NTER, where Aboriginal people’s rights were removed or downgraded through discriminatory practices and the exemption of the measures from the Racial Discrimination Act, and they have not been fully restored despite claims by the government.
I think Australia should have taken a much stronger stance at that time and made some stronger commitments. I look forward very passionately to seeing the government’s response when they do respond in a couple of months time and hope that they do respond in a full and comprehensive manner to those 145 recommendations. I will be looking in particular at the comments on the recommendations, especially those that impact on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and look at whether we can start addressing this issue of using disadvantage to undermine Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s rights. I think it is quite obvious, and it is in fact internationally recognised, that to start addressing disadvantage you have to make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and indigenous people are able to fully exercise their human rights. That is one of the issues that leads to their disempowerment and their alienation and can add to their disadvantage.
Australia will be watched very strongly by the international community on the way it responds to these 145 recommendations. I know there are groups around the country that are carefully looking at the recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review and will be, I hope, talking to government about them.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Universal Periodic Review</title>,Ministerial Statements,30,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-03-03,"—It is certainly the government’s intention to provide a full and comprehensive response to the recommendations. I think it is a little gratuitous for a Greens senator to stand up and make a complaint about not responding in the three-day time period for the initial report. I am extremely proud and in fact I had the honour of leading the Australian delegation at Australia’s UPR on behalf of the Attorney-General, Mr McClelland, who was needed here in Australia in his role with regard to the flood response.
The recommendations made to Australia through the course of our UPR process are under full consideration. I know that the various NGOs and those who are interested in the issues relating to Australia’s human rights record would appreciate that a comprehensive and thoughtful response at the appropriate time is in fact the best possible position for the Australian government to take. There were many recommendations made. It should be said that the serious progress that has been made under the federal Labor government was widely acknowledged by members of the UN Human Rights Council. I was extremely proud to be able to relay to the Human Rights Council our substantive progress in human rights issues across a number of fronts.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I present the government response to the interim report of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee on the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Primary Schools for the Twenty First Century: Government Response to the Interim Report
Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee
Recommendation
Response
Recommendation 1
The committee majority recommends that all quarterly reports on maintaining state spending on primary school infrastructure be made available immediately.
Disagree
Information in the quarterly reports is provided by the States in confidence and on the understanding that it would only be made public, in respect of a particular state, if the Commonwealth decided to impose a sanction on that state for failure to meet its benchmark. 
Recommendation 2
The committee majority recommends that when the next round of P21 funding is made available the remaining P21 program funds be provided directly to those government schools choosing to manage their own projects to completion.
Disagree
With over 99 per cent of all P21 projects having commenced as at 31 December 2010, providing schools with funds directly, particularly where contractual commitments are already in place, would serve little benefit.
In its August 2010 interim report, the BER Implementation Taskforce recommended that projects not yet committed should be delivered in accordance with a pre-BER ‘business as usual’ approach to capital works and that school stakeholders should be more involved in decision making.
The Government has agreed to implement this recommendation made by the Taskforce in its August 2010 interim report.
Recommendation 3
The committee majority recommends that the government immediately require all state and territory education authorities and Block Grant Authorities to publish breakdowns of all individual P21 project costs.
Noted
In its August 2010 interim report, the BER Implementation Taskforce recommended that in the interest of transparency and public accountability, each education authority publish school specific project cost data related to BER P21 in a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. The Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.
Recommendation 4
The committee majority recommends that DEEWR release original applications and project costs as P21 projects are completed, together with an explanation regarding any contract cost variations.
Agree in part
Consistent with the response to recommendation 3, the Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions for reporting on project costs. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.
The Government does not agree to release original applications as they pre-date detailed tendering and procurement processes and buildings were not designed or costed in detail at that point. In addition, the original applications and project costs may have been subjected to variations for a number of valid reasons and this will not be evident in this information.
Recommendation 5
The committee majority recommends strengthening accountability mechanisms for oversight of state expenditure of Commonwealth money. This should include enhancing the powers of the Auditor-General to ‘follow the money trail’ to ensure value for money is achieved by the Commonwealth for state expenditure of Commonwealth monies.
Noted
This issue was covered in the terms of reference of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. While that inquiry lapsed with the prorogation of the Parliament on 19 July 2010, it would be appropriate for government to respond to this issue through any recommendations arising from that Inquiry.
The Government further notes that the BER Implementation Taskforce was established by the Australian Government in April 2010 with the express purpose of assessing value for money aspects of individual projects, as well as systemic issues, and ensuring allegations of waste are fully investigated. With the ongoing work of the Taskforce, a Senate inquiry, two state parliamentary inquiries, an Australian National Audit Office audit and the various audits being undertaken within jurisdictions the BER is a heavily scrutinised program.
Recommendation 6
The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation Taskforce be given access to all costings and be able to examine all relevant contracts to enable it to properly discharge its function to ensure the community that value for money is being achieved.
Agree
The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money.
In its August 2010 interim report, the Taskforce noted that it is receiving cooperation from Education Authorities to access costings and relevant contracts.
Recommendation 7
To ensure that further taxpayer money is not subject to waste and mismanagement, the committee majority recommends that the release of any further BER funding be delayed until the BER Implementation Taskforce reports to the Minister for Education in August 2010.
Disagree
The BER Implementation Taskforce released its interim report on 6 August 2010. The Government has accepted and will implement in full all 14 recommendations. The report stated that the BER program “is delivering much needed infrastructure to school communities while achieving the primary goal of economic activity across the nation.”
The Government will continue to consider recommendations from the Taskforce regarding any future payments.
Recommendation 8
The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation Taskforce report be made publicly available when it is presented to the Minister for Education.
Agree
The BER Implementation Taskforce interim report was made publicly available when it was released on 6 August 2010. The Taskforce’s first full report was also made publicly available when it was released on 15 December 2010.

Recommendation 9
In order to fully examine the systemic failure of Commonwealth oversight mechanisms, the committee majority recommends that a judicial inquiry be established to inquire into whether the BER program has achieved value for money.
Disagree
The Government believes a judicial inquiry is a long and expensive exercise that is unnecessary for a program that has already been subject to an Australian National Audit Office investigation and federal and state parliamentary inquiries.
The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money. The independent chair of this taskforce has testified that all 22 Education Authorities are fully cooperating with his inquiries and making all requested documentation available.

The Government believes a judicial inquiry is a long and expensive exercise that is unnecessary for a program that has already been subject to an Australian National Audit Office investigation and federal and state parliamentary inquiries.
The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money. The independent chair of this taskforce has testified that all 22 Education Authorities are fully cooperating with his inquiries and making all requested documentation available. The Taskforce comprises specialist expertise from the building and construction industry, economists, Quantity Surveyors and contract law experts.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,31,2

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2011-03-03,"—On behalf of Senator Bishop I present the 421st report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, The role of the Auditor-General in scrutinising government advertising.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Mr President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee’s Report 421: The role of the Auditor-General in scrutinising government advertising.
This report is tabled on behalf of the Committee of the previous Parliament, which undertook all of the work for the inquiry, including the conduct of the public hearings and the preparation of the report. After consideration of the report and its findings the current Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has decided to adopt this report.
The inquiry was instigated by the previous Committee in October 2008 to examine the Auditor-General’s new role in scrutinising compliance of public advertising campaigns under the Guidelines on Information and Advertising Campaigns by Australian Government Departments and Agencies. Under the Guidelines implemented in 2008, the Auditor-General was not required to decide whether a campaign would run or not, but only to provide a review opinion as to whether they considered the Guidelines had been satisfied.
The Committee commended the ANAO for the diligence with which it undertook its role and believes that the ANAO’s involvement increased transparency. However, it is important to note that by the end of the inquiry, all Committee members agreed that it was not an appropriate role for the Auditor-General to be involved in the scrutiny of proposed advertising campaigns. They considered that it blurred the boundary between executive decision-making and audit review.
Some Committee members were also concerned that a positive review report by the Auditor-General could be seen to be publically endorsing government policy.
The inquiry was still in progress when, on 31 March 2010, the Special Minister of State announced, in response to the Independent Review of Government Advertising Arrangements, a refined framework for government campaign advertising. In consequence, the Auditor-General’s role in reviewing proposed advertising campaigns before their launch was abolished. Instead, the Auditor-General would be asked to conduct a performance audit on at least one campaign per year or the administration of the campaign advertising framework.
The Committee seriously considered the option of continuing to scrutinise government advertising, due to it being such a subjective area of government spending.  The Committee concluded however that the Auditor-General’s forward works program is likely to achieve this same purpose. That being said, the Committee will take particular note of the Auditor-General’s forthcoming report regarding the implementation of the new system.
As a result of the inquiry, the Committee considers that in future, any substantial proposed changes to the role of the Auditor-General should be first reviewed by this Committee on behalf of the Parliament and not effectively implied by executive announcement. This would more properly reflect the Auditor‑General’s standing as an Independent Officer of the Parliament. The Committee believes that many of the difficulties with the advertising function, discussed in this report, would have been picked up earlier if such a process had been followed.
The Committee has therefore made one recommendation to this effect.
In closing, I would like to commend the Chair of the previous committee, Ms Sharon Grierson, and all Committee members on the work of this inquiry and this report. The report is a comprehensive consideration of the issues surrounding the Auditor‑General’s role in scrutinising government advertising.
Mr President, I commend the Report.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2011-03-03,"—I wish to take note of the CSIRO annual report for 2009-10 and in so doing I wish to indicate that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation facility in Scottsdale in north-east Tasmania received some good news recently. An $18.7 million upgrade to that facility has been announced by the federal government. Of course, the initial announcement to upgrade that facility was made in April 2010. They bungled the tender process at that time and now we have to start again.
Of course we welcome this new development and the announcement of this tender, but we know that the work will not begin until late 2011 at the earliest. That is 18 months after what was originally promised. The people of north-east Tasmania are hurting at the moment. Unemployment is on the rise. The Gunns sawmill is closing at the end of this month and over 100 jobs will be lost directly in that community—that hurts.
There is the lesson that has been learnt. The government have been dilatory and have sat on their hands. They bungled the first tender process. I was in Scottsdale just a couple of weeks ago where there were representatives from the CSIRO at that facility. At that time the government announced the establishment of a new joint research centre in food innovation, drawing on the facilities and expertise of the University of Tasmania, CSIRO and the DSTO.
We do not know the detail, but that is great news. I am pleased about that because I made that suggestion in a letter that I wrote to the minister suggesting that the role of the DSTO Scottsdale facility in food production and research could be expanded. In this case it appears that the government has listened to the view set out in that letter and it can see that there is potential. There is huge potential. I am talking about big money investment in this centre. There is no commitment over the direct money amount to this new centre with the CSIRO. We do not know if it is all going to be based in Scottsdale, in Launceston at the university or at CSIRO in Hobart. We do not know the details. I know the local community is very keen to benefit from this new joint research centre. It certainly has the support of the local community. I hope that it can become a centre of excellence for all of Australia. I hope that we can talk about big money investment into this community—not just for research but also for production.
I would like to put on the record my extreme disappointment that this government have taken on a tender for the production of processed foods for our defence forces from a New Zealand company. It is so sad and disappointing that it has not gone to an Australian company and that the Scottsdale facility has not specifically benefited. The Scottsdale facility produces processed food for the Australian Defence Force, so we are missing out on an opportunity there.
In that letter I also made the suggestion that this food should be made available through our overseas aid program, whether it be for the Haiti earthquake, the Pakistan disaster or other places. In a time of need this is exactly the sort of the thing that the Scottsdale facility could provide for. I would hope that the government seizes with both hands this opportunity to create more jobs, growth and development in the north-east. I would like to see more detail about this joint research facility as soon as possible so that we can get things underway. They have been hurting. It is tough up there in the north-east. They need support from the federal government. This is a great way to provide it and I hope it happens as soon as possible. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to speak to this Auditor-General’s report, entitled Performance audit—Restoring the balance in the Murray-Darling Basin. As we all know, the Murray-Darling Basin is the biggest food bowl in Australia, and that food depends on the pollination of plants, including vegetables and everything else that is grown there. Tonight I want to expose a threat to food bowls all around Australia, but particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. The food industry and even our environmental industry is being challenged by this threat, which does not come in the shape of a human or a natural disaster but in the form of an animal, namely a bee from Java.
Currently in Australia there is an incursion of the Asian honey bee in Cairns. There is a concern that it will move into the Murray-Darling Basin. This bee is a native to Java, Indonesia, and has infested itself near many of the territories around Australia, namely Papua New Guinea and the Solomons. It has now taken up home in our backyard and could well end up in the Murray-Darling Basin.
In 2007 the first nests of the Asian honey bee were found. The bee carries with it a mite from Java known as the varroa mite. This particular mite is carried on the back of the Asian honey bee and carries with it viruses that can be lethal to the European bee, which is the bee we have in Australia. The Asian bee, carrying the mite, will invade the European honey bee hive. The mite can then transfer itself onto the European bee, bringing with it viruses that will result in fatalities in the adult bees in the hive. The mite will also get in amongst the bee larvae, weakening the unborn bees and causing further losses. In areas such as the Solomons and New Guinea, the effect of this bee and the mite has already been devastating.
While there have been no instances of the mite being found on the Asian honey bee in Australia as yet, there is evidence to suggest it will come if not prevented and will ultimately find its way into the Murray-Darling Basin. Already, because of the quarantine protocols of other countries, the fact that the mite may exist on our bees has caused the overseas demand for Australian queen bees to decline. Unlike the European bee, this bee is not able to be  domesticated and it produces little honey. Instead it will rob honey from European honey bee hives like a forager. If this bee makes its way from Cairns down into the food bowls of Australia it will cause many honey producers and controlled pollinators to experience significant loss in their yield.
The bee does not just threaten the honey and pollination industry of Australia; it is also is a threat to public safety, as it establishes nests in cavities within houses and creates a nuisance in urban areas. Furthermore, its impact on the environment is significant, as it stings native animals and insects, disrupting the ecosystem significantly. Further, their nesting sites compete with native insects and they also compete for food. As I have already stated, if the varroa mite is able to breed in Australia the results will be devastating for all primary industry. At first glance the problem is contained within Queensland; however, if allowed flourish, the beekeepers of Australia are adamant that the swarms will spread further, to different states, and will end up in the Murray-Darling Basin. If not stopped, the Asian bee infestation has the potential to do to our honey industry what the rabbit did to our graziers. So what is being done to stop the rot?
This week bee farmers from all over Australia have come to Canberra to voice their concern on this vital food security issue. In April 2010 there was a program initiated that was designed to come up with a solution to the Asian bee problem. In November 2010 this program was significantly scaled back. Now only a staff of 11 researchers remain in the program to carry on the research. Out of those 11 staff members, none are field researchers, which means the program is effectively shut down. This is because no real practical progress can be made without the input of field scientists. This program will be officially cut out altogether on 31 March and then there will be no other way for the beekeepers of Australia to fight this menace. This is a threat all over Australia.
The Commonwealth government at this time feels that, based on evidence provided to it by a technical committee, the bee infestation is not eradicable. The government seems to be of the impression that to carry on this vital research is a waste of time and money. Furthermore, by not doing anything about the problem, the federal government is effectively giving the message that it feels the threat will not spread from Queensland to other states, but we are concerned about the Murray-Darling as well. However, the beekeepers of Queensland and the Queensland government are of the opinion that the problem can be fixed. They believe that the bee is eradicable and that, given the right amount of funding and support, the Asian bees can be wiped out from our shores for good. Also, information from the CSIRO suggests that the swarms can and will move to other states if given a chance.
It is interesting to note that the government faced a similar problem with regard to the invasion of the papaya fruit fly. However, due to the government’s willingness to fight on and find a solution to the problem, that problem was solved. That is what we need to do for the infestation that we are fighting now. At the moment it is thought by beekeepers that in order to restart a credible program a figure of $5 million a year must be obtained. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that is a very small amount of money to protect our environment and our native bees. Five million dollars for one year, to prevent the total annihilation of the Queensland or even the national honey bee industry seems like a small price to pay, and it is not only to protect the bee industry. This problem is very serious from an environmental point of view.
The Queensland government has already developed a model by which they believe the problem can be tackled. I therefore ask the Commonwealth government to take action. We need to fight this feral menace for the good of our primary food producers, not to mention our own fragile ecosystem. It seems absurd that a country that stands up for primary industry and the environment would allow a problem to exist that has the potential to wipe out a very important sector of our rural economy, when it is thought that it could be fixed so easily and for so little. I therefore ask the federal government to listen to the plight of the Australian beekeepers and industry, and either provide the full amount of funding for the eradication program, which is really insignificant, or at least work with the Queensland government and provide partial funding so that this plague can be stopped before it is too late.",SENATE,<title>AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS</title>,<title>Report No. 27 of 2010-11</title>,Auditor-General's Reports,41,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-03-03,"—I rise this evening to discuss a matter that I spoke about recently in a condolence speech in this chamber on the Queensland flood victims. During that particular speech I raised the matter of an event that was held at Club Pine Rivers and which I was principally involved in. The idea of the event commenced when I contacted the club’s CEO, Wayne Moffatt, in mid-January, requesting that they be involved in an event to raise money for the Premier’s Disaster Relief Appeal. Despite the lack of time, with 10 days notice for the event to be held on Sunday, 22 January at the club, the enthusiasm and the commitment was really overwhelming. What started out as a basic sausage sizzle grew into a massive event, pulling in sporting identities, local and state parliamentarians and The Veronicas, who all attended to support Queensland flood victims.
State member for Pine Rivers, Carolyn Male, councillor for the Moreton Bay region Mick Gillam and I got behind the event and helped with auction items, advertising, marketing and the sausage sizzle. A number of athletes also generously donated their time on the day. They included Tonie Carroll and Matt Gillett from the Broncos Rugby League Club; Daniel Rich from the Brisbane Lions AFL club; legendary jockey Larry Cassidy; and Olympic swimmers Melanie Schlanger, Jessicah Schipper and Chris Wright; along with Australian softballer Jodie Bowering. Mick Hancock, Mick De Vere and David Nelson also made valuable contributions and wanted to be there but unfortunately had other commitments.
The athletes made themselves available to sign autographs and do whatever it took to help raise funds. In addition, anyone was able to challenge any of the athletes for a gold coin donation throughout the day to play a number of games they had arranged. People challenged Tonie Carroll to pass the ball and take on Larry Cassidy at Texas Hold ’Em. Additionally, bowls were played with Matt Gillett, darts with Jessicah Schipper, miniature golf with Jodie Bowering, and foosball with Chris Wright or Mel Schlanger. All of the athletes were very generous with their time, and a special mention must go to the members of the Olympic swim team, who not only stayed all day but donated $500 of their own money to the cause. Funds were raised by ways of donation boxes set up throughout the club, raffles every hour and a monster auction at the end of the day. All prizes were donated by individuals or the club and there were no reserve prices on anything. There were some really good bargains in the auction.
On a day with many highlights, it must be said that The Veronicas were the big drawcard. I could not believe at the time of my initial contact with their manager, their brother, Julian Origliasso, the willingness and the generosity shown by them. It was overwhelming. What started out as an agreed 1.5-hour visit from 4.30 pm turned into an extended stay until 9.30 pm. Plenty of people turned up to see them, and they stayed and signed every autograph for and took pictures with everybody who wanted one. They brought prizes for the auction and were even generous enough to agree to be auctioned themselves, for a dinner with them on a particular night. That auction went for around $500, and Lisa and Jess also took to barefoot bowling and showed plenty of ability on the greens.
There were too many volunteers on the day to mention them all individually, but my thanks go to the wonderful staff of Club Pine Rivers who volunteered, along with plenty of members who helped them out. Club corporate partners were also enormously generous not only with donations but also with their time. Genesis Fitness Club, Lawnton; Drummond Golf, Lawnton; Harvey World Travel, Strathpine and North Lakes; Village Motors, Petrie; WOW Sight and Sound from Rothwell; Terry Orreal’s Quality Meats; Westpac Bank and Super A-mart, Lawnton, were fantastic with their efforts. In addition, assistance came by way of donations for raffles from contacts I had made personal requests to, including Terri Irwin from Australia Zoo; Sonia La Penna from Supercheap Auto; Coffee Club, Strathpine; Wendy Cooke from Campbells Cash and Carry, Maroochydore; Cecil Fernandes from IGA; Raj from Baskin Robbins, Kedron, and Kevin Boland from SPM Group. Notwithstanding all that the club had already done, it went further by matching dollar for dollar all donations made through the barrels and donation tins on the day.
Charity support to local communities is nothing new for Club Pine Rivers. The club has supported, and continues to support, many charities over the years. It also tries hard to support as many sporting organisations and other worthwhile causes as it can. Examples of these are the Queensland Ambulance Service, the Salvation Army, Clubs Smile for a Child, Rapids Baseball, Pine Rivers St Andrews Hockey Club, Strathpine Little Athletics, the Endeavour Foundation, Mount Olivet Crime Stoppers, Bray Park-Strathpine RSL sub-branch, the Mater Hospital and many local schools and community groups. Over the past years Club Pine Rivers has raised over half a million dollars for community organisations. All these examples demonstrate why clubs like Club Pine Rivers and its executive need to be supported as pillars of our society.
Many things in life can make you proud to live where you live and be who you are. Being part of a response like that to the floods in Queensland—talking with victims, in their demolished homes sometimes or over the phone, and assisting them in various ways—has to be one of the best things you could do as an Australian. The same Aussie spirit I saw firsthand, shown by the countless volunteers helping out in those flood ravaged areas of south-east Queensland, was the same spirit I saw alive and well at this fundraiser at Club Pine Rivers.
The desire to help with fund raising is widespread in our neighbourhoods. I have now lost count of how many events I have been invited to and have attended. I know the generosity to help your fellow human beings will continue for a long time. Some examples of events I have been to recently or are about to go to have been at the Sandgate PCYC, which was organised by the local state member. There is an event at the Queensland Multicultural Council this Saturday night in Oxley, which was an area that was devastated by the Brisbane floods. Just last night, I attended a function, with other senators and members from Queensland and Victoria in the members dining room here in Parliament House, receiving a cheque for $2.2 million from a Taiwanese organisation—a clear demonstration of their commitment and the worthiness of those sorts of donations that are coming through. Not long after the flooding in Brisbane, Deen Brothers Earthmoving went out in their earthmoving equipment. Habib Deen tells me that he and 40 volunteers from the Islamic Council of Queensland used both earthmoving equipment and human labour to help the Brisbane flood cleanup.
All this goodwill clearly demonstrates that the opposition’s arguments in debating the flood levy bill, with regard to donations and donations drying up, were clearly vexatious. In closing, I acknowledge those from Club Pine Rivers: President Bob Ebborn, CEO Wayne Moffatt and all of the executive and staff for their amazing efforts to raise money for Queenslanders in so much need. Their example again demonstrates why we should support community clubs like Club Pine Rivers who give so much back to their community.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Natural Disasters</title>,Adjournment,42,1
