Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (12:31):  I move:


That the Committee does not insist on amendments 5 and 41 to which the House has disagreed and agrees to the amendments made by the House in their place.


The House of Representatives has agreed to 46 of the 48 amendments made to this legislation by the Senate. The two that were opposed both related to paid parental leave in schedule 7. The original schedule 7 was intended to remove the requirement for all employers to act as the pay clerk for the government's Paid Parental Leave Scheme. In passing the original schedule 7, the House of Representatives demonstrated its commitment to removing this administrative burden for all businesses from 1 July 2014. The Senate's revised schedule 7 would have removed that requirement only for employers with fewer than 20 employees. In opposing these amendments, the House of Representatives agreed to its own amendment that would omit schedule 7 of the bill relating to paid parental leave and make a consequential amendment to the commencement provision in the bill. This measure has since been introduced into the House of Representatives in a separate bill, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment Bill 2014.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:10):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Dastyari and Bishop today relating to the regulation of financial services.


On the eve of the Western Australian by-election, the government is scrambling to find public support for Future of Financial Advice reforms that clearly favour the interests of one powerful sector over the interests of consumers. We have witnessed the government scrambling to find public support for its proposal to repeal sections of the Future of Financial Advice reforms. On the eve of the Western Australian by-election, there has been a long, loud chorus by consumer and community groups criticising the government's proposed changes. On the eve of the Western Australian by-election, this week Senator Cormann penned a long defence of the FoFA repeals in the Australian Financial Review, only to scramble backwards, in retreat, a few hours later. Senator Cormann is retreating in the face of overwhelming public concern. It has been astonishing to watch this process unfold. 


It started with Senator Sinodinos's sheepish announcement of the repeals just before Christmas. There were his nervous attempts to defend his position in this chamber. His constant repetition of 'implementation and compliance costs' failed to win the support of consumers, customers and, more worryingly, the market regulator. In fact, the regulator was forced into making a very nervous admission of its own, which is that it was facing the prospect of the repeal of the very same consumer protections it had argued for. 


The government's proposal to repeal these important aspects of FoFA have now descended into a huge embarrassment for the Abbott government. The Prime Minister needs to take responsibility for the astonishing manner in which this has been handled. We heard today from a senator from Western Australia, Senator Cormann, appealing to those saving for their retirement. We in the Labor Party are only too well aware of the challenges of saving for retirement. My office has been inundated with phone calls, emails, faxes and letters from people who lost a large proportion of their retirement savings to trailing fees and commissions before Labor introduced its extensive package of FoFA reforms. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I want to ensure that this is clear to Senator Cormann: these people have lost a large proportion of their principal sum—not just the profit, the interest or any annual return. They have lost a large proportion of the money which they started with and invested in good faith. Their retirement savings have been diminished by the advice of people claiming to be acting in their best interests. 


I have heard Senator Cormann talking about giving consumers a choice and the benefit of robust competition. I invite the senator from Western Australia to talk to the consumers who have contacted my office to voice their concerns. Many of them were on the verge of retirement. These are the very people Senator Cormann was appealing to during question time today—people in their 50s and 60s who have also been astonished to discover that their own parents, who are in their 80s and 90s, have been fleeced by the trailing fees and commissions that were apparently in their best interests. 


That is right: before Labor introduced the FoFA reforms, retirees in their twilight years were conned into paying commissions and trailing fees that were plainly not in the best interests of these consumers. It is not enough for the government to pause the process until after the Western Australian Senate election. Western Australians know only too well, as do all Australians, what happens when advice is not provided in the best interests of consumers. The actions of the government have not been good enough.

I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted. 




Senator SIEWERT:
  I table the explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The recent decision by Minister Hunt to exempt the Western Australian shark cull from federal environment protection laws, in the ""national interest"", is an outrageous abuse of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.


The Western Australian Government's controversial policy to catch and kill sharks to apparently protect public safety and tourism is recklessly cruel and needlessly destructive.


Section 158 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is generally used for the purposes of defence, security or a national emergency. It is outrageous that Minister Hunt, with the support of the Prime Minister, is abusing this provision and making a loophole of a section that is there for genuine national emergencies.


In the past section 158 has been used to respond appropriately to devastating natural disasters: floods and bush fires, or as a response to human made disasters like the Montara oil spill. It has also been used to protect endangered species - like the Christmas Island bat emergency breeding program.


It is unconscionable to use this exemption provision to kill vulnerable and protected species. Section 158 in the past has been used in the interests of protecting endangered species and the environment or for emergencies where there was a risk to endangered species rather than an intent to kill them.


If the Minister for the Environment is failing in his duty to uphold the intent of the Act, then it is up to Parliament to hold the Government to account, and ensure that this exemption, and any similar exemption into the future, is not permitted.


The Save Our Sharks Bill seeks to void the Ministerial exemption granted on 10 January 2014 in relation to the 72 baited drum lines in Western Australia, and ensure that no similar declaration or exemption will have any effect.


To date the drum lines have caught 104 sharks, including 101 tiger sharks. 40 of these were either dead or have been destroyed, with 30 sharks caught over 3 metres. We do not know how many have died on release but anecdotal evidence suggests that many don't survive.


In less than two months at least two mako sharks – which are protected under the EPBC Act as a migratory species – have been killed by the drum lines.


The Government's program was supposedly targeted at 3 species of shark, with the focus largely being the great white shark. However, as acknowledged by the WA EPA, great white sharks are predominantly in Western Australian waters in September to December. It is not surprising therefore that the drum lines haven't caught a great white shark. They have however caught a lot of tiger sharks. Tiger sharks have been involved in very few attacks and none in recent history. This highlights the fact that this program was a knee-jerk public relations measure, not an emergency response in the national interest.


Having approved the WA Government's program and accepted the ""conditions"" the WA Government has set, the Federal Government has not enforced the conditions or in fact even monitored implementation.


Despite Minister Hunt announcing that he has requested a ""full environmental assessment"" of WA's mitigation strategy before deciding whether or not to extend the culling beyond 30 April, the damage that has already been caused by this senseless policy cannot be undone. What is needed is a foolproof guarantee that no similar exemption will be granted into the future and recognition that the intent of this failed policy was completely flawed and ignored all scientific research and alternative approaches.


Our oceans are under increasing pressures from a diverse and complex set of threats. We need a Minister FOR the Environment not a Minister AGAINST the Environment. We need a Minister that will protect our marine life, not circumvent the very legislation that is meant to protect it.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

  The government does not support an inquiry into these matters. It is unwarranted and unnecessary. We all care for the reef and are custodians of it. Significant work has already been undertaken to protect and support the reef. That is why we have the Reef 2050 Plan, with the Reef Trust to provide $40 million for specific work to improve water quality along the reef. An inquiry at this time would only delay, confuse and potentially pre-empt the findings of the comprehensive strategic assessment of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area and adjacent coastal zone that is currently being undertaken by the Australian and Queensland governments. An inquiry of this type would also involve matters relating to the Abbot Point dredging and dredge spoil disposal project, which are the subject of judicial review proceedings in the Federal Court and before the AAT. Minister Hunt will make a well-informed consideration of the issues related to this proposed development with the full assessment information.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:51):  Yes, Mr Deputy President, we object to this motion being taken as formal. I seek the indulgence of the Senate to make a short statement to explain our reasons. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you. Labor is denying that this motion be taken as formal because we do not believe complex and contested matters, including matters that concern foreign relations, should be dealt with in summary fashion by this chamber. It is the case that Labor leaders and managers in this place have previously drawn the attention of the chamber to our concern about dealing with complex and contested matters by way of formal motions. We previously expressed that concern both in government and in opposition. The moving of formal motions that deal with complex and contested matters compels senators to take a binary position on these matters, without debate. The giving of short periods of notice—usually one day—means that there is often little consultation before the mover is on his or her feet seeking the support of the chamber. 


Whilst formal motions remain a useful mechanism for dealing with routine motions such as committee matters, the introduction of bills and Parliamentary Zone approvals, they have much less utility when employed to pursue complex matters. For that reason, today I am restating and reaffirming Labor's long-held position that complex and contested matters should not be pursued by way of formal motions. I also flag that Labor will not support the suspension of standing orders to bring on debate on such motions, except in the most exceptional of circumstances.


Mr Deputy President, as you would be aware, the Procedure Committee is currently undertaking a review of the routine of business in the Senate, and I would encourage the committee to give careful consideration as to how the Senate should deal with motions that concern non-routine matters.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.   




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you. I am not going to move to suspend standing orders. I could do that in these circumstances, and take up half an hour, but I am not going to. I just want to say that I do not accept the premise that foreign affairs matters cannot be dealt with in motions. In fact, it is often the only way you can have matters deal with in a timely manner. Only yesterday the Labor Party brought forward a motion in relation to Sri Lanka—quite appropriately, and we supported it—and the Human Rights Council is making a decision on that later this week. It is important in that context for the parliament to be able to express an opinion. 


This motion relates to the Israeli occupation and illegal settlements on the West Bank. It is 2014, the United Nations Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. This motion was to call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Bishop, to publicly acknowledge that all settlements are illegal and in breach of the fourth Geneva convention. She denied that when she was in Israel recently, and the claim she made was outrageous and absolutely contrary to international law. 


It is important in this context to recognise that we have to continue to campaign for the Israeli government to cease the expansion of settlements in the West Bank. I want to strongly put on the record that the Greens do want this matter debated at length. Several members of parliament attended the get-together yesterday to celebrate the UN Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. We want to express very firmly—and we will continue to do so—that Israel's illegal settlements in the West Bank cannot be allowed to continue. We have to make a stand for fairness and justice for the Palestinian people. 


I want to go back to accepting the premise that foreign affairs cannot be dealt with. We argue that they can and should be dealt with in this parliament in the manner in which we are proposing. (Time expired)

Senator FIFIELD:
  Thank you. It is often fraught to deal with complex foreign affairs issues by way of motions. If this motion had been taken as formal, the government would have voted against it. I will briefly outline our reasons for that.


The Australian government does strongly support the resumption of final status negotiations aimed at reaching a just and lasting two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side, in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders. The question of Israeli settlements is a key point of negotiations for any resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, and the Australian government will not pre-empt outcomes of ongoing final status negotiations.


Australia does stand ready to assist in any way it can to support the Middle East peace process, including through supporting Palestinian development. Australian assistance to the Palestinian territories in 2013-14 will be $55 million, focused on improving governance, rural livelihoods and the delivery of basic services to Palestinians.

Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (15:58):  Tomorrow, Wednesday, 26 March, marks the fifth anniversary of one of Australia's most high-profile financial collapses. I refer of course to Storm Financial. There were other great frauds prior to that and there have been many other abuses since. Some of the names I mention—Bankwest, Commonwealth Financial Planning, Trio, Westpoint—are now well-known names that have been involved in financial scandal and financial harm to thousands, indeed tens of thousands, of Australians. 


 


So what I am about to say is not news to anyone, but in this matter of public importance it is worth noting the significance of tomorrow's date, because in the not too distant future we will be inquiring into legislation introduced into the House last week on the Future of Financial Advice reforms. It will go to the Senate economics committee for investigation and, either prior to June or in the second half of this year, we will discuss in this chamber momentous legislation that affects the livelihood, the savings and the retirement of millions of Australians.


The financial scandals of all of those companies that I mentioned in my introduction—Storm Financial, Bankwest, Commonwealth Financial Planning, Trio and Westpoint—were occasioned by greed, fraud, excessive reward and incentivised commission payments to salespeople and those involved for a livelihood in the sale of financial products. All of those financial scandals resulted in heartbreaking loss: the loss of millions of dollars to individual Australians, the loss of assets built up over time and the loss of houses, as well as the breaking up of families, the displacement of children and the ruining of lives. Without exception, each of those scandals could have been prevented and was occasioned by greed and avarice on the part of thousands of individuals who gave out bad advice, unnecessary advice, improper advice and illegal advice. Innocent men and women who were seeking assistance to plan their savings, the purchase of their home, the purchase of an asset or funding to educate their children at school and university lost their life savings. All of it was avoidable and should have been avoided.


Last Friday, as the Minister for Finance and acting Assistant Treasurer advised us at question time, the Assistant Treasurer made a long overdue but still inadequate statement concerning the FoFA legislation repeal and/or amendment. I say the statement that he made last Friday or last Thursday was long overdue because this government for some time has been aware—as has been every member of parliament in this place and the other place—of the growing concern in the Australian community about the government's attempt to backdoor the introduction of commission payments for the sale of financial products. That is backdooring and making conflicted remuneration legal.


I say it was also an inadequate statement because the draft bill, plain and simple, is an election pay-off to five companies—four banks and one financial house, AMP. They are five companies so awash with surplus capital, record dividend payments to shareholders, record market share growth and generally record share prices that their naked greed in exploiting additional revenue streams amazes, surprises and indeed shocks all observers of this industry in Australia.


The opposition—the Labor Party, the party which when in government was responsible for the most breathtaking set of worthwhile financial reforms only two years ago—say upfront in this debate the following: we are opposed to conflicted remuneration and commission-based payments for general financial advice. We say upfront (a) that we are opposed to a situation where financial advisers can earn sales commission and trailing fees from product providers; (b) that, when financial advisers can also receive soft dollar inducements such as overseas education junkets, that is graft and corruption and should not be part of the deal, and we are opposed to that practice; and (c) that financial advisers will not need to tell their clients about these fees or other benefits that they gain for the sale of financial products to those consumers or clients who seek their advice, and we are opposed upfront—two years ago, now and forevermore—to those sorts of practices.


To return to my earlier introductory remarks about extra-large revenue streams for NAB, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac Bank and AMP, we say that those new and additional revenue streams for clerks, for tellers, for salespeople, for financial planners and for financial advisers who upscale the sale of financial products without adequate disclosure to consumers or clients are a con. We disapprove of it. We do not want to participate in it.


During a Senate inquiry which has been foreshadowed into this legislation, we will pay close attention to the submissions and the evidence that we gather. On the basis of that inquiry, I will be very, very surprised if the position I foreshadowed at the outset of this discussion is not our permanent position. We are opposed in principle to the amendments sought to be introduced into the House last week and foreshadowed by Senator Cormann on Thursday or Friday of last week in this place.


If the legislation foreshadowed by Senator Cormann is introduced, is passed and becomes law, who wins? We know who the winners are. They are the four banks I named and AMP, commission-based salespeople and retailers of financial products who persuade banks to recommend to customers the sale of their particular product—by that I mean the ABC equity fund as opposed to the DEF equity fund. The people who flog those products either to the banks or to the staff of banks and AMP—who then flog those products to consumers—are the winners, and wholesalers are the same.


Who, interestingly enough, do we glean from public debate, opposes these changes foreshadowed by Senator Cormann? Firstly, National Seniors; secondly, the Council on the Ageing; thirdly, the Choice organisation on behalf of consumers; fourthly, Industry Super Australia on behalf of industry funds with membership in excess of five million Australians. Interestingly enough, there is a fifth group that has come out publicly so far and foreshadowed opposition, the Financial Planning Association. Think about that: seniors, aged people, old people, persons going into their retirement, consumers and workers—blue-collar and white-collar—who are members of industry funds. We are talking not five million, not seven million, not eight million but the best part of 10 million people in this country who, through their representative organisations or their professional associations, have voluntarily foreshadowed without equivocation total opposition to this bill introduced by Senator Cormann this week on behalf of ANZ, Bankwest, NAB, Commonwealth and AMP but on behalf of nobody else.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2014-03-25,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:09):  Senator Bishop, in his 10-minute speech, referred to the absolutely heartbreaking financial collapses of a number of financial advising firms and the devastating effect that undoubtedly created for the people whose money was lost. And he canvassed a number of reasons for why that happened. Indeed, the original Ripoll inquiry, as it is now known, had as its catalyst these collapses. The report of that 2009 Ripoll inquiry was in fact bipartisan. All members of the committee in that report worked together to come up with a very solid piece of work which made a number of recommendations as to how we could work in this place to minimise the risk of similar collapses occurring in the future.


But, when FoFA legislation was put forward by the previous government, it was not a particularly accurate reflection of the recommendations from the Ripoll inquiry. It went much further. As a result, rather than a bipartisan approach being available at that point, the coalition felt it needed to put in a dissenting report so that it could more accurately reflect the findings of the Ripoll inquiry, which had conducted the most thorough in-depth investigations of these issues there possibly could have been. As I mentioned, the FoFA legislation went much further.


It is my proposition that, if we can get the changes to FoFA that we are now proposing through, the FoFA legislation that would then be in place would be a much truer and more accurate reflection of the recommendations of the original Ripoll inquiry than what we currently see.


At the recent ASIC inquiry hearings for the Economics References Committee, the chair of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, Greg Medcraft, noted that only about 20 per cent of Australians are in a position to receive or are receiving proper financial advice. In his view, at least half of Australians should be enjoying the benefit of detailed and thorough financial advice. But there is no possibility whatsoever of achieving this aim unless the advice that is available to Australians is both accessible and affordable.


As in all regulatory matters, you need to strike the appropriate balance between imposing regulations to protect consumers and making sure they are accessible and affordable. Our contention is that the previous government's FoFA legislation did not strike that appropriate balance. On the contrary, it worked quite strongly to make financial advice that Australians need—I repeat: the advice that far more Australians need than are currently receiving it—far too expensive and less likely to be actually accessed.


I have a couple of key points. First, I want to make it clear that we are not abolishing FoFA. On the contrary, we are just fiddling at the edges, making improvements to the way that it works in line with our election commitments. As I mentioned, our election commitments are based on the coalition members' findings in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the FoFA bills and more accurately reflect the outcomes of the Ripoll inquiry.


It is important also to note that we are not abolishing the best-interest duty; we are keeping it. But what we are doing is ensuring that there is a greater certainty for both consumers and financial advisers on how the best-interest duty will operate. It is also important to note that we are reintroducing sales commissions or conflicted remuneration for financial advisers.


On conflicted remuneration and commissions, I will make a couple of points. Mr Chris Bowen said recently a number of times—and I think he said it again this morning—that balanced scorecard payments are the same as commissions. I can tell you they are not. A balanced scorecard arrangement exists where an employee receives incentive remuneration that is calculated by reference to both volume based and non-volume based factors; for example, customer satisfaction, meeting training requirements and compliance targets et cetera. Importantly, that incentive payment is only allowed where it does not conflict advice and is only a small part of the overall bonus. And that is consistent with the original legislation introduced by Mr Bill Shorten when he was financial services minister. This is what Mr Shorten said in his second reading speech on FoFA on this issue on 24 November 2011:


For the most part, advisers will not be able to receive remuneration—from product issuers or from anyone else—which could reasonably be expected to influence financial advice provided to a retail client. 


If an adviser is confident that a particular stream of income does not conflict advice, then these reforms do not prevent them from receiving that income. For example, in the case of the receipt of income related to volume of product sales or investible funds, there is a presumption that that income would conflict advice. However, this is a presumption only, and if the adviser can demonstrate that the receipt of the income does not conflict advice then such remuneration will be permissible under the bill.


That was from his second reading speech on 24 November 2011. It was also reflected in Bill Shorten's explanatory memorandum to his FoFA legislation. It said:


However, if it can be proved that, in the circumstances, the remuneration could not reasonably be expected to influence the choice of financial product recommended, or the financial product advice given, to retail clients … the remuneration is not conflicted and is not banned.


There was also an example of a payment under a balanced scorecard arrangement that could rebut the conflicted remuneration presumption in the explanatory memorandum.


Our proposal in this respect gives effect to that proposition contained in Mr Shorten's explanatory memorandum and second reading speech—nothing more and nothing less. The proposed provision provides business with certainty that they can continue to remunerate their employees under a balanced scorecard arrangement where that payment does not conflict with advice, as was envisaged by the original legislation and as enunciated by the then Assistant Treasurer and now Leader of the Opposition. Whilst the balanced scorecard payment provides an incentive for the employee to make more sales, it forms only a small part of the employee's total remuneration, and the employee needs to have satisfied a range of other criteria, such as customer satisfaction, to be eligible for the bonus.


Furthermore, the bonus is a one-off payment; there is no ongoing payment in relation to past sales—that is, there are no trailing commissions. By contrast, a commission is directly based on the number of products sold and no other non-volume related factors. The commission payment would in the past have been ongoing—that is, a trailing commission. Neither is the case with balanced scorecard payments.


As the acting Assistant Treasurer noted in a published editorial piece over the last few days,


Finally under Labor's FoFA legislation it was always envisaged that benefits to employees calculated on the volume of sales were permissible under a so-called balanced scorecard approach. 


In a fuller version of the article, Senator Cormann wrote:


Labor in government, however, never got around to properly implementing that part of their stated intention through regulation. Consumer protections are inherent under this approach provided for under our legislation because there are clear criteria to ensure that any benefit does not directly influence advice. If, contrary to our clear expectations and our intention not to bring back conflicted remuneration the personal advice or for advice is providing general advice, developments in the market warrant our intervention. It could and would be addressed very quickly by relevant regulation. We don't believe it will be necessary.


In relation to the general advice exemption for employees of product advisers, this is about levelling the playing field across the financial services market after the special deals that Mr Shorten did with industry funds only.


Incentive payments for employees of product providers to provide general product advice are not conflicted remuneration. Their application is very limited: namely, to employees selling products issued or sold by licensees who have not provided any personal advice to the retail client in the last 12 months. Again, this is not intended to open the door for a return of conflicted remuneration, personal advice or advisers providing general advice; this is about restoring some competitive neutrality in the market as part of our efforts to ensure that we have the right balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection and affordable access to high-quality advice. We want consumers to continue to benefit from robust competition between both different business models and different businesses across the financial services market.


To summarise, the government continue to support the underlying goals of the FoFA reforms and we do not propose to change the vast majority of those reforms, but we do believe that the FoFA reforms went too far in imposing red tape and additional costs on business and, of course, those additional costs will be passed through to the consumer. Analysis by Treasury estimates that the government's amendments, if passed, would save the industry an average of approximately $190 million a year with further savings of $90 million in implementation costs. Those savings will, of course, be passed on to clients and improve the affordability and access of financial advice to Australians. The government is committed to amending the FoFA legislation to reduce these costs and make financial advice more affordable to consumers and has undertaken substantial consultation on the amendments and will continue to do so in the coming months.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2014-03-25,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:19):  Sometimes working in this chamber feels a bit like The Truman Show with cameras, live broadcasting and people looking down on you. What would you make of this government and this debate today if you were a member of the public, looking in from the outside? This is a government, I would point out, which has lost the faith of the public faster than any other first-term government in the last 40 years. I will tell you what I think it looks like. If you are a powerful organisation in this country, you have money and you donate it to this government—the Liberals or National Party—they will use this place to deliver for you. If you want a return to a free-for-all system of financial commissions and a winding back of consumer protections to help your business—ignoring recent disasters and the damage done to consumers of financial services, such as the collapse of Storm Financial or the government's disastrous managed investment schemes—all you have to do is donate. And guess what? The Liberals and Nationals will deliver. If it looks obvious that backroom deals have been done on these FoFA reforms—with the industry lobbyists so favoured by this government—then why wouldn't there be special favours for other legislation in front of this parliament?


If you do not like a mining tax because it nibbles at your superprofits and you donate, then the Liberals and Nationals will deliver. If you run a polluting power plant and you do not want to pay for the damage that burning fossil fuels cause to our environment and you donate, then the Liberals and Nationals will deliver. If you think the government is here to prioritise the delivery of health care or education or a future free from climate shocks, then this government is not for you. Why? I suspect there are no donations in these issues for the Liberal-National government. I have said it till I have been blue in the face: our political system is corrupted and undermined by rent-seeking special interests—vested interests—seeking to influence political decisions, regardless of the impact on the public good or public interest. Ross Gittins, one of the country's most experienced economic writers, has written several excellent articles on this subject recently.


Looking from the outside in, it is as if the executive government of Australia operates in a closed loop of special interests, lobbyists, staffers, ex-politicians, corporate rent-seekers and donations. It largely occurs in secret, undisclosed or vaguely disclosed years after the fact. The Australian public will not even know who donated to this government in the lead-up to the last federal election until February 2015.


The proposed winding back of FoFA reforms are a classic case. The previous government's proposal delivered sensible reforms to financial advice legislation to stop runaway rorts like Storm Financial, remove conflicts of interest in commissions and provide some simple consumer safeguards. Contrary to what Senator Cormann told the Senate today, there is nothing complex about understanding conflicts of interest or how they undermine consumer rights.


Speaking of conflicts of interest, this government is directly embroiled in its own conflict of interest in this debate today—explaining donations from the big end of the finance town directly to decision makers able to influence FoFA reforms. The lead proponent for the case against the previous government's FoFA reforms was the Financial Services Council. They represent many of the banks—and AMP, as mentioned earlier by Senator Bishop—that said they stood to lose from the original reforms and that they opposed them. So they naturally sought to influence the result in their members' favour. Other than submissions and direct lobbying, one way it would appear to have tried to influence the debate and the positions of the major parties is through political donations.


Over the last few years, not including the recent donations that have yet to be disclosed, the Financial Services Council donated over $42,000 to the major parties. These donations were not just general donations to the head office; they were targeted to the major relevant financial policyholders at the time in each party. The donations were: $11,000 to Joe Hockey's electorate fundraising arm; to Mr Tony Smith, the then shadow parliamentary secretary for tax reform; to Chris Bowen's local re-election fund; to the electorate of the then Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury; and $10,000 to—guess who?—Senator Cormann. These were not donations towards good public policy, as Senator Cormann would have you believe, but rather they were donations targeted and tailored towards influencing the people who had the power to make decisions about financial policy in this country—policy which could influence their members' profits. Two of the four people, Senator Cormann and Mr Smith, who authored the coalition's dissenting report into the FoFA changes, received sizeable donations from the Financial Services Council. 


I encourage all members of this place and the public to read the coalition's dissenting report on FoFA reforms. Seemingly, the Financial Services Council wrote it. Their views are mentioned often enough in it. I am not saying directly that the coalition's position on FoFA is entirely due to donations; I am sure there is an unhealthy dose of free market ideology thrown into the bargain as well. But it sure looks bad to those watching us on TV. How could the public draw any other conclusion? The Greens have long been calling for greater transparency with donations and with lobbying. The public has a right to know the target of donations or lobbying efforts that seek to influence decisions on public policy.


Maybe it is not the Truman show today, rather it is groundhog day. Again, we are debating legislation brought in by this government to look after the big end of town. We have now had months of debate on the carbon bill repeals. It is legislation that is designed to prop up the big, dirty polluters and their profits that are threatened by a jobs rich, emerging, clean energy industry—all in the face of the dire need for immediate, strong and real action on climate change. And then there is the repeal bill for the tax on mining industry superprofits. Again, the Liberal-National government are looking after the big end of town, their mates and their donors, and are supporting the rent-seeking, profit-chasing obsession of the big miners, who are determined to put the tens of billions of dollars of profits they make, most of which goes overseas and does not stay in Australia, ahead of small businesses, superannuants and the broader Australian community. 


And let us not forget modern trade deals, the so-called free trade deals under negotiation, and the push by the biggest, most powerful global corporations in the world to have Trojan Horse clauses added to these trade deals—the ISDS clauses or investor state dispute settlement clauses. These give corporations legal rights to sue sovereign governments if their future legislative changes impact on their future profits. Even the Howard government would not consider the inclusion of such clauses in their trade deals. Under this government, where anything goes if you are a wealthy corporation and have influence, such dangerous clauses are on the negotiating table. 




Senator Seselja:
  Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. We are hearing about trade deals. That is not the matter before the Senate at the moment in this MPI.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  There is no point of order.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I must have hit a nerve there. And now we have this: the government's proposed changes to FoFA regulations. These changes are designed to help make more money, fee income, for the big banks and financial services companies such as AMP. As I have stated previously in this chamber, banks and financial services companies no longer make most of their income and profits from simple deposits and loans. They make the majority of their income from selling financial products and financial services. While these FoFA regulations are about protecting consumers and the reputation of the financial planning industry, who oppose these regulations, they are designed to help the profits of the big end of town.


What next, I wonder? I remind the Liberal-National Party, the government, that the public expects that the job of government is to protect the public good, not just the profits of big corporations that are determined to put the interests of shareholders ahead of the interest of the Australian public. It easy sitting in here all day listening to debate to forget the really important point that there is a world outside those doors and windows. We live in a society not in an economy. Contrary to what this government believe, they are not always the same thing. We need reform in this country. We need reform to drive clean energy transition. We need reform for a fairer tax system. We need reform to protect consumers. It takes bravery and courage to push through reform. We need legislation that strikes a better balance between the profits of the powerful and the people—consumers, Australian taxpayers and small businesses.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (16:29):  I too rise to contribute to this debate this afternoon, concerned, as we on this side all are, about protecting consumer interests in relation to the farce that has become the Future of Financial Advice legislation and Senator Cormann's pause that he announced today to those regulations, which he suggested was for the purpose of more consultation. We would be very pleased if there were genuine consultation about this issue, because it simply is a fact that the proposals, as developed by former Minister Sinodinos—the draft regulations and the legislation—were issued with literally no consultation at all. They absolutely reflect, as Senator Whish-Wilson just said, the interests of the financial industry, not the consumer in any way, shape or form.


I was thinking, as I was listening to the debate, about the events around the collapse of Storm, Westpoint and Trio. I was a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services when the collapse occurred, and I was part of the investigation that that committee undertook.




Senator Williams:
  So was I.




Senator STEPHENS:
  Senator Williams, you were not here at the time.



The PRESIDENT:  Through the chair, please.




Senator STEPHENS:
  I just wanted to make this really important point: we travelled quite significantly and time and time again we saw the extent to which the financial advisory industry was so poorly regulated. All we could do was listen with jaws dropping to stories of people who were being advised—in good faith, they thought—to do the most extraordinarily unwise things, risking their financial future. I know Senator Williams has a particular interest in this. We have shared many stories about how people in the bush have been caught in exactly the same kinds of situations. The proposals that we had to consider and the recommendations that were made out of that inquiry really reflected the horrible circumstances that were part of the evidence to the inquiry. We really felt that the government and the opposition knew that there was a need for some critical action to be taken.


I will give you just one story—perhaps I might share two. One story is of the Doyles—Barry and Deanna Doyle—from Townsville. They were an ordinary couple in their 60s who were not particularly wealthy and not particularly sophisticated financially either. Mrs Doyle was retired. Mr Doyle was still working part time. As a result of financial advice that they never should have been given, they ended up owning a share portfolio costing over $2 million, with debts to match, on which their annual interest payments eventually rose to nearly $200,000. The Doyles had been modestly secure before they were advised by Storm Financial. They had paid off their mortgage. They had about $600,000 in superannuation. But Storm's investment advice was to borrow against their home and use the cash to raise yet more money to invest. They increased their borrowings—or exposure to the stock market—on the advice of Storm Financial 11 times in two years and ended up not only losing their super and their share portfolio but also with a debt of over $450,000 on their previously unencumbered house and with not enough income to make the repayments. Quite frankly, their situation was that they were completely financially wiped out.


We heard story after story. There were thousands of people who, on the advice of the financial service industry, entered into high-risk transactions in which they were likely to lose their money and even their homes—and they did. I was particularly taken by a story that we heard in Wollongong from another gentleman, a very articulate but desperately angry man who had been the victim of a car accident. He had received a compensation payout which he had been advised by the insurer needed to be invested wisely because this insurance payout meant he would not be eligible for any kind of Centrelink payment until he reached retirement age. He was in his late 40s at the time. With the advice of a financial adviser, he invested all his money in a particular strategy and was completely wiped out. He was, at the time we spoke to him, almost homeless, living on the charity of friends, not eligible for any kind of social security support and not eligible for any kind of compensation for the way in which the financial adviser had completely ripped him off not only through gouging of fees but also through poor investments. The total unfairness of this man's situation was enough for us, as committee members, to say, 'Something must be done.'


The things we recommended in that report which were brought into effect in the Labor government's legislation are now being systematically challenged and wound back. The idea has been raised of dumping the opt-in demand that requires financial advisers to ask their clients whether they want to continue with an investment. The removal of that opt-in requirement would mean that they no longer need to ask the client's agreement before collecting fees automatically every year for financial advice that the clients have never sought. Any existing fee arrangements would continue to exist unless the arrangement was terminated. The opt-in requirement sounds like something being done in all fairness for transparency and good financial practice, one would have thought, but it is something that the financial services industry has resisted from the beginning and has systematically campaigned against to ensure that Senator Sinodinos was prepared to accept their advice. 


The other issue is fee disclosure. The legislation that the government is now moving actually removes the requirements for advisers to disclose fees to all customers who entered into a fee arrangement before 1 July 2013, when FoFA commenced—so all existing clients can be kept in the dark. This is what the government is talking about as a reform. There is a trend that I want to flag, which I am going to come back to very shortly on this issue, and that is the influence of the financial services industry on the government's approach to the administration of charitable trusts, where we are seeing the same kind of insidious insistence that fees and charges be hidden from the clients. What happens if you are a trustee of a financial organisation, managing what is now called an orphan trust where there are no living trustees other than the trustee manager? We are seeing the same kind of approach that will hide financial charges and gouge the management of financial affairs in these kinds of financial investment mechanisms. 


This issue is really about the financial industry's influence on this government. It is certainly not about protecting the interests of consumers in any way, shape or form. It will lead to pensioners and other people in their retirement years losing their savings all over again. It is poor policy, it is bad policy and it is going to leave the most vulnerable people, who are not financially literate enough to understand their superannuation, at the mercy of a gouging financial industry. It is just outrageous!

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2014-03-25,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales) (16:39):  I must make some comments about Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution on this MPI. He talked about donations to political parties. I want to again put on the record that, when the former Greens leader, Senator Bob Brown, was here and there was debate on the Triabunna mill in Tasmania, he wanted reforms. He wanted changes. He wanted this done and that done. Then a short time after—I was listening to it on radio—we heard the declaration of the largest donation to any political party in Australia's history—$1.58 million. I will repeat the number: $1.58 million. It was donated to the Greens by Mr Graeme Wood, the owner of Wotif. All of sudden, the Greens were batting for the business and interests of Mr Graeme Wood. Now we hear all of the holier than thou Greens saying: 'These donations are terrible.' Come on, get off the cat's tail! This is hypocrisy at its greatest level. It was a $1.58 million donation. 


I have just listened to Senator Stephens's contribution on this MPI. I was on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiring into the Storm Financial crash. In fact, I started this job on 1 July 2008, and in January 2009, seven months later, I went to Redcliffe. I was the first politician out of the 226 politicians in Canberra who went to meet with the Storm Financial victims up there in Redcliffe in order to see what I could do to help them and to get a parliamentary inquiry into the Storm Financial crash. 


Of course the Greens like tree planting. The managed investment schemes of Timbercorp and Great Southern involved buying farmland and claiming the purchase of that land off their tax. The farmer cannot do that, but those managed investment schemes could do it on the basis of planting trees. Of course Timbercorp and Great Southern went belly up—and there were other big crashes. But as far as Senator Stephens's comments go, she has missed one point: the products on the market were wrong. Storm Financial was destined to fail—full stop. People were so heavily geared, so leveraged with debt, that, once the stock market turned down, they went down. This is where it is ASIC's job to see that financial products on the market, that are out there for people to purchase, are strong, solid and viable. It is why there is an ASIC inquiry at the moment. I am pushing for ASIC to have stronger powers in order to call for a stock-loss audit so that they can phone up a financial planner and say: 'From this minute you are no longer a financial planner. You can go to the AAT'—the Appeals Tribunal—'and appeal our decision against you, if you wish.' That is what I want to see put in place so that, when financial planners do the wrong thing, they are simply struck off in the instant of one phone call. 


I have some concerns, I admit, with any changes to FoFA, but then I had a good look at the detail of the proposed legislation. The first recommendation, which was a unanimous one by the committee which I was part of, was that the interests of the client must come first. We are simply making a small adjustment to section 961B(2) so that legal uncertainty for advisers will be removed. So 961B remains and 961J clearly states that the interests of the client will come first—and, if it does not, I want to see ASIC with the powers to just kick that financial planner straight out of business so that people get good, strong, solid advice that is in their best interests. This is exactly what we are doing. 


There is the opt-in test. We received more than 400 submissions at the PJC inquiry and only one suggested the opt-in test. Guess who it was? It was Industry SuperFunds. Guess who they are in bed with? The Australian Labor Party. It is why the opt-in was put forward. It is why the opposition are defending the opt-in test. Treasury is projecting $190 million costs a year, with a further $90 million savings a year. I want to make this point to the chamber: if you add costs to how financial planners do their job, who is going to pay for it? I tell you who is going to pay for it—the client, the person seeking the advice. If it gets too expensive then people are not going to seek advice, and that is a real worry. When we have almost $1 trillion in superannuation funds, with almost 30 per cent of those being self-managed, we need good, strong, solid advice to protect the best interests of the clients—and that is what we will get. 


I commend Senator Cormann for the work he has done on this. The opposition have done what is expected. The Ripoll report went further than what the committee agreed on. At that time, the coalition, then in opposition, put in a dissenting report. We made it quite clear before the election and after the election that we were going to introduce the recommendations made in the dissenting report. That is the reason we are pursuing this line. 


To say that the commissions and the remunerations will be put back in place is simply wrong. That is not the case. With respect to personal advice, that cannot be the case. Senator Cormann has made that quite clear. There is nothing worse than seeing people who have worked hard all the lives lose their money. I was the first politician to meet with Storm Financial victims. The whole program was destined to fail. My colleague Senator Macdonald joined us in Townsville, and Senator Brett Mason was involved in the hearing as well.


It was a sad story. Let's say you have an expensive house, worth $1 million. You borrow half a million dollars against your house and use that for a deposit on a marginal loan and buy another $2 million worth of shares. You would have $2½ million worth of shares. The dividends on those shares are supposed to pay the interest on the $2½ million and give you $50,000 or $60,000 a year on which to live. You cannot do it. The capital growth in the share market might help you for a few years but when the share market turns down—history shows that it always does at some stage—then you are gone. The Storm Financial product was destined to fail. I feel so sorry for those people who went through so much, fearing that they would lose their houses.


ASIC did come to the fore. They put a lot of money into fighting court cases to see if an unregistered managed investment scheme was being promoted. Unfortunately, the court never made a decision. ASIC made settlements. They told me at Senate estimates that they spent that money to pursue settlements. I will go to my grave believing that it is not ASIC's job to pursue settlements in financial discrepancies and disagreements. It is ASIC's job to enforce corporate law, and they should get a judgement. Whichever way the mop flops, people can determine what they do after that.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  We will not go into mops, Senator Bilyk. The point I was making was that ASIC should have pursued judgements. There have been settlements and some people are a bit happier than they were, but these changes to FoFA are to get rid of the costs so that people can afford to get good advice. The rules will be in place; they will not be removed. The clients' interests will come first and foremost. To say that anything will change is simply wrong. There has just been a big scare campaign from those opposite as far as these changes go.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:47):  I, too, rise to take part in this debate this afternoon. It is a matter of genuine public interest. It is a matter of considerable concern. In my former role as the member for Robertson—and also as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee for Financial Services and Corporations—I had the incredible privilege of hearing the awful stories, particularly with regard to Trio Capital. I learned about Trio when I picked up that committee. People were advised very poorly—we have heard number of those stories here this afternoon—and ended up in the most desperate situations.


I can remember one Saturday morning when the sun was shining and, for all intents and purposes, it was a great day in Australia. I walked down the street in Kincumber and knocked on a door. A gentleman approached me. He had never been doorknocked by a politician before. The story that unfolded about the loss of his entire life savings of $800,000 was the first that I heard of the terrible impact of the Trio Capital range of advice that was given to people.


I do not want to paint the entire financial services sector in a negative light. That is the risk of a debate like this. There are people who are doing a great job, helping Australians to earn money, grow their wealth and improve their retirement. But that sector is very divided on this issue. I want to put on the record, before I go any further, the comments of Matthew Rowe in response to Emma Alberici, who asked the question about a point that has been much debated here this afternoon—the consumers' best interests. Let's be clear about what that means. When I go to a doctor, I expect the doctor to give me advice in my best interest, not his or hers. When I go to a lawyer, I expect the lawyer to give me advice in my best interest, not his or hers because they are subject to some sort of corrupting influence or financial incentive. When Australians today go to a financial planner, they want to know that they are going to have information given to them that will be in their best interest. That is what this legislation is going to pull apart. The FoFA reforms that the Labor government put in were seeking to ensure, for all Australians, that the advice they are given is in their best interest. But that is what is under discussion at this point, and ready for dismantling. Emma Alberici asked the core question:


Reintroducing the ability for planners to accept commissions, is that in consumers' best interests? We've talked about the interests of you and businesses like yours, is that change in the best interests of consumers?


Matthew Rowe, who is the chair of the Financial Planning Association, made it very clear. On behalf of the industry itself he said:


I don't believe it's in the best interests of consumers. I think it's a retrograde step.


That statement reveals two very important things. Financial planners who wanted to do good work for Australians are very happy with the FoFA legislation that the Labor government put through, because it is an effort to professionalise an industry where there have been sharks and shonks—people of avarice and greed—who have ripped families apart and ripped people's savings away from them, knowingly acting in their own interests instead of their clients' interests. That is what all this FoFA talk is about. 


Often people listening to these debates wonder what legislation in this place does. I was intimately associated with the FoFA legislation. I want to acknowledge the great work of the member for Oxley, Mr Ripoll, and his committee. The legislation was about ensuring that Australians can have confidence when they go to secure information about their financial future. We implemented a best-interest duty. We said that people should be able to opt in. Every two years they should have a choice put before them: do I really want to stay with this person or not? There should be annual disclosure statements provided to let you know exactly what it is that you are paying for so that you can make an informed decision about sticking with it or moving off. Conflicted remuneration was the most insidious of all elements that needed to be removed, but it is up for grabs again now because of this legislation that has been introduced by Senator Cormann.


The problems we face with the legislation that came through from the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sinodinos, are that it removes best interests, scraps opt in and gets rid of annual disclosure, and there is only a partial lifting, but a dangerous one, of conflicted remuneration. These things put Australians' hard-earned savings at risk and put the financial sector at the edge. Instead of being a critical profession, they become marginal boundary riders and a shonky profession. We cannot allow it to be that way. I urge the government in its reconsideration to hold up the FoFA reforms as they were— (Time expired)

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2014-03-25,"




Senator EDWARDS

 (
South Australia
) (
16:52
):  I rise to contribute to this debate today. I just want to confirm to everybody who is listening to this our commitment on the government side to the FoFA reforms—the Future of Financial Advice reforms. I must comment on a number of things that have been said in this chamber. I have listened to banks and the financial advisers industry being vilified in here by Senator Bishop. It is almost as though if you are a bank teller providing general advice you are a criminal.


I think that Senator Cormann has made a very bold and courageous move in embracing further debate on this legislation. The government remains, as I said, committed to implementing these improvements to the future of financial service laws, and we took that to the last election. When I look at the inquiries in 2011 prior to the implementation of this, there was broad support, and as far back as August 2011 when in opposition we raised the fact that we did not like what we saw. We went to the election and said that we would change this. The people of Australia are expecting us to implement the election promises that we took to them, and this is no different.


Unlike the Labor Party, who do not like to have a policy debate, we are going to have a policy debate. There are sections of the community that are not entirely happy and we will embrace them. We heard in question time earlier today that the superclinics in Western Australia are a dismal failure. That is a policy that they did not want to listen to advice on. We argued with the government at the time about the folly of what they were proposing. That policy never got proper scrutiny. They rammed it through, and what do we have? We have one empty GP superclinic in Western Australia, and six were promised. Typical of Labor: the policy is big and bold but they do not deliver. We do not intend to do that.


While we are talking about debating policy, the changes to the FoFA policy came about because the industry said it is going to cost so much money. While we are talking about policy, wouldn't it have been good to have had more policy debate on the pink batts program? Wouldn't it have been good to have had policy scrutiny on the cash-for-clunkers program? Wouldn't it have been good to engage and exercise a little bit of caution on GroceryWatch? What happened to GroceryWatch? And there was the mother of all policy failures: the NBN. Reportedly, it was put together on the back of a serviette on a VIP flight with the then Prime Minister—with the revolving doors of Labor's Prime Ministers—and Senator Conroy. Wouldn't it have been good if that policy had suffered a little bit more scrutiny—in fact, if that policy had had a business plan? It was the $40 billion infrastructure project of the century. What a failure that has been, yet here we are left to pick up the pieces and clean up the mess.


We are not going to do that. Like Senator Brandis, the Attorney-General, announced today, we are going to put out an exposure draft on section 18C. That is because we want to engage the community. There will be an exposure draft so that all the backbenchers, the opposition, the media and all the interest groups can have a say. That is the same scrutiny that Minister Cormann is going to apply to this. We are committed to ensuring we have the right balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection and ensuring affordable access to high-quality advice. What Labor did in government was regulatory overreach, because they do not understand—it is just easier to regulate than try and solve the problem. They just want to talk about the problem; they do not want to fix the problem. They imposed way too much unnecessary and costly regulation which ultimately has to be paid for by the people saving for their retirement. That $190 million of ongoing operational costs are going to have to be paid by the same retirees who want their money invested. Wouldn't it be much better if that $190 million a year was left in the pockets of the people who earned it and they were not burdened with this regulatory claptrap—that is the word that comes to mind—that Labor just lazily overlaid on industry.


I have a lot of sympathy for what has been going on. This is a highly technical area. The more technical and harder the argument the easier it is to knock it off its feet. The simple play from the other side is, 'We'll be ruined,' but we will not be because otherwise you will not stop fraud, you will not stop criminal activity and you will not stop the Bernie Madoffs of this world who are systematically corrupt. The rules and regulations will be there for the benefit of all the people who are good and have proper intentions. In the meantime, there is an inquiry underway, which is due to report in the middle of June. I urge all members of the public and of the Senate and the other chamber to have their input into that important inquiry.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (17:00):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the fifth report of the 44th Parliament of the committee on the examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011.


Ordered that the reports be printed.




Senator SMITH:
  by leave—I move: 


That the Senate take note of the report. 


I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' fifth report of the 44th Parliament. This report examines 22 bills introduced in the period 17 to 20 March, three of which have been deferred for further consideration, and 42 legislative instruments received in the period 1 to 7 March. The report also includes the committee's consideration of seven responses to matters raised in previous committee reports. Of the bills considered in this report, I note that the following bills are scheduled for debate during this week:


the Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2014;


Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2014;


the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Legislation Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2014


the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Classification Tools and Other Measures) Bill 2014;


the Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014; and


the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No.2].


The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with human rights, and I encourage my fellow senators to look to the committee's report to inform your deliberations on the merits of this proposed legislation.


I would like to draw senators' attention to a point of particular interest which arises in relation to a number of bills considered in the report and which highlights the committee's approach to undertaking its assessments of the compatibility of legislation with human rights. As senators would be aware, a number of bills introduced in this period of sittings are intended to further the government's deregulation agenda by the removal of spent and redundant legislation as well as the removal of regulation considered to be burdensome, unnecessary or as duplicating other regulatory arrangements. These bills include:


the Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014;


the Statute Law Revision (No 1) Bill 2014;


the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Repeal Bill 2014; and


the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission (Repeal) (No 1) Bill 2014.


From the perspective of the committee's assessment of legislation for compatibility with human rights, bills seeking strictly to repeal spent and redundant legislation, by definition, lack any substantive or practical effect that might engage, promote or limit human rights. However, where a bill seeks to repeal existing arrangements, the committee's assessment must take into account the extent to which the repeal of those arrangements may reduce or remove human rights protections. To determine this, the committee looks at the extent to which any arrangements that will remain or are proposed in place of the repealed measure offer equivalent or greater protection of human rights.


For the benefit of those involved in the development of repeal measures of this type, I note that it is therefore important that statements of compatibility address the question of whether the removal of regulation will reduce or remove human rights protections. Where existing or new arrangements will remain or take the place of repealed regulation, statements of compatibility should also provide sufficient information to support the committee's assessment of whether those remaining or proposed measures will offer equivalent or greater human rights protections.


In relation to legislative instruments, the committee examined 42 instruments for this report and will seek further information in relation to two instruments. One of these instruments amends a marine order made under the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel) National Law Act 2012, and the committee has taken the opportunity to draw attention to its concerns regarding uniform national schemes such as those routinely negotiated through COAG and other intergovernmental forums. The committee's concerns relate to the potential for these schemes to be developed and agreed on without formal human rights considerations and to restrict the capacity of jurisdictions to ensure that, once enacted, such legislation is or remains compatible with human rights obligations. In addition to restating its concerns with national scheme legislation, the committee has sought an update on the progress of consultations to amend the Protocol on Drafting National Uniform Legislation to ensure that human rights considerations are addressed in the development of such legislation.


Finally, in relation to responses to matters previously raised by the committee, the report contains consideration of seven such responses and the committee's concluding remarks on these matters.


With these comments, I commend the committee's fifth report of the 44th Parliament to the Senate.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:08):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The purpose of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014 is to amend the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009 and to repeal the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988, the Roads to Recovery Act 2000 and the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958.


This Government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century - the infrastructure Australia will need to meet the challenges and opportunities ahead. 


The Government is working with state and territory governments to deliver the nationally significant infrastructure projects to grow Australia's productivity and improve living standards. We also need to work in partnership with the private sector to maximise private capital investment in infrastructure. This collaboration between the Australian Government, states and territories and the private sector will enable the successful delivery of the infrastructure Australia expects, industries need and our people deserve.


Through the Infrastructure Investment Programme, the Government has committed $35.5 billion over 6 years to road and rail projects, including:


$6.7 billion to upgrade the Bruce Highway;


$5.6 billion to finish the duplication of the Pacific Highway;


$1.5 billion to the WestConnex project in Sydney;


$1.5 billion for the East-West Link in Melbourne;


$1 billion to continue the Gateway Motorway North upgrade in Brisbane;


$700 million for the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing;


$686 million to finish the Gateway WA Project in Perth;


$615 million to build the Swan Valley Bypass on the Perth to Darwin Highway;


$500 million for the upgrade of South Road in Adelaide;


$405 million for the F3 to M2 Link project in Sydney; and


$400 million to continue the Midland Highway upgrade in Tasmania.


The Government has also committed $300 million to finalise plans, engineering design and environmental assessments for the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail project.


Amendments to the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act2009 (the Act) are necessary to facilitate the Government's ambitious land transport infrastructure agenda.


The Bill will rename the Act to the National Land Transport Act 2014. The names of some of the parts of the Act will also be amended to reflect its change of name. This name change also requires consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Telstra Corporation Act 1991.


The Bill enables the continuation of the Roads to Recovery Programme (the Programme), which provides vital funding to local governments for the maintenance of the nation's local road infrastructure beyond 30 June 2014. 


This change is necessary as the Act currently specifies the Roads to Recovery funding period as ending on 30 June 2014. The Bill removes the specification of the funding period from the Act and places it in the Roads to Recovery List. This removes the need to amend the Act every time the Roads to Recovery funding period changes, and ensures that this very important programme will continue.


The Bill also inserts a power for the Minister to determine a Roads to Recovery List, which is essential for the Programme to be able to function. The Roads to Recovery List will be exempt from disallowance under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, which will provide certainty for the local government funding recipients of the Programme.


The Bill also streamlines and enhances the operation of the Act by combining Part 3, National Projects, and Part 6, Off-Network Projects, into one Part for Investment Projects. Parts 3 and 6 contain a significant number of identical provisions. By combining the two parts into one this will removes unnecessary duplication of provisions.


The new Part 3 for Investment Projects also includes a new requirement that states and territories notify the Minister as soon as possible after the sale or disposal of land that was acquired using Australian Government funding. This will ensure a timely response to land sales or disposals from both the states and territories and the Australian Government. The proceeds of the sale or disposal can then be allocated to new infrastructure projects.


The Bill also slightly alters one of the reasons for granting states and territories an exemption from the public tender requirements in Part 3. Work that costs less than an amount prescribed by regulations can currently be exempted and this is being altered so that the amount is determined instead by legislative instrument. This alteration will reduce regulatory delays.


The Bill introduces a new type of project that can receive funding under Part 4 of the Act - Transport Development and Innovation Projects. Projects that involve research, investigations, studies or analysis of Investment or Black Spot projects, previously funded Off-Network projects, and works funded under the Roads to Recovery Programme, will be eligible for Part 4 funding. This amendment will enhance the management of projects and the Infrastructure Investment Programme. Part 4 funding will also be able to be used for analysis of projects submitted for consideration for funding as Investment or Black Spot projects, to help inform advice to Government.


The Bill also adds two new types of eligible funding recipient into the Act. Partnerships have been added as an eligible funding recipient for Parts 4 and 5 of the Act. This change will simplify funding arrangements for firms without a body corporate structure. Non-corporate Commonwealth entities whose functions include research related to land transport research operations will now be able to receive funding under Part 5 – Funding for land transport research entities.


The Government has committed to the continuation of the Black Spot Programme, which provides funding to address road sites that are high risk areas for serious crashes. Black Spot Projects are administered under Part 7 of the Act and the Bill makes a few changes to that Part as a result of the Act's name change.


The Bill makes no amendments to the National Land Transport Network, a vital component of the Infrastructure Investment Programme. This Network contains the key road and rail links connecting Australia.


The Bill also repeals three spent land transport infrastructure Acts. The Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 was superseded by the then AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005, now the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. There are no outstanding claims under the Australian Land Transport Development Act andconsequently it should be repealed.


The Bill also repeals the Roads to Recovery Act 2000. The Roads to Recovery Programme commenced under this Act and in 2005 the Programme was moved into the then AusLink (National Land Transport) Act 2005, now the Nation Building Program (National Land Transport) Act 2009. There are no outstanding claims under the Roads to Recovery Act and consequently it should be repealed.


The Bill further repeals the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958. This Act incorporates an agreement between the Australian Government, New South Wales and Victoria to implement gauge standardisation, with the Australian Government loaning funding to New South Wales and Victoria for that purpose. These works were completed in 1962 and the last loan repayments were received in June 2013. As the loan has been repaid the Railway Standardization New South Wales and Victoria Act can now be repealed.


The amendments to the Nation Building Program Act, and the repeal of the three spent acts, do not have any regulatory or financial impacts on businesses and the not-for-profit sector. 


Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure. The amendments in this Bill will help to better deliver the infrastructure Australia critically needs.


I commend the Bill to the House.

Senator FARRELL:
  I move:


That the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument 2014, made under subsections 117(2) and (3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, be disallowed [F2014L00257].


That the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Determination 2014, made under subsections 258(4) and (5) of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, be disallowed [F2014L00256].


These two motions will disallow the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Determination 2014 and the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument 2014.


I can scarcely believe that I need to do this. The ALP is incredulous—and I repeat incredulous—that this government would be small-minded enough to cut small income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans. We all know what this is about. It is a small-minded, mean-spirited attempt to make a political point about the MRRT, using children of veterans who have performed the highest form of public service—that is, they have borne arms and put themselves in harm's way in the service of our country. This is pathetic. In fact, it is more than pathetic; it is despicable.


Labor are deeply committed to keeping in place these income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans. We make no apology for that and we make no apology at all for going in to support our veterans and their families. Our aim is to keep in place income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans, which the government is so callously determined to cut. These disallowance motions will void the repeal of those payments to the children of veterans, some of whom are homeless or do not live at home. Some of them, tragically, are orphans.


Let us look at the callous cuts that the government is proposing to make: a total cost to the budget of $254,000. Seriously, we have probably spent that amount in getting people here to Canberra today to debate this matter. Let us look at what the payment was designed for. It was designed to help the children of veterans and their families meet the sort of unexpected and unwelcome expenses that arise. Under this scheme, each eligible veteran's child receives $215.60. While some of us may see this as a small amount, it can mean a great deal of difference to a veteran's child. It might mean a pair of new footy boots, a school trip, a new school blazer or some music lessons. What is the ADF community to make of this proposal?


If I were a mate of a dead or wounded digger and I watched this happen to my mate's kid, I would seriously begin to wonder what sort of small-minded, penny-pinching country we had put ourselves on the line for. I repeat: bearing arms is the highest form of public service bar none. Those of us who send these people into conflict in our name have an onerous responsibility. That responsibility is to ensure that the courage and sacrifice of these people is reflected in the care that we give them upon their return and the care and consideration that we show for their families.


With regard to Australia's veterans we must discharge this duty of care to them and their families and not count the cost—ever! If the government wants savings, might I suggest that it look to, for instance, the Prime Minister's paid parental leave scheme for millionaires. Believe me, there are savings aplenty to be found there. Anyone in this place knows that government members and senators are far from universally supportive of this piece of legislation. Today, coalition MPs and senators will have to decide whether they will support children of ADF veterans or back the Prime Minister's penny-pinching, mean-spirited and small-minded cuts.


The income support bonus is paid by the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to assist those students who rely on government allowance as a primary source of income. It provides funding for unexpected expenses. Students who receive an education allowance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme are entitled to the income support bonus. Criteria for eligibility under the VCES guidelines include the following young people: those children of veterans who receive disability pension at various rates, depending on their level of disablement—for example, if they have suffered amputation or blindness; $215.60 for the child of an ADF member who has died and whose death was war- or defence-caused; $215.60 for the child of a veteran who was an Australian prisoner of war and who is now deceased; and $215.60 for students who are the children of Vietnam veterans or former members of a peacekeeping force.


The income support bonus for these students is paid twice a year—in late March and in September. This is the payment the coalition will cut, a yearly income support bonus of a measly $215.60 that goes to children of injured or killed diggers. In my home state—and yours, Madam Acting Deputy President Ruston—of South Australia, there are 77 children who will be affected by the scrapping of this payment.


Let me repeat: the cost of providing this assistance is just under $254,000 a year. That is less than 0.005 per cent of the Prime Minister's universally derided paid parental leave scheme for millionaires. It is a sad day when the government puts the saving of a measly amount of money ahead of the welfare of children of veterans, some of whom have paid the ultimate price in the service of our country.


The president of the New South Wales RSL, Don Rowe—not someone you would expect to line up with the Labor Party on many issues—has publicly stated his absolute disgust with this decision. He described it as 'a mean penny-pinching exercise'. I agree. It is mean and miserly. Legacy Australia said:


Legacy would be disappointed if any of the welfare payments are cut to the families of deceased or incapacitated veterans.


It is time for coalition MPs and senators to come out from behind the lines. Do they want to be part of a government that is happy to proceed with a $5.5 billion parental leave scheme but cannot find $250,000 for the children of veterans? They should ask the Prime Minister exactly when it was that he stood before the Australian people prior to the election and declared that he was going to cut support for the children of soldiers who had been killed or wounded in action. He did not say that. 


The Prime Minister and the coalition love to drape the flag over themselves and stand up damp-eyed at Anzac Day dawn services in their electorates, yet this is how they treat veterans and veterans' families. It is shameful. In the context of an annual budget that runs into hundreds of billions of dollars, to do this to save $254,000 is mind-boggling. This is nothing more than a shameful political stunt by the government to underline its opposition to the MRRT. I urge the Prime Minister and the government to go and pick on someone their own size, not the children of deceased, sick or injured veterans. 


This is a cruel and callous government, one that is happy to spend more providing paid parental leave to just four high-income earners than it would cost to keep up this support to the 1,200 children of ADF veterans. That is what the government will be voting for with this legislation—cuts to payments for the children of war veterans. The priorities of this government are simply wrong. It should scrap its unfair and unaffordable parental leave scheme instead of hitting low- and middle-income families. 


The real Abbott government is now standing before us. We are seeing how callous its actions are and will continue to be. The Prime Minister is steadfast and was unapologetic even today about cutting these benefits to the children of veterans. He has indicated very clearly what his priorities are. We say that the families of our veterans deserve respect and gratitude. Taking away their modest payments is incredibly insulting. 


I am proud to move these disallowance motions on behalf of the Labor Party. We can scarcely believe the government would go to so much effort to save $254,000. I call on senators opposite to join us in disallowing these regulations. Come on over. Cross the floor and demonstrate to ADF members, past and present, that you have the courage to stand up for what is right—as they had the courage to defend us and what is right in the theatres of war. Cross the floor. There are no IEDs, no landmines. You just have to cross the floor, Senator Edwards. All ADF members and their families know who you are and how you are going to vote. 


This payment was intended to help cover unanticipated expenses. Families know how often these arise. On this side of the house, we know just how much difference a small amount of financial assistance can make to students and their families. If there is a bone of compassion in his body, the Prime Minister will reverse the decision immediately. He should reverse this callous decision. He ought to back down and ensure that the children of Australian war veterans get the support they deserve. We need to send a clear and unequivocal message today that this parliament in no way supports the government's attempts to deprive the children of veterans of this modest payment.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:20):  I rise to support these disallowance motions. Put simply, these motions would block the government's attempts to cut income support to the children of veterans. The Australian Greens are resolute in our support for these disallowance motions because we consider it crucial to support veterans and their families. The impact of military service extends far beyond its enormous impact on the Defence Force personnel involved. It has an impact on their spouses, their families and their children. 


These motions would disallow two instruments—the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument 2014 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Determination 2014. The Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument is intended to repeal a scheme which established an income support bonus for certain veterans' children. The second repeal instrument is intended to repeal a scheme which paid $211.60 per annum for unexpected expenses to recipients of education allowances under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. 


As we have already heard, these payments only cost the government about $260,000 a year. They are payable to a very limited number of students who have met quite high eligibility requirements—students with veteran parents who died during war service or who have qualified for pensions at rates adjusted for their impairment. This amounts to only about 1,240 students across Australia who are eligible for these payments. The payments were introduced in March 2013 at a cost of $260,000 per year, funded by the mining tax. There is a good rationale for these payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs: they are to help eligible children achieve their full potential in education or career training. On the other hand, the government's rationale for repealing the benefits is that it has decided to repeal the mining tax.


Many groups, very understandably, do not consider that to be good enough. As we have already heard, the New South Wales state president of the Returned and Services League, Don Rowe, said he was 'absolutely disgusted' by the government's decision. The Australian Greens too believe that it is a mean-spirited act to take money away from veterans' children with one hand and return it to the shareholders of wealthy mining companies—80 per cent of whom live overseas—with the other.


Rather than cutting support for veterans' children and partners, the Australian Greens have consistently been calling for greater recognition and support for families. Veterans' families are in a unique circumstance. They provide a huge service to us all but often end up disadvantaged by their loved ones' own personal military service. They move around a lot; their employment and schooling is disrupted; they endure long absences, sometimes with family members in situations of great danger and conflict. And then they pick up the pieces afterwards if their loved one is injured or affected badly by the experiences they have had. And, of course, some partners, children and families lose their loved one forever. So the Australian Greens know that families play a crucial role in caring for veterans, and we want to support families in this. 


It is really as simple as this: if we are prepared to send people to serve in conflict on our behalf, it is only right that we treat them fairly and we look after them properly when they return. Military service extends beyond Defence Force personnel to their families, and the Greens are committed to caring for veterans' families. The income support bonuses to be repealed by these instruments are inexpensive, practical ways to benefit veterans' student children in difficult circumstances. There is no rationale for taking these away. 


As the Australian Greens spokesperson for veterans affairs, I have met extensively with the partners and families of veterans; I have spoken to wives, partners and offspring; and I have heard firsthand many stories about the long-term and debilitating impacts of war and war service. I have heard accounts, from myriad sources, of veterans suffering for years without diagnosis or treatment, with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder or other disorders that make life a misery for them, and sometimes for their families as well.


I have heard the accounts of partners who have been disbelieved in the early years about the experiences they had living with their partners. I have heard about children cowering and hiding. 'Walking on eggshells' is a phrase I commonly hear because of the debilitating consequences on veterans who return from high conflict and danger. These accounts are actually alarmingly common. 


Frequently I meet with partners and hear their stories. These are often heartbreaking stories about partners who have known their veteran partner since before they went into military service, and about the changes in personality and the changes in outlook that they have experienced over the years since then. I have heard that post-traumatic stress disorder can commonly manifest as depression, rapid and severe changes in mood and behaviour, terrifying nightmares, hypervigilance and, in some cases, violence. I have heard how some people end up self-medicating through alcohol or other drugs. These symptoms alone can have enormous impacts on veterans and their families.


There is clear evidence now that it is not just the health of veterans which is affected by military service; there are studies which show that there are significant health risks for veterans' partners and their families, relating to their caring role. Professor Brian O'Toole from the Brain and Mind Research Institute has reported that partners of Vietnam veterans have mental illnesses at levels 20 to 30 times higher than the general population. Similarly, in 2005 Dr Hedley Peach, of the University of Melbourne, reviewed various studies and reported that psychological disorders affect partners and children of veterans at substantially higher rates than the non-veteran population, and carry an associated risk of cardiovascular and other physical diseases. 


Veterans' children are reported to be at risk of higher rates of various congenital birth conditions and health problems. Long-term studies show that being the partner or child of a Vietnam veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder is a predictor of suffering from a mental disorder which can in turn affect grandchildren. It is reported that suicide levels among veterans' children are up to three times higher than the rest of the Australian population.


The need to support veterans and their families with adequate mental health services and other supports is much broader than income support, and I look forward to working with the government on these complex issues. However, decent support with education and a livelihood for veterans' children is the least that we can do. 


When I spoke about the mining tax repeal bill last week, I cited the payments under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme as prime examples of that bill's short-sightedness. The Greens want to strengthen the mining tax, not repeal it. We want to share the profits from our nation's mineral wealth among our community—the community that owns these shared resources and the community that contributes to the society that makes this mining and this wealth possible. This government's move to discontinue these payments to veterans' children, because it is hell-bent on repealing the mining tax, is mean-spirited and bloody-minded.


We demonstrate our values by the choices we make. We do not have an infinite source of revenue but we can choose to have the revenue that is available to us from things like sharing the wealth that is generated by our shared resources. So do not tell me that we do not have sufficient wealth in Australia—one of the most wealthy nations in the world—to properly look after those who are the most needy. Education, health, mental health—how we look after the most vulnerable is the sign of how civilised we are as a nation. In this case, we have a government that is choosing to look after its mates and to repeal the mining tax legislation—a decision that will directly see more money in the pockets of its wealthy mining company mates, wealth which is generated from the resources that we all own and that belong to all of us—and choosing, at the same time, to take away money from the children of veterans who have died or who are disabled.


The Greens took a fully costed proposal to support veterans' families to the federal election last year. We know that, as a community, we owe the partners and families of veterans a huge debt. Government decisions have sent their loved ones to serve on our behalf, as a nation, into hazardous and often highly distressing situations. So it is only right that we care for them properly and care for the families who support them.


I would just like to give an indication of some of the initiatives that we developed, took for costing and took to the election. These were based carefully on the listening I have been doing over a period of years with veterans and their families. We would allow children of veterans who are acting as a carer for their veteran parent and the parents and siblings of veterans killed in service to access counselling through the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. The provision of counselling services is a tangible way to support them. We would grant bereavement payments to partners who have separated from their veteran partner where it is established that the veteran's mental ill health played a part in the separation. This initiative would recognise the unique pressures that veterans' partners experience through living with a veteran, which can affect their lives or their relationship and are often directly attributable to the military service.


Our initiative would have increased funeral benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 from $2,000 to $4,000, subject to review every five years to keep up with increasing costs. Our initiative would make the Department of Veterans' Affairs the responsible department for assessing the eligibility of veterans' carers for the Centrelink carer allowance, because it is that department that has a much better understanding of the nature of the condition experienced by veterans and the consequences and effects of caring for someone with that condition by their partners.


We would change the current situation regarding carer allowance so it is no longer cancelled after the veteran has been hospitalised for six weeks, which requires partners and carers to reapply. We would review the carer supplement every five years to ensure that the payment is adequate. We would increase veterans' home care respite services to 260 hours per year. That is merely 10 hours per fortnight, but I have heard time and time again from partners of veterans that that precious 10 hours—when they are looking after a veteran and often cannot leave the house or, if they can leave the house, often cannot do so with any certainty that they will be able to stay away without getting the call that they are required back home—would give them the chance to go and get a haircut, to go and have a cup of coffee with friends, to see family or to do some shopping.


We would also establish and maintain a jobs for Defence families website that would assist Defence families—who are often uprooted and moved around—and their partners to find employment with people who have an understanding and a respect for the Defence Force, so that they can be partnered up or given the opportunity to find out about employers who would make jobs available for them. I have been told the nomadic existence, in some ways, that veterans and partners experience is one of the great pressures on veterans' relationships. We would fund the Defence Community Organisation to provide enhanced induction and support seminars for Defence families before their loved one enters Defence service and also when they are leaving, so that they can be alerted to the things to look out for and be advised about the programs and assistances that are available for them.


So the Australian Greens oppose the repeal of the mining tax because, if the tax were implemented properly, it would share the wealth from our minerals among the community and it could fund worthy projects and initiatives just like those that I have outlined. So we are supporting this disallowance motion, because it is just not good enough to take away benefits for veterans' children just because this government is intent on repealing the mining tax. On behalf of the Australian Greens, I will continue to advocate to care properly for the people who do military service on our behalf and for the families who support them.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:34):  I rise to speak on this government's shameful plan to cut the Department of Veterans' Affairs income support bonus. This payment supports the children of service men and women who have died or have been seriously injured while serving in the Australian Defence Force. Labor is against this government's plans to take away this measure from the children of ADF personnel. Labor is proud that we provided the income support bonus while we were in government. I note that Labor's opposition to the MRRT bill in the Senate has allowed another payment of this very support just this week. It is a payment that would not have been made if the MRRT bill had passed.


This motion makes clear that, even if the government succeeds in removing the minerals resource rent tax, we will continue to fight for the income support bonus. What we are talking about here is $250,000 a year in the budget. That is about $215 per child of a deceased or injured member of the ADF. It is not a huge sum of money, but it is an acknowledgement of our commitment to look after the families of our ADF men and women.


To be honest, I am genuinely surprised that I need to speak on this. It had never occurred to me that a government would want to do this—stripping money away from the children of veterans. I find it inconceivable that any government would be so heartless as to cut income support to the children of service men and women who have died or been injured while serving their country. There are 1,200 children in Australia who will be affected by this cut—1,200 children who will miss out on about $215 a year.


RSL officials, as has been mentioned, have described these cuts as a mean-spirited, penny-pinching exercise that will hurt Defence families. Mean-spirited and penny-pinching—I could not have put it better myself. What makes these heartless cuts even more galling is that the they only save an estimated $250,000. That is all: $250,000.




Senator Lines:
  Shame.




Senator CONROY:
  I will take that interjection of 'shame' because that is exactly what it is. I will give those opposite some free advice: if they want to save $250,000, they could sack their mate Tim Wilson from the Human Rights Commission or, better yet, just cut Ziggy Switkowski's salary down from four days to three days a week—two simple opportunities—or even not reintroduce knighthoods and damehoods, which appears to be today's priority of Mr Tony Abbott's government. What an extraordinary lack of judgement and priority by this government. It is actually true. He held a press conference and actually said it. On the day that the government wants to take away $250,000 or $215 a year away from the families of veterans, he wants to spend money and time prioritising the reintroduction of knighthoods.


The people of Australia and ADF families will not thank Mr Abbott for this surprise. He promised before the last election that his would be a government of no surprises. If you want to save $250,000, do not take it from the children of injured or killed ADF personnel. These payments are made twice a year and provide funding for unexpected expenses. These payments help with expenses like textbooks, schoolbags, uniforms, school excursions or a new set of shoes for netball or boots for footy.


The Labor Party has long supported ADF families. We have supported them because we understand that ADF members do a tough job. We understand that by supporting their families we ease their burden. Our country takes ADF personnel away from their families for months or years at a time. We ask them to do a tough job in tough conditions. We look after their families so that our ADF personnel can get on with their job without worrying about their wives or husbands and their children they have left behind.


We understand that Defence families do it tough. We understand that while they are away, often in harm's way, their family is at home taking kids to school, paying bills and going to work. Our service men and women do an amazing job. They do an amazing job because they have the support of their family. They do what the government asks of them and they do it without question.


The men and women of the ADF go to dangerous places like Afghanistan, Iraq, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands to defend the security of our country and to help our friends and allies. They go to places like Aceh, the Philippines, South Sudan and Port Moresby to help those in need. Right now, ADF personnel are flying over and sailing through the southern Indian Ocean looking for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing two weeks ago. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my thanks for the work that they are doing. All of us are proud of their efforts and the work many Australians are doing to support the search mission. This includes not only the men and women of our Defence Force but also the officials of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Federal Labor fully supports their efforts. We are grateful for their efforts and the world is grateful for their efforts.


Sometimes ADF personnel are put in harm's way and they do not come home. Sometimes they go to these places and they are so seriously injured that they can no longer work. Do not these men and women, along with their families, deserve this payment? I believe they do. Labor believes they do and that is why we introduced this payment in government and why we are moving this disallowance motion today.


The income support bonus was not the only support that Labor provided to ADF families when we were in government. We put all the groundwork in place and fully budgeted for the National ADF Family Health Program. This program will provide gap payments for free GP visits for the families of ADF members and provide $400 a year towards specialist health care services. This ensures that the health and welfare of ADF families are being looked after. Labor was proud of this policy and was pleased to see that planning and preparation led to a trouble-free introduction. This policy will cost $103 million over the forward estimates and will provide services to around 71,000 ADF dependents.


Labor is committed to providing the best Australian-made equipment to the ADF and that is why it had a plan to bridge the valley of death. In the shipbuilding industry, Labor had plans to keep thousands of highly skilled workers on the job in the shipbuilding industry by bringing projects forward. This would have ensured that we had the knowledge, skills and infrastructure in Australia to undertake these big projects like the future frigate and future submarine projects, which I know are very dear to Senator Farrell's heart. That would be thousands of Defence industry families that would not lose an income under Labor's plan. This is in stark contrast to what the government are doing now. They are sitting on their hands, they have been in government for six months and all we have heard from them so far are empty promises and empty rhetoric. The minister needs to stand up to his cabinet colleagues and ensure that the valley of death in the shipbuilding industry is bridged so that our shipbuilding industry has a bright future.


I mentioned earlier that I was shocked that any government could seek to take away this small payment to help the children of killed or injured ADF servicemen and women. Perhaps, I should have seen it coming. This is after all a defence minister whose first action as a minister was to cut the pay and conditions of serving ADF personnel in the Middle East, including Afghanistan. The minister cut their allowance to the tune of $19,000 a year and now he wants to cut payments to the kids of ADF veterans as well. This is a disgrace, and the Senate should not stand for it.


This is a government that is happy to stand up in front of Liberal Party banners on Defence Force bases but refuses to stand up for ADF veterans and their children. That is right, Mr Acting Deputy President. Just in case you had forgotten, the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Tony Abbott, stood up in front of a Liberal Party South Australian campaign banner—




Senator Farrell:
  It didn't help them.




Senator CONROY:
  at RAAF Base Edinburgh just two days before the South Australian election. As my South Australian colleague next to me, Senator Farrell, has made the point, it did not help them in the end. They trash convention and trash and embarrass our military just for some cheap political point-scoring on an Air Force base. He stood there on this base next to the still Liberal opposition leader, Steven Marshall, in front of a Liberal Party banner. The banner included the Liberal Party logo, Liberal Party slogans and the Liberal opposition leader's Twitter handle. This was on an Air Force base. I have written to the minister and asked for an explanation. I am still waiting to hear how he allowed this to happen and, more importantly, how he intends to make sure it never happens again.


Those opposite stand condemned by their decision to cut this payment to the children of killed or injured ADF personnel. There is no support for these cuts in the community. There is no reason for these cuts. This is one of those few times when those opposite just let their mask slip and we get to see what they are really about—mean spiritedness and penny-pinching. The Labor Party will not support the government's efforts to cut this important payment, and nor should anyone else in this chamber. The Senate should agree to this motion to ensure continued support for the children of killed or injured ADF personnel.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:47):  I rise tonight in support of this disallowance motion. This disallowance motion aims to keep in place income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans, which the government has so callously and mean-spiritedly determined to cut. This disallowance motion will void the repeal of those payments to the children of veterans, some of whom are homeless or do not live at home and some of whom are orphans.


I do so because, quite frankly, I think those on the other side are probably not allowed to, but I am sure there are those on the other side who would seek to support this motion as well, because I cannot for a moment believe they are all so mean-spirited and callous to deny veterans' children the total of just over $215 a year—not a month, not a week, not a day, but a year. I have been absolutely astounded by this fact, because the yearly income support bonus goes to the children of injured and killed diggers, and, as I said, some are actually orphans. As has been said by previous speakers, over a year, it is a mere total of about $254,000.


In my home state of Tasmania, there are children who will be affected by the scrapping of this payment. I have recently employed on my staff and ex-Defence veteran who has had some conversations about this precise issue. He is very concerned about some of the children of his colleagues from when he was in the Defence Force in regard to this matter. I am not going to take too long, but I really want to stand up and speak about this


As I was saying, the cost of providing assistance is a total of around $254,000 a year, and that is less than 0.005 per cent of Mr Abbott's universally derided Paid Parental Leave scheme for millionaires. That is also much more than some people get paid for being on the board of a water company and only doing a couple of weeks work. Let me point that out: you might be on the board of a water company and only have to do a couple of weeks work and you could receive just about the same amount. So it is a sad day, I think, when the government puts the savings of a measly amount of money ahead of the welfare of children.


Everybody in this place knows that I have a longstanding interest in the welfare of children. Be it just over $200 a year or be it $20,000 a year to children who deserve it, it is a very important issue to me, and I know it is to a number of other people as well. Prior to the election, Mr Abbott said the government would promise to repeal the MRRT and the benefits it was intending to fund, but I think he was very sneaky. I do not think he actually pointed out to anyone that veterans' children who receive assistance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme would lose their annual payment of about $215 a year. I do not think they knocked on anyone's door and said, 'If you're a child of veteran, you will lose this money.' So I think there has been a sleight of hand and a bit of sneakiness going on in regard to this issue.


I think Mr Abbott needs to explain why he is doing this and why he is cutting these payments. As I said, it contrasts quite a lot with a number of other issues—certainly with the government's willingness to pursue a generous paid parental leave scheme offering payments up to $75,000. The annual cost of payments to veterans' children is less than the cost of providing four high-income earners with paid parental leave under Mr Abbott's proposed scheme. Why does the Prime Minister thinks that four women on higher salaries are more important and more worthy than 1,200 children of war veterans? I just do not get it. I think there are a lot on the other side who are probably embarrassed by this. I can tell you that, if I were on that side and my government had done something like this, I would be more than embarrassed; I would be taking it up to the leader and getting them to change their mind on it.


A number of people have made comment in regard to it. The Executive Director of the Defence Force Welfare Association, Mr Alf Jaugietis, said—and I quote—that he 'was ""bloody stunned"" and would seek clarification from the minister's office over the decision'. He also said:


… to target kids, and only about 1,200 of them, over something that costs so little, seems … petty to us …


Even that interesting person over in the other place, the member for Fairfax, Mr Clive Palmer, 'foreshadowed an obstacle to the government's repeal of the mining tax', declaring that it will not come at the expense of income support to orphan children or war veterans. The payment to veterans' children—which has an overall price tag for the government, as I said, of $250,000, give or take a few dollars—is to be one of the casualties, I think, of the mining tax repeal package. Mr Palmer 'threatened to block the repeal if the payments are axed', so he was very serious about it. He told Radio National on Thursday:


They'll just have to take it out or they won't have any change …


Mr Palmer also said that he thought scrapping the payment was 'a crazy thing to do'. The New South Wales RSL president, Don Rowe, also publicly stated his absolute disgust with the decision. He described it as 'mean-spirited' and 'a mean penny-pinching exercise'.


This is a callous act from the Abbott government; there are no two ways about it. I think coalition MPs and senators need to decide whether they will support the children of ADF veterans or they will back Tony Abbott's callous cuts to the assistance these children so richly deserve. They need to be, as I said, standing up to Tony Abbott on behalf of the children of war veterans, not voting to cut their payments.


In summing up today, I am so flabbergasted by this that I really find it a bit hard to put into words what I really feel because I know I probably need to watch my language, and it might get away from me if I do not contain myself. It is unexplainable to me why the government would go down this road. It is completely incomprehensible—



Senator Urquhart interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Thank you, Senator Urquhart, it is. It is completely incomprehensible. It is mean. It is nasty. It is callous. The adjectives could go on, and I probably would never end the adjectives about what I think about this case, but I strongly believe that the families of our veterans deserve the respect and gratitude that we should give them. I do not think they should be insulted by callous acts like this. I also firmly believe that we have the responsibility to support those children.


To anyone in this room, I would imagine that $215 a year is probably not that much money. I am sure someone on that side will probably say how many milkshakes or cups of coffee you could buy with it, because that has been known to be said before about the cutting of funding. It is not that much money. This issue has been so callously brought on, and Mr Abbott is so firm and so determined not to backtrack, because he made this promise to repeal the MRRT. Well, Mr Abbott, you are going to have to do something. It is not on. This is not what Australia is about. This is not the Australian way.


I think we all have the responsibility to support those children, whose fathers and mothers have given their lives for our country, so I urge those on the other side to really take it up to Mr Abbott. I am not sure when their next caucus with him is, but I would be getting on the phone if I were some of those people on the other side. I know they are not all hard hearted and callous on the other side. I have worked for six years with most of those on the other side, and I have spent a lot of time with some of them. Some of those on the other side I can get on quite well with. So I know they are not—



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Did you say 'name them', Senator Farrell? No, I will not do that because it might put them—



Senator Kroger interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Oh, Senator Kroger wants to be named! Senator Kroger, if you want to be named, you go and take this up to Mr Abbott and you get him to change his mind, because I think it is really, really important that those on your side who do have a heart point out the minuscule amount of money involved, which is such a help to those children and those families. I will end it there, but I really did just want to get up—I have said more than a few words—and participate in this discussion because to me it is so important.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (17:58):  I rise today in support of these two disallowance motions. I rise as the daughter of a veteran who served as a commando on the Kokoda Trail. My father, now almost 92, has carried shrapnel embedded in and scattered throughout his shoulder and back for more than 70 years. I can tell you as his child that those scars that my father carried were not just carried in his back. He gave his youth for the service of Australia. He gave his youth fighting on the Kokoda Trail. So Legacy and the RSL, when I was a child, played a very, very important role in my life.


I go on now to talk about the current situation. I cannot imagine a more callous act from a government than taking such a small amount away from veterans' children. I was fortunate. My father came home from the war and went on to get married and have children, but that legacy of the years that he gave fighting as a soldier for Australia impacted on our family life. I cannot imagine the impact that losing a key loved one would have on a family. My father's injuries had an impact on our lives. When you kiss your loved one goodbye and then they do not come home, because they have given their life for Australia, the impact would be enormous. For the Abbott government to take money from the children of war veterans is absolutely shameful; and it is even more shameful because it is such a small amount of money for the government. But it is a significant amount of money for a family, because it helps with shoes, books or tertiary fees, and it is a tiny, little recognition that the parent's death meant something to the broader Australian community.


Again we have seen a government that simply cannot speak the truth, because last week the Prime Minister told my colleagues in the other place, 'No specific payments to veterans' families are being cut.' We know that is just not true. That is just not true. The Prime Minister can continue on saying, as much as he likes, that he has retained some of these schemes and that he has consulted with stakeholders on this issue. Fortunately for me, my father came home. But the families of mates of my father who did not come home relied on a bonus, a payment from the government, for their lost father; in most cases it was a father. Young Australians who were expecting to have some of their educational expenses met will now have to find the money for uni books or for fees to help fund their education or training out of their own pockets. Again I suspect that Legacy and the RSL will step up, but it is not appropriate for those organisations to be expected by the Abbott government to step up and fund such a minuscule payment.


The shadow minister for families and payments, Jenny Macklin, specifically asked the Prime Minister on 18 March precisely where and when the Prime Minister announced that this specific payment to the widows and orphans of war veterans would be cut. Despite the Prime Minister saying that he consulted widely with stakeholders, the RSL were not aware of this cut. Legacy is pleading with the government to reconsider. Young Western Australians were not consulted. They were not told that the cost of the assistance was the same as giving just four high-income earners the Prime Minister's extravagant and unfair Paid Parental Leave scheme. I would be ashamed as an Australian to think that we had cut this payment of $211 and a few cents per year to fund an extravagant parental leave scheme. I would be absolutely ashamed if we were to take that money from the children of veterans and give it to people who have still got a mum and dad in their family—people who have not suffered the ravages of war and who have not suffered a horrific and tragic death in their families. That would be the ultimate injustice. 


The Prime Minister keeps telling us, 'If you want to fix the economy you've got to fix the budget first.' I am aware of the arguments from the other side—that this income support bonus was expected to be funded by the minerals resource rent tax and, without the MRRT, the government can no longer afford to supplement the income of the children of veterans—including some who are homeless. What rubbish, what nonsense and what selfishness to take away such a small payment, $211.20—a very, very small payment in the budget of a government but a payment that would really make a difference in the lives of the families of veterans. 


This is nothing but bullying by the Abbott government. It is the bullying of a handful of children—just 1,200 children. For the Abbott government to say that it plays any reasonable part in fixing the budget whilst retaining the gold-plated parental leave scheme is just insulting. I would challenge the Prime Minister to stand up before one of the children from whom he is taking this benefit and explain why he is doing that. In my view, it amounts to reverse class warfare. And to be so unapologetic is callous. The cost of providing this assistance—as we have heard senator after senator say in this place today—is just under $254,000 a year. It is a sad day when the government puts their pledge to have the budget in surplus ahead of the welfare of children of veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. 


Dave Spillman, President of the Kwinana Branch of the RSL in Western Australia said:


We’re shocked the Prime Minister would cut something that helps the kids of RSL members like this. When Western Australians fight for Australia, get injured for Australia and die for Australia, we don’t think it’s too much to ask for their kids to get a helping hand. The armed services are important in Western Australia and the Prime Minister should remember that. We call on Prime Minister Abbott to reverse this decision.


Presumably the RSL is the major stakeholder, but obviously they were not consulted. It certainly does not sound like the Kwinana branch or Dave Spillman or any of the executives in Western Australia were consulted. I agree with the RSL on this matter. As the child of a veteran, I can understand how they feel. But I too am absolutely disgusted with the government's decision. This cut is unnecessary, and $254,000 will not achieve the budget surplus the government believes the country so desperately needs. 


Where are the government's priorities? I don't believe that if you want to fix the economy you have to fix the budget first. As a West Australian, I can think of a number of things we need before we need a budget surplus. How about a fast, efficient rail network? The RAC tells us in Western Australia that congestion is a massive cost to business. What about some roads that were promised linking eastern suburbs such as Ellenbrook and the Swan Valley? How about addressing the high cost of housing in Western Australia? What is the Prime Minister's answer when parents ask why schools in WA are not equal, why school performance is dependent on postcode and not funding and why some WA students exit school barely literate? The Prime Minister does not have an answer; the Abbott government cannot look WA parents in the eyes as it has no plan. 


If the government places a priority on getting to surplus ahead of these matters and cannot even put aside $260,000 to help the families of those who have put their lives on the line for our country to gain access to education, how will it ever prioritise every other issue for Western Australians? My father gave his youth to this country serving as a commando on the Kokoda Trail. Thankfully, he came home, but for those children and those partners who lose their loved ones, taking this minuscule amount of money away from children who have suffered the most unimaginable loss is absolutely unthinkable and mean-spirited.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia) (17:09):  I seek leave to move business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 2 and 3 together.


Leave granted.




Senator FARRELL:
  I move:


That the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument 2014, made under subsections 117(2) and (3) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, be disallowed [F2014L00257].


That the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Determination 2014, made under subsections 258(4) and (5) of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, be disallowed [F2014L00256].


These two motions will disallow the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Determination 2014 and the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument 2014.


I can scarcely believe that I need to do this. The ALP is incredulous—and I repeat incredulous—that this government would be small-minded enough to cut small income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans. We all know what this is about. It is a small-minded, mean-spirited attempt to make a political point about the MRRT, using children of veterans who have performed the highest form of public service—that is, they have borne arms and put themselves in harm's way in the service of our country. This is pathetic. In fact, it is more than pathetic; it is despicable.


Labor are deeply committed to keeping in place these income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans. We make no apology for that and we make no apology at all for going in to support our veterans and their families. Our aim is to keep in place income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans, which the government is so callously determined to cut. These disallowance motions will void the repeal of those payments to the children of veterans, some of whom are homeless or do not live at home. Some of them, tragically, are orphans.


Let us look at the callous cuts that the government is proposing to make: a total cost to the budget of $254,000. Seriously, we have probably spent that amount in getting people here to Canberra today to debate this matter. Let us look at what the payment was designed for. It was designed to help the children of veterans and their families meet the sort of unexpected and unwelcome expenses that arise. Under this scheme, each eligible veteran's child receives $215.60. While some of us may see this as a small amount, it can mean a great deal of difference to a veteran's child. It might mean a pair of new footy boots, a school trip, a new school blazer or some music lessons. What is the ADF community to make of this proposal?


If I were a mate of a dead or wounded digger and I watched this happen to my mate's kid, I would seriously begin to wonder what sort of small-minded, penny-pinching country we had put ourselves on the line for. I repeat: bearing arms is the highest form of public service bar none. Those of us who send these people into conflict in our name have an onerous responsibility. That responsibility is to ensure that the courage and sacrifice of these people is reflected in the care that we give them upon their return and the care and consideration that we show for their families.


With regard to Australia's veterans we must discharge this duty of care to them and their families and not count the cost—ever! If the government wants savings, might I suggest that it look to, for instance, the Prime Minister's paid parental leave scheme for millionaires. Believe me, there are savings aplenty to be found there. Anyone in this place knows that government members and senators are far from universally supportive of this piece of legislation. Today, coalition MPs and senators will have to decide whether they will support children of ADF veterans or back the Prime Minister's penny-pinching, mean-spirited and small-minded cuts.


The income support bonus is paid by the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to assist those students who rely on government allowance as a primary source of income. It provides funding for unexpected expenses. Students who receive an education allowance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme are entitled to the income support bonus. Criteria for eligibility under the VCES guidelines include the following young people: those children of veterans who receive disability pension at various rates, depending on their level of disablement—for example, if they have suffered amputation or blindness; $215.60 for the child of an ADF member who has died and whose death was war- or defence-caused; $215.60 for the child of a veteran who was an Australian prisoner of war and who is now deceased; and $215.60 for students who are the children of Vietnam veterans or former members of a peacekeeping force.


The income support bonus for these students is paid twice a year—in late March and in September. This is the payment the coalition will cut, a yearly income support bonus of a measly $215.60 that goes to children of injured or killed diggers. In my home state—and yours, Madam Acting Deputy President Ruston—of South Australia, there are 77 children who will be affected by the scrapping of this payment.


Let me repeat: the cost of providing this assistance is just under $254,000 a year. That is less than 0.005 per cent of the Prime Minister's universally derided paid parental leave scheme for millionaires. It is a sad day when the government puts the saving of a measly amount of money ahead of the welfare of children of veterans, some of whom have paid the ultimate price in the service of our country.


The president of the New South Wales RSL, Don Rowe—not someone you would expect to line up with the Labor Party on many issues—has publicly stated his absolute disgust with this decision. He described it as 'a mean penny-pinching exercise'. I agree. It is mean and miserly. Legacy Australia said:


Legacy would be disappointed if any of the welfare payments are cut to the families of deceased or incapacitated veterans.


It is time for coalition MPs and senators to come out from behind the lines. Do they want to be part of a government that is happy to proceed with a $5.5 billion parental leave scheme but cannot find $250,000 for the children of veterans? They should ask the Prime Minister exactly when it was that he stood before the Australian people prior to the election and declared that he was going to cut support for the children of soldiers who had been killed or wounded in action. He did not say that. 


The Prime Minister and the coalition love to drape the flag over themselves and stand up damp-eyed at Anzac Day dawn services in their electorates, yet this is how they treat veterans and veterans' families. It is shameful. In the context of an annual budget that runs into hundreds of billions of dollars, to do this to save $254,000 is mind-boggling. This is nothing more than a shameful political stunt by the government to underline its opposition to the MRRT. I urge the Prime Minister and the government to go and pick on someone their own size, not the children of deceased, sick or injured veterans. 


This is a cruel and callous government, one that is happy to spend more providing paid parental leave to just four high-income earners than it would cost to keep up this support to the 1,200 children of ADF veterans. That is what the government will be voting for with this legislation—cuts to payments for the children of war veterans. The priorities of this government are simply wrong. It should scrap its unfair and unaffordable parental leave scheme instead of hitting low- and middle-income families. 


The real Abbott government is now standing before us. We are seeing how callous its actions are and will continue to be. The Prime Minister is steadfast and was unapologetic even today about cutting these benefits to the children of veterans. He has indicated very clearly what his priorities are. We say that the families of our veterans deserve respect and gratitude. Taking away their modest payments is incredibly insulting. 


I am proud to move these disallowance motions on behalf of the Labor Party. We can scarcely believe the government would go to so much effort to save $254,000. I call on senators opposite to join us in disallowing these regulations. Come on over. Cross the floor and demonstrate to ADF members, past and present, that you have the courage to stand up for what is right—as they had the courage to defend us and what is right in the theatres of war. Cross the floor. There are no IEDs, no landmines. You just have to cross the floor, Senator Edwards. All ADF members and their families know who you are and how you are going to vote. 


This payment was intended to help cover unanticipated expenses. Families know how often these arise. On this side of the house, we know just how much difference a small amount of financial assistance can make to students and their families. If there is a bone of compassion in his body, the Prime Minister will reverse the decision immediately. He should reverse this callous decision. He ought to back down and ensure that the children of Australian war veterans get the support they deserve. We need to send a clear and unequivocal message today that this parliament in no way supports the government's attempts to deprive the children of veterans of this modest payment.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-03-25,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:20):  I rise to support these disallowance motions. Put simply, these motions would block the government's attempts to cut income support to the children of veterans. The Australian Greens are resolute in our support for these disallowance motions because we consider it crucial to support veterans and their families. The impact of military service extends far beyond its enormous impact on the Defence Force personnel involved. It has an impact on their spouses, their families and their children. 


These motions would disallow two instruments—the Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument 2014 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Determination 2014. The Veterans' Children Education Scheme (Income Support Bonus) Repeal Instrument is intended to repeal a scheme which established an income support bonus for certain veterans' children. The second repeal instrument is intended to repeal a scheme which paid $211.60 per annum for unexpected expenses to recipients of education allowances under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. 


As we have already heard, these payments only cost the government about $260,000 a year. They are payable to a very limited number of students who have met quite high eligibility requirements—students with veteran parents who died during war service or who have qualified for pensions at rates adjusted for their impairment. This amounts to only about 1,240 students across Australia who are eligible for these payments. The payments were introduced in March 2013 at a cost of $260,000 per year, funded by the mining tax. There is a good rationale for these payments from the Department of Veterans' Affairs: they are to help eligible children achieve their full potential in education or career training. On the other hand, the government's rationale for repealing the benefits is that it has decided to repeal the mining tax.


Many groups, very understandably, do not consider that to be good enough. As we have already heard, the New South Wales state president of the Returned and Services League, Don Rowe, said he was 'absolutely disgusted' by the government's decision. The Australian Greens too believe that it is a mean-spirited act to take money away from veterans' children with one hand and return it to the shareholders of wealthy mining companies—80 per cent of whom live overseas—with the other.


Rather than cutting support for veterans' children and partners, the Australian Greens have consistently been calling for greater recognition and support for families. Veterans' families are in a unique circumstance. They provide a huge service to us all but often end up disadvantaged by their loved ones' own personal military service. They move around a lot; their employment and schooling is disrupted; they endure long absences, sometimes with family members in situations of great danger and conflict. And then they pick up the pieces afterwards if their loved one is injured or affected badly by the experiences they have had. And, of course, some partners, children and families lose their loved one forever. So the Australian Greens know that families play a crucial role in caring for veterans, and we want to support families in this. 


It is really as simple as this: if we are prepared to send people to serve in conflict on our behalf, it is only right that we treat them fairly and we look after them properly when they return. Military service extends beyond Defence Force personnel to their families, and the Greens are committed to caring for veterans' families. The income support bonuses to be repealed by these instruments are inexpensive, practical ways to benefit veterans' student children in difficult circumstances. There is no rationale for taking these away. 


As the Australian Greens spokesperson for veterans affairs, I have met extensively with the partners and families of veterans; I have spoken to wives, partners and offspring; and I have heard firsthand many stories about the long-term and debilitating impacts of war and war service. I have heard accounts, from myriad sources, of veterans suffering for years without diagnosis or treatment, with conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder or other disorders that make life a misery for them, and sometimes for their families as well.


I have heard the accounts of partners who have been disbelieved in the early years about the experiences they had living with their partners. I have heard about children cowering and hiding. 'Walking on eggshells' is a phrase I commonly hear because of the debilitating consequences on veterans who return from high conflict and danger. These accounts are actually alarmingly common. 


Frequently I meet with partners and hear their stories. These are often heartbreaking stories about partners who have known their veteran partner since before they went into military service, and about the changes in personality and the changes in outlook that they have experienced over the years since then. I have heard that post-traumatic stress disorder can commonly manifest as depression, rapid and severe changes in mood and behaviour, terrifying nightmares, hypervigilance and, in some cases, violence. I have heard how some people end up self-medicating through alcohol or other drugs. These symptoms alone can have enormous impacts on veterans and their families.


There is clear evidence now that it is not just the health of veterans which is affected by military service; there are studies which show that there are significant health risks for veterans' partners and their families, relating to their caring role. Professor Brian O'Toole from the Brain and Mind Research Institute has reported that partners of Vietnam veterans have mental illnesses at levels 20 to 30 times higher than the general population. Similarly, in 2005 Dr Hedley Peach, of the University of Melbourne, reviewed various studies and reported that psychological disorders affect partners and children of veterans at substantially higher rates than the non-veteran population, and carry an associated risk of cardiovascular and other physical diseases. 


Veterans' children are reported to be at risk of higher rates of various congenital birth conditions and health problems. Long-term studies show that being the partner or child of a Vietnam veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder is a predictor of suffering from a mental disorder which can in turn affect grandchildren. It is reported that suicide levels among veterans' children are up to three times higher than the rest of the Australian population.


The need to support veterans and their families with adequate mental health services and other supports is much broader than income support, and I look forward to working with the government on these complex issues. However, decent support with education and a livelihood for veterans' children is the least that we can do. 


When I spoke about the mining tax repeal bill last week, I cited the payments under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme as prime examples of that bill's short-sightedness. The Greens want to strengthen the mining tax, not repeal it. We want to share the profits from our nation's mineral wealth among our community—the community that owns these shared resources and the community that contributes to the society that makes this mining and this wealth possible. This government's move to discontinue these payments to veterans' children, because it is hell-bent on repealing the mining tax, is mean-spirited and bloody-minded.


We demonstrate our values by the choices we make. We do not have an infinite source of revenue but we can choose to have the revenue that is available to us from things like sharing the wealth that is generated by our shared resources. So do not tell me that we do not have sufficient wealth in Australia—one of the most wealthy nations in the world—to properly look after those who are the most needy. Education, health, mental health—how we look after the most vulnerable is the sign of how civilised we are as a nation. In this case, we have a government that is choosing to look after its mates and to repeal the mining tax legislation—a decision that will directly see more money in the pockets of its wealthy mining company mates, wealth which is generated from the resources that we all own and that belong to all of us—and choosing, at the same time, to take away money from the children of veterans who have died or who are disabled.


The Greens took a fully costed proposal to support veterans' families to the federal election last year. We know that, as a community, we owe the partners and families of veterans a huge debt. Government decisions have sent their loved ones to serve on our behalf, as a nation, into hazardous and often highly distressing situations. So it is only right that we care for them properly and care for the families who support them.


I would just like to give an indication of some of the initiatives that we developed, took for costing and took to the election. These were based carefully on the listening I have been doing over a period of years with veterans and their families. We would allow children of veterans who are acting as a carer for their veteran parent and the parents and siblings of veterans killed in service to access counselling through the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. The provision of counselling services is a tangible way to support them. We would grant bereavement payments to partners who have separated from their veteran partner where it is established that the veteran's mental ill health played a part in the separation. This initiative would recognise the unique pressures that veterans' partners experience through living with a veteran, which can affect their lives or their relationship and are often directly attributable to the military service.


Our initiative would have increased funeral benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 from $2,000 to $4,000, subject to review every five years to keep up with increasing costs. Our initiative would make the Department of Veterans' Affairs the responsible department for assessing the eligibility of veterans' carers for the Centrelink carer allowance, because it is that department that has a much better understanding of the nature of the condition experienced by veterans and the consequences and effects of caring for someone with that condition by their partners.


We would change the current situation regarding carer allowance so it is no longer cancelled after the veteran has been hospitalised for six weeks, which requires partners and carers to reapply. We would review the carer supplement every five years to ensure that the payment is adequate. We would increase veterans' home care respite services to 260 hours per year. That is merely 10 hours per fortnight, but I have heard time and time again from partners of veterans that that precious 10 hours—when they are looking after a veteran and often cannot leave the house or, if they can leave the house, often cannot do so with any certainty that they will be able to stay away without getting the call that they are required back home—would give them the chance to go and get a haircut, to go and have a cup of coffee with friends, to see family or to do some shopping.


We would also establish and maintain a jobs for Defence families website that would assist Defence families—who are often uprooted and moved around—and their partners to find employment with people who have an understanding and a respect for the Defence Force, so that they can be partnered up or given the opportunity to find out about employers who would make jobs available for them. I have been told the nomadic existence, in some ways, that veterans and partners experience is one of the great pressures on veterans' relationships. We would fund the Defence Community Organisation to provide enhanced induction and support seminars for Defence families before their loved one enters Defence service and also when they are leaving, so that they can be alerted to the things to look out for and be advised about the programs and assistances that are available for them.


So the Australian Greens oppose the repeal of the mining tax because, if the tax were implemented properly, it would share the wealth from our minerals among the community and it could fund worthy projects and initiatives just like those that I have outlined. So we are supporting this disallowance motion, because it is just not good enough to take away benefits for veterans' children just because this government is intent on repealing the mining tax. On behalf of the Australian Greens, I will continue to advocate to care properly for the people who do military service on our behalf and for the families who support them.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:34):  I rise to speak on this government's shameful plan to cut the Department of Veterans' Affairs income support bonus. This payment supports the children of service men and women who have died or have been seriously injured while serving in the Australian Defence Force. Labor is against this government's plans to take away this measure from the children of ADF personnel. Labor is proud that we provided the income support bonus while we were in government. I note that Labor's opposition to the MRRT bill in the Senate has allowed another payment of this very support just this week. It is a payment that would not have been made if the MRRT bill had passed.


This motion makes clear that, even if the government succeeds in removing the minerals resource rent tax, we will continue to fight for the income support bonus. What we are talking about here is $250,000 a year in the budget. That is about $215 per child of a deceased or injured member of the ADF. It is not a huge sum of money, but it is an acknowledgement of our commitment to look after the families of our ADF men and women.


To be honest, I am genuinely surprised that I need to speak on this. It had never occurred to me that a government would want to do this—stripping money away from the children of veterans. I find it inconceivable that any government would be so heartless as to cut income support to the children of service men and women who have died or been injured while serving their country. There are 1,200 children in Australia who will be affected by this cut—1,200 children who will miss out on about $215 a year.


RSL officials, as has been mentioned, have described these cuts as a mean-spirited, penny-pinching exercise that will hurt Defence families. Mean-spirited and penny-pinching—I could not have put it better myself. What makes these heartless cuts even more galling is that the they only save an estimated $250,000. That is all: $250,000.




Senator Lines:
  Shame.




Senator CONROY:
  I will take that interjection of 'shame' because that is exactly what it is. I will give those opposite some free advice: if they want to save $250,000, they could sack their mate Tim Wilson from the Human Rights Commission or, better yet, just cut Ziggy Switkowski's salary down from four days to three days a week—two simple opportunities—or even not reintroduce knighthoods and damehoods, which appears to be today's priority of Mr Tony Abbott's government. What an extraordinary lack of judgement and priority by this government. It is actually true. He held a press conference and actually said it. On the day that the government wants to take away $250,000 or $215 a year away from the families of veterans, he wants to spend money and time prioritising the reintroduction of knighthoods.


The people of Australia and ADF families will not thank Mr Abbott for this surprise. He promised before the last election that his would be a government of no surprises. If you want to save $250,000, do not take it from the children of injured or killed ADF personnel. These payments are made twice a year and provide funding for unexpected expenses. These payments help with expenses like textbooks, schoolbags, uniforms, school excursions or a new set of shoes for netball or boots for footy.


The Labor Party has long supported ADF families. We have supported them because we understand that ADF members do a tough job. We understand that by supporting their families we ease their burden. Our country takes ADF personnel away from their families for months or years at a time. We ask them to do a tough job in tough conditions. We look after their families so that our ADF personnel can get on with their job without worrying about their wives or husbands and their children they have left behind.


We understand that Defence families do it tough. We understand that while they are away, often in harm's way, their family is at home taking kids to school, paying bills and going to work. Our service men and women do an amazing job. They do an amazing job because they have the support of their family. They do what the government asks of them and they do it without question.


The men and women of the ADF go to dangerous places like Afghanistan, Iraq, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands to defend the security of our country and to help our friends and allies. They go to places like Aceh, the Philippines, South Sudan and Port Moresby to help those in need. Right now, ADF personnel are flying over and sailing through the southern Indian Ocean looking for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing two weeks ago. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my thanks for the work that they are doing. All of us are proud of their efforts and the work many Australians are doing to support the search mission. This includes not only the men and women of our Defence Force but also the officials of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Federal Labor fully supports their efforts. We are grateful for their efforts and the world is grateful for their efforts.


Sometimes ADF personnel are put in harm's way and they do not come home. Sometimes they go to these places and they are so seriously injured that they can no longer work. Do not these men and women, along with their families, deserve this payment? I believe they do. Labor believes they do and that is why we introduced this payment in government and why we are moving this disallowance motion today.


The income support bonus was not the only support that Labor provided to ADF families when we were in government. We put all the groundwork in place and fully budgeted for the National ADF Family Health Program. This program will provide gap payments for free GP visits for the families of ADF members and provide $400 a year towards specialist health care services. This ensures that the health and welfare of ADF families are being looked after. Labor was proud of this policy and was pleased to see that planning and preparation led to a trouble-free introduction. This policy will cost $103 million over the forward estimates and will provide services to around 71,000 ADF dependents.


Labor is committed to providing the best Australian-made equipment to the ADF and that is why it had a plan to bridge the valley of death. In the shipbuilding industry, Labor had plans to keep thousands of highly skilled workers on the job in the shipbuilding industry by bringing projects forward. This would have ensured that we had the knowledge, skills and infrastructure in Australia to undertake these big projects like the future frigate and future submarine projects, which I know are very dear to Senator Farrell's heart. That would be thousands of Defence industry families that would not lose an income under Labor's plan. This is in stark contrast to what the government are doing now. They are sitting on their hands, they have been in government for six months and all we have heard from them so far are empty promises and empty rhetoric. The minister needs to stand up to his cabinet colleagues and ensure that the valley of death in the shipbuilding industry is bridged so that our shipbuilding industry has a bright future.


I mentioned earlier that I was shocked that any government could seek to take away this small payment to help the children of killed or injured ADF servicemen and women. Perhaps, I should have seen it coming. This is after all a defence minister whose first action as a minister was to cut the pay and conditions of serving ADF personnel in the Middle East, including Afghanistan. The minister cut their allowance to the tune of $19,000 a year and now he wants to cut payments to the kids of ADF veterans as well. This is a disgrace, and the Senate should not stand for it.


This is a government that is happy to stand up in front of Liberal Party banners on Defence Force bases but refuses to stand up for ADF veterans and their children. That is right, Mr Acting Deputy President. Just in case you had forgotten, the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Tony Abbott, stood up in front of a Liberal Party South Australian campaign banner—




Senator Farrell:
  It didn't help them.




Senator CONROY:
  at RAAF Base Edinburgh just two days before the South Australian election. As my South Australian colleague next to me, Senator Farrell, has made the point, it did not help them in the end. They trash convention and trash and embarrass our military just for some cheap political point-scoring on an Air Force base. He stood there on this base next to the still Liberal opposition leader, Steven Marshall, in front of a Liberal Party banner. The banner included the Liberal Party logo, Liberal Party slogans and the Liberal opposition leader's Twitter handle. This was on an Air Force base. I have written to the minister and asked for an explanation. I am still waiting to hear how he allowed this to happen and, more importantly, how he intends to make sure it never happens again.


Those opposite stand condemned by their decision to cut this payment to the children of killed or injured ADF personnel. There is no support for these cuts in the community. There is no reason for these cuts. This is one of those few times when those opposite just let their mask slip and we get to see what they are really about—mean spiritedness and penny-pinching. The Labor Party will not support the government's efforts to cut this important payment, and nor should anyone else in this chamber. The Senate should agree to this motion to ensure continued support for the children of killed or injured ADF personnel.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:47):  I rise tonight in support of this disallowance motion. This disallowance motion aims to keep in place income support bonus payments to the children of war veterans, which the government has so callously and mean-spiritedly determined to cut. This disallowance motion will void the repeal of those payments to the children of veterans, some of whom are homeless or do not live at home and some of whom are orphans.


I do so because, quite frankly, I think those on the other side are probably not allowed to, but I am sure there are those on the other side who would seek to support this motion as well, because I cannot for a moment believe they are all so mean-spirited and callous to deny veterans' children the total of just over $215 a year—not a month, not a week, not a day, but a year. I have been absolutely astounded by this fact, because the yearly income support bonus goes to the children of injured and killed diggers, and, as I said, some are actually orphans. As has been said by previous speakers, over a year, it is a mere total of about $254,000.


In my home state of Tasmania, there are children who will be affected by the scrapping of this payment. I have recently employed on my staff and ex-Defence veteran who has had some conversations about this precise issue. He is very concerned about some of the children of his colleagues from when he was in the Defence Force in regard to this matter. I am not going to take too long, but I really want to stand up and speak about this


As I was saying, the cost of providing assistance is a total of around $254,000 a year, and that is less than 0.005 per cent of Mr Abbott's universally derided Paid Parental Leave scheme for millionaires. That is also much more than some people get paid for being on the board of a water company and only doing a couple of weeks work. Let me point that out: you might be on the board of a water company and only have to do a couple of weeks work and you could receive just about the same amount. So it is a sad day, I think, when the government puts the savings of a measly amount of money ahead of the welfare of children.


Everybody in this place knows that I have a longstanding interest in the welfare of children. Be it just over $200 a year or be it $20,000 a year to children who deserve it, it is a very important issue to me, and I know it is to a number of other people as well. Prior to the election, Mr Abbott said the government would promise to repeal the MRRT and the benefits it was intending to fund, but I think he was very sneaky. I do not think he actually pointed out to anyone that veterans' children who receive assistance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme would lose their annual payment of about $215 a year. I do not think they knocked on anyone's door and said, 'If you're a child of veteran, you will lose this money.' So I think there has been a sleight of hand and a bit of sneakiness going on in regard to this issue.


I think Mr Abbott needs to explain why he is doing this and why he is cutting these payments. As I said, it contrasts quite a lot with a number of other issues—certainly with the government's willingness to pursue a generous paid parental leave scheme offering payments up to $75,000. The annual cost of payments to veterans' children is less than the cost of providing four high-income earners with paid parental leave under Mr Abbott's proposed scheme. Why does the Prime Minister thinks that four women on higher salaries are more important and more worthy than 1,200 children of war veterans? I just do not get it. I think there are a lot on the other side who are probably embarrassed by this. I can tell you that, if I were on that side and my government had done something like this, I would be more than embarrassed; I would be taking it up to the leader and getting them to change their mind on it.


A number of people have made comment in regard to it. The Executive Director of the Defence Force Welfare Association, Mr Alf Jaugietis, said—and I quote—that he 'was ""bloody stunned"" and would seek clarification from the minister's office over the decision'. He also said:


… to target kids, and only about 1,200 of them, over something that costs so little, seems … petty to us …


Even that interesting person over in the other place, the member for Fairfax, Mr Clive Palmer, 'foreshadowed an obstacle to the government's repeal of the mining tax', declaring that it will not come at the expense of income support to orphan children or war veterans. The payment to veterans' children—which has an overall price tag for the government, as I said, of $250,000, give or take a few dollars—is to be one of the casualties, I think, of the mining tax repeal package. Mr Palmer 'threatened to block the repeal if the payments are axed', so he was very serious about it. He told Radio National on Thursday:


They'll just have to take it out or they won't have any change …


Mr Palmer also said that he thought scrapping the payment was 'a crazy thing to do'. The New South Wales RSL president, Don Rowe, also publicly stated his absolute disgust with the decision. He described it as 'mean-spirited' and 'a mean penny-pinching exercise'.


This is a callous act from the Abbott government; there are no two ways about it. I think coalition MPs and senators need to decide whether they will support the children of ADF veterans or they will back Tony Abbott's callous cuts to the assistance these children so richly deserve. They need to be, as I said, standing up to Tony Abbott on behalf of the children of war veterans, not voting to cut their payments.


In summing up today, I am so flabbergasted by this that I really find it a bit hard to put into words what I really feel because I know I probably need to watch my language, and it might get away from me if I do not contain myself. It is unexplainable to me why the government would go down this road. It is completely incomprehensible—



Senator Urquhart interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Thank you, Senator Urquhart, it is. It is completely incomprehensible. It is mean. It is nasty. It is callous. The adjectives could go on, and I probably would never end the adjectives about what I think about this case, but I strongly believe that the families of our veterans deserve the respect and gratitude that we should give them. I do not think they should be insulted by callous acts like this. I also firmly believe that we have the responsibility to support those children.


To anyone in this room, I would imagine that $215 a year is probably not that much money. I am sure someone on that side will probably say how many milkshakes or cups of coffee you could buy with it, because that has been known to be said before about the cutting of funding. It is not that much money. This issue has been so callously brought on, and Mr Abbott is so firm and so determined not to backtrack, because he made this promise to repeal the MRRT. Well, Mr Abbott, you are going to have to do something. It is not on. This is not what Australia is about. This is not the Australian way.


I think we all have the responsibility to support those children, whose fathers and mothers have given their lives for our country, so I urge those on the other side to really take it up to Mr Abbott. I am not sure when their next caucus with him is, but I would be getting on the phone if I were some of those people on the other side. I know they are not all hard hearted and callous on the other side. I have worked for six years with most of those on the other side, and I have spent a lot of time with some of them. Some of those on the other side I can get on quite well with. So I know they are not—



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Did you say 'name them', Senator Farrell? No, I will not do that because it might put them—



Senator Kroger interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  Oh, Senator Kroger wants to be named! Senator Kroger, if you want to be named, you go and take this up to Mr Abbott and you get him to change his mind, because I think it is really, really important that those on your side who do have a heart point out the minuscule amount of money involved, which is such a help to those children and those families. I will end it there, but I really did just want to get up—I have said more than a few words—and participate in this discussion because to me it is so important.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (17:58):  I rise today in support of these two disallowance motions. I rise as the daughter of a veteran who served as a commando on the Kokoda Trail. My father, now almost 92, has carried shrapnel embedded in and scattered throughout his shoulder and back for more than 70 years. I can tell you as his child that those scars that my father carried were not just carried in his back. He gave his youth for the service of Australia. He gave his youth fighting on the Kokoda Trail. So Legacy and the RSL, when I was a child, played a very, very important role in my life.


I go on now to talk about the current situation. I cannot imagine a more callous act from a government than taking such a small amount away from veterans' children. I was fortunate. My father came home from the war and went on to get married and have children, but that legacy of the years that he gave fighting as a soldier for Australia impacted on our family life. I cannot imagine the impact that losing a key loved one would have on a family. My father's injuries had an impact on our lives. When you kiss your loved one goodbye and then they do not come home, because they have given their life for Australia, the impact would be enormous. For the Abbott government to take money from the children of war veterans is absolutely shameful; and it is even more shameful because it is such a small amount of money for the government. But it is a significant amount of money for a family, because it helps with shoes, books or tertiary fees, and it is a tiny, little recognition that the parent's death meant something to the broader Australian community.


Again we have seen a government that simply cannot speak the truth, because last week the Prime Minister told my colleagues in the other place, 'No specific payments to veterans' families are being cut.' We know that is just not true. That is just not true. The Prime Minister can continue on saying, as much as he likes, that he has retained some of these schemes and that he has consulted with stakeholders on this issue. Fortunately for me, my father came home. But the families of mates of my father who did not come home relied on a bonus, a payment from the government, for their lost father; in most cases it was a father. Young Australians who were expecting to have some of their educational expenses met will now have to find the money for uni books or for fees to help fund their education or training out of their own pockets. Again I suspect that Legacy and the RSL will step up, but it is not appropriate for those organisations to be expected by the Abbott government to step up and fund such a minuscule payment.


The shadow minister for families and payments, Jenny Macklin, specifically asked the Prime Minister on 18 March precisely where and when the Prime Minister announced that this specific payment to the widows and orphans of war veterans would be cut. Despite the Prime Minister saying that he consulted widely with stakeholders, the RSL were not aware of this cut. Legacy is pleading with the government to reconsider. Young Western Australians were not consulted. They were not told that the cost of the assistance was the same as giving just four high-income earners the Prime Minister's extravagant and unfair Paid Parental Leave scheme. I would be ashamed as an Australian to think that we had cut this payment of $211 and a few cents per year to fund an extravagant parental leave scheme. I would be absolutely ashamed if we were to take that money from the children of veterans and give it to people who have still got a mum and dad in their family—people who have not suffered the ravages of war and who have not suffered a horrific and tragic death in their families. That would be the ultimate injustice. 


The Prime Minister keeps telling us, 'If you want to fix the economy you've got to fix the budget first.' I am aware of the arguments from the other side—that this income support bonus was expected to be funded by the minerals resource rent tax and, without the MRRT, the government can no longer afford to supplement the income of the children of veterans—including some who are homeless. What rubbish, what nonsense and what selfishness to take away such a small payment, $211.20—a very, very small payment in the budget of a government but a payment that would really make a difference in the lives of the families of veterans. 


This is nothing but bullying by the Abbott government. It is the bullying of a handful of children—just 1,200 children. For the Abbott government to say that it plays any reasonable part in fixing the budget whilst retaining the gold-plated parental leave scheme is just insulting. I would challenge the Prime Minister to stand up before one of the children from whom he is taking this benefit and explain why he is doing that. In my view, it amounts to reverse class warfare. And to be so unapologetic is callous. The cost of providing this assistance—as we have heard senator after senator say in this place today—is just under $254,000 a year. It is a sad day when the government puts their pledge to have the budget in surplus ahead of the welfare of children of veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. 


Dave Spillman, President of the Kwinana Branch of the RSL in Western Australia said:


We’re shocked the Prime Minister would cut something that helps the kids of RSL members like this. When Western Australians fight for Australia, get injured for Australia and die for Australia, we don’t think it’s too much to ask for their kids to get a helping hand. The armed services are important in Western Australia and the Prime Minister should remember that. We call on Prime Minister Abbott to reverse this decision.


Presumably the RSL is the major stakeholder, but obviously they were not consulted. It certainly does not sound like the Kwinana branch or Dave Spillman or any of the executives in Western Australia were consulted. I agree with the RSL on this matter. As the child of a veteran, I can understand how they feel. But I too am absolutely disgusted with the government's decision. This cut is unnecessary, and $254,000 will not achieve the budget surplus the government believes the country so desperately needs. 


Where are the government's priorities? I don't believe that if you want to fix the economy you have to fix the budget first. As a West Australian, I can think of a number of things we need before we need a budget surplus. How about a fast, efficient rail network? The RAC tells us in Western Australia that congestion is a massive cost to business. What about some roads that were promised linking eastern suburbs such as Ellenbrook and the Swan Valley? How about addressing the high cost of housing in Western Australia? What is the Prime Minister's answer when parents ask why schools in WA are not equal, why school performance is dependent on postcode and not funding and why some WA students exit school barely literate? The Prime Minister does not have an answer; the Abbott government cannot look WA parents in the eyes as it has no plan. 


If the government places a priority on getting to surplus ahead of these matters and cannot even put aside $260,000 to help the families of those who have put their lives on the line for our country to gain access to education, how will it ever prioritise every other issue for Western Australians? My father gave his youth to this country serving as a commando on the Kokoda Trail. Thankfully, he came home, but for those children and those partners who lose their loved ones, taking this minuscule amount of money away from children who have suffered the most unimaginable loss is absolutely unthinkable and mean-spirited.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (18:11):  I rise this evening to contribute to this debate on the appropriation bills and I really want to focus, have had the discussion earlier today about the reforms to FoFA being proposed by the government, to revisit an issue that I raised earlier today, and that is the role of the financial services industry in the administration of charitable trusts. Coincidentally, just a year ago I raised this issue in the Senate, because the administration of charitable trusts is quite fundamental to many Australian charities. 


Just over a year ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer referred the issue of regulation of certain aspects of activities of trustee companies under the Corporations Act 2001, particularly the fees they charge charitable trusts and the accountability and portability of their services. He referred those issues to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, CAMAC, which is a very important advisory arm to the government of the day. It provides independent advice on issues that arise in corporations and financial markets law and practice. Corporations Law we would think is a pretty long way away from the day-to-day operations of local charities, but in this instance Corporations Law is impacting in a very real way on the invaluable work of the charitable organisations that we will rely on to build and strengthen our communities. 


So the parliamentary secretary sought advice on the range of additional fees beyond those regulated under the act that are or could be charged by professional trustee companies; the effectiveness of the regulation of the new arrangements between professional trustee companies and a trust; the effectiveness of grandfathering existing fee arrangements; and what the current position is with regard to the removal and replacement of a trustee of a charitable trust, whether this position is unsatisfactory from a consumer protection perspective, and if so what, if any, reforms are necessary to address this. Finally, he encouraged the committee to bring to the attention of government any other issues that impact on the objectives of that 2001 act on the charitable purposes of trusts.


So what does that all mean? The previous government was committed to strengthening our communities by enhancing the work of charitable organisations. We have spoken many times about the opportunity and purpose of growing the culture of giving in Australia. The previous government had made very significant commitments to improving the regulatory environment in relation to philanthropy, with some very interesting consequences. An expert in philanthropy, Ms Elizabeth Cham, wrote in 2009:


Australian philanthropy has had a pervasive impact on society but it is largely invisible. Nothing illustrates this more starkly than the total absence of attention paid to, or discussion about, a landmark act that was passed by the Commonwealth parliament under which the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the regulation of the traditional services of trustee companies.


You would be more interested if you understood that one consequence of this could be a transfer each year of potentially up to about $23 million from the amount available for grants to the not-for-profit sector into administrative fees of trustee companies. It also alters the fee structure of perpetual charity trusts. Historically, they have been charged five to six per cent of income. Under the new regime, they will be charged up to 1.056 per cent of capital. The impact on a foundation with a capital base of, say, $50 million will be a fee increase from $131,840 to $528,000. So I think that you can see the dead hand of the Financial Services Council in what has happened in this space, just as we have seen the dead hand of the Financial Services Council on the FoFA reforms.


I was very disturbed when I absorbed this information. Like many of my colleagues, I did not realise the extent of the fees that come out of the moneys left by generous dead individuals and families on the understanding that the trust or foundation would be maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of those most disadvantaged in the community. Ironically, of course, the founders are no longer there to advocate on their own behalf and most have no independent trustees to challenge fee increases. This means that trustee companies are now the sole trustees for the great majority of trusts and foundations they administer. In practice, the for-profit arm of these companies tells itself, as the sole trustee of a charitable trust, that its fees will be increased. So you can begin to understand why the government is ready to review the legislation, which has now been in operation for two years. 


At the time, I for one was quite disturbed about what happened and, like most of my colleagues, did not realise the extent of the fees that come out of the moneys left by generous dead individuals and families on the understanding that the trust or foundation would be maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of those most disadvantaged in the community. Ironically, of course, the founders are no longer there to advocate on their own behalf and most have no independent trustees to challenge fee increases. This means that trustee companies are now the sole trustees for the great majority of trusts and foundations that they administer. In practice, this means that the for-profit arm of these companies tells itself that, as the sole trustee of a charitable trust, its fees will be increased. So you can begin to understand why the previous government was ready to review the legislation—which, at the time, had been in operation for two years. It has now been in operation for three.


Before I go to the report of the committee—which has yet to see the light of day—let me explain a little bit more about trustee companies and their significance for philanthropy and the not-for-profit sector. First of all, trustee companies are actually a uniquely Australian invention and, until the deregulation of the Australian financial sector in the 1980s, were somewhat old-fashioned entities established by gentlemen for gentlemen. Their initial role was to manage the assets of wealthy individuals when they travelled abroad for, very often, lengthy periods. Later, that was extended to managing deceased estates—some of which established perpetual charitable foundations. The trustee companies were seen as particularly suited for this because they had financial expertise and were perpetual organisations.


Trustee companies manage some of Australia's most valuable and significant cultural, medical and scientific awards and prizes, including the Miles Franklin Literary Award, the Patrick White Literary Award and the Ramaciotti medal for medicine. They also administer some of Australia's oldest foundations and bequests, such as the Alfred Felton Bequest established in 1904, and more recent ones like the Shane Warne Foundation.


Today, Australian trustee companies are the largest administrators of charitable trusts and foundations, usually as the sole trustee. They manage about 2,000 charitable trusts and foundations, with assets of approximately $3.3 billion—although that was at the time. In the report to CAMAC, the figures are mind-blowingly more. I will quote from the report which shows how significant these are. The report says that the organisations are:


… the sole trustee or co-trustee of some 1500 charitable trusts, with a combined capitalisation of approximately $3.4 billion. The FSC estimates that the entire charitable trust sector is valued at around $7 billion. The FSC has further indicated that (excluding charitable trusts that are PAFs—


private ancillary funds—


or PuAFs—


public ancillary funds—




administered by LTCs) LTCs, on average, distribute annual trust income amounts equivalent to 4-6% of the total capital value of the charita
ble trusts that they administer.



So this is a very significant sector, where the Financial Services Council has been having a significant influence for a long period of time.


The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, having been given that reference early in 2013, had as one of its challenges a consultation process that included calling for submissions. The committee received six submissions, including one from the Charitable Alliance, which is an alliance of concerned trustees, advisers to and stakeholders of charitable trust foundations, which provides significant financial support to communities across Australia. That submission made a series of recommendations related to reforming fees and prices, governance, transparency, portability and the issue of orphan trusts. The other submissions, with the exception of the Financial Services Council's own submission, supported the call for radical change in the interests of the charitable trust sector. Unsurprisingly, the Financial Services Council disagreed with those recommendations.


CAMAC had been due to have round table discussion, which was cancelled at the last minute because of the withdrawal of the Financial Services Council. So CAMAC then had to move to establish a new round table with interested parties and work out how this oversight could be part and parcel of the role of the new ACNC, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.


I will go now to the report, and the recommendations of this very senior advisory body are twofold. Firstly, CAMAC recommends that:


… the ACNC implement, or co-ordinate, Stewardship audits of a cross-section of charitable trusts administered by LTCs—


that is, licensed trustee companies. The recommendation continues:


The purpose of the audits would be to obtain information on how LTCs have performed their administrative responsibilities in the context of the philanthropic and benevolent purposes of these trusts.


So the issue of stewardship audits was a very significant reform. They took up the recommendations of the submitters to the inquiry and considered the concerns that were raised across the board. The stewardship audits that were recommended included things such as, the report says:


the level, and type, of active administration employed, including the history of investments and distributions and investment management practices


the relationship between the trustees of co-trustee trusts, including how any disputes between them have been resolved


how the concept of traditional services has been interpreted and applied in practice, in particular the range of activities that LTCs consider come within/outside the scope of that concept


the types and quantum of fees and other costs charged against the trust, including what fees and costs LTCs treat as coming within/outside the concept of traditional services (and therefore as coming within/outside those regulated under Part 5D.3 of the Corporations Act)


the method of valuation of the assets of the trust (for fee and other purposes) and the extent of involvement of any independent external party in that valuation exercise


the nature of any investment-related services in operating the trust (beyond investments in common funds) and the costing arrangements for those services


what services are outsourced, for what reasons, and the costing arrangements for these services


the extent to which the trust has received identifiable value for the various fees and costs charged against the trust


the nature and extent of any conflicts of interest that have arisen in the administration of charitable trusts


the extent to which the benevolent and philanthropic objectives of the trust have been achieved, including the implementation strategies that have been employed.


And the CAMAC report says:


The views of donees on relevant matters should also be sought, where appropriate.


So you can see that that is a far-reaching recommendation by the advisory council to initiate this concept of stewardship audits.


As soon as those recommendations were made public, the Financial Services Council went into overdrive to do whatever it took to advocate that these changes were not implemented, despite the recognition by the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee that this level of transparency was required for both donors and the philanthropic community to have confidence about the way in which this significant part of the charitable sector was being administered.


CAMAC proposed that:


… Stewardship audits be conducted or co-ordinated by the ACNC, with the trusts included for audit being selected by the ACNC or the party it appoints to conduct the audits.


It was anticipated that:


… participation in Stewardship audits would be on a voluntary basis.


Use by a regulator of investigative powers to conduct the audits was seen to be inappropriate, because it was not suggested that there was any deliberate evidence of improper conduct; it was about improving the processes of transparency. This was the crux of the CAMAC proposal, and, with it, came the notion that, by conducting stewardship audits, it could delay what some of the submissions were actually looking for: a more pressing and urgent regulatory reform. So CAMAC came down on the side of caution, on the side of a light-touch approach—a stewardship audit which would improve best practice of the management of these trusts and the activities of the licensed trustee companies.


Also in the CAMAC's report is a consideration of a review of a range of alternative approaches to trustee fees, which was suggested again in the submissions. CAMAC proposed that:


… fees and costs charged against a charitable trust be subject to a requirement that they be fair and reasonable—


something that all of us would think was fair and reasonable—


with an extended power of the court to deal with disputes alleging the charging of excessive fees or costs.


Well, the Financial Services Council has indicated that this was not something that they wanted to engage in. From the time of these recommendations being presented in the May 2013 report they actively began advocating and systematically campaigning for rejection of the recommendations that would see them be much more accountable and having to justify to philanthropic organisations around the fees and charges that they were charging, but also those that would make them accountable through the activities and oversight of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Therein lies the story about the fundamental shift to ensure that the coalition government persists in unravelling the ACMC.


Fundamentally, it is the influence of the Financial Services Council to ensure that they are not subject to greater oversight and this, for me, is a hugely important issue. It is about the gouging of fees from trustee accounts and philanthropic foundations, where there is no capacity for anyone to challenge the management of those trusts and there is no capacity for people to even shift from one trustee company to another. People may not realise that if you are subject to the public trustee—if someone's estate has been taken over by the public trustee—there is no capacity for beneficiaries of that trust to challenge the management of the trust and move it to some other organisation that might be prepared to manage the trust in a more transparent, fair and reasonable way.


We have seen the FoFA reforms and we have seen the Financial Services Council move to advocate in every way that it can for less accountability and less transparency. This issue about the administration of charitable trusts is something that will become a national shame if we do not focus on getting it right. The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee is a professional, legal support to the government, and its advice should be adhered to.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (18:31):  It is always a pleasure to follow my colleague and friend Senator Stephens. She worries about one word; I have days where I forget whole topics. We will see how I go at this late hour. I too rise to speak tonight on the Appropriations Parliamentary Departments Bill No. 2 2013-14, the Appropriations Bill No. 3 and Appropriations Bill No. 4. Before I get to the core of my comments, I have to say that I am having an exciting week and it is only Tuesday. Not a lot of things excite me, but I have to tell you, Mr Deputy President, it has been all about Western Australia this week and I have clearly thoroughly enjoyed the contributions, particularly from senators on the other side from South Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, Victoria. And there was a contribution from the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, who has now picked up the portfolio of Assistant Treasurer as well.




Senator Nash:
  You must not forget Senator Cash.




Senator STERLE:
  I will take that interjection from Senator Nash, for whom I have the greatest respect. We have worked together very closely for six years, but she has decided to run off to have another life as minister. Congratulations, Senator Nash. Senator Cash is always exciting—there is no argument about that. I know that, when we were in government, Prime Minister Gillard used to worry about what came out of my mouth sometimes, but Senator Cash leaves me for dead. She is a beauty! I mean that sincerely.


I want to talk about Senator Cormann's contributions today and for the last couple of days. We are talking about finance and we are talking about appropriations. Last year when we went to the federal election the current government made it very clear that they wanted to make massive changes to Labor's FoFA legislation—Future of Financial Advice legislation. We had taken serious action because we had seen some shocking developments with major collapses of financial advisory corporations, namely Westpoint. A number of Western Australians were caught up in that. They and other Australians were blistered—that is the only word I can find to describe it—by devious people who should have been locked up much earlier than they were. There were losses of up to about $312 million through very shady deals. We also remember the collapse of Storm Financial almost five years ago—a disastrous part of our mostly proud history. That unfortunately was not a proud bit.


We believe the financial advisory industry has a role to play. There is no doubt about that. But, sadly, there are some very shady characters—I will go so far as to call them crooks—who should not be in the industry. Unfortunately, you have some in every industry. They saw their way to garnering huge rewards from pushing certain products that did not suit their clients' needs. They got rich; the other poor devils lost their money. Hence, we put in some tight legislation. It irks me to think that the current government is doing everything it can to overturn it. Why would you want to overturn the protection of people's savings? The only reason I can find—and I will stand corrected if I am wrong—is some sort of payback to mates, though I am not too sure. I did touch on this earlier today and I would like to touch on it again because I think it is essential for those who may be seeking financial advice or those who may be wondering what the heck is going on with the backflips on some regulations from the other side of the chamber. I am touching on it again because this time it will be without the constant interjections and chatter from those opposite who are sent in to make a lot of noise and put off speakers in the hope that the message does not get out. Mr Deputy President, you know that I do not act like that. I would much prefer to have an informed debate and be heard by both sides.


I must quote from a piece in today's AustralianFinancial Review written by that well-respected and highly regarded journalist Philip Coorey. It talks about the backflip from Senator Cormann on the FoFA regulations. It says:


It is too early to describe the FoFA freeze as a backdown but it could end up that way. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says he intends to legislate for the policy as promised before the election, just that it would be better to have all the interest groups in agreement first.


What we have seen is a massive backlash in large parts of the community from people seeking finance, from pensioners and from community groups who are absolutely furious that this would overturn the tight legislation that was put in to protect people from bad advice, or just crooked advice—if I could put it any other way I would, but I cannot think of another way. Going back to the article from Mr Coorey, it states that Minister Cormann:


… who designed the FoFA changes in opposition, is hardly signalling a rousing endorsement of stood-aside assistant treasurer Arthur Sinodinos. 


It was Sinodinos's job to box the changes into shape, present them as regulations and legislation, consult the stakeholders and let fly. 


By Cormann's own admission, the stakeholders are largely opposed to what the government is proposing. 


He believes this to be more the product of misunderstanding and sloppy reporting than anything the government has done.


Every Western Australian listening should be very well aware of what our Minister for Finance, who is Western Australia based, actually means. In question time today in this chamber, he said—and, if I am wrong, he can challenge me anywhere he likes—that he was new to it and so he could not answers questions from, I think, Senator Dastyari and Senator Bishop in relation to why things changed, and he left it at that. Somebody is not telling the truth, because Mr Coorey clearly said that in opposition this was Minister Cormann's baby, that he developed it.


I refer now to another article in The Australian Financial Reviewin Chanticleer with the headline 'Cormann makes a clean break'. It states:


Sinodinos bungled the financial advice reforms by putting too much emphasis on cutting red tape and too little on what it would mean for consumers.


Where I am coming to with this is that we are still waiting for the National Commission of Audit report. I want to make that clear so there is no confusion. 


I want to go to one more article that Western Australians must be well aware of. It is also from The Australian Financial Reviewand Sally Patten is the reporter. In the article, she says:


Commonwealth Bank of Australia revealed in September last year that it had stopped putting in place systems that would have enabled its advisers to sign fresh contracts with clients every two years, a measure Senator Cormann has been keen to drop. 


The government may also come under pressure to either obtain industry consensus—


Well, we hope. Where I am leading to is that there was going to be a commission of audit where the belt would have to be tightened and a lot of promises might not be kept. It is my belief that something is not right here. Everyone wants to talk about us Western Australians this week, so why can't we have the report of the Commission of Audit? Why is it so secretive? It has been ready now for a couple of weeks, but it cannot be released. Some may think that because there is a Western Australia Senate election Saturday week on 5 April—and I have no proof because I have seen nothing—there might be some bad news in it not only for West Aussies but for every single Australian.


I now turn to another aspect that has given me much grief over the last few months. I have shared it with as many people as I can, but I would like to share it again now because I have not yet had the opportunity here. On Sunday, 17 February last year, the Hon. Tony Abbott as opposition leader visited Western Australia. I am told he had a Liberal Party campaign rally in Perth—so he was there to gee up the troops. I will read from a media release from the ABC; there is no stunt here. He told the crowd that 'he hopes to model his government on Premier Colin Barnett'. When I put that to some Western Australians in this place, no-one denied it. In fact, one of the good senators from Western Australia shook his head in agreement, so I am not making anything up. The article says of the then opposition leader and now Prime Minister Mr Abbott:


He says he has learned a lot from Mr Barnett, describing his government as a model he hopes to repeat in Canberra.


The party faithful thought, 'You beauty!' Bear in mind that February last year was one month before the Western Australia state election. So just under a month later, we went to a Western Australian state election where Mr Barnett was returned with a majority of more seats than he had in the previous government. He had received a glowing endorsement from a lot of Western Australians—not me, of course—that they wanted him as their Premier. This would have excited Mr Abbott because he wanted to model himself on Mr Barnett's government. 


What happened between 14 March and a month later? Mr Barnett went to the election telling all Western Australians to tighten their belts, that it was time for fiscal responsibility, that there was not a lot of money to throw around and that they wanted to contain pay rises through the public sector. I think the figure was a modest three per cent or something like that.


But—lo and behold!—about three or four weeks after the election, this wonderful article came out in Perth and talked about Mr Barnett's adviser Dixie Marshall's pay rise. You can see the nervousness that I want to share with every Western Australian, because there is a Senate election coming. I am not scared to talk about it. If Mr Abbott wants to model himself on Mr Barnett—uh, oh! Nothing was said about this, but a pay rise of $84,534—I am not making this up; I do wear glasses, but this is very clear—brings Ms Marshall's pay packet to $245,000 a year. This is why we have to be very careful. We are being told by Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott that we have got to tighten the belt, and we are also being denied access to the audit. What have they got to hide?



Government senators interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I notice the chirping starting. You will all have your turn, because I want to know if you know something I do not. But West Aussies need to be very nervous if Mr Abbott models himself on Mr Barnett and wants a repeat of his government in Canberra. I am getting a horrible feeling here. How can you get an $84,000 pay rise to take your pay up to $245,000 when you are the Premier's media adviser? 


There was also another pay rise that snuck through that there was no mention about before the election. It was to a Ms Cant. I do not know Ms Cant, but it says in this article that she is a long-time ally and director of government strategy. She got a pay rise of $52,963. This is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful. If you had the intestinal fortitude to go to the election and say that you were going to deliver these pay rises, maybe then I would be wrong and would not be talking about it.


But—do you know what?—I have absolute faith in the political system in Western Australia. It has just brought me back to the pack, because I have been a little bit unfair. You see, the Liberal members of the government over there in WA—and I am reading from the PerthNow article—were really annoyed. It says here that it caused 'furore amongst Liberal MPs' that wage rises like that could be awarded to two political advisers. There was no mention about it before the election. Western Australians are being told to tighten their belts. You know why there was furore? Because they said they believed they too should receive the big pay rises and then got cranky because their pays are set by the Salaries and Allowances Tribunal. I have got faith; I am back on. No worries.


You can see why we have the Prime Minister wanting to model himself on Mr Barnett. There are more reasons for fear. Let me tell you of another really dangerous situation that will occur if Mr Abbott reflects Mr Barnett. He has already started to reflect Mr Barnett. It will be cuts to education. My, my, my! In that great state of Western Australia there was no mention of the cuts that were coming to education. I have to share this with you. It may bore some over there. I see Senator Bernardi is yawning. It may bore him because he is not up for election and so he is sitting there feeling very cocky. But it does not bore me that $183 million has been taken out of Western Australian state schools. I know I am on a high horse here, because this is something that I am absolutely passionate about. I am actually honoured to be the patron of the Darling Range Sports College in Forrestfield in Mr Wyatt's federal electorate of Hasluck. It may sound very flash, but its previous name was Forrestfield Senior High School. It is a really good, knockabout, low socioeconomic public school, and it is not awash with the cash that you find at private schools. It had its funding cut by no less than $379,268.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  That is absolutely frightening. It has an Aboriginal population of about eight per cent too. It is not cashed up like maybe the school you went to was, Senator Bernardi.


But while we are talking about good knockabout public schools, I want to talk about my old school, Thornlie Senior High School, also in the same electorate. Their funding has been cut by $435,000. I have examples of primary schools in the same electorate—primary schools, for crying out loud! Here is one. Forest Crescent Primary School in Thornlie has had $230,885 cut from their funding.




Senator Gallacher:
  Did you go to high school?




Senator STERLE:
  I did go to high school. I actually did. I was there, Senator Gallacher.

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (18:11):  I rise this evening to contribute to this debate on the appropriation bills and I really want to focus, have had the discussion earlier today about the reforms to FoFA being proposed by the government, to revisit an issue that I raised earlier today, and that is the role of the financial services industry in the administration of charitable trusts. Coincidentally, just a year ago I raised this issue in the Senate, because the administration of charitable trusts is quite fundamental to many Australian charities. 


Just over a year ago the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer referred the issue of regulation of certain aspects of activities of trustee companies under the Corporations Act 2001, particularly the fees they charge charitable trusts and the accountability and portability of their services. He referred those issues to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, CAMAC, which is a very important advisory arm to the government of the day. It provides independent advice on issues that arise in corporations and financial markets law and practice. Corporations Law we would think is a pretty long way away from the day-to-day operations of local charities, but in this instance Corporations Law is impacting in a very real way on the invaluable work of the charitable organisations that we will rely on to build and strengthen our communities. 


So the parliamentary secretary sought advice on the range of additional fees beyond those regulated under the act that are or could be charged by professional trustee companies; the effectiveness of the regulation of the new arrangements between professional trustee companies and a trust; the effectiveness of grandfathering existing fee arrangements; and what the current position is with regard to the removal and replacement of a trustee of a charitable trust, whether this position is unsatisfactory from a consumer protection perspective, and if so what, if any, reforms are necessary to address this. Finally, he encouraged the committee to bring to the attention of government any other issues that impact on the objectives of that 2001 act on the charitable purposes of trusts.


So what does that all mean? The previous government was committed to strengthening our communities by enhancing the work of charitable organisations. We have spoken many times about the opportunity and purpose of growing the culture of giving in Australia. The previous government had made very significant commitments to improving the regulatory environment in relation to philanthropy, with some very interesting consequences. An expert in philanthropy, Ms Elizabeth Cham, wrote in 2009:


Australian philanthropy has had a pervasive impact on society but it is largely invisible. Nothing illustrates this more starkly than the total absence of attention paid to, or discussion about, a landmark act that was passed by the Commonwealth parliament under which the Commonwealth assumed responsibility for the regulation of the traditional services of trustee companies.


You would be more interested if you understood that one consequence of this could be a transfer each year of potentially up to about $23 million from the amount available for grants to the not-for-profit sector into administrative fees of trustee companies. It also alters the fee structure of perpetual charity trusts. Historically, they have been charged five to six per cent of income. Under the new regime, they will be charged up to 1.056 per cent of capital. The impact on a foundation with a capital base of, say, $50 million will be a fee increase from $131,840 to $528,000. So I think that you can see the dead hand of the Financial Services Council in what has happened in this space, just as we have seen the dead hand of the Financial Services Council on the FoFA reforms.


I was very disturbed when I absorbed this information. Like many of my colleagues, I did not realise the extent of the fees that come out of the moneys left by generous dead individuals and families on the understanding that the trust or foundation would be maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of those most disadvantaged in the community. Ironically, of course, the founders are no longer there to advocate on their own behalf and most have no independent trustees to challenge fee increases. This means that trustee companies are now the sole trustees for the great majority of trusts and foundations they administer. In practice, the for-profit arm of these companies tells itself, as the sole trustee of a charitable trust, that its fees will be increased. So you can begin to understand why the government is ready to review the legislation, which has now been in operation for two years. 


At the time, I for one was quite disturbed about what happened and, like most of my colleagues, did not realise the extent of the fees that come out of the moneys left by generous dead individuals and families on the understanding that the trust or foundation would be maintained in perpetuity for the benefit of those most disadvantaged in the community. Ironically, of course, the founders are no longer there to advocate on their own behalf and most have no independent trustees to challenge fee increases. This means that trustee companies are now the sole trustees for the great majority of trusts and foundations that they administer. In practice, this means that the for-profit arm of these companies tells itself that, as the sole trustee of a charitable trust, its fees will be increased. So you can begin to understand why the previous government was ready to review the legislation—which, at the time, had been in operation for two years. It has now been in operation for three.


Before I go to the report of the committee—which has yet to see the light of day—let me explain a little bit more about trustee companies and their significance for philanthropy and the not-for-profit sector. First of all, trustee companies are actually a uniquely Australian invention and, until the deregulation of the Australian financial sector in the 1980s, were somewhat old-fashioned entities established by gentlemen for gentlemen. Their initial role was to manage the assets of wealthy individuals when they travelled abroad for, very often, lengthy periods. Later, that was extended to managing deceased estates—some of which established perpetual charitable foundations. The trustee companies were seen as particularly suited for this because they had financial expertise and were perpetual organisations.


Trustee companies manage some of Australia's most valuable and significant cultural, medical and scientific awards and prizes, including the Miles Franklin Literary Award, the Patrick White Literary Award and the Ramaciotti medal for medicine. They also administer some of Australia's oldest foundations and bequests, such as the Alfred Felton Bequest established in 1904, and more recent ones like the Shane Warne Foundation.


Today, Australian trustee companies are the largest administrators of charitable trusts and foundations, usually as the sole trustee. They manage about 2,000 charitable trusts and foundations, with assets of approximately $3.3 billion—although that was at the time. In the report to CAMAC, the figures are mind-blowingly more. I will quote from the report which shows how significant these are. The report says that the organisations are:


… the sole trustee or co-trustee of some 1500 charitable trusts, with a combined capitalisation of approximately $3.4 billion. The FSC estimates that the entire charitable trust sector is valued at around $7 billion. The FSC has further indicated that (excluding charitable trusts that are PAFs—


private ancillary funds—


or PuAFs—


public ancillary funds—




administered by LTCs) LTCs, on average, distribute annual trust income amounts equivalent to 4-6% of the total capital value of the charita
ble trusts that they administer.



So this is a very significant sector, where the Financial Services Council has been having a significant influence for a long period of time.


The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, having been given that reference early in 2013, had as one of its challenges a consultation process that included calling for submissions. The committee received six submissions, including one from the Charitable Alliance, which is an alliance of concerned trustees, advisers to and stakeholders of charitable trust foundations, which provides significant financial support to communities across Australia. That submission made a series of recommendations related to reforming fees and prices, governance, transparency, portability and the issue of orphan trusts. The other submissions, with the exception of the Financial Services Council's own submission, supported the call for radical change in the interests of the charitable trust sector. Unsurprisingly, the Financial Services Council disagreed with those recommendations.


CAMAC had been due to have round table discussion, which was cancelled at the last minute because of the withdrawal of the Financial Services Council. So CAMAC then had to move to establish a new round table with interested parties and work out how this oversight could be part and parcel of the role of the new ACNC, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission.


I will go now to the report, and the recommendations of this very senior advisory body are twofold. Firstly, CAMAC recommends that:


… the ACNC implement, or co-ordinate, Stewardship audits of a cross-section of charitable trusts administered by LTCs—


that is, licensed trustee companies. The recommendation continues:


The purpose of the audits would be to obtain information on how LTCs have performed their administrative responsibilities in the context of the philanthropic and benevolent purposes of these trusts.


So the issue of stewardship audits was a very significant reform. They took up the recommendations of the submitters to the inquiry and considered the concerns that were raised across the board. The stewardship audits that were recommended included things such as, the report says:


the level, and type, of active administration employed, including the history of investments and distributions and investment management practices


the relationship between the trustees of co-trustee trusts, including how any disputes between them have been resolved


how the concept of traditional services has been interpreted and applied in practice, in particular the range of activities that LTCs consider come within/outside the scope of that concept


the types and quantum of fees and other costs charged against the trust, including what fees and costs LTCs treat as coming within/outside the concept of traditional services (and therefore as coming within/outside those regulated under Part 5D.3 of the Corporations Act)


the method of valuation of the assets of the trust (for fee and other purposes) and the extent of involvement of any independent external party in that valuation exercise


the nature of any investment-related services in operating the trust (beyond investments in common funds) and the costing arrangements for those services


what services are outsourced, for what reasons, and the costing arrangements for these services


the extent to which the trust has received identifiable value for the various fees and costs charged against the trust


the nature and extent of any conflicts of interest that have arisen in the administration of charitable trusts


the extent to which the benevolent and philanthropic objectives of the trust have been achieved, including the implementation strategies that have been employed.


And the CAMAC report says:


The views of donees on relevant matters should also be sought, where appropriate.


So you can see that that is a far-reaching recommendation by the advisory council to initiate this concept of stewardship audits.


As soon as those recommendations were made public, the Financial Services Council went into overdrive to do whatever it took to advocate that these changes were not implemented, despite the recognition by the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee that this level of transparency was required for both donors and the philanthropic community to have confidence about the way in which this significant part of the charitable sector was being administered.


CAMAC proposed that:


… Stewardship audits be conducted or co-ordinated by the ACNC, with the trusts included for audit being selected by the ACNC or the party it appoints to conduct the audits.


It was anticipated that:


… participation in Stewardship audits would be on a voluntary basis.


Use by a regulator of investigative powers to conduct the audits was seen to be inappropriate, because it was not suggested that there was any deliberate evidence of improper conduct; it was about improving the processes of transparency. This was the crux of the CAMAC proposal, and, with it, came the notion that, by conducting stewardship audits, it could delay what some of the submissions were actually looking for: a more pressing and urgent regulatory reform. So CAMAC came down on the side of caution, on the side of a light-touch approach—a stewardship audit which would improve best practice of the management of these trusts and the activities of the licensed trustee companies.


Also in the CAMAC's report is a consideration of a review of a range of alternative approaches to trustee fees, which was suggested again in the submissions. CAMAC proposed that:


… fees and costs charged against a charitable trust be subject to a requirement that they be fair and reasonable—


something that all of us would think was fair and reasonable—


with an extended power of the court to deal with disputes alleging the charging of excessive fees or costs.


Well, the Financial Services Council has indicated that this was not something that they wanted to engage in. From the time of these recommendations being presented in the May 2013 report they actively began advocating and systematically campaigning for rejection of the recommendations that would see them be much more accountable and having to justify to philanthropic organisations around the fees and charges that they were charging, but also those that would make them accountable through the activities and oversight of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Therein lies the story about the fundamental shift to ensure that the coalition government persists in unravelling the ACMC.


Fundamentally, it is the influence of the Financial Services Council to ensure that they are not subject to greater oversight and this, for me, is a hugely important issue. It is about the gouging of fees from trustee accounts and philanthropic foundations, where there is no capacity for anyone to challenge the management of those trusts and there is no capacity for people to even shift from one trustee company to another. People may not realise that if you are subject to the public trustee—if someone's estate has been taken over by the public trustee—there is no capacity for beneficiaries of that trust to challenge the management of the trust and move it to some other organisation that might be prepared to manage the trust in a more transparent, fair and reasonable way.


We have seen the FoFA reforms and we have seen the Financial Services Council move to advocate in every way that it can for less accountability and less transparency. This issue about the administration of charitable trusts is something that will become a national shame if we do not focus on getting it right. The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee is a professional, legal support to the government, and its advice should be adhered to.

There were losses of up to about $312 million through very shady deals. We also remember the collapse of Storm Financial almost five years ago—a disastrous part of our mostly proud history. That unfortunately was not a proud bit.


We believe the financial advisory industry has a role to play. There is no doubt about that. But, sadly, there are some very shady characters—I will go so far as to call them crooks—who should not be in the industry. Unfortunately, you have some in every industry. They saw their way to garnering huge rewards from pushing certain products that did not suit their clients' needs. They got rich; the other poor devils lost their money. Hence, we put in some tight legislation. It irks me to think that the current government is doing everything it can to overturn it. Why would you want to overturn the protection of people's savings? The only reason I can find—and I will stand corrected if I am wrong—is some sort of payback to mates, though I am not too sure. I did touch on this earlier today and I would like to touch on it again because I think it is essential for those who may be seeking financial advice or those who may be wondering what the heck is going on with the backflips on some regulations from the other side of the chamber. I am touching on it again because this time it will be without the constant interjections and chatter from those opposite who are sent in to make a lot of noise and put off speakers in the hope that the message does not get out. Mr Deputy President, you know that I do not act like that. I would much prefer to have an informed debate and be heard by both sides.


I must quote from a piece in today's AustralianFinancial Review written by that well-respected and highly regarded journalist Philip Coorey. It talks about the backflip from Senator Cormann on the FoFA regulations. It says:


It is too early to describe the FoFA freeze as a backdown but it could end up that way. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says he intends to legislate for the policy as promised before the election, just that it would be better to have all the interest groups in agreement first.


What we have seen is a massive backlash in large parts of the community from people seeking finance, from pensioners and from community groups who are absolutely furious that this would overturn the tight legislation that was put in to protect people from bad advice, or just crooked advice—if I could put it any other way I would, but I cannot think of another way. Going back to the article from Mr Coorey, it states that Minister Cormann:


… who designed the FoFA changes in opposition, is hardly signalling a rousing endorsement of stood-aside assistant treasurer Arthur Sinodinos. 


It was Sinodinos's job to box the changes into shape, present them as regulations and legislation, consult the stakeholders and let fly. 


By Cormann's own admission, the stakeholders are largely opposed to what the government is proposing. 


He believes this to be more the product of misunderstanding and sloppy reporting than anything the government has done.


Every Western Australian listening should be very well aware of what our Minister for Finance, who is Western Australia based, actually means. In question time today in this chamber, he said—and, if I am wrong, he can challenge me anywhere he likes—that he was new to it and so he could not answers questions from, I think, Senator Dastyari and Senator Bishop in relation to why things changed, and he left it at that. Somebody is not telling the truth, because Mr Coorey clearly said that in opposition this was Minister Cormann's baby, that he developed it.


I refer now to another article in The Australian Financial Reviewin Chanticleer with the headline 'Cormann makes a clean break'. It states:


Sinodinos bungled the financial advice reforms by putting too much emphasis on cutting red tape and too little on what it would mean for consumers.


Where I am coming to with this is that we are still waiting for the National Commission of Audit report. I want to make that clear so there is no confusion. 


I want to go to one more article that Western Australians must be well aware of. It is also from The Australian Financial Reviewand Sally Patten is the reporter. In the article, she says:


Commonwealth Bank of Australia revealed in September last year that it had stopped putting in place systems that would have enabled its advisers to sign fresh contracts with clients every two years, a measure Senator Cormann has been keen to drop. 


The government may also come under pressure to either obtain industry consensus—


Well, we hope. Where I am leading to is that there was going to be a commission of audit where the belt would have to be tightened and a lot of promises might not be kept. It is my belief that something is not right here. Everyone wants to talk about us Western Australians this week, so why can't we have the report of the Commission of Audit? Why is it so secretive? It has been ready now for a couple of weeks, but it cannot be released. Some may think that because there is a Western Australia Senate election Saturday week on 5 April—and I have no proof because I have seen nothing—there might be some bad news in it not only for West Aussies but for every single Australian.


I now turn to another aspect that has given me much grief over the last few months. I have shared it with as many people as I can, but I would like to share it again now because I have not yet had the opportunity here. On Sunday, 17 February last year, the Hon. Tony Abbott as opposition leader visited Western Australia. I am told he had a Liberal Party campaign rally in Perth—so he was there to gee up the troops. I will read from a media release from the ABC; there is no stunt here. He told the crowd that 'he hopes to model his government on Premier Colin Barnett'. When I put that to some Western Australians in this place, no-one denied it. In fact, one of the good senators from Western Australia shook his head in agreement, so I am not making anything up. The article says of the then opposition leader and now Prime Minister Mr Abbott:


He says he has learned a lot from Mr Barnett, describing his government as a model he hopes to repeat in Canberra.


The party faithful thought, 'You beauty!' Bear in mind that February last year was one month before the Western Australia state election. So just under a month later, we went to a Western Australian state election where Mr Barnett was returned with a majority of more seats than he had in the previous government. He had received a glowing endorsement from a lot of Western Australians—not me, of course—that they wanted him as their Premier. This would have excited Mr Abbott because he wanted to model himself on Mr Barnett's government. 


What happened between 14 March and a month later? Mr Barnett went to the election telling all Western Australians to tighten their belts, that it was time for fiscal responsibility, that there was not a lot of money to throw around and that they wanted to contain pay rises through the public sector. I think the figure was a modest three per cent or something like that.


But—lo and behold!—about three or four weeks after the election, this wonderful article came out in Perth and talked about Mr Barnett's adviser Dixie Marshall's pay rise. You can see the nervousness that I want to share with every Western Australian, because there is a Senate election coming. I am not scared to talk about it. If Mr Abbott wants to model himself on Mr Barnett—uh, oh! Nothing was said about this, but a pay rise of $84,534—I am not making this up; I do wear glasses, but this is very clear—brings Ms Marshall's pay packet to $245,000 a year. This is why we have to be very careful. We are being told by Mr Hockey and Mr Abbott that we have got to tighten the belt, and we are also being denied access to the audit. What have they got to hide?



Government senators interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  I notice the chirping starting. You will all have your turn, because I want to know if you know something I do not. But West Aussies need to be very nervous if Mr Abbott models himself on Mr Barnett and wants a repeat of his government in Canberra. I am getting a horrible feeling here. How can you get an $84,000 pay rise to take your pay up to $245,000 when you are the Premier's media adviser? 


There was also another pay rise that snuck through that there was no mention about before the election. It was to a Ms Cant. I do not know Ms Cant, but it says in this article that she is a long-time ally and director of government strategy. She got a pay rise of $52,963. This is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful. If you had the intestinal fortitude to go to the election and say that you were going to deliver these pay rises, maybe then I would be wrong and would not be talking about it.


But—do you know what?—I have absolute faith in the political system in Western Australia. It has just brought me back to the pack, because I have been a little bit unfair. You see, the Liberal members of the government over there in WA—and I am reading from the PerthNow article—were really annoyed. It says here that it caused 'furore amongst Liberal MPs' that wage rises like that could be awarded to two political advisers. There was no mention about it before the election. Western Australians are being told to tighten their belts. You know why there was furore? Because they said they believed they too should receive the big pay rises and then got cranky because their pays are set by the Salaries and Allowances Tribunal. I have got faith; I am back on. No worries.


You can see why we have the Prime Minister wanting to model himself on Mr Barnett. There are more reasons for fear. Let me tell you of another really dangerous situation that will occur if Mr Abbott reflects Mr Barnett. He has already started to reflect Mr Barnett. It will be cuts to education. My, my, my! In that great state of Western Australia there was no mention of the cuts that were coming to education. I have to share this with you. It may bore some over there. I see Senator Bernardi is yawning. It may bore him because he is not up for election and so he is sitting there feeling very cocky. But it does not bore me that $183 million has been taken out of Western Australian state schools. I know I am on a high horse here, because this is something that I am absolutely passionate about. I am actually honoured to be the patron of the Darling Range Sports College in Forrestfield in Mr Wyatt's federal electorate of Hasluck. It may sound very flash, but its previous name was Forrestfield Senior High School. It is a really good, knockabout, low socioeconomic public school, and it is not awash with the cash that you find at private schools. It had its funding cut by no less than $379,268.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator STERLE:
  That is absolutely frightening. It has an Aboriginal population of about eight per cent too. It is not cashed up like maybe the school you went to was, Senator Bernardi.


But while we are talking about good knockabout public schools, I want to talk about my old school, Thornlie Senior High School, also in the same electorate. Their funding has been cut by $435,000. I have examples of primary schools in the same electorate—primary schools, for crying out loud! Here is one. Forest Crescent Primary School in Thornlie has had $230,885 cut from their funding.




Senator Gallacher:
  Did you go to high school?




Senator STERLE:
  I did go to high school. I actually did. I was there, Senator Gallacher.


Debate interrupted.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2014-03-25,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:50):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the final report of the Sugar Research and Development Corporation.


For many years the Sugar Research and Development Corporation has done magnificent work in research, science and development of Australia's sugar industry. The sugar industry has been a magnificent contributor to the economy of Australia, particularly in my home state of Queensland, for over 100 years. Back when the SRDC was set up, it was envisaged that it would provide additional scientific work towards the sugar industry and help in its ongoing development. That it has been successful is evident from the pre-eminent position the sugar industry holds in Australia's primary industries at the present time. As a result of rearrangements last year, the Sugar Research and Development Corporation was, by the vote of its constituent members, agreed to be wound down. This was then supported by government legislation, which you might recall passed through in the dying minutes of the last parliament and the last government.


The proposal for the new agency to replace the SRDC was that the SRDC and the industry's key research provider, the Bureau of Sugar of Experiments Station Ltd, would be wound together to form a single entity called Sugar Research Australia. It was also proposed that the research coordination activities undertaken by the milling arm of the industry, the milling research consulting body in Sugar Research Ltd, be transferred. The industry decided to bring all elements of research and development, both growers and millers, into one new group—Sugar Research Australia. This organisation commenced operations towards the end of last year. 


I look forward to watching the progress of the new organisation and, more importantly, seeing what that organisation does for the ongoing support of, as I say, one of Australia's major primary industries—an industry which has earned billions of export dollars for Australia over the years, which employs hundreds of thousands of people and, indeed, which supports a lot of regional communities up the coast of Queensland and a little bit inland, too, including my home district of the Burdekin and the town of Ayr, where I come from. 


I particularly want to take note of this report of the SRDC being its absolutely last report and pay tribute to all of those who have worked with the Sugar Research and Development Corporation over the years, since its inception. The last chairman of the SRDC was the Hon. Ian Causley, whom many in this building will remember as a distinguished member of the other place for many years. Mr Causley was the last in a long line of very significant chairmen of that board who have made a major contribution to the sugar industry. 


In talking to this report, I want to simply thank all of those who over the years have made the sugar industry what it is today, and that includes members of the board and staff of the research organisation. In fact, it includes everyone in the sugar industry from mill managers, mill workers and cane farmers to truck drivers and harvester drivers—all those who work the cane farms. Over the years they have contributed to making this a wonderful industry that has meant so much to my state of Queensland. I congratulate all of them on the work they have done during the term of the SRDC, and I wish Sugar Research Australia all the very best in the important role it takes on following the closure of the SRDC.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-03-25,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:55):  The incorporated speech read as follows—


In 1891 George Black delivered one of the most lasting definitions of labour politics.


Our goal, he said, was to 'make and unmake social conditions'. This was the mission of the late, great Wally Curran. And he gave it one hell of a crack.


I pay tribute to him today as a great Australian and legend of the labour movement; a man of principle and character; generous of spirit, large in imagination, and unstinting in his service to the cause.


This was a man who helped shape a generation of labour activists - and in so doing, helped to reshape politics and industry in this country


Wally Curran: the boy from the boning room, born on Butcher's Picnic Day, the 20th January, in 1932.


To his opponents - and they were many - Wally was always something of an enigma.


They simply couldn't square his great intellect and learning with what they saw as his humble roots.


And the collars don't come much bluer than Wally's.


Born in Williamstown in the Great Depression, his mother was a factory worker and his father was a slaughterman.


Wally grew up with the 'professional fishermen' - or poachers - on the docks.


When he turned 14, his mother told him to find a job, or she'd find one for him. So Wally left Williamstown Tech at 14 and worked in the woollen mills and on the Williamstown Docks.


Then he got a job as a labourer in the local meatworks. There, he worked 16 hour shifts, for precious little pay, in appalling conditions.


Injuries on the job were common. The work was hard and physical. He was an adult before he had the time to be a child.


But these conditions did not make him bitter or resentful. They steeled him for the fight that would define his life.


The fight for dignity at work and justice for working people.


The fight for the opportunities and richer life that people of his class were denied.


And the greatest mistake of his enemies was to underestimate what this man could do.


For four decades he served the Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union and its members faithfully.


He was Assistant Secretary of the Victorian Branch, for 18 years; and Secretary for another 24.


Wally's industrial tactics were creative. He argued that people who criticised the AMIEU didn't understand it.


""It's free and democratic"" he used to say. ""That's how the members arrive at their decisions, and then they proceed in a disciplined way.""


His views are captured in a short story he wrote about the experience on the picket line.


""The picket was good humoured, peaceful, and marked by a sense of comradeship and belief in the right to take action and protect our jobs.


""This was, after all, Australia, and not some bloody sheikdom that relied on rule by force. We had the right to strike, the right to organise, and that's what we were exercising on that wharf.


""Some picketers took up fishing, only to discover that the fish had been contaminated by the local oil refinery and tasted of kerosene. Talk about the oil company, and what multinational companies did to local environments, here and elsewhere in the world, then became a topic for serious discussion.


""Being on the picket line to defend our own real and very immediate interests created a sense of social responsibility and the need to take


notice of and action about a whole range of issues; that affected our lives and our future.""


That larger vision - that empathy - were very much Wally's hallmark.


It was Wally Curran who took up the fight for equal pay for women in meatworks, later broadened to the entire manufacturing sector, when no-one else would touch it.


It was Wally Curran who championed an end to the Christmas sackings, the stand-downs without pay, the wretched insecurity that was for so long just accepted


It was Wally Curran who agitated for, and then implemented, the first Meat Industry Superannuation Fund.


It was Wally Curran who was instrumental in establishing the first Trade Union Clinic for workers; then secured funding for research into worker safety; and fought for the introduction of equipment that saved lives.


It was these contributions which earned him a Medal in the Order of Australia in 1997.


Through it all, he remained faithful to his class, contemptuous of bourgeois pretence, and true to the principles that fired him.


Wally made no secret of his red credentials.


He left the Labor party in the 1950s to join the Communist Party.


The training and intellectual involvement he found in the CP helped him succeed where others failed.


He returned to the Labor Party in the 1960s.


Here it is true that he favoured a much more comprehensive and radical political program than anything the Labor Party could offer.


But he matched that ambition with incredible political acumen - achieving a compromise that has always defined the labour movement at its best.


Industrially and politically, he knew when to set aside his ideological aspirations in order to reach a real-world settlement.


And he achieved so much. His influence could have a real impact on the fate of governments. His speeches made headlines. His counsel was sought by generations of Labor activists, and politicians.


He never held a formal position within the Labor Party, he never sought to be elected to a parliament, but he was never a 'faceless man'. And he never betrayed the union or its members.


Through all the turns of the political cycle, he stayed true to the labour cause and true to the people who put their faith in him.


Because people did put their faith in him — Premiers and Prime Ministers as well as men and women on the factory floor.


Perhaps Wally explained it best himself.


""People always came to me,"" he said. ""I never went to them. I never sought any great riches or a seat in Parliament. I was never after any of that, so I never wanted anything from anybody else and I was never beholden to any other bastard.""


And that was something else his opponents could never understand -Wally's politics of persuasion.


The Liberals, the Nationals, the Farmers' Federation and the conservative press threw bile at him for forty years.


They could not understand this man's influence and stature in the Labor Party.


They were flummoxed when Paul Keating turned to Wally for support. And Wally was well aware of it.


""In reflecting on my life,"" he said, in an article in The Age in 1993, ""it is easy to see where I have gone wrong. I have been constantly reminded by the metropolitan and rural press, by the electronic media, by politicians and indeed, many others, that I am the cause of society's problems.""


So what, as Shaun Carney asked in 1992, was so special about this man?


""Certainly,"" Mr Carney wrote, ""he is abrasive, aggressive, selective to the point of capriciousness in his choice of journalists with whom he will speak.


""He delights in puncturing those he perceives have even a whiff of bourgeois pretension, which means that a lot of journalists get short shrift"".


But Carney goes on to make an observation about Wally that will ring very true to those who knew him.


""Mr Curran appeals to Mr Keating,"" he wrote, ""because he refuses to bow to the established order and because he has devoted his life to the labour movement.


""When Mr Keating visited Mr Curran looking for support, he was a man with a problem just like so many members of the Meat Industry Employees' Union.


""In helping Mr Keating, Mr Curran in one respect was just doing the job he has done since the 1960s.""


Now as Wally would later say, after such a passionate embrace it was too much to expect that Mr Keating still respect the Left in the morning.


But for once he was wrong. To the end of his life, they remained in contact. Mr Keating continued to hold him in the highest regard.


And in any conflict, Wally was a formidable combatant.


He had a knowledge of human foibles and an intuitive understanding of people that couldn't be found in any ministerial brief.


And he would often sum up the health of a company long before the Stock Exchange was to know. One only has to think back to the meat substitution rackets of the 1970s and 80s, where companies that had denounced him as a ratbag - and worse - were later found to be engaged in organised crime. He was onto the crooks, and they didn't like it.


They were not just selling kangaroo meat to the Americans as beef - they were shipping arms around the country in meat-vans.


And when Wally spoke up, they accused him of single-handedly destroying the industry.


He was fearless and infuriating to his enemies.


On one particularly memorable occasion, he took to the stage at the right-wing Industrial Relations Society dinner, to share some choice observations on the Industrial Relations Commission of the day.


He accused this august body of 'lacking ability, obvious bias, hypocrisy, impropriety and incompetence.'


He further noted that productivity in the managerial classes would be greatly improved if the Melbourne Club closed earlier at lunchtime.


It was remarks such as these that got him referred to the DPP in 1991.


And amidst yet another round of calls for the AMIEU to be deregistered, the AFP finally concluded there was no cause to act.


Wally was always careful to cultivate his hard-bitten image. But you would be mistaken if you confused him with his public persona.


He believed in the rights of working class people to enjoy life in all its richness.


Not just a right to decent work for fair pay, and proper health and safety conditions, but also to participate in the arts, literature, and beautiful gardens.


To Wally, it was all the same struggle. He tried throughout his career to get his comrades to see the connections.


He himself was widely read, a keen potter, and a skilled gardener.


He was a very proud member of the Australia Council from 1974 to 1978 - reappointed by Malcolm Fraser — and a director of the Spoleto Festival.


It is hard to overstate the impact of having the Secretary of the Meatworkers on such an august body.


And he was a humanist.


Who fought for the equal rights of migrant workers. Who judged you on your merits, not your accent.


Who helped me and many others at the darkest of times, with his comfort, friendship and counsel.


For all his public persona of toughness, he was a gentle, generous and compassionate man.


Even up to his final conscious moments, his concerns were with working people. We in the labour movement remember him with gratitude and pride.


Our thoughts are with his partner Kay Morrissey, his daughters Lisa and Cindy, and his two grandchildren, Lucy and Tia.


He left this world a far better place than he found it.
