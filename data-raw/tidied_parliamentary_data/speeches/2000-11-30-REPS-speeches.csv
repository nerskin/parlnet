"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2000-11-30,"—I move: 
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Dickson from making a statement forthwith to explain her actions in relation to the 1996 preference selling deal between the ALP and the Australian Democrats. 
Come on, let's have the debate! You say you want the debate: let's have it. Come on! Show a bit of ticker for once. 
—The minister will resume his seat!
Opposition members interjecting—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. That motion is out of order; there is already a motion before the chair. Unless you are going to rule the Leader of the Opposition's motion out of order, this motion is not in order. You can't avoid ruling forever. One of these motions is out of order and you have to determine which one.
—As the Manager of Opposition Business is aware, in consultation with the Clerk—and I concede that the Leader of the Opposition was continuing to address the chamber, not inappropriately—I did not believe that the Leader of the Opposition had a valid motion because I did not believe that I had ruled.
—Is that your ruling?
—I have so ruled, yes.",REPS,<title>MEMBER FOR DICKSON</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—I move:
That the Speaker no longer possesses the confidence of this House.
This is an unprecedented day. This day has arrived without precedent basically because of faults in your own rulings. At the beginning of this day, you had an opportunity to uphold the standing orders of this parliament—the standing orders of the parliament which you have exercised hitherto with rigour on this side of the House and with some vigour, from time to time, on the other side of the House.
It may well be an oddball standing order in one sense, but there is an absolute requirement that, if a member of this parliament raises the point that something that was said to them was offensive, the member responsible is obliged to withdraw. Generally speaking, when a Leader of the Opposition gets up and asks for a withdrawal of a comment that has been made, it is withdrawn unreservedly. I realise you have a child, an unguided missile and a bully on your hands in the form of the Minister for Employment Services, and that is a difficult thing for a Speaker to deal with at the best of times. But it is one thing to have a termagant on your hands and quite another thing to allow him to get away with it.
This morning, it was time to bring this character, who has gone out there over the last 24 hours in defiance of the concerns that you expressed yesterday, to order. Characters like Abbott, characters like this minister, are invariably time bombs under their own decks and the time bomb under this deck has blown up on you comprehensively, Mr Speaker, has destroyed the authority of your speakership, has destroyed the meaning of standing orders and has destroyed decent behaviour in this House.
The minister got up. Instead of being required to withdraw at the beginning of proceedings, a simple procedure, he was allowed to stand up and lie in this chamber. Despite the existence, and the obvious implications, of what he had to say in the Hansard—and it was not an implication; it was a clear-cut statement—he decided to excuse himself by saying that all his comments were generic, and then he decided to compound that defiance of normal standing orders by getting up and moving that the member for Dickson be obliged to answer a lie. That is what Abbott did, the minister did, in this chamber.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Nobody who is lecturing you should be using members' names when they know the rules of the House.
—The Minister for Forestry and Conservation will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition in fact corrected the error he had made. For that reason I did not intervene.
—Mr Speaker, what the minister has been doing over the last 24 hours is cocking a snoot at you. He knew full well yesterday—you acknowledge your mistake. In the way in which you acknowledged it you made it clear-cut that, if you had understood the full implications of the meaning of what was said by the minister to the member for Dickson, you would have required action on his part. What the minister has been saying over the airwaves since then is that he intends to come into this place, defy normal parliamentary precedence—and get away with it—and say, `How smart alec I am.' He has been boasting around the benches of the parliament, `Look, I am the big bomb thrower, I am the big deal, I am the fellow who can get the opposition running.' 
—The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat—
—The Minister for Forestry and Conservation and the Leader of the Opposition will resume their seats.
—And the member for Lyons is warned.
—What was said by the minister yesterday was this:
Yesterday the member for Dickson, responding to misleading statements from ACOSS, issued a press release. She did not do live media lest she be asked the obvious question: how can you keep the so-and-sos honest when you are taking their money?
This is plain language. It is a suggestion in this plain language that the member for Dickson had received a bribe. That was the implication of it, and it is against those sorts of implications that the standing orders stand to protect members. Then the minister came into this chamber and, firstly, misled this chamber by saying that all he had said was of generic application to Democrats as opposed to the member for Dickson—that particular proposition is a defeat of plain language, I would have thought—and then compounded this reasonable interpretation of it by getting up and moving a motion in this chamber to try to get the member for Dickson to come in and state that she had not received a bribe. It was a classic `when did you stop beating your wife' type performance. None of that would have happened if something very simple had occurred earlier this day, and that is if normal standing orders had proceeded.
I was reminded earlier today of an incident in the Senate in 1986 when my Senate colleague from Western Australia Peter Walsh described Senator Walters as a `harpy'. Walsh then left the chamber after a withdrawal had been demanded. The President of the Senate—and remember the President of the Senate does not necessarily have a majority supporting them—sent the Black Rod down to Walsh's office to arrest him to bring him back into the chamber to make a formal withdrawal. That was Doug McClelland—that was a Presiding Officer. That is what happened then. That was a President of the Senate determined to uphold the standards of the Senate. He was prepared to have the Black Rod arrest the minister to oblige him to enter the chamber to make a formal withdrawal. That is guts; that is defence of the parliamentary process.
That was not actually required of you, Mr Speaker. There was just a simple requirement for the Minister for Employment Services to get up and withdraw. And I note that recently you have developed this habit of also asking for apologies—though I must say that is nowhere in standing orders that I can find. Nevertheless, it might have been useful on that particular occasion to ask for an apology as well. Accusing somebody of taking bribes in the political process is in anybody's terms, in anybody's language, an offence against standing orders that requires, at a minimum, a motion and, backing up that motion, a serious presentation of evidence to that extent.
None of those things of course were occurring. That is how this whole imbroglio started. Then, after their smart alec efforts at seizing the standing orders in this place and getting stuck into us, they found themselves arguing against impossible propositions that rulings were not rulings—absurd propositions. Whenever you pronounce on the standing orders you make a ruling. Whether the ruling is clear-cut in your favour or whether it is an area of discretion—whatever—it is a ruling. You make rulings when you are asked by members of parliament. You cannot sit in the chair and say, `This is not a ruling. I am just giving you some sort of advice.' Of course you cannot do that. Everything you say from the chair, because you are the Presiding Officer in charge of standing orders, is a ruling—every point is a ruling. 
A motion of dissent may be well based or ill based and, generally speaking, motions of dissent rarely are moved in this place. You find yourself in this situation, as I said, only partially through fault of your own. But, at the end of the day, you have to be independent of all of us and you have to make rulings. If we dissent from your rulings, that is a matter for debate in this chamber; it is a perfect entitlement of all members to do it. But, in persistently trying to slip-slide around that, we finally get to a position where a dissent motion was acceptable even to you and your very strange interpretation of what a ruling is in this place. That dissent motion was then put before this chamber, and in the course of that dissent motion the bells were rung. They were rung for a period of one minute. We on our side of the House suggested that perhaps they should have been rung longer. When we suggested that they should have been rung longer, you ruled that we were wrong. You ruled that it was perfectly appropriate in the circumstances for the bells to have been rung for one minute. It is not as though there was any doubt in the minds of any member in this chamber. There was a small problem with that, in that one or two of the folk who voted ultimately for you found themselves on our side at the normal closure of the division and were allowed, as you spoke slowly, to move to the other side.
Opposition members interjecting—
—After you had closed it, two of them came through the door. Had they been locked out, it would have been 55-57 against you. Then there was the vote, and the vote was 57-all. It was a vote legitimately counted in this chamber and a division legitimately held when all objections that could have been raised to it—that is, that the doors had not been quickly enough locked on the other side and that one minute was not a long enough period of time for the division to be held—had been ruled on by you. Those were the only potential impurities in the division, and before the count was held you had ruled on both of them. 
Then, when you finally had handed to you, after avoiding it for a period of some 10 minutes, the Clerk's recording of the division, you stood up and said that as far as you were concerned there was a sufficient level of confusion for you not to cast your vote either for or against yourself and to invite a further division in this chamber. There was no confusion or error. You had given clear-cut rulings. Nobody was lying in the crossbenches there who was counted twice on one side or the other by the tellers. There was no issue as to whether or not the particular bodies in the seats at the time were alive. There was no issue as far as that was concerned. There was no question of a stranger in the House appearing to vote when the stranger should not have been voting. There was no question of that. There was no question of a member under suspension voting in the chamber and creating confusion and contaminating the result as a result of that. There was no person involved at all in confusing the division. Any potential inadequacies in that division had already been ruled on by you, and we did not persist with them. You made the ruling that the couple of characters who were let in after the doors were supposed to have been closed could vote. Fine, we did not persist with it. You made the ruling that one minute was long enough for the division after we had asked for it to be longer. We did not persist with it. We accepted the rulings that you made. And then the vote came to 57-57.
Now you find yourself in the position of working out what it is that you ought to be doing. You have to make a choice between your job and the dignity of this place—between your job and the operation of these standing orders. I am afraid, Mr Speaker, you did not take the choice that most accords with the dignity of this place; hence we have been obliged to move no confidence in you—no confidence in your handling of the processes around this division and no confidence in the way in which you have handled this particular minister, who has been treated with kid gloves over the course of the last 24 hours. I can recollect yesterday, one after another, our people being obliged to withdraw. I cannot recollect one of those withdrawals involving an accusation on the other side that they had been involved in bribery or that they had been involved in, for example, that particular incident which occurred in New South Wales when a member of parliament—a senior Liberal—invited the Shooters Party to change their preferences on the basis of a payment. We made no accusations to the Prime Minister on those matters, though he was the leader of the party at that point in time. We had plenty of opportunity to sling mud yesterday on those particular matters, but we did not. Only had we done so would we have found ourselves in a position where somebody on this side of the House said something anywhere remotely as offensive as was said by this particular minister. 
This particular minister is the classic bomb thrower. He is so proud of his reputation that he does not care what happens to you, he does not care what happens to the government and he does not care what happens to decent standing orders in this place. He is utterly arrogant. From time to time people who live their lives in a state of suspended adolescence arrive in this chamber—people who spend their lives frozen in the school debating techniques of their childhood—people who have never left the sandpit do arrive in this place, and of course have no moral function, no moral direction and no understanding of the traditions that apply in this chamber, only an utter self-centredness, an utter pridefulness and an utter disregard for the basic decencies which dominate the political processes. Those children have to be stood on by Speakers to establish their authority. There is one child in this House now, and this is the child who has got you into trouble. But the child could have been dealt with by you, Mr Speaker, so simply, so easily. All you required of him was a simple withdrawal. He could have moved his childish motion after that if he had wanted to. He could have moved his childish suspension of standing orders, if he had wanted to, at that point in time, having been subject to the normal decent processes that apply to the rest of us. But that, Mr Speaker, was not a course you took. You have, as a Speaker, made error after error in your handling of this material over the course of the last 24 hours. You have allowed the chair to be defied; you have allowed the chair, therefore, to be defiled in the way in which you have conducted yourself in this regard. Then, finally, you have allowed a division to be bodgied. This House can have no confidence in you at all. (Time expired)

"Reith, Peter (Leader of the House)",LP,2000-11-30,"—Mr Speaker, you are a good Speaker; Mr Speaker, you are an honest Speaker. Mr Speaker, not one person—
Opposition members interjecting—
—The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence on what is obviously a matter of great moment to the House and to the occupier of the chair. Similar courtesy will be extended to the Leader of the House.
—Mr Speaker, you are a good Speaker; you are a fair Speaker; you are a highly respected member of this parliament. On both sides of this parliament, your decency and your fairness have been respected by all members. Only this week, I heard senior members of the Labor Party speak in glowing terms of you not only as a person but furthermore as a Speaker with the goodwill—
—You are defying the chair again.
—So is the member for Blaxland. 
—I have heard members of the Labor Party say, despite their constant interjections, that you are a Speaker who has clearly exhibited a goodwill—
—The member for Denison!
—the bona fides of a Speaker attempting to do what everybody recognises is always a difficult job.
—The member for Denison! 
—As I will, I hope, forensically show in my remarks today, all of the claims that have been made against you are either completely and totally exaggerated out of all proportion or, furthermore, as in some cases, simply and completely fabricated—just fabricated. Just to give you a quick example, I could barely believe my ears but I did hear the Leader of the Opposition say, `Everything you say is a ruling,' therefore attempting to justify some of the absurd motions that he moved this morning. I refer you to page 204 of House of Representatives Practice where it says that, in 1984, Speaker Jenkins named a member and an attempt was made to dissent from his ruling in naming the member. The Speaker then ruled that the proposed motion of dissent was not in order as he had not made a ruling. In other words, there was a Labor Speaker making the very point that you made this morning, and we had this, quite frankly, stupid suggestion—but I say it was a malicious suggestion—from the Leader of the Opposition. He knows otherwise, because he has been a Leader of the House. That claim that those motions that he moved this morning in dissent were validly based he knows to be wrong. For him then to use that as justification for this motion shows you that, when he is after a political objective—in this particular case, the Minister for Employment Services—this weak leader is prepared to attack a Speaker who is well respected by people on his own side. So he was simply attacking you, Mr Speaker, and fabricating arguments for his own political purposes. That is weakness in the extreme, and we utterly and completely reject it, as we will of course completely reject this baseless, uncalled for, unreasonable and unjustifiable motion.
All this comes about—
—The member for Denison is warned!
—because yesterday, as is often the case in question time, there was a controversy.
—I do not think the member for Dickson should throw barbs in our direction when the Manager of Opposition Business used the word `scumbag' in the House this morning, reminiscent of one of the worst offenders in this House, namely, the former leader of the Labor Party—the man from whom the Leader of the Opposition learnt some of his tricks—former Prime Minister Keating. It came about because yesterday there was a fracas because, as Australia now knows, federal Labor members in Queensland have been associated with payments in cash, in brown paper bags, to provide financial support to other political parties. As one of the editorials—
—Mr Speaker, I have a point of order in relation to comments that the member is now making. I argue that this is a no confidence motion against you, Mr Speaker, and that this is not relevant to the substantive motion before the House.
—The Leader of the House had prefaced his remarks by indicating why he was using this illustration. 
—I am simply explaining the context in which this matter came about. The Labor Party is very sensitive because one of theirs has been caught up with the allegations of corruption being made in Queensland. That is why you are so sensitive about it. The words used by the Minister for Employment Services—and he can go to the details of that—
—Pass me over the quote; I am sorry I do not carry it around with me. Big deal. What he referred to was a slogan of the Australian Democrats. That slogan was: `Vote for the Democrats and we will keep the bastards honest'. That is the slogan to which he referred. Yesterday in question time he referred to the fact that, to your great embarrassment, the Australian Democrats were receiving money from the Labor Party in a preference deal. In the 1996 election the party that said they would keep both sides honest in fact did a secret deal with the Labor Party. That is your embarrassment. Then, of course, the member for Dickson joined the Labor Party and she is now on their front bench. No wonder you are embarrassed! So what is the Labor Party's tactic today? They came in here today and they were acting so affronted! After the years of abuse which they have piled onto our side the Leader of the Opposition made an obvious statement, namely, that the Democrats—and in particular, because she was the leader of the Democrats, the member for Dickson—were involved in a deal to receive money from the Labor Party in an exchange of preferences. They waltzed in here full of fabricated and confected concern, anger and angst about those particular comments. They had every opportunity to allow the member for Dickson to get up on her feet and explain herself. In fact, when it was obvious that they were so determined to have a debate on this matter we offered them the opportunity. The Minister for Employment Services actually moved a motion to suspend standing orders to provide her with the opportunity to speak. 
Many things are said in this place. When you considered the matter yesterday at the end of question time, Mr Speaker, you took a different interpretation of what was said. No-one in this House could ask more of a Speaker than what you did yesterday: you stood up and honestly and decently said, on the basis of what you had heard—and no-one should forget that when you are sitting in the Speaker's chair, with the babble that comes from the opposition side, you do not always hear every last word—that you had heard these words uttered and you thought they meant one thing and that you were therefore prepared to go away and have a look at the matter. Seriously, can anybody genuinely believe that any more could be asked of a Speaker? When the Labor Party was running this country and we had Labor Speakers we never had as fair a go as the fair go you yesterday provided to the opposition on this matter. Furthermore, you provided ample opportunities in giving the opposition the call this morning. They were up and down on their feet like yoyos this morning. The Minister for Employment Services provided the context within which he made his remarks, and that basically was the end of it. But, of course, from the Labor Party's point of view, it cannot be the end of it because so embarrassed are they by this matter, when they came in here and had the opportunity to put up the member for Dickson, what did they do? They attacked the Speaker. Instead of defending their own, because they do not trust her to get on her own two feet to explain herself, no, they fabricate an attack on you, Mr Speaker. Part of that fabrication was to say—
Opposition members interjecting—
—The member for Melbourne Ports is not in his seat and I warn him. It is the third time I have had to draw his attention to what ought to be a courtesy extended to all members in the House.
—It is the old tactic, Mr Speaker: put up a straw man and say, `Oh, he alleged there was a bribe.' What he alleged was that there was a deal for the passing of money between the Labor Party and the Democrats. Given the fact that the member for Lilley had in the House publicly disclosed and confirmed it—and we know that the Leader of the Opposition knows all about it because he has had them all in to explain themselves—how can it be contested? That was a fact on the record in the House, and it is a shame on you that you should attack the Speaker as a political defence on your own part. 
A couple of other things need to be said. First of all, I mentioned the rulings. The fact is that the standing orders are the standing orders and you simply implement those standing orders. There are times and circumstances under the standing orders where it is necessary for you to exercise a discretion, and it is quite clear from reading the standing orders. For example, with respect to the closing of the doors—
—The member for Prospect is warned!
—It is only a small point but it again contradicts what the Leader of the Opposition claimed. With respect to the closing of the doors, that is not a discretion for the Speaker—an exercise to let a few in to suit yourself, which was the snide, unpleasant, totally unsubstantiated accusation. The fact is this is a requirement under the standing orders. This does not require an exercise of your discretion. It is as simple as this: as the standing orders require, the doors are closed—full stop. Again, sure, it is a small matter in a sense, but it is typical of the Leader of the Opposition to make any claim, regardless of the standing orders and regardless of the facts, because he is fabricating a completely baseless, unjustified motion and arguments in support of it. 
In respect of the four minutes and the one minute, I thought there was intervening debate. I am now not quite sure whether there was or there was not, quite frankly. But I know this: we had had at least two, if not three, divisions beforehand. I do know that the government won the election last time around, I do know that we do have the numbers on this side of the House and I do know that some members of the House were off to the Main Committee, off to their other job, if you like. If they had thought there was going to be another division, they would have been entitled to think and entitled to presume, as I think the Leader of the Opposition half admitted, that there would be a four-minute break. Well, there was a one-minute break and I saw some of them standing outside. Quite frankly, so what! It is hardly the biggest deal I have ever heard of. So what! (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Want of Confidence Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"McMullan, Bob (Manager of Opposition Business)",ALP,2000-11-30,"—This is a crisis that arises because of a failure of leadership of the Prime Minister. It is his responsibility to point you into line, Mr Speaker. He had the opportunity yesterday to not put you in this position because he could have and should have required the Minister for Employment Services to come in here and withdraw, and he did not. He spoke to him after question time, but it is clear he did not require him to come in and withdraw, as he should have done. It is ultimately the responsibility of the Prime Minister to ensure that these people who misbehave in such a childish, irresponsible, rude and continually arrogant manner get pulled into line, not earmarked for promotion. It is a failure of leadership.
There is an issue more serious—that is, the issue we raise with you, Mr Speaker, about your behaviour today and why we have a lack of confidence in it, accepting, as we do, that you have been put in an extremely difficult position by the irresponsibility of the Minister for Employment Services and the incompetence of the Leader of the House. We do understand you were put in a difficult position, but this is not a minor matter. When we have a division in this House, the Constitution of Australia says how it should be determined, and it has not been applied. Section 40 of the Constitution says:
Questions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. The Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote. 
That does not say, `Unless he feels like calling a second division.' It does not say, `It's a bit embarrassing, let's have another vote.' So what cover did you develop, on the best advice you had but on advice which was not good enough? That you would go for section 208 and say that there was an error or confusion. The Leader of the Opposition has clearly destroyed the potential argument that there was an error. There was nothing which occurred that was not known before the vote was declared. There was nothing that was known that did not establish clearly in advance that the vote was being conducted in a manner which you considered was proper and valid and in conformity with your decisions. 
Had the rules been more precisely applied, the vote would have been carried, because the member for Mitchell and the member for Makin would not have been entitled to vote since they came in after the doors should have been closed. Okay, that happened. But there is another reason why the vote should have been carried—that is, if the standing orders were being consistently applied. One member on our side yesterday was suspended for 24 hours. The nature of her apology to you, Mr Speaker, was not sufficiently grovelling, so you suspended her for 24 hours. What she said and in light of what you now know was the provocation that led her to do it suggest that hers was a much lesser offence than that of the Minister for Employment Services—for which you gave him the opportunity to repeat his remarks. You did not require him to withdraw them. You let him say, `No, I repeat them, I reiterate them, and then I want to move a motion to say that the person who is aggrieved should explain themselves.' Not the aggressor, but the victim! He gets the chance to say, `The person against whom I made this slur should explain the basis of the slur but I shouldn't have to withdraw it.' So, Mr Speaker, if you had applied the standing orders consistently, the member for Fowler would have been in here voting, the motion would have been carried and then we would have had a very interesting situation. You would not have had to worry about your casting vote. It would have been carried. 
It is clear that there is no argument to support your position or the Leader of the House would have used it. But he did not use one. He thought he might get away with attacking the member for Dickson again. She must have had the temerity to win a seat they thought they were going to win. What a shocking thing! And this offence has been something for which she has served a penalty of two years of sustained attack from the Minister for Employment Services without justification or basis in fact. The things which he said yesterday were not only scurrilous and unjustified, they were untrue. They seem to be pretty good grounds for requiring them to be withdrawn. Let me refer you, Mr Speaker, to how you defended him against statements that were made about him. Yesterday I said:
No wonder David Oldfield left—you were not good enough for him!
It is true that I said that. I still believe it to be true, and it was not generic. Mr Speaker, you said that you wanted to apply high standards: you asked me to withdraw the remark and I did. I said:
Can I just seek clarification. I will withdraw—
without qualification—
but are you seriously saying I have to withdraw something that I said to him—
the Minister for Employment Services—
when he does not have to withdraw alleging that somebody took money? 
How can that be a fair application of the standing orders? When we say, `He is lower than David Oldfield'—which is true—`and David Oldfield left,' you say it is unparliamentary, but it is much less of an accusation than that which he made about the member for Dickson. I, unlike him, have the defence of truth. My statement is accurate; his is false. He preceded his statement by another false statement when he said that she `issued a press release. She did not do live media'. Even the presumption on which it was based was false, and then he went on to make false, unreasonable assertions which the standing orders say absolutely have to be withdrawn.
We understand that you initially misinterpreted his remarks and, critical as we are of what has happened subsequently, we did not criticise you for that. In fact, we bent over backwards to give you time to require him to withdraw. We said we wanted it done yesterday, but at the end of the sitting we accepted, reluctantly, your advice to us that he would come in this morning. We accepted that that put you in extremely difficult circumstances because of the character, personality and consistent pattern of behaviour of this minister—the only minister who has had to be thrown out of this place for his behaviour. That probably rescued him from something more serious if you had not which, in hindsight, we may regret, but you did the right thing then, Mr Speaker. But we bent over backwards to say, `Yes, let him come in this morning,' even though that meant the member for Dickson was subjected to that unjustifiable insult for the whole of yesterday and it was reported last night. And while you were being advised that the minister was not available to withdraw it, he was out repeating it. But he said, `I am not available. I am leaving. I am interstate.' He was out doing television interviews repeating the assertion. But even then we gave you time. Did you require a withdrawal? No, you gave him licence to reiterate. 
It is an untenable position that you were put in but the standing orders say how you should resolve it. You should resolve it by requiring this person to withdraw. It needed to be withdrawn. Everybody in Australia knew it needed to be withdrawn, including the Minister for Employment Services. He simply chose to defy you and you chose to accept that defiance. You should not have done so and it has led to this series of events, culminating in that motion so incompetently handled by the government but which led to the division which you sought to have recounted, without a skerrick of justification, merely because it was extremely difficult and embarrassing. That is not, Mr Speaker, an acceptable standard for us and we cannot accept it. 
It would not be, in my view, an appropriate course, but we are being left with little other than for us to come in here and say that the scandal which took place with the Liberal Party's behaviour during the Lindsay by-election was the responsibility of the Prime Minister. We have never said that, even though he took the state campaign director who was responsible at the time and promoted him into his office. We have never said that it was the Prime Minister's fault. We believe it was a rogue element in his party doing the wrong thing. But perhaps it was not, given that he promoted the person who was running the campaign at the time and brought him into his office. But we have never made that allegation. We have never made the allegation about the very worrying claims raised by the Chief Government Whip last night about behaviour in the Penrith City Council, which is part of a chain of events directly linked to the office of the local member, the member for Lindsay. We have never even said that the member for Lindsay knew about that, even though everybody involved worked in their office. We have never said that she knew about it. We have never held her responsible. We have certainly never said it was the Prime Minister's fault.
Those allegations would be equally as valid as the allegation the Minister for Employment Services sought to make and we have never made them and we will not unless we are forced to. But, can I make it very clear, there is a lot more if you actually want to go down this road. But we do not wish to do that and we do not wish your behaviour, Mr Speaker, to force us to do so. But let us make it clear: we will not sit idly by while this minister continually, rudely, arrogantly and untruthfully attacks one of our colleagues. It will not happen. Each time he comes in and, outside his portfolio, attacks our colleague, abuses our colleague and tells lies about our colleague we will not stand idly by. We will stand and fight. And if you do not stand up for the standing orders in that process, we will be forced to say that the failure which he started has flowed on to you. That is where we are today, the failure which this person started by his pattern of irresponsible, rude, arrogant, untruthful behaviour—
—Serial.
—The pattern that this serial offender started has flowed on and you have been caught up in it. That is not all your fault, but you had the capacity to resolve it and you did not. That is what has led to this motion. In our view you should have resolved it yesterday, and you did not. You should have resolved it this morning, and you did not. That then led into a debate, consequent upon that failure, and we got into a very serious situation where a vote of no confidence in you was put and the government could not deliver a majority in support of you, Mr Speaker. They could not deliver a majority and you had to spend minutes pretending that you did not know what everybody here knew, what the result of the division was. In my view, it is not consistent with standing order 203—which requires you to declare the vote—your sitting there pretending. I see no evil, I hear no evil, so I can speak no evil is not an acceptable position for the Speaker. 
You had to accept that that vote had been counted and led to a result which was uncomfortable and difficult and caused by the incompetence of the Leader of the House, to which you should be becoming accustomed. But it is not an acceptable position to fail to declare that vote and then, when the vote goes in a manner which is unacceptable, to seek to have it recommitted with no provision in the standing orders which justifies that provision. It is a very serious matter. It goes to the heart of how this parliament works. The Leader of the House said, `It should not matter because we won the election.' Maybe we will just call the parliament off and he could rule for three years or perhaps he could come in here with rottweilers and a few people in masks. But we are not going to have the balaclavas and rottweilers in here, Mr Speaker. We are going to stand up for the standing orders and we are going to stand up for our colleague and for the requirement that the standing orders be fairly, impartially and consistently enforced. When that is done by you, you will have our support and when it is not, you will have our censure. ",REPS,<title>MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Want of Confidence Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2000-11-30,"—Mr Speaker—
—Withdraw!
Opposition members—Withdraw! 
—The Minister for Employment Services will resume his seat. The Minister for Employment Services.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let me say at the outset of my contribution to this debate that, in my opinion, you have been the fairest Speaker that this parliament has seen, at least in the decade that I have been associated with it.
Opposition members interjecting—
—I would remind members on my left that some of them have already been subject to warning. In fact, if the chair is to exercise the authority expected of it, they will be required to leave the chamber. The minister has the call.
—Mr Speaker, the fact that members on this side of the House are from time to time accustomed to grumble about one or two of your rulings is a sign of just how fair you are. In declining to exercise the casting vote to which you are undeniably entitled, you were showing yet again the high sparks of honour which have constantly motivated your occupation of the chair. I have to say that I feel deeply for you, having to deal at this point in time with a feral opposition which is frightened of the truth—a feral opposition which is frightened of the truth.
—The minister will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, I find the comment `feral opposition' offensive and I ask the minister to withdraw.
—The member for Paterson will resume his seat. The Speaker has heard, I am sorry to say, a number of offensive remarks this morning, and I am allowing the minister to continue because I do not consider that the comment he used was unparliamentary.
Opposition members interjecting—
—If I were to be consistent—
—Feral minister! 
Honourable members—Feral minister!
—I warn the member for Lalor! If necessary, I will issue a general warning if that is the only way that the Minister for Employment Services will get an entitlement to be heard. I warn the member for Lalor.
—Thank you, Mr Speaker. What happened today in the House which sparked the behaviour of the opposition and which sparked the opposition's motion is that I came in here and clarified a comment yesterday which had obviously been misunderstood, perhaps wilfully misunderstood, by members opposite. Having clarified my comments yesterday, I then sought to give the member for Dickson an opportunity to fully explain her role in the 1996 preference selling deal. The most important point which has emerged from all the proceedings in this House today is that the member for Dickson has been gagged by her own side. The member for Dickson has been gagged by her own side because her own side do not trust the member for Dickson to explain exactly what happened in the course of that 1996 preference buying deal. What happened yesterday? 
—Mr Speaker, this is a motion of no confidence in the Speaker. It has nothing to do with the member for Dickson. I would ask you to get the minister to keep his comments towards that objective.
—I thank the member for Bendigo. In fact, the whole exercise in which the House is engaged this morning has a great deal to do with events that occurred yesterday. I was endeavouring to listen closely to the minister's remarks. 
—What I said yesterday was: `How can you keep the so-and-sos honest when you are taking their money?' That is what I said yesterday. It was a reference to the fact that the Democrats slogan in 1996 was: keep the so-and-sos honest. At that time the member for Dickson was the leader of the Democrat party. There was a deal between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. We know that there was a deal. We know that there was a deal because the member for Lilley has told us in this House. 
—No doubt, Mr Speaker, the lack of confidence motion in you has been caused by this minister, but he cannot canvass that. What he should actually be doing is talking about why we should not censure you, rather than why we should be censuring him.
—The Chief Opposition Whip will resume his seat. For reasons that should be obvious to everyone in the House, with more intent I suspect than anyone else in the chamber, I am listening closely to what the minister has to say. He has not at this stage said anything that is unparliamentary, and for that reason I have allowed him to continue. I, more than anyone else in this chamber, have a vested interest in the minister's comments.
—The member for Dickson was the leader of the Democrats at the time. There was a deal, the member for Lilley told us. There was assistance provided, because the Leader of the Opposition has told us that there was assistance provided.
—Mr Speaker, my point of order is that this is a motion of lack of confidence in you. What the government should be doing is saying why the House should have confidence in you. He obviously does not; he is not willing to say so.
—The Chief Opposition Whip is aware that the minister has said nothing that is unparliamentary. I am listening closely to what he has to say, and I trust he is merely building his case sequentially.
—It is perfectly reasonable for members on this side of the House to want the member for Dickson to come in and explain exactly what the terms of that national deal were. Mr Speaker, this motion is a censure motion of you, but clearly from everything that was said—
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: your ruling that the minister has said nothing unparliamentary—
Government members—What is your point of order?
—I will determine whether or not the member for Denison is heard.
—may be strictly and literally accurate, but nor has he said anything relevant to the motion before you. It is your responsibility particularly—
—The member for Denison will resume his seat.
—I am making a submission—
—The member for Denison will resume his seat.
—I am entitled to make a point of order.
—The member for Denison had made his point of order. It was a point of order on relevance, and I indicated that the minister was being relevant. The member for Denison is obliged to resume his seat.
—In the course of this debate, there have been numerous accusations by members opposite towards me and other members on this side of the House that we are getting personal. Any fair-minded observer of this House who is listening to the accusations that are being hurled from members opposite, who is listening to the filth and drivel that habitually comes from members opposite, would know that there is no getting personal on this side of the parliament.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: already once this morning the government have failed to provide the numbers to support you and now, in this motion, they are not even prepared to talk to the issue of defending you. It is not relevant.
—By any measure, the comments made by the minister refer to an unfortunate incident yesterday which has provoked— 
—It was more than unfortunate!
—The Chief Opposition Whip is warned. By any measure, the minister is referring to an unfortunate set of events yesterday which has culminated in the actions this morning. I could hardly, therefore, rule him out of order.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I would ask you to ask the minister to withdraw that comment about filth and drivel coming from this side. I find it very offensive.
—I am the first to agree with the member for Franklin that it was an undesirable comment, and under my normal requirements I would require him to at least refrain from that sort of statement. However, I have sat here in the chair this morning and for a matter of 2½ hours now have heard a number of most undesirable remarks levelled at the minister.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member has asked for a withdrawal. Are you going to ask the minister to withdraw or not?
—I have indicated that I am not requiring the minister to withdraw because, if I were to be consistent in my application of the principles, we would have spent a great deal of time making withdrawals this morning, and I am simply seeking to facilitate the debate.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I rise under standing orders 75 and 76. They are that the minister should not be able to impugn the reputation of the honourable member for Dickson or make remarks that the honourable member for Dickson found offensive yesterday and, under the guise of this motion, reiterate them today. I ask you to ask him to withdraw and enforce those standing orders.
—If the minister were to say anything couched in yesterday's remarks that reinforced the slur he had made on the member for Dickson's reputation, I would be the first to require him—
—Why don't you get him to withdraw it?
—I simply asked him for a withdrawal.
—The statement I have just made—as I imagine the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is aware because he will have conferred with the Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Opposition—is consistent with my entire remark to all people who were in my office yesterday.
—Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to this debate. If in fact you have now admitted what he said yesterday was a slur, why don't you require him to withdraw it as the standing orders require?
—As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is well aware, if in fact the chair were to require all slurs made in this place to be withdrawn, sadly we would spend little time in debate. I have dealt as fairly as I can with this issue, and I want to use the remaining time to facilitate the minister, for obvious reasons.
—Mr Speaker, my further point of order is that withdrawal can come about through two courses: (1) through your requirement and (2) as a result of a request from the member defamed asking, which is exactly what the member for Dickson did yesterday. On every other occasion when a member has asked for statements slurring them to be withdrawn, you have required it of them. You have required it of us on every occasion. You were given the opportunity to reflect on this over 24 hours. Clearly that reflection has come to the conclusion it was a slur. She asked for it to be withdrawn, and it should be, on her request.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, one of the marvellous marks of your speakership is that members opposite have not been able to bully you the way the Leader of the Opposition's staff try to bully frontbenchers opposite. The Leader of the Opposition's staff have got more ticker than the Leader of the Opposition. That is the problem: the staff have more ticker than the Leader of the Opposition.  
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of  order. I am entitled to have a point of order on relevance and not to be ignored. That is absolutely disgraceful behaviour.
—Mr Speaker, the one basic point that has emerged from all the proceedings this morning is that members opposite are in fear of their political lives. They are absolutely terrified that they will be consumed by the fire that is burning the Beattie government in Queensland. And, Mr Speaker, you are a marvellous Speaker and you fully deserve the confidence of this House.
—The question is a motion of no confidence in the Speaker. I recognise the member for Dickson.",REPS,<title>MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Want of Confidence Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"Kernot, Cheryl, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—Thank you, Mr Speaker.
—Explain.
—The member for Fisher is warned!
—You ought to talk. Mr Speaker, I want to—
—So is the member for Swan!
—I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak, although I do not consider myself accountable to the Minister for Employment Services, the member for Fisher or anybody else sitting on that side of the chamber. In fact, I abhor the hypocrisy and dishonesty of the Minister for Employment Services and the way he calls himself a practising Christian.
Government members interjecting—
—Mr Speaker, I make this point because you told me yesterday that the minister could not be asked to withdraw because he was in transit. In fact, he went straight from this House, scuttled out of this House, knowing that he had said something specific and not generic, and he repeated accusations in a doorstop of which I have a transcript. Amongst other things he said: `Where did the money go? Did someone pocket the money? Certainly Wayne Swan has admitted that the money was paid over.' And this is where the connection takes place, Mr Speaker. He said: `What happened to it? Cheryl Kernot was the leader of the Democrats at the time.' Make that connection, Mr Speaker. But the point—the reason that I mention my abhorrence of his hypocrisy—is that he went from that doorstop to Paul Lyneham's funeral service. The Comcar drivers told me that he arrived at 4.30. Obviously, he thought it was more important to get out there and continue to defame me than to go to the funeral service. But I want to point out that I think I have a perfectly valid right to point to the hypocrisy of a man who willingly joins in the following words. This is the man who considers himself a specialist on Catholic doctrine. He goes into Paul Lyneham's funeral and joins in the hymn: 
Once to every man and nation 
comes the moment to decide, 
in the strife of truth with falsehood,
for the good or evil side ...
—The member for Dickson—
—It is perfectly relevant.
—The member for Dickson will resume her seat. The member for Dickson has the call. I think I could reasonably have presumed that there was someone seeking the call. The member for Aston, I believe, was on his feet. I am not seeking from the member for Aston a point of order. I am seeking an assurance that he was in fact on his feet when I interrupted the member for Dickson.
—Mr Speaker, I was merely going to raise a point of order on the question of relevance. The member for Dickson was not addressing the question that is before the House.
—The member for Aston will resume his seat. I merely wanted to indicate to the member for Dickson that my intervention was the result of a genuine belief—in fact an observation—that there was someone on their feet.
—Mr Speaker, we all remember what the Minister for Employment Services said about Greg Wilton's funeral. We all remember what he said in here and we all remember what he did less than two days after. I think the point that the Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business have made about this minister being a serial offender is a point well made. And it is where this issue beganand the comments that this minister made and which I asked to be withdrawn and which you failed to act on. 
—Which he now admits is a slur.
—Yes, and which you now admit was a slur on my name. Mr Speaker, I regret that we have to have this debate today—but it was in your hands yesterday. You allowed a minister to say what he said with intent—with intent to smear. I am not accountable to him, but I am very happy to talk about the circumstances of the preference negotiations.
—Tell us about the money. 
—Minister for Aged Care!
—The minister's remarks about my role as Leader of the Australian Democrats obviously have nothing to do with his portfolio, but that has never stopped him before. I was the leader of the Democrats. I am grateful for the opportunity that afforded me to contribute to public debate in this country. And I resigned—unlike others, I resigned from parliament before recontesting a seat for the Australian Labor Party—and despite your best efforts to defeat me. As the leader of the Democrats I was travelling around the nation quite extensively but I did take part in some telephone conference hook-ups. I am aware that at the national executive a decision was made to direct preferences to like-minded candidates first and then—
Government members interjecting—
—No, you are wrong—and then in a split ticket to both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. That was in the Senate. After that, conversations were held with members of the preference committees of both the Liberal Party in every state and the Labor Party in every state. The Liberal Party was not excluded from these conversations. As a result of these conversations, I find myself in the ironic position of having been part of the decision which recommended preferences against the Leader of the Opposition, the then member for Brand. Then the Democrats announced that preferences were directed to X number of Liberal seats and a similar number of Labor seats. 
It is as simple as that, Mr Speaker. I was not involved in the campaign for Lilley or in the state discussions about those allocations. I know nothing about any donations, and I join Gary Gray, Robert Ray and Meg Lees who speak with authority on this matter. I do know that Senator Bob Woods did approach Senator Vicki Bourne with all sorts of offers; I do know that. But I think the minister is being deliberately misleading in attempting to single me out as a member of a party. I was the leader. But, to use his argument, John Howard should then be responsible for the actions of former Senator Bob Woods in negotiating preferences and how-to-vote-card printing with the Shooters Party candidate in the by-election in Lindsay.
Mr Speaker, I categorically reject any association with this decision or with any money which may have changed hands. That is why I was extremely disappointed in you yesterday when you failed to require the minister to withdraw that statement. It was not a generic statement; it was a specific statement. It was said with intent to smear, as we know have been the actions of this minister ever since the day I joined the Labor Party and he began peddling his poison about me to the press—some evidence of which I have.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Dickson said I poisoned people against her and I was doing this consistently, and she said she had evidence. Produce the evidence.
—The minister will resume his seat. That is no valid point of order.
—Anybody listening and watching this debate would be asking why we are carrying on like this. I will tell you why, Mr Speaker: because it is about the style of John Howard's government and the abuse of this parliament in lying and defaming people almost on a daily basis. We on this side have had enough of it. We have particularly had enough of it from this Minister for Employment Services. Some old cynics would say that `twas ever thus. 
There is a very big difference between the argy-bargy of daily politics and the use of this chamber to daily smear and slur the character and reputation of members on this side. It is your duty to uphold the rights of people on this side as much as you do of your government by virtue of the fact that they are ministers. I take great exception to people leering and jeering from the other side—this from a man who vilifies the unemployed, calls them `job snobs' and says `You can't trust politicians.' I take exception to a person leering and jeering who presides over a crisis in aged care. I take exception to a minister involved in telecard rorting. I take exception to the many ministers who have failed the Prime Minister's own code of conduct and continue to occupy the front bench on the government side. That is what it is all about. That is why we are passionate about it.
Unfortunately, Mr Speaker, your failure to defend my rights to have that slur against me withdrawn yesterday when I asked for that to be done—when the minister has misled you about his inability to come in here yesterday and do it by telling you that he was in transit—causes us to reflect on the way you have exercised your authority in that chair. I did come to see you—I am very happy to put that on the public record—and I am still dissatisfied with the result of the outcome because, Mr Speaker, this is the result: it has been repeated all around this country because you did not give me the protection that I asked of you. I object to that too, Mr Speaker—and I told you so.
Mr Speaker, in conclusion, we do need to look at the way you have conducted yourself in this particular aspect of the debate. We do need new `fair to both sides' standing orders which are relevant and where truth matters—where truth and relevance matter. That is why our passions are inflamed. That is why I talk about Paul Lyneham's funeral. That is why I talk about the man or nation that chooses the darkness or the light. The Minister for Employment Services always chooses the darkness.
—The question is that the House has no confidence in the Speaker. The Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation is seeking the call.
—TA rorter!
—You are such a hypocrite. You paid back more than I did, Simon.
—At least I was there. You weren't there.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation have just illustrated the very remarks between each other that each other would want withdrawn and the difficulty the chair has had in intervening this morning.",REPS,<title>MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Want of Confidence Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2000-11-30,"—Mr Speaker, at the outset of speaking to this no-confidence motion, the first thing to say is that nobody believes you are anything other than nonpartisan, able, fair, balanced and decent in your behaviour in the chair and out of it.
—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition leaves me no choice but to warn him.
—This is one of those occasions where political emotions on both sides run high, and the simple fact is that it is a grave mistake to attempt to shift the blame to the umpire. There is something of a John Kerr syndrome at work here in that the Labor Party will dump onto the person who refers it to the proper voting procedures or who processes the ultimate decision. So you are the subject of a no-confidence motion simply because you put the vote to the parliament. Where is the gravity of that error of judgment as alleged by the opposition? You simply left it to the parliamentarians to resolve the issue. I think it is odious of the opposition to bring this matter before you by way of a no-confidence motion.
It is interesting that the Labor Party, having run two years of shock tactics in the House—of organised disruption, calculated noise and interference, interjections and points of order, so that they have overturned decades of established reasonable behaviour and restraint by parties on both sides of the House—now try to take the moral high ground. It simply does not work. It especially does not work to involve you in it. You have been a reformist Speaker of the parliament. You have faced daily provocation, at times from our side, and you have dealt with people on our side. I have been the subject of your warnings. Members on our side have been evicted from the House. We respect you for it, but the opposition do not, because they constantly test the boundaries of your authority. And when, Mr Speaker, you refer the final arbitration of this morning's prolonged and at times complicated exchange, they cry foul. They cry foul because the parliament resolved the issue as it ought to properly. 
Let us look at this matter sequentially. It started yesterday, when there was a dispute about the interpretation of the words used by the Minister for Employment Services. The fundamental issue is that you—if I understand you correctly—came to the conclusion that the minister was referring to the Democrats generically, or as a party. As you explained yesterday, you had a different interpretation from that put on the minister's words by the member for Dickson, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition at large. The dispute then arose about how to interpret those words and to what extent you would require withdrawal, but the minister was not in the House. You then, with typical fairness, balance and goodwill—for which you are rightly known—undertook to examine the record, which brings us to today.
The minister was spoken to. The minister gave an explanation, and points of order, in rapid fashion, followed. To try to resolve the matter, you then sought confirmation that the minister had not meant to reflect personally on the member for Dickson and that he withdrew any reflection on the shadow minister. As I understood the minister, he said that he was referring to the Democrats. This was not good enough for the opposition, because they wanted to stage-manage an attack on the Minister for Employment Services and, in doing so, were prepared to sacrifice the member for Dickson. They care not about her own personal position, because it was clarified this morning. Instead, they were prepared to trample on her standing, to confuse the issue and to muddy the waters, all for the purposes of attacking the Minister for Employment Services. You, also, were to be treated in the same fashion as the member for Dickson: as cannon fodder for their political opportunism and their political objectives.
The minister's explanation and your acquiescing in it this morning should have been good enough for the opposition. But it was never going to be good enough, because they had a political agenda. Whatever the cost to the dignity of the parliament, yours has not been infringed or compromised in any way. I cannot say the same about the parliament, but the Speaker rose above it. You properly and faithfully adhered to standing orders. You showed extraordinary cool, calmness and patience under constant provocation for more than one hour. There were dozens of interventions directed your way by way of points of order and questions—and insults, make no mistake, Mr Speaker, and nor have you. But, with good grace, you have decided to ignore or overlook the personal barbs thrown your way. If anyone is to emerge well from the heated debate and conflict this morning, it is you.
Mr Speaker, to continue on the events of today, you have properly fulfilled your duty as a Speaker, which is to determine whether words need to be withdrawn. You did so; you took the minister's word, as you do for all members. You were not affording the Minister for Employment Services any special treatment or favouritism—you dealt with him in the same way as you do all other members—but you had secured his withdrawal anyway. This will still not be acknowledged by the opposition—that the Speaker obtained the minister's withdrawal and clarification in any event. So all the nonsense and attacks that have followed, culminating in this phoney no-confidence motion, were totally unnecessary.
In the divisions that followed the vote was tied. You had the right to rely on a casting vote on the motion of dissent against you. Again showing the highest personal and professional standards, you did not give a vote in your own cause. It would have been the easiest thing for you to simply vote to strike down the malicious and contrived motion of dissent moved by the opposition. You did not do so. Instead you relied on your own judgment, in that you believed your ruling was correct, and indeed it was a correct ruling originally. 
Speakers must make such decisions. It is not for oppositions or governments to complain if a decision that is fairly and properly reached by the Speaker goes against them. And that is what it is—the Labor Party will never accept the umpire's decision. The simple fact is that you are now the target of the opposition because they seek to attack the Minister for Employment Services and the government at large. Never forget, all of this could have been curtailed if the opposition had agreed to the minister's suspension of standing orders to allow the member for Dickson to state her case. It is as simple as that—this is a debating forum. But they did not want to let her.
I am sure the member for Dickson—not that I dare speak for her—like most members of this parliament, would have welcomed that opportunity. She has been boiling with frustration, understandably, and wanted her opportunity at the dispatch box to put her case and set the record straight as she sees it. Yet she was prevented from doing so from 9.30 this morning until midday—for 2½ hours the member for Dickson had to cool her heels because of the Labor Party. They ruthlessly exploited the member for Dickson's position so they could attack the Minister for Employment Services.
—The member for Banks is warned.
—In the end, Mr Speaker, you had to resolve this matter, after what you may well have considered a misjudgment or error in not allowing the four-minute division bells to ring, by calling for a fresh division. That is simply commonsense. Where there was—if there was—a mistake made in the length of time the division bells were rung which excluded a large number of members from participating in the division, as is their rightful responsibility, you called for another division. Why would the Labor Party object to a democratic vote in the House of Representatives?
Your action was courageous, Mr Speaker. The easiest thing for you to have done would have been to vote with the noes on the motion of dissent against your ruling. The simple fact is you upheld the best traditions of that chair in taking the decision you did, which was to put it back to the members of this House. There is no escaping our responsibility to decide these matters. As the Speaker has said on a number of occasions, along with his predecessors, the conduct and behaviour of this House is in the hands of the members themselves. So it was a brave decision which, to any fair or balanced member of the House, has only enhanced your standing as Speaker of the parliament.
Who really in this chamber believes in this no-confidence motion? The opposition do not believe in it. We saw a number of your predecessors behave in an undisguised partisan way and trample on individual rights. There are very few in recent memory who have brought the same sense of fair play and nonpartisanship to the chair in the way you have—but, I hasten to say, I do not name anyone in particular. But we all know that not all Speakers have thrown aside their political bias. There are reputed to have been Speakers in the past with close relationships to the leaders of their party, to the point where some might have accused them of doing their party's bidding. But I do not want to be deflected from the issue at hand, which is a motion of no confidence in you.
—The Chief Opposition Whip is already under a warning.
—Every time a minister or one of our backbenchers rises to his or her feet there are family insults coming from that side. There are the most personalised attacks every day. We do not complain; we accept it as part of the culture and part of the moral corruption of the Labor Party. Then they think they can, in an institutional sense, impose their warped values on the parliament. We will not tolerate that. It is one thing for the Labor Party to engage in your personalised fantasies but it is another thing to tear down the parliament's traditions by way of a completely unjustified, completely unnecessary motion of no confidence in the Speaker. 
Mr Speaker, you have acted in the rightful way all through this. Your track record in your two years in the chair is one that you should be proud of—not that you seek any acclaim or any congratulations—because you have brought a degree of balance and fairness to the conduct of this House that most, if not all, of your predecessors would envy. It is a sad occasion that the Labor Party, for political purposes, seeks to draw you into what is a parliamentary debate, fierce as it may be. It is unjustified, it is uncalled-for and it has potential ramifications for the parliament as a whole, whoever may occupy the government benches or the Speaker's chair. Mr Speaker, the government and—in their hearts, if not in their consciences—the entire opposition reject this motion of no confidence.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. During the address just concluded, the Chief Government Whip made substantial reflections on the chair, and I ask that he withdraw. He was not a participant in the debate.
—Mr Speaker, I most happily withdraw any imputation that I made against the chair or any other member in this House—and it is a pity the minister does not too.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the government obviously think so much of you and your position they have had you defended today by two rorters and a spiv. You demand more respect than that, Mr Speaker. Where is the Prime Minister, Mr Speaker? Why isn't he here defending you, pulling that bullyboy into line?
—The member for Batman knows that, as much tolerance as I have exercised in the chair, the remarks he made would not be acceptable by any Speaker at any time.
—Mr Speaker, out of absolute respect for you and your position, I unconditionally withdraw those remarks. I only wish others would apply the same respect to you.
—The member for Batman has done as I required.

—The Treasurer may proceed.
—In percentage terms, the growth in net foreign debt between March 1983 and March 1996 was 668 per cent and from March 1996 to September 2000 was 52 per cent. As a proportion of GDP, the growth between March 1983 and March 1996 was 176 per cent and between March 1996 and September 2000 was 20 per cent. In relation to the current account, I should inform the House that, as a percentage of GDP, for the first time in nearly 30 years Australia now has a smaller current account deficit in percentage terms than the United States. This is a point which has been made—

—in the BT report put out today by Chris Caton, who after making the observation that—

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—This is not an issue about politics. It is not an issue about point scoring, as no doubt the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs would like to make people think. This goes to the very question of whether Minister Ruddock has the capacity to manage his portfolio. Let us put aside the minister's inaction and his blinkered attitude to date on the numerous allegations that have been made with respect to the alleged incidents at the Woomera Detention Centre. On this occasion, I would implore the minister to put aside his pride, to put aside his blind adherence to bureaucratic processes and to start to think seriously about the numerous allegations that are surfacing with respect to the incidents at the Woomera Detention Centre on a day-to-day basis. The people who are making these allegations are brave, credible people who obviously feel so strongly about what has happened that they are prepared to put their credibility on the line and, if you are to believe some of them, even expose themselves to possible retribution. I am aware that there are many others who would be prepared to come forward and tell similar stories if it were not for the confidentiality clauses in terms of their employment and the fact that they are concerned about what could happen to them.
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs defends these allegations by saying that there are avenues available for people with complaints. He says that they should report matters to the police or to Family and Youth Services in South Australia. If he really thinks that—and he again said that today here in this House—he is living in fairyland. Minister, if this were one allegation, I could understand your view. Of course then you go to the appropriate place where you can complain. If it were two allegations, again you would go to one of these state instrumentalities or to some other organisation. Even if it were three, I put it to you that maybe your answer would be appropriate. But, Minister, we are now at a point where there seem to be allegations of systemic abuses at the Woomera Detention Centre. People are frightened of retribution and are not making reports. Given what we are hearing about the culture at Woomera, is it any wonder that they are frightened of making these reports? 
To date the opposition, believing that the minister has erred badly in his handling of these issues, has pursued these matters in the parliament. For instance, the minister has had to be dragged in, kicking and screaming, to establish a limited inquiry with very limited terms of reference. Indeed, he acted only when the media broke the story. Even then, it was eight months after a document—evidently an incident report was made. He found out about it supposedly eight months later. I believe him that he found out about it eight months later, but I say to the minister: someone has let you down badly. The fact is that you made this decision to have these limited terms of inquiry only after you were forced into it by the fact that the media reported the alleged rape of a 12-year-old boy. Then, having found that document, having been made aware of that document, you decided that you would call for a limited inquiry.
We were also led to believe during the week that the minister had not received a letter dated 18 April that was sent by a Mary Lindsay by fax to Mr Smith, the director of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Adelaide. In that letter, Mary Lindsay specifically made the assertion that she had heard that there had been some problems with respect to a young boy. Again, I accept that the minister did not see that letter until the day that I tabled it in this House, which was a couple of days ago. But, Minister, what was the result of that inadvertence? What was the result of whoever it was, either the department or one of the officers in your own office, not giving you that information? Somebody either covered up this incident report or, for some reason, did not give it to you. What was the result of that? It is not just one of those matters where you can say, `Oh well, these things happen.' The result is that a 12-year-old boy was left in the environment where he was being sexually abused, and in the custody of the person allegedly abusing him, for another eight months. This is what we are talking about here. This is why I started off my MPI by saying that this is not about whether I am having a go at the minister or whether the minister is trying to protect somebody. The fact is that this is about real people. In fact, this is about a little child who is 12 years old. The result of this inaction, this inadvertence, this cover-up—call it what you will—is that this young kid was left in the hands of the person who allegedly raped him for an extra eight months. I am not blaming you for that, Minister—not personally. But I am saying that something is terribly wrong and needs to be looked at.
I think those of you who are involved in any sense in, say, family law or in problems between husbands and wives will know that, if any allegations at all are made to a judge that one party or the other is somehow molesting one of the children, immediately the benefit of the doubt is given for the welfare of that child. That child is taken away and put in some sort of custody. You do not take risks. In other words, I would presume that, if that incident report of the time had been made known to the South Australian Police and to the authorities, most probably they would have given it the benefit of the doubt and they would probably have put that young child in protective custody, where I understand that he was taken last Monday week.
Even after all of this, even after the minister has been made aware of all these facts—reading about it in the newspapers on a day-to-day basis, even after this—the minister callssome sort of a press briefing and extols the virtues of, and heaps praise on, Australasian Correctional Management and says that they are doing a wonderful job under the circumstances. In fact, journalists rang me to say, `You've got no idea how effusive the minister was in heaping praise on Australasian Correctional Management.' The fact is: why are these people all coming out? We will pursue these issues at a later time, Minister. But for now, what is at issue is the minister's ability to handle the situation. He must, if he has any idea of doing the right thing, set up an inquiry with full powers, including compulsion and protection of witnesses. Even though the results of that inquiry may be embarrassing to you, Minister, to other people and perhaps to your government, it is the right thing to do. It is not just the opposition calling for this; it is a lot of people out there in the community. I just want to read into the record a few of the editorials that I have seen today. One from the Advertiser— 
—The minister laughs. This is not a laughing matter, Minister. I am trying to be—
—Ill-informed.
—Ill-informed as far as you are concerned, but this is what these editorials say. This is the Adelaide Advertiser of today, Thursday, 30 November. It is headed `The fair go should apply at Woomera', and I quote:
The allegations about criminal behaviour at the Woomera detention centre where illegal migrants are held are deeply disturbing. But their veracity is yet to be tested. 
This is Australia, and the most excited complainant deserves a fair hearing. When the accusations are, in effect, about rape and brutality, posturing and half-measure responses are simply inadequate. 
The basic approach of federal immigration minister Phillip Ruddock marks him as a follower not a leader in this matter.
And it goes on. I say to the minister: be a leader on this issue. If you do not think that there is anything to worry about, what are you frightened of? Why are you giving this inquiry that you have set up, this investigation, such limited terms of reference without any real powers?
I now go to the Sydney Morning Herald editorial of today, Thursday the 30th, headed `Inefficient inquiry'. It says:
Even before it begins the inquiry prompted by allegations of child abuse in the Woomera immigration detention centre is flawed. The terms of reference announced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Mr Ruddock are too narrow.
It goes on to talk about questions of bias, which I do not particularly want to read. Then it goes on:
Mr Flood's inquiry will also be fatally flawed by its limited powers. It will not, it seems, have the power to compel witnesses to appear and answer questions and—most important—to protect them. Already, potential witnesses have reportedly said they would not appear before the inquiry out of fear of possible retribution. 
The announced terms of reference are narrow, confined to the “processes” for “identifying, dealing with, reporting on and following up allegations, instances, or situations where there is reasonable suspicion, of child abuse in immigration detention centres”. The inquiry will look at the “manner in which these processes were followed in cases during the past year”.
The editorial goes on to say:
But Mr Flood has not been asked to determine whether the serious allegations of criminal behaviour at the Woomera detention centre—of rape and sexual abuse of a 12-year old boy and sexual abuse of women—have substance. 
It is imperative to establish these fundamental questions, especially in view of the persistent suggestions that the allegations are baseless or arise from confused complaints from the boy and the young women concerned that are really the result of being traumatised by other factors, such as the harrowing experience of their journey to Australia. 
It continues:
In the terms of reference “the case currently under investigation by the South Australian Family and Youth Service” is mentioned. This appears to mean the case of the 12-year old boy
and it goes on. Later it says: 
The public must have confidence in the operation of the Woomera centre, run by the Australasian Correctional Centre Management. The public needs reassurance that the policy of privatising such a function as immigration detention is working and the principle of detaining asylum seekers is sound. For that, a wider and more powerful inquiry is needed. Anything less will simply store up trouble for the Government. As well, of course, an incomplete inquiry may also leave at risk the health and wellbeing of people in custody for whom the Government ultimately is responsible.
The Sydney Morning Herald's article is spot-on, mainly because it is talking about the people—and I am talking here about the possibility of the problems that we have with under-age children. There is little doubt now that there is a major crisis in the management of Australia's immigration detention centres, and in particular the Woomera centre, by Australasian Correctional Management. ACM contracts, for instance, stipulate the provision of clothing, yet the company went to St Vincent de Paul seeking free garments, disadvantaging both the charity's needy clients as well as the detainees. I will not have the time to read it today but there was a very good article in yesterday's Advertiser by political reporter Suzie O'Brien reporting that: `The company managing the Woomera detention centre approached charity groups last year for free clothing for detainees.' It goes on and says at the end:
But Mr Ruddock acknowledged it was contracted to provide complete service including food, clothing and shelter.
So we have a situation here where these people are going with the begging bowl to St Vincent de Paul trying to get free clothes which they are getting paid for by this government—and this government says that they are fantastic. It just beggars belief that this minister is that gullible that he would actually believe that. 
On the matter of ACM's failure to provide properly trained medical staff to treat detainees, we saw in yesterday's lead story on the ABC news where a nurse who worked at the centre said that psychiatric nurses—or people who were supposedly psychiatric nurses but did not have the appropriate qualifications—were giving out poison S4 prescription drugs; administering them. It is just unbelievable, Minister, that you say that there is nothing wrong. 
I want to make this point before I close: I know that there is not a lot of sympathy out there in the Australian community for people who jump queues, who come here unlawfully. I know that. And I know now that for some time this minister has believed that his treatment—demonising a lot of these people, giving them these temporary protection visas and not giving them any services, et cetera—might have been popular out in the Australian community. He may well have been right at that time. But I put it to you, Minister, that the Australian public has a heart: they do not like to read reports about young children being abused and they do not like to see human beings being treated in this way. 
Now that you have the opportunity to renegotiate your contract with Australasian Correctional Management, I put it to you that you should look seriously at their performance. I put it to you that these people who are making these complaints have a right to have their grievances aired before a full judicial inquiry with all the powers available to them to compel witnesses and to protect witnesses. If you do not do that, Minister, you are failing in your obligation as minister for immigration.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2000-11-30,"—I would have hoped that honourable members who are so enthusiastic about these matters might have waited to hear some more balanced discussion. It is a pity to see so many of them scurrying out so quickly.
—At least they sat around for me.
—They want one side of the story. I will just deal with the issue of agendas. I have been thinking very seriously about why these issues are being raised in the way they are and why the opposition is pursuing them in the way in which it is. The opposition makes it clear that it sees mandatory detention as an important public policy. I think the reason for this shadow minister taking that view is that he believes it would be electorally unpopular were he to do anything else. I do not know that it is in his heart to keep before him the reasons why these policies are pursued. The reasons why these policies are pursued are to ensure that there is a system of integrity in relation to the way in which people enter Australia and stay here and to ensure that we are able to look after the most needy people in our refugee and humanitarian program. 
Why? The shadow minister made it clear the other day in answer to an interjection. His agenda is to unwind the privatisation, as he sees it, of the detention system. He made it very clear that that is what his agenda is. He asks why other people should have any other agenda. I do not want to speculate as to what all the agendas might be. But, when I know that something like 63 nurses have been at Woomera and one or two people are pursuing matters and have pursued them over a long period of time, I ask myself whether they do have any other agenda. Have they sought other positions and been disappointed? Are there issues of the character we see so often in the industrial movement where people believe that, if you pursue a matter in this way, you can get a particular outcome?
The evidence will be seen in terms of the nature of the allegations that are being made—and I will deal with those in detail in a moment. The shadow minister said that I had been dragged kicking and screaming in relation to the establishment of the Flood review. The reason that I established the Flood review was that, on the evening of the day before I made the announcement, I learned that there was a document that should have been before Family and Community Services, which they said was germane to their inquiries but which was not before them at that time—and I certainly believe that the procedure is deficient and in need of examination. That is why the inquiry has been launched.
But I will go to the substantial issues that have been raised, because I think it is important to characterise the allegations that have been made to date in terms of all of the statements in the press that I have read and all of the statements from the member opposite.
—There are a lot more to come.
—He says that there are a lot more to come. If you have allegations and information before you that relate to the safety of individuals and they are of a substantial character and you have not put them before the police or the relevant authorities and you are holding it up for a drip, drip, drip, that would be the most highly irresponsible, and I think the most callous, approach that any member of this parliament could take. It demonstrates that what you are about is a political agenda. That is what it is about: drip, drip, drip. That is what he said. He knows—drip, drip, drip. Let us look at the substance.
— Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I seek his withdrawal of those statements about `callous'. The reality is that the statement I have made is on the basis that people are coming to me every day and giving me new information.
 (Mr Nehl)—Order! Let it be quite clear that the decision as to whether anything is offensive rests with the chair, and on this occasion I do not require the minister to withdraw. The minister has the call.
—I want to deal with the substancethe allegations that are in the public arena. First, in relation to a young boy, 12 years old, there is the allegation: raped by his father and sold to other detainees for cigarettes. An allegation relating to the boy was referred to the South Australia Police. They investigated the matter and found no basis upon which charges could be laid or the boy removed into care. It was also referred to the South Australian Family and Youth Services, which conducted a joint investigation with the South Australia Police. Again, the outcome was no charges. The matter was reopened two weeks ago and the investigation remains current—and, quite frankly, it is the only matter that is presently under investigation. While I do not know the result of that inquiry, I suggest that it would be far better for the honourable member to wait until it is available. Let me say, if the inquiry does show that the initial decisions were right, you have not got a feather to fly with. 
—No, the inquiry by Family and Youth Services—
—Order! The member for Bowman has had his chance. The minister will ignore the interventions from the member.
—By competent officers, well trained, who are taking a great deal of care in relation to this matter. The matter of the 15-year-old male being sexually abused was referred to the South Australia Police and FAYS, who found no basis for charges. They are the appropriate authorities. The matter of the report of a young girl being sexually abused in April was investigated by police who found no basis for charges. Police and FAYS are the appropriate authorities. There was an allegation that young girls were being engaged in a brothel. No names, dates or any information have been offered to authorities to investigate it. In the matter of a nurse raped by an ACM officer, not on site but presumably in Woomera, no report or complaint was made to the police by the alleged victim. According to the member for Bowman, colleagues knew of the attack. The police are the appropriate authority to deal with it. 
Let us deal with some of the other statements that have been picked up, because this gives you the genesis of the sorts of complaints we are dealing with. Do you remember the speech two days ago about babies being fed rice and cabbage and treated in hospital for malnourishment?
—I said they were the allegations. 
—You said they are the allegations. That is right. Let us deal with the allegations in that matter. No child has been admitted to Woomera Hospital or to other hospitals suffering malnutrition.
—Yes. No children have been admitted to Woomera or Roxby Downs for gross malnourishment, ostensibly as a result of poor quality food provided. But as I was there yesterday—and I am supposed to be vigorously defending ACM—let me put before him what I would have put if he had asked me a question on the matter. The handwritten menus for the period of 1 January 2000 detail the sorts of meals people get. At breakfast they get cereal, toast, milk, tea, jam—
—What about infants?
—You can go through and you can deal with it in relation to infants. Infants get infants' food or they are on their mothers' breast or they get bottled food. 
—What do they give them—cabbage and rice? 
—No. They give them the appropriate food. There are the menus. And not only do they have a menu for November but also they have a menu for Ramadan, which I table. There is enormous sensitivity in the way in which these issues are dealt with. Then there are the statements about unqualified nurses treating patients: 63 nurses have been employed at Woomera, 52 have been confirmed as registered in South Australia and checks are being made on the balance. When they advertise they ask for registered nurses. Some of those that come forward are from interstate and there is a short interregnum before people get their qualifications transferred to the relevant state in which they are working. But unregistered nurses can still perform medical tasks provided they do not contravene the registration requirements. Then there is the intimidation of contracted staff wanting to report child abuse. 
Many staff have both a legal and a moral obligation to report. There is no option. Reports to the abuse line of Family and Youth Services—and the pamphlet is here, which I table—make it very clear that the people who report to that line are anonymous; that is, the person reporting is not revealed to the accused. That information is quite clear. If people are claiming sexual abuse, why didn't they report it? Why have they left it, as the honourable member says, for eight months? If these are professional people making their judgments in these matters, they have a lawful responsibility to bring that information forward. And, eight months down the track, the judgments you want to put on me you are saying are totally unreasonable to ask of anybody else. 
—Order! The honourable minister will resume his seat. The member for Bowman has exhausted his deposit of goodwill from the chair. From now on he will be silent or he will leave the chamber. The minister has the call. 
—Let me deal with the final matter—information withheld or removed from files. That is the one matter that I think Mr Flood would be able to deal with. If it involves particularly medical malpractice, those are issues that can be reported to relevant health authorities—others like the ombudsman and the like. I make these points because, if you look at the evidence and you go through it, there have been reports and they have been investigated. Let me make it very clear: I am not trying to protect anybody in relation to the people who have a responsibility for dealing with these matters. If the police and Family and Youth Services believe charges should be brought, whether they are against detainees or others, those charges will be brought, as they were in Curtin in Western Australia.
In the time that remains I want to deal with some allegations that were repeated today on which the eight months was based—that is, the letter from Mary Lindsay. There is some information that has come to me from the head of the firm Macpherson and Kelley that employed her when she was in Woomera. She is one of the principals informing the member opposite. I will read from the letter because the letter understandably deals with the issues that are germane to this very question. He said:
It is, I think, relevant for you to know that Ms Lindsay was contracted by my firm between April 4 and 12 to assist us with Taskforce 32 at Woomera. That was the first and last occasion on which we have used her services. I was present at the Woomera IRPC during the processing of this taskforce and although Ms Lindsay had complaints about the inability of detainees to communicate with their families she did not then, nor at any time later, mention to me any concern about the sexual or other abuse of children in the centre. 
I understand that Ms Lindsay took it upon herself to speak to the DIMA manager at the Centre on that occasion about improving the facilities for detainees to communicate with their families. She contacted me after the taskforce and informed me it was her intention to write to you about these concerns. I wrote to you at that time disassociating my firm from any comments she may have made concerning conditions at Woomera IRPC on the basis that she was not authorised by my firm to make comments that had not first been cleared by me. 
To the best of my knowledge Ms Lindsay did not raise any concerns about maltreatment of children with any of the other members of the team which handled Taskforce 32. Had she done so we would have immediately taken the matter up with the DIMA manager at the Centre ... Until the current allegations arose in the media none of us at Macpherson + Kelley had received any information (from detainees or from any other source) about child abuse at Woomera or any other immigration detention centre. 
I note also that the letter allegedly written by Ms Lindsay claims that she heard about the alleged sexual abuse `last Friday' which Mr Sciacca calculated was April 14. This was two days after Ms Lindsay's return to Adelaide and consequently the source of this information is to be questioned. She also apparently noted that other “reps” at the camps had genuine concerns about children being sexually abused yet on bringing these concerns to the notice of “heads of firms” they had been advised not to get involved. As I have mentioned, no such report was made to me at any time. 
I also note with interest that Ms Lindsay's claims to have expressed her grave concerns to the head of ACM at Woomera when she heard about a `similar case' involving a young boy. In my opinion it is not likely that Ms Lindsay spoke to an ACM officer or anyone else about such a matter given that she did not mention it to me, and admits that she did not become aware of the matter until April 14 when she was back in Adelaide.
I mention those matters because this goes to the credibility of the sources that the member wants. There are motives involved in this—the member has admitted that he has a motive. Why does he want this sort of inquiry? Because he wants to parade a whole host of unsubstantiated allegations in the public arena for the purposes of discrediting a whole lot of professional people whose careers and futures depend upon them carrying out their obligations professionally and appropriately.

 (Mr Nehl)—Before I call the next speaker in the discussion, I noted during the address of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs that he tabled several documents for which he should have sought leave. I understand he implied that he should seek leave.

"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance concerning the government's failure to establish a judicial inquiry into the revelations concerning the immigration reception centres around the country. Behind the issue that the House is considering today is one very important concern. It is a concern that I am sure that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs does not take lightly—nor should he. The minister proudly wears his Amnesty International badge, a badge whose symbol is barbed wire. Yet at any given time he is responsible for the wellbeing of thousands of people who have been deprived of their liberty—people who have not committed a crime, people who have been forced here by circumstances that few of us here could even begin to understand, people who have sought shelter from oppression, people who have sought sanctuary in Australia and people, we should not forget, of whom 90 per cent will become permanent residents of Australia.
The minister has a responsibility to those people. He has a responsibility for their wellbeing, he has a responsibility for their safety and he has a responsibility to ensure that they are treated fairly in having their case heard before the tribunals. The fact that he wears the badge of Amnesty International makes those responsibilities personal as well as legal. When you deprive a person of their liberty—when you lock them away behind barbed wire—you take away the ability for them to help themselves, you take away their rights to access help and you make them totally dependent on you for their care. You cannot pass the buck—if something happens to them while they are in your care, you are responsible.
That has to be the principle under which the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs operates. You have to be open about it; you have to be accountable. You have to be accountable to the parliament and the people of Australia and, because the people you are dealing with are not citizens of Australia, you have to be accountable to the international bodies. Accountability means being open. It means allowing the people of Australia and the world access to what is going on behind the barbed wire of the detention centres. Accountability is not something you can contract out with a commercial-in-confidence clause. It is not something that you can hand over to a public relations firm. These are the snivelling excuses that a coward hides behind. And when it comes to being accountable you cannot get away with a whitewash investigation.
In Australia the standard for accountability is a judicial inquiry. Only the judiciary has the credibility to conduct an inquiry into matters which may involve the serious breaches alleged to have occurred. Anything less will be seen as a whitewash. If that happens, Australia's immigration practices will be rightly seen as a sham by the international community. But any investigation of alleged incidents must be seen against a backdrop of the development of detention centres—or, to give them their quaint title, `immigration reception processing centres'. It is true that such centres have been a reality of immigration policies throughout the term of many successive governments, but this government and this minister have taken the development of detention centres way beyond anything we have seen in this country before.
Why is it that we now have thousands of people detained in the most remote parts of Australia—thousands of kilometres from the tribunals which will hear their case, far from the legal representatives who will argue their case and far from the cities in which 90 per cent of them will eventually settle? It is part of a deliberate policy designed to pander to a racist minority in the Australian electorate. In a government driven by opinion polls the comments coming out of the focus groups provide the basis for this government's policy. This minister, despite his appeal to the principles of Amnesty International, is the willing servant of the government in implementing this policy. 
I am sure members will be familiar with the solution proposed by some citizens to deal with people seeking refuge in Australia. There are those who would send out the Navy to sink the boats and drown their occupants before they reached our shores. The minister does not go that far, but this government's policies are the nearest thing. When it comes to people arriving in Australia without the required authority this policy makes life so difficult and uncomfortable that it is a deterrent to anyone considering it. Having visited—along with the member for Hindmarsh—a number of detention centres, including those in Port Headland Broome, Curtin, Darwin and Villawood, I would have to say that they would be best described as deterrent centres rather than detention centres. So while the great majority of people detained in those centres have committed no crime, while they have not been sentenced as punishment, the government has to use the centres as a deterrent to those who would seek to come to Australia.
While the department put together videos—we all remember the videos that the department put together—showing sharks, crocodiles, snakes and spiders, the real deterrent, it hopes, is that word will get back to the countries from which asylum seekers come describing the detention centres as horror camps. If that is what the minister intended, then for some he may have succeeded. As anyone who has spoken to refugees would know, they have to put up with much worse. Many have already risked their lives in unsafe and overcrowded boats to get here, so just how far will the minister go to deter asylum seekers? What horrors can he dream up that will cause asylum seekers to avoid Australia? Given the sorts of responses he must get from his opinion polling, he probably thinks he can get away with anything. But I wonder if those same Australians would see things differently if they or a member of their family were to be treated by a foreign government in the same way that this government treats asylum seekers.
Some years ago I had the misfortune to have my passport and travel documents stolen while I was overseas. I can tell you that it can be quite frightening trying to convince officials that you are a tourist. Fortunately, I was able to get my passport back and continue on my journey. I was grateful that the people I dealt with were helpful, but I can imagine the difficulty I might have faced, because there are some people in the world who would not have allowed it. Listen to this, Minister: those thoughts crossed my mind when I visited a detention centre recently. I noticed a young woman, about the same age as my daughter, who had arrived in Australia by air, not by boat, without documents. When I saw the conditions in which she was being detained—and the member for Hindmarsh saw them as well—I could not help but think that if this were happening to the daughter of an Australian citizen there would be a great outcry against this uncivilised treatment of one of our own. And this really is the whole point of this debate. While we set out to deter asylum seekers, we create conditions which are totally unacceptable in a civilised world. For some this is justified, but that justification amounts to nothing less than racism. We are prepared to treat others in ways that we would condemn if they were suffered by one of our own. To avoid such accusations we must make it clear to Australians and to the world that when we deprive people of their liberty we do so only on reasonable grounds and that, having detained them, we apply the highest standards of care. To show that we are accountable, we need to have our system open to credible investigation: no cover-ups and no public relations firms putting the big spin on events. We need to examine any allegation openly. In short, we need to have a judicial inquiry into these events in our immigration reception processing centres.
In the short time that I have, I say to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs as a mother to a father, to a grandfather: I would not like to see what happened to that 12-year-old boy happen to any child of mine of yours; you would not like to see that happen either. So, please, on behalf of this government, allow a full judicial inquiry.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2000-11-30,"—Before I address some of the shameful allegations by the shadow minister for immigration, Mr Sciacca, I should like to refer to the speech by the member for Fowler, who—did I hear it right?—just condemned the facilities that she said she had visited. Yet I have in front of me a report signed off by the member for Fowler, which says:
The Committee—
of which, I believe, she was a member—
believes that Australia's detention administration is appropriate and professional. It is currently handling the demands of unprecedented numbers of arrivals as well.
Is there a minority report from the member for Fowler disagreeing with this? Is there one dissenting voice from the member for Fowler? No, there is not. What about page 84, paragraph 12.10. It says:
Overall, the Committee believed that the facilities provided were adequate, and that the cultural sensitivities of detainees were being accommodated. The Committee was convinced that Australia was taking seriously its responsibilities for those in its care, whether or not they were expected to gain visas for Australia.
Paragraph 12.11 says:
The Committee was aware that some facilities and services made available to detainees represented a desire—
I notice the member does not want to hear the words she signed off on. She has left the chamber, ashamed that she should now, in the light of political expediency, deny her own words in this report, a report she signed off on, which said everything at the detention centres is fine. But now she is backing up this shadow minister at the table, the shadow minister who shamelessly has brought forward totally and utterly unsubstantiated allegations. He has brought this country into disrepute on the basis of nothing that has been proved. If you went into the community right now, you would hear beliefs in the community based solely on what this shameless shadow minister has done for purely political reasons. Let us look at the speech that he made in this House—this hypocritical, incredibly dangerous shadow minister. What were the charges he made? He said:
The minister and his government, however, are guilty of fostering a culture of mistreatment of detainees ...
He also said:
Asylum seekers in detention are being treated worse than the most dangerous criminals in our jails.
This is what he is saying to the people in this community. But worse than that, this shadow minister made specific allegations in this parliament against the detention centres. He made an allegation about a 15-year-old boy. He raised that question again today: an allegation that a 15-year-old boy had been sexually mistreated and raped. And yet that has already been investigated by the South Australia Police and by South Australian Family and Youth Services, and they said there was no reason for action.
He has raised a case that has been investigated and thrown out. What else has he raised? He has raised the story of the 12-year-old boy. That has already been investigated but, as the minister said, it has been returned to the South Australia Police to be reinvestigated, having already been investigated by FAYS and SAPOL. Then there was the allegation that a brothel had been run. That was an allegation by the shadow minister with absolutely no evidence, and no proof has come up. Let us now take the shadow minister's own words:
No baby food at Woomera until July this year, if young infants were not breast feeding, they were given cabbage and rice. Many would not eat because it was so horrible.
Let us look at what is actually happening. 
Babies are either breast fed or bottle fed. When infants commence on solids, they are provided with typical baby food, as they are in the Australian community, such as rice cereal, stewed fruits and custards. 
I am also informed by the department, whom I rang and got the information from—the same way the shadow minister could have done if he wanted real information and not just to come in here and raise these false allegations—that Woomera has carried canned baby food and infant formula since it was established and, of the 12 nurses on staff, four or five have special child nursing qualifications. What other allegations did this shameful man make, this shameful shadow minister? 
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I find the word `shameful' offensive, and she has repeated it two or three times. I know that she does not know what she is talking about, but at least she could play the issue and not the man.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! To progress this discussion, I ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to withdraw that remark.
—There was no remark against the shadow minister—I refer to shameful allegations, and they are shameful. To progress this debate, to use your words, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw the remarks. The second allegation was that some young children were admitted:
... into Roxby Downs Hospital because of gross malnourishment. They were officially admitted for `anaemia' ... 
He says they were officially admitted for anaemia. The truth is that no such admittances ever happened. This is a shameful, base allegation by this shadow minister. He talks about what has happened here as if somehow this government has changed a process that was set in train by the Labor government. The member for Fowler referred to the setting up of Port Hedland and Curtin as being `so far away from everywhere'. Who set them up, Minister? Wasn't it the Labor Party?
—Yes, definitely.
—The Labor Party set up Port Hedland and Curtin. So much for the member for Fowler. Let us have a look at some of the newspaper articles. Let us have a look at March 1992 when an article read:
... 180 Cambodian refugees at a holding camp at Port Hedland in north-west Australia have begun a protest rally and hunger strike ...
An article a couple of days later read:
The Chinese, detained at Port Hedland, have been conducting what immigration officials say is a rostered hunger strike.
The hunger strike follows a similar campaign by about 240 mainly Cambodian detainees ...
 I will read this article from 2 February. The shadow minister should listen to this because this happened under his government. The article says:
The four boat people looked pale and downcast as they talked of their shattered dreams ... “Under Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, I lived for three years, eight months and 20 days ... Here I have lived for almost three years. In both places it's the same.”
The article goes on:
Villawood detention compound is a hot, barren place. Among the 100 Cambodians inside, there have been several suicide attempts in the last two and a half years. 
Further on it says that a welfare officer who worked at Villawood:
... was sacked two months ago after sending officials in the Immigration Department a paper criticising the policy of keeping boat people locked away for years waiting for their cases to be resolved. 
He claimed:
... it's a slow ... mental torture. In the case of many Cambodians, the Immigration Department has achieved where Pol Pot failed: to break their resolve. 
On 24 June a group of boat people complained to the United Nations over the policy. On 16 August 1993 the federal government admitted in the High Court that it had unlawfully detained a Cambodian teenager seeking refugee status, and the immigration department conceded that the 14-year-old Cambodian boy was held unlawfully for more than two years. So much for this member's hypocrisy. Let us face it: this is a distraction from what is happening in his own seat in Queensland and what he knows about those things that are rorting in the seat which he should be answering for. (Time expired)
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I definitely find the remark of the honourable member for Hindmarsh to be absolutely offensive. She has just accused me of rorting my seat. I find that very offensive and I want it to be withdrawn.
—She accused you of organising the allegations to take away—
—Whatever it was, I find it very offensive, and I ask for it to be withdrawn.
—Order! Can we settle this. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh has in fact accused the honourable member for Bowman of, in some way, rorting something to do with his seat, I am forced to ask her to withdraw. I apologise because I was distracted and did not hear exactly what was said. The way the honourable member for Bowman presented it has made my job even harder. If the honourable member for Hindmarsh did make some form of accusation that would require a motion of the House, would she please withdraw it? 
—I could ask what it is that I said but, in respect for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not want to say anything in this House that was unparliamentary, and I certainly would not want to be one to make allegations that cannot be substantiated in this area. I have answered. In respect for the Deputy Speaker, I withdraw anything that would bring disrepute to this place.
Motion (by Mr Ronaldson) proposed:
That the business of the day be called on.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. This motion from the Chief Government Whip is the second time in which there has been an attempt to prevent an Independent member from contributing to an MPI.
—The honourable member for Calwell will resume his seat. There is no point of order.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2000-11-30,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th, 12th and 13th reports for 2000 of the committee relating to the construction of mixed residential dwellings at block 87, section 24, Stirling, ACT; the ABC Perth Accommodation Project, East Perth, WA; and the Reserve Bank of Australia proposed head office building works.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—by leave—The first report is in relation to the Defence Housing Authority, Stirling, ACT, and it is on the construction of mixed residential dwellings at block 87, section 24, Stirling, ACT. The committee has recommended that the proposed development proceed. The proposed development, estimated to cost $11.5 million, will comprise 50 detached and semidetached dwellings. The project is needed to partially meet overall Defence needs for additional Defence Housing Authority dwellings in Canberra and to meet the imminent expansion of the Australian Defence College. Defence intends to co-locate its three single service command and staff colleges at the Australian Defence College.
While the committee supports the proposed development, the inquiry raised a number of process related issues that need to be addressed. The inquiry highlighted a number of deficiencies in the liaison process between the Department of Defence and the Defence Housing Authority, particularly in relation to the Australian Defence College. The committee has recommended that, at the earliest opportunity, the Department of Defence make DHA a party to all discussions which may impact on Australian Defence Force personnel housing requirements. The committee received evidence challenging the sincerity and adequacy of the consultation process engaged in by the Defence Housing Authority. The committee is strongly of the view that it is essential for all Commonwealth agencies sponsoring public works to consult with the wider community. Such involvement gives legitimacy to a proposed public work. In relation to the Stirling project, I simply note that it would have been better if DHA's community consultation process had been more transparent.
The second report is in relation to Carey Street, Darwin. Members may recall that the committee in its 10th report did not approve the development by the Defence Housing Authority of 90 apartments in Darwin. The committee recommended that the Defence Housing Authority report to the committee when it had complied with all the recommendations contained in its report. The committee has received a response from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence on its recommendations and advice as to Defence Housing Authority planned actions. The committee has resolved that DHA proceed with the issue and evaluation of tenders and obtain an updated market appraisal; the committee accept DHA's response in respect of recommendation 6; and that the construction of the proposed work not proceed until the committee's recommendations—with the exception of recommendation 6—have been met. I will report again to members in relation to this matter. The committee welcomes DHA's responses to its recommendations and trusts that, in relation to future projects, the inquiry will serve to assist DHA to achieve improved levels of transparency and accountability. 
The third report is in relation to ABC, Perth. This report that I have tabled relates to the development of new accommodation for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Perth. The proposed development is estimated to cost $25.7 million. It will replace the ABC's existing facilities, which it has occupied for more than 40 years. The proposed facilities will comprise a two-level office and technical zone, with undercover parking; an acoustic zone; an area for technical workshops and stores; a communication tower; and parking for radio and television outside-broadcast vehicles. The committee found existing facilities to be poorly configured, inflexible and outmoded. In many instances, substandard buildings resulted in dysfunctional, inflexible and potentially dangerous facilities. The committee is of the view that the new facilities will allow for improved operational efficiencies and will enhance the ABC's capabilities. The committee has concluded that the project should proceed. Moreover, we see that the construction of the proposed facilities represents value for money. The facilities offer the potential to provide long-term benefits to the ABC and its current and potential clients.
The ABC's existing facilities accommodate not only the ABC but also the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra, more commonly referred to as WASO. Unfortunately, the site for the new development does not include accommodation for WASO. The future location of the orchestra proved to be the most contentious issue of this inquiry. While the committee was of the view that it would be physically possible for the ABC to include accommodation for WASO in the proposed development, it found that this would significantly impact on the way the site functioned as an ABC facility; also, that the ABC would suffer a significant financial penalty for WASO to be considered in the final preferred development option.
The committee examined this matter in some detail. We found that there had been ad hoc consultation by the ABC prior to formally advising WASO that it intended to sell the current premises and relocate. We also found a lack of credibility in the rationale for the level of assistance that the ABC had factored into project cost estimates and financial analysis to assist with the fit-out of alternative WASO accommodation. The committee welcomed advice from the Western Australian government that there is a compelling argument for a tripartite arrangement whereby the University of Western Australia, the federal government and the Western Australian government contribute to the relocation of WASO.
The committee is of the view that the treatment of the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra represents a precedent in relation to the level of funding for the relocation of ABC orchestras generally. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra receive from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation relocation funding commensurate with that received by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and that federal, state and relevant local governments consider funding options for the permanent housing of the Western Australian Symphony Orchestra in the proposed Music Access Centre, in an arrangement with the University of Western Australia, on land to be provided by the University of Western Australia. (Extension of time granted)
The third report I have tabled relates to a proposed work at the head office building of the Reserve Bank of Australia at 65 Martin Place in Sydney. The Reserve Bank wishes to reconfigure its head office building and free up 7,000 square metres of underutilised floor space for commercial lease. This equates to six floors of standard commercial office space. The project is the result of a steady decline in staff located at the head office since the early 1980s, which is due to the use of improved technology and organisational changes. The cost of the project is estimated at $21.5 million. Revenue generated from tenants will be approximately $3.5 million a year. Resulting profits will return to consolidated revenue. 
The committee welcomes the commitment of the Reserve Bank to this entrepreneurial project. The committee looks forward to examining other building proposals that display similar initiative. The Public Works Committee has consistently paid attention to heritage and environmental issues. They must continue to be given priority of concern in any works proposal submitted to the committee—they can never be an afterthought. Features of cultural and historical significance attached to major public buildings should be, as far as practicable, preserved and bequeathed to future generations. 
The Reserve Bank's building forms a part of the Martin Place `heritage precinct' that is included on the Register of the National Estate. The committee also understands that the building is described on the Central Sydney Heritage Local Environmental Plan as being `of historical importance for its ability to exemplify a postwar cultural shift within the banking industry'. Some of the features of interest raised by the National Trust of Australia and the City of Sydney are a squash court, the bank's staff cafeteria and a shooting range. While sympathetic to the preservation of heritage items, the committee was not convinced how features such as the bank's squash court warranted preservation. However, the committee has recommended that, before work proceeds, the Reserve Bank photograph and carefully document all relevant features. I commend these reports to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,18,1

"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—I rise to finish my comments on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000, and I must thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the commercial during question time when he was, above all, quite happy to quote me and indicate how hard I have fought for road funding. I do know how important it is but, again, I keep coming back to this question: is this the best result that Australia could have had? The answer is a resounding no. I was earlier pointing out how this government has overseen the highest fuel taxes ever in Australia. At the same time that it has been prepared to collect that funding, it has slashed road funding, particularly for regional and local roads.
I am quite happy to turn to black spot funding, because it is something that is often thrown up by this government. They always come back to black spot funding. It was our program and, sure, we took it away. Bob Collins was the minister back in 1994, I believe, when we took it away. Why did we take it away? I guess the government should go and have a yarn to people like Jeff Kennett, the Hon. John Fahey, who was then Premier of New South Wales, or maybe Mr Borbidge, who was Premier of Queensland. They know that when they received road funding from the federal government they would spend it on anything but roads and then they would come to the federal government and say, `Give us some black spot funding.' We did that, and they were simply relying on the black spot funding. So along came the Howard government in 1996 and they reinstated black spot funding, but did they reinstate any other form of funding? The answer is definitely no. 
I also remember quite vividly and passionately Laurie Brereton and Michael Knight visiting Raymond Terrace. It was a historic agreement in November 1995 when the federal government and the state government of New South Wales agreed to reconstruct the Pacific Highway. That is something that is also thrown up in this parliament by the Deputy Prime Minister, but what he does not tell us is that, at the time that Laurie Brereton offered that money and offered to participate in that program five years ago, the federal government was putting in $750 million. What is it putting in today? $600 million. This is a government that has pulled $150 million out of the Pacific Highway funding and many parts of it have stalled. Mind you, it does not stop the Deputy Prime Minister from announcing the money. I think he has announced the Chinderah to Yelgun bypass about 16 times. 
I can also recall the then minister for transport, the Hon. Mark Vaile, going to a public meeting in Karuah in early 1998. At that public meeting there was some debate about whether or not the town of Karuah should be bypassed. The then minister for transport said, `I know there are a few people here who are friendly to my side of politics and who don't want the town to be bypassed, so I'm pulling the funding out.' It is ironic that this week four lanes of continuous divided highway from Sydney to Karuah will be completed. They have not even started work on the Karuah bypass yet. It will be another four years before that work is done.
I use these as examples to show the sorts of games that this government has played with transport, the sorts of games that this government has played with roads. It is all very well for the Deputy Prime Minister to come in here and beat his breast now about school kids and buses on country roads being unsafe. Where has he been for the last five years? Is he going to tell us that this is something new? Is he going to tell us this is something that has just happened? I can assure him, as a representative of one of those electorates in which my kids went to school and travelled over those sorts of roads, that they have been around for years, they have been around for generations, because we never built the proper roads in the first place. It is nothing new. So do not come in here now and preach to those people who have had to live and put up with it.
I indicated that this legislation should be about roads, about the vital infrastructure that this country needs. It is not. It is about a government that is trying to convince the people of rural and regional Australia that it cares about them. It wants those people to forget the last five years of neglect. It wants those people to ignore the fact that they are paying the highest prices for fuel that they have ever paid. It wants the people of Australia to forget that they are paying the highest fuel taxes they have ever paid. This is the only response that the government is prepared to give them. $1.2 billion sounds a fantastic sum. It is a big sum of money. Where does it come from? Over the same period, how much will the government take out of the pockets of the fuel consumers? It will take over $2 billion. In other words, at the end of the four-year period, when this road building program is under way or completed—it should be completed by then—the government will still be in credit with fuel taxes it has taken from the Australian people, and we will still not have the road network that we really need as a modern country going into the next millennium.
This government has failed Australia with its carte blanche acceptance of high fuel prices without its ability to think what we can do. I will give you an example. I have attended a few hearings of the caucus committee that is going around Australia talking to people who are adversely affected by high fuel prices. One group particularly that have a grudge—and I believe they justly have a grudge—spent a couple of thousand dollars converting their petrol consuming car to LP gas or went out and paid an extra $800 to get one of these new Falcons that only uses LP gas. When they first came out LP gas was worth about 40c a litre around my area; people are now paying 59.9c or more. I had one couple convince me that they are now running their gas-altered car on petrol because they think it is probably cheaper. They wonder why they spent the $2,000.  
But where this government has missed the point is that Australia essentially is self-sufficient in LP gas. Australia has developed technology—and there is a whole industry out there of mechanics that fit LP gas converters to cars. LP gas actually gives our nation an advantage as far as fuel is concerned. But the shame of the Howard-Costello-Anderson government is that it is the government that put a tax on it. Up until 1 July this year, there was no tax on LP gas. I would have thought that the government might have come in here and said, `We are going to do the right thing. We are going to let the world know that we are pretty resourceful and pretty cunning and we are going to take the tax off it.' I tell you what: I would support it. I would support it and I would love that to be included in the amendment. I might have to go and have a word with the member for Batman about that.
What about our trucking industry? We hear lots about the trucking industry. Again, the Deputy Prime Minister stands up and tells us how things are going so swimmingly for truck owners and drivers and operators. He must be talking to a different group from the group I talk to. I have plenty of them in my electorate. They know that, despite the 24c a litre rebate they are getting, they are still paying more for their diesel today than they were paying on 30 June, before the GST came in. This was traditionally an industry made up of small business people. To the government that claims to be the representative of small business people: what are you doing to the trucking industry? Within another couple of years the trucking industry will be made up of three or four major operators and that is all. The owner-driver operators, the small organisations—the husband and wife organisations—will be gone. Where will your competition policy be then? It will not exist. What does this legislation do about it? Absolutely nothing. 
Why isn't there a code of conduct included in this legislation for our trucking industry? They have been negotiating long enough, and this government simply turns a deaf ear to it and ignores the need. That is why this piece of legislation really is a con job. It is all about trying to convince the people of Australia out there: `We care about roads; come and vote for us.' I will give you another example to show that. In a question on Monday from me to the Prime Minister I mentioned the adverse effects of fuel prices on Meals on Wheels, and I am sure every member of this House would agree that that is a vital service to ageing members of many of our communities. The Prime Minister answered and spoke about local councils. He said:
... but the fact that they have extra money to spend on roads means that there will be less pressure on other areas of the budget, including the provision of many charitable and welfare services. As a result, it is a good deal all round. 
When we have a look at the conditions that apply to this money being given out to local governments, what do we find? Clause 7 states, under `funding conditions', that they must use the grants for expenditure on roads, that they must account for their expenditure properly—that is fair enough—and that they must maintain their existing road expenditures. The whole point is: what the Prime Minister told me on Monday is completely false. It will not bring any relief anywhere for the councils at all because they have to maintain their funding for roads as if they were not getting this money. So there will be no relief. There will be no added services like the Prime Minister said. Let us have a look at some of the other things because this is what this legislation really is all about. This legislation says: 
It is expected that these conditions will cover the following administrative aspects of the program:
Proposal
A local government body is to provide the Minister with a proposal for the expenditure of the grant.  
In other words, big brother is watching. Centralised government will be telling the local government authorities, `Yes, that is acceptable. No, it is not,' because you have to submit it to the minister to get it approved. I would have thought in this day and age government was all about allowing local communities to determine their priorities. Not with this piece of legislation it is not. But how about this one, because this is the one I like—I hope they are going to put a picture of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business maybe walking his dog on it: 
The conditions will ensure that the Commonwealth receives appropriate recognition for its contribution to the roads concerned.  The conditions will require that the local government body must erect signs acknowledging the Commonwealth funding along the road works being funded from the grants.
I hope it is not on the side of the road. I hope it is not a danger to travellers. But I guess it will have to be a minimum size and I guess it will have to have the coat of arms and all the rest of it on it. Obviously, it is about parading that this federal government gave some money to roads. Are they going to have to put it on every pothole? It will cost you more money for signs than it will for tar patching. What a ridiculous statement! But that says it all and that is what this government is about. It is not about building a decent road network. It is about being out there and getting the accolades for putting more taxpayers' money in the government's pocket and giving them less back and building a road system that, at the end of four years, despite $1.2 billion, will still be inadequate. That is the charade that the government expects us to accept.
As I said when I started, I always welcome funding for roads because I know we do not get enough. If this government thinks it has gone far enough with this legislation, it really does not understand the needs of rural and regional Australia.

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2000-11-30,"—I welcome the opportunity to talk on the Roads to Recovery Bill 2000 and I welcome it for a number of reasons. I have been a member of parliament at state and federal level now for 13 years. I drive approximately 100,000 kilometres plus per year over the roads for the electorates that I have represented and currently represent. Because of that movement over those roads, I have seen the state of our roads for that period of time and know what is required to get those roads up to standard. It was interesting to hear the comments of the member for Paterson who at no stage during his contribution to this House made any reference to not wanting the money that he was given by the government, nor indeed did he make any reference to the need for New South Wales, as an example, to make a similar contribution to road funding as the Commonwealth has done.
The issue of the state of the roads was well recognised when I was a member of the Greiner government that was elected in 1988. At that time the Greiner government introduced a 3 x 3 tax at the bowser for road funding, 60 per cent of which went into rural roads in New South Wales and was graciously and gratefully received by the local shires and the local councils. The road infrastructure that they had in their shires at that time was as it is today, breaking down at an astronomical rate because the roads had been laid down for 50 or 60 years, five or six decades. They needed an enormous injection of funds to bring them up to scratch and make them safe for motorists. It is interesting to note that since the Carr Labor government came in, they have reversed that formula. They increased the state petrol tax to 4c a litre for four years and reversed it to the extent where the 60 per cent portion of it went to the metropolitan area at the expense of rural roads. It was not long before there were visible signs of the progress that had been made in catching up on the repair to those roads had started to fall back again. 
About a fortnight ago, I released a press release with regard to the announcement of the $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery program. I cautioned the government to ensure that that road funding was distributed fairly, equitably and based on a needs priority. I said in that press release, as a rural based member who regularly travels on roads within the electorate of Hume, that I am well aware of the atrocious state of local roads, which have rapidly deteriorated following unusual, constant wet weather. I also said, more importantly, that these conditions have accelerated the breakdown of road infrastructure to the point where roads are becoming extremely dangerous and beyond the capacity of local government resources to maintain, let alone reconstruct. In relation to the distribution of this special road package, which is in addition to the annual local roads grants, the shires association and the shires right throughout Australia are very grateful for the contribution that has been made.
In the electorate of Hume over the four-year period that this package covers, there will be $21.65 million allocated to 14 shires. That is an average of about $1.43 million in annual grants over those 14 shires or an annual grant to each shire of $388,000. That is a significant contribution, and it has been acknowledged in some memos that I have received from shires and, indeed, from the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales, for example through their G division. I received this facsimile yesterday from the chairman of the G division of the shires association, who I know required about $50 million or $60 million to repair and reconstruct roads within the G division of the shires association. The chairman, Mayor Paul Braybrooks of Cootamundra Shire, said:
Dear Mr Schultz,
Re: Funding for local roads
Please accept G division's appreciation for your efforts in representing the needs of rural areas for local road funding and for the recently announced Roads to Recovery Program. Enclosed herewith please find a copy of a letter to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson MP, expressing the division's appreciation and requesting a meeting to directly convey such to him.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Braybrooks
It is well known in this place and outside this place that I sometimes do not make too many favourable comments with regard to my coalition partners on some issues, but I have to say that the way in which this road funding has been handled is exemplary, exemplary inasmuch as it has met the concerns that I raised with regard to fairly and equitably distributing the funding. I will quote from the letter that I received, as everybody did, from the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. John Anderson, on 27 November, when the funding formula was released and the amount of funding for each individual shire was released. In the second sentence of the third paragraph, he said:
We are now in a stronger budgetary position that allows the Government to return a dividend to the whole community through this substantial investment in local road infrastructure.
The Federal Government has chosen to invest in the local road network because we understand its importance to the Australian economy and to the social amenity of all Australians. The Roads to Recovery Programme will provide a substantial investment boost to local roads, allowing widespread upgrading and maintenance work to be undertaken and providing additional employment opportunities in local communities.
What he said in that letter to me was absolutely right. Of course, he did not say that just by chance, because he has had an opportunity over the past 12 months to read the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services headed Time running out: shaping regional Australia's future. And wouldn't you know it? Paragraph 75 on page 146 of that document said:
`Roads are the lifeline for rural and remote Australia'. This statement in Austroad's 1997 report encapsulates the importance of roads to regional Australia. In brief, roads play a very significant role in the social and economic life of the nation. They are a vital element in the transport chain on which Australia's international competitiveness depends. With the loss of many services from small towns and the need to travel to regional centres for shopping and services, there is also now a greater dependence on road infrastructure than before. 
That report goes on in relation to responsibility for roads and talks about all three levels of government sharing the responsibility. That in itself is a true indication of what actually happens, and it is one of the reasons why I am amazed that the member for Paterson did not call upon the New South Wales state government to match the funding that the federal government have given in addition to the funding that they allegedly still supply to local government. The sad reality of it is that, at the last budget, the New South Wales government removed $111 million from road funding in rural New South Wales. That gives you an indication of the commitment that they have, despite all the rhetoric that comes from them and despite the rhetoric that comes from Country Labor about its commitment to rural New South Wales. It also proves that they have absolutely no knowledge of how vital the restructuring of our road system is to the people out there who need to get their produce to market and to country people who drive considerable distances to get to work safely.
I would also like to make the point that it is, in my view, very important for me to talk in this chamber about the need for rural road funding in shires right across Australia but, more specifically, about the need for additional funds in the Hume electorate, which I represent—an electorate which some of my parliamentary colleagues covet prematurely before the redistributed boundaries take effect. But, in the Hume electorate alone, there is a need for approximately $70 million just to get all of the roads in those 14 shires in a rural electorate up to a standard that you, I and everybody else would expect to be safe for the community, whether it is for businesspeople or ordinary people on the street from those communities and from those many small villages, towns and cities in rural Australia who need to carry on driving over those roads to get to their places of work and to deliver their produce.
I welcome the announcement by both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister on this very worthwhile and gratefully accepted road package. I thank them for listening to the concerns that I have raised on behalf of my constituency and, indeed, on behalf of the constituencies of all of the members across Australia, regardless of their political persuasion, for the fair, equitable distribution on the basis of needs for each of those groups of shires that needed some additional funding. In closing, I look forward with anticipation to a decent contribution to the repair of the road infrastructure in New South Wales by the New South Wales Labor government and I hope and sincerely request that they will make a contribution to match the federal coalition government's contribution to roads as quickly as possible in the interests of road safety for everybody in New South Wales.",REPS,<title>ROADS TO RECOVERY BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate for one reason in particular, and that is to point out to the government, to the Deputy Prime Minister in particular, the contradictions and the inequity within the way in which this funding package has been put together and distributed. 
I was impressed this afternoon when I heard the Deputy Prime Minister during question time regale us with the social benefits that accrue to the community as a result of better roads. He made a number of points. Included among them was the importance of road infrastructure to improving educational outcomes for people who live in rural communities. He also made the point about the importance of road infrastructure for improving health outcomes for people who live in rural communities. Frankly, I agree with him. But the plain fact is that in the context of the Northern Territory this money will go next to nowhere towards improving or providing social benefits to people who live in the Northern Territory. I say that knowing full well that the $20 million which the Northern Territory is to receive is going to be welcomed by those 70-odd community councils and local government councils that will receive funding. The fact of the matter is that the average distribution of these funds to rural communities outside of Darwin and Alice Springs will be around $10,000 per community over four years. The sum of $2,500 per year is the average amount that local government authorities will get in the Northern Territory. 
You have to ask yourself: does that sound fair or reasonable? I have before me a list of those 17 or 18 electorates that received the bulk of the funding. It comes as no surprise that the electorate to receive the most funding was of course that of the member for O'Connor. The member for Gwydir, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, was the second or third highest beneficiary of this money. I make this observation: we have heard a lot today about the way in which this money has been distributed. We have not seen the formula that has been used. We have heard about population, we have heard about road length and we have heard about historical circumstances. Let me ask you this question: what strikes you as peculiar? In the case of the electorate of Gwydir, its area is 114,000 square kilometres. It has 72,930 voters on the roll and at the 1996 census had a population of 111,146 people. That electorate received $42,386,389. I did two simple calculations. I divided the population into that amount and got the following amount: $381 per head, $581 per voter and $372 per kilometre. 
What I did then was use those figures and apply them to the Northern Territory. What we discover when we apply those figures to the Northern Territory—using the population ratio, the population figures of the Northern Territory, bearing in mind that the population of the Northern Territory is 190,000 and there are 105,000 voters—is that, if you use the population criterion alone, the Northern Territory could expect to receive something in the vicinity of $72,457,000. We got $20 million. If you use the voting population we could have expected to have received $61,053,000. If we use the area figures on their own, the Northern Territory could have expected to have received $409 million. The fact is we got 20. The fact is that the most isolated people in Australia, those people who need road access most, live in my electorate. 
They are the people who have been disowned by this government. The people the government have made it very clear they have no concern for are the people who live in my electorate. I am not alone in saying this. I have in front of me an extract from the Northern Territory News, dated 29 November. The headline is `$20 million for NT roads is just nonsense'. You would expect me to be saying that, and I have done it. But you would not expect the Northern Territory Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Development, Mick Palmer, to be saying it, but he has. He said—and I quote here from this extract:
It is extremely disappointing; it is just nonsense.
It is nonsense for a number of reasons. Unlike the member for Gwydir, the National Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister, who sits in the cabinet room and, with his colleagues, orchestrates where this dough goes, unlike the member for O'Connor, also a minister who sits in on the deliberations of where these moneys go, we are in a situation where the formula concocted by the government has created a very unequitable distribution of these resources. It means $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money flushed down the drain, effectively, in terms of my electorate because it will do nothing—nothing—to materially advance the state of the road infrastructure in the Northern Territory.
Let us make it very clear: not only does this package not do that but also it does nothing to alleviate the problem of high fuel prices—and high fuel prices are something I have experience of. I want to use the example of a couple of communities. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may or may not know where the community of Numbulwar is. You may or may not know where the community of Ngukurr is. They are both in the Northern Territory. I am sure the Deputy Prime Minister has no damn idea where either of those communities is. But those communities, between them, have roughly 3,000 people and there is a road length of some 156 kilometres. They join the Roper Highway, and the Roper Highway goes to Katherine. These two communities are in south-east Arnhem Land. For around six months of each year, they are inaccessible by road. Why are they inaccessible by road? Because, of course, in the wet season the rivers flood. What do these communities need to ensure that they get all-year-round access? They need a bridge: a bridge across either the Wilton River or the Roper River, or both. Also, they need roadworks done to give them an all-weather seal on the road. 
The cost of just bringing the road up to a reasonable standard is $3 million. Understand this, Mr Deputy Speaker: the community of Numbulwar will received $282,000 over four years out of this program; the Yugul Mangi Community Council will receive around $307,000. These two communities also have local roads they have to look after. The connecting roads between these two communities are not their responsibility; they are the responsibility of either the Northern Territory government or the federal government. But nothing in terms of the contribution being made out of this road money will assist in the development of an all-weather road for these two communities. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what this means. The people at Numbulwar pay $1.83 per litre for diesel. I understand that it has been estimated that, if they had an all-weather road to Numbulwar, their freight costs would come down by something like 70 per cent. The reason for this, of course, is that during the wet season, for most of six months of the year, they have to barge from Darwin.
I hear the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, come in here and proselytise about the importance of rural communities. I accept that they are extremely important. My heart goes out to all those farmers in northern New South Wales who have been ravaged by floods. But understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, the communities in my electorate are not made up of farmers; predominantly, they are Aboriginal communities. They have the lowest incomes of all Australians, they have the lowest level of infrastructure support of all Australians, yet they pay the highest costs in Australia for fuel and transport—and their roads are miserable.
But what do we get from this government? We get a maldistribution of these resources to the extent that $42 million goes to the electorate of Gwydir. I will go back and use the figures for the electorate of the member for O'Connor. If we use the population ratio of the Northern Territory for the seat of Gwydir, the seat of Gwydir would receive $13.8 million, not $42 million. I would think, in terms of my own communities, that is a far better distribution of the resources. Give us the $42 million in the Northern Territory and, Mr Anderson, you take $14 million—because, on any measure of disadvantage, on any measure of inequity, the people who are most disadvantaged in this whole process are the people who live in rural communities in the Northern Territory. Yet not one jot of notice is taken of that issue by this government.
If this government wants to illustrate that it is actually working for all Australians, the Deputy Prime Minister would go back to the formula which he has created in his little mind back in his office here in Parliament House and come up with something which is fair and reasonable. He would come up with something which says of that $1.2 billion, `We accept that the electorates of Kalgoorlie and the Northern Territory, just by their nature, must get the lion's share of these resources which are being made available.' But we do not find that at all. While the electorate of Kalgoorlie is high up on the list, as it should be, where does the Northern Territory rate in the hit parade of those communities, those electorates, which will receive money from this government for this purpose, for these roads? It is almost off the screen. The persons responsible for making these decisions are, of course, the Deputy Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues.
So when I hear the Deputy Prime Minister talk about the social benefits that can be garnered from improving roads in rural and remote areas, I say to him: yes, I agree. Of course I agree that if you can get kids to school across roads it is very important. But did you know that in the community of Umbukumba on Groote Eylandt there are no teachers resident? They live something like 70 kilometres away from Alyangula and Angurugu—two other communities—on a dirt road. It is not an all-weather dirt road. This program will not provide them with sufficient resources to fix their roads. As a result, there are often times when neither teachers nor nurses can visit that community. So the kids go without education on those days and the community goes without the benefit of the medical service provided by the registered nurses. Is that fair or reasonable? If the Deputy Prime Minister were concerned about improving the social benefits that accrue to people who live in rural areas, he would have allocated this money on a needs basis, not on some airy-fairy formula made up in his office based on historical circumstances. I think the historical circumstance he was talking about was who won the last bloody election. Given they won the last election, he said, `We will make a determination of what the priorities will be on the sort of formula we will create for ourselves.' The Leader of the Opposition has been 100 per cent on the money about the use of these funds ever since it became clear where they were going to go. 
Because this money has been distributed in this particular way, there is no recognition of the strategic importance of developing infrastructure in regional Australia. We have $400 million from the National Highway Program yet to be distributed. This afternoon I had occasion to talk to a constituent of mine who is the Director of the Australian Trucking Association. I asked him what he thought of this program. He said that they were extremely disappointed. He said that it was a slap in the face for Territorians. He is 100 per cent correct. It is a slap in the face for Territorians. The Northern Territory government is not a friend of mine but is supposedly an ally of the coalition. It has Senator Tambling, who sits in the Senate with the National Party and is a parliamentary secretary. What influence does he have on this government? Clearly none. We have seen that they have made decisions which, as Mr Cooper has said, are a slap in the face for the community of the Northern Territory. Whilst I would like to see some of that $400 million go to upgrading the highway between Katherine and Darwin, Highway 1, I would also like some of that money to go to Highway 1 from Borroloola to Burketown. I bet it will not.
—Of course it won't. It is not a local road.
—The $400 million which is coming from the National Highway Program, which I am talking about, which is yet to be announced—I bet we do not get one cent of that. Even if we do, it will not go to addressing the huge need that is clearly obvious in the Northern Territory.
It is important that I say all of these things because in 1996, when the Howard government were first elected, they canned the regional road program in the Northern Territory, a regional road program which was based on strategic roads around Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. They canned that program: $15 million over three years—gone. As it happens, the roads which it was earmarked for—the Daly River and Port Keats road covering 128 kilometres at $2 million, serving a population of about 3½ thousand people; the Arnhem Link Road covering 393 kilometres at $5.3 million, serving a population of 3½ thousand people or thereabouts; the Ngukurr-Numbulwar road, which I have spoken of previously; the Angurugu-Umbakumba road, which I have spoken of previously; the Papunya and Kintore Road, which I have spoken of previously—are strategic roads identified by a collection of people, including the Northern Territory government. Aboriginal people through the land council in the Northern Territory require that funding, funding which was identified by the previous Labor government and made available for this purpose, funding which was knocked on the head by the Howard government as soon as they came into office. You cannot believe how aggrieved I am that this money which has been made available across Australia has not been done on a strategic basis, has not been done on a needs basis, to develop the infrastructure that is required in the Northern Territory in terms of roads.
This is failing the needs of my communities. This is failing the needs of the Northern Territory. This is failing the needs of Australia. This is not done on a strategic basis or on a needs basis; this is done on the whim of the government. You only have to see the distribution of funds to understand that that is a fact. The people who are being most disadvantaged in Australia in terms of access to infrastructure, access to resources, access to good education, access to good health—those things which have been identified as the sorts of social outcomes which the Deputy Prime Minister is trying to achieve—are Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of the Northern Territory. Whilst they will receive some moneys—70 communities will receive smaller amounts of money for their local roads—nothing is being done to make a reasonable fist of doing a strategic analysis of what money should go into roads in the Northern Territory and that money being provided.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—It gives me great pleasure to use this short time available during the adjournment debate to read to you a letter from a year 8 student from Jabiru Area School in the Northern Territory. This letter has been written by Miranda Tapsell, a 13-year-old girl who attends the Jabiru school. Recently the year 8 students from Jabiru Area School completed a unit of work on argument and persuasion. At the end of the unit, the students had to write a letter to the editor on a topic that interested them or about which they felt strongly. The subject matter was entirely up to them. This student wrote a letter about apologising and the failure of the Prime Minister to say sorry. The views which she expressed in this letter I am sure go to the heart of many arguments which have been had in this place about the necessity for the Prime Minister to apologise on behalf of the government and people of Australia. I would like to read this letter from Miranda Tapsell, entitled `Sorry'. The letter states:
Dear Editor
I am ashamed of the way our Prime Minister, John Howard consistently refuses to say sorry to the Stolen Generation.
These people have literally been taken away from their family because the government of the day believed that the Aboriginal children of mixed races would have a better education by being removed from parents and relatives. Because of that, hundreds of Indigenous Australians have lost their culture and language. They do not know where they come from and most importantly, many of them do not know who their family is.
Of course John Howard himself may not feel that he should say sorry because he personally did not do anything. But he is the Prime Minister, the head of the government and he should have the compassion to apologize for the actions of previous governments that have caused this terrible trauma for these innocent victims. Stop and think how you would feel not ever having known your parents because you were taken away from them.
How would you feel having been told that your parents died a month ago when you had finally found out where they lived? Mr Howard, if you were not the Prime Minister and you were part of the Stolen Generation, you would be in there pouring your heart out on the subject.
Some citizens of Australia may ask, “What will saying sorry change?”
Saying sorry always helps. This apology is like any other one.
On behalf on the Stolen Generation, I beg you to say one simple word that will heal the rift between black and white. Come on, John Howard, make the effort to apologise now.
Yours sincerely
Miranda Tapsell
Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have to say that is a heartfelt plea from a young Australian who feels deeply about the subject—a young Australian who clearly understands the hurt being felt by members of the stolen generation and a young Australian who, I know, knows many people who are members of the stolen generation. That heartfelt plea she is making is shared by the majority of Australians, but it is something which our Prime Minister cannot confront. He cannot accept the legitimacy of the demand that he should say sorry on behalf of all of us. I think he will have a very good opportunity next year in the Centenary of Federation when this parliament will sit in Melbourne. I make a plea to the Prime Minister to accept the requests by so many Australians of goodwill for you to apologise on behalf of the people of Australia and use the occasion of that meeting of the parliament in Melbourne on the Centenary of Federation to say sorry.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—This morning I want to raise an issue involving my electorate  and which I have spoken about in this place on a number of occasions. I refer to an aged care facility in Cessnock known as Allandale. Allandale has traditionally been one of Cessnock's major employers and a source of apprenticeships and all sorts of training in the electorate. It was established in 1962 and has operated as an aged care facility for most of that time. For all of that time it has been owned and operated by the New South Wales state government.
The CEO of the Hunter Area Health Service, Professor Katherine McGrath, is determined that that should not be the case any longer and is determined to privatise Allandale. I do not take an ideological approach to privatisation. In fact, I think privatisation should always be considered on a case by case basis. If governments can make out a case for privatisation, so be it, particularly in circumstances where a huge injection of capital is required to keep the facility viable or competitive. Professor Katherine McGrath has not made out a case for privatising Allandale, and I am very concerned about the implications of privatisation for residents of the facility and their families. In particular, for those who work at the facility, I think employment numbers will decline significantly. I do not think there is anything in it for the Cessnock community.
Professor Katherine McGrath says that the privatisation of Allandale is about enhancing the standard of care at Allandale and, indeed, attracting a greater amount of Commonwealth funding. As you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the early nineties the Commonwealth agreed to take over all funding responsibilities for aged care because of concerns regarding inconsistencies in standards of care across the country. It was also agreed that the Commonwealth would not pay the capital component of bed funding for those homes that were operated by the state government. In other words, the New South Wales government has a lesser ability than a private provider to attract Commonwealth funds.
Professor Katherine McGrath's plan to privatise Allandale is no more than an exercise in shifting costs from the New South Wales government to the Commonwealth. It is about saving her budget $3.5 million each year. Professor McGrath says that if she can make savings of $3.5 million in relation to Allandale each year, that represents more money that she has available to put into acute care. I say that if Katherine McGrath has identified shortfalls in acute care funding she should take her case to the government and secure additional funding. She should not be seeking, at the expense of the local community, to embark upon a cost shifting exercise by privatising Allandale.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2000-11-30,"—Merry Christmas, Mr Deputy Speaker! But what do those two words mean? Christmas is the single most celebrated and happy feast day of all the Christian churches. Whether Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox, all Christian faiths recognise the ultimate significance and joy that is in the very word `Christmas'.
The origin of the date of 25 December is unknown, but it is by tradition attributed to an adaptation of the old pagan Festival of Light. Some think of Christmas as presents, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, mistletoe, yule logs, wassail bowls and a roast turkey dinner on Christmas Day. The use of a Christmas tree is of relatively recent origin—first appearing in Strasbourg, France, in the 17th century. The celebration of the coming of Santa Claus is actually a tradition introduced by Dutch settlers in the United States who knew him as Sinterklaas, although his feast day is actually 6 December. St Nicholas was born in Patara around AD 280 in Asia Minor and became Bishop of Myra, now Demre, in Turkey. He attended the first council of Nicea in 325 AD.
These traditions are all diversions from the ultimate purpose of Christmas and why it is celebrated. For the two billion Christians around the world, Christmas is about the birth of Jesus Christ. It is timely to recite the relevant truths contained in just one of the four gospels that corroborate the testimony that is the very basis of the feast day of Christmas. I cite the gospel of St Luke, chapter 2, verses 8 to 13, which describes the account of that momentous event of the birth of Jesus Christ. It says:
And in that region (of Bethlehem) there were shepherds out in the
field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the
Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear.
And the angel said to them,
“Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you tidings of a great joy
which will come to all the people;
for to you is born this day in the city of David
a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. 
And this will be a sign for you; you will find a babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in a manger”.
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God saying:
“Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace among men of good will”.
Bible historian Jules Lebreton notes in his text The Life and Teaching of Jesus Christ that, using certain milestone dates such as the death of Herod, being 4 BC, the baptism of John, the date of the enrolment by Quirinius, the Governor of Syria, et cetera, we can estimate the most likely actual birthday of Jesus Christ to be 12 March, 4 BC. But the feast day of Christmas transcends mere empirical analysis. Contemporary society seeks to reduce the celebration to an eclectic festivity of consumerism, encroachment and hijacking by other festivals and events, and an outright denial of the truth that is Christmas—the celebration of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the World.
The truth in the gospels is a testimony of Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. It is solely for this reason that Christmas is Christmas. The gospels are not chronologies; they are oral traditions put to writing long after the events they describe. They lack factual details. Some seek to discard them for this very reason. Subsequent documents in history attempt to destroy the very meaning and existence not only of Christmas but of the pre-eminent position of Christ himself. If there is a reason why the testimony is to be believed, then it is to be found in the humility of the scene. This is not the story of a great king performing fantastic deeds and miraculous works. What the nativity of Jesus is about, as Bible historian Jules Lebreton further notes in his text:
We do not find, in the (Gospel) pages, those puerile and fantastic fantasies that show that the imagination has been at work ... From his birth on, we find the same surroundings of poverty and humility—a hired stable, a handful of straw, swaddling clothes ... It is not this kind of magnificence that would have been imagined by the mind of a man.
In concluding this reflection on Christmas, I can find no other words that best describe the true meaning of Christmas than those of the great theologian Saint Augustine in his famous Sermon on the nativity:
Hear what you already know; reflect upon what you have heard; love what you believe; proclaim what you love.
