"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—In the Howard government's first budget it cut federal funding for vocational education and training by five per cent. In addition, it cancelled a provision for five per cent real growth in funding. There was the Howard government in its very early days demonstrating to Australia that it was not interested in skills development in our nation. It went further in the second Howard budget—it cut funding again. It cut it again, and it was not until the 2001-02 budget that there were some funding increases. But now we are in the sad situation where negotiations for a new agreement with the states have broken down. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 reduces the appropriated limit of funds for 2004 and appropriates funds for 2005.
There is an acute skill shortage in this country. Everyone except the government acknowledges it. The government does not want to recognise that skill shortage. Labor does, and Labor has committed to the following: on top of any Howard government funding, Labor will fund 20,000 new TAFE places every year to 2008. That is an indication of Labor's understanding of the skill shortage in Australia and its commitment to doing something real and substantial about it. There are numerous industry surveys that highlight the concern of the business community about the skill shortage. I refer in particular to a survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—a survey of investor confidence from July of this year. ACCI says the July 2004 survey:
... reported for the first time in its 14 years, that the Availability of Suitably Qualified Employees was ... the number one constraint on future investment decisions.
In the survey, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says:
For only the second time in the history of the survey Business Taxes and Charges ... has been removed from its position as the foremost constraint on investment. Taking number one position for the first time is the Availability of Suitably Qualified Employees ... A much tighter labour market for skilled workers has seen this constraint rise from fifth highest just a year ago to second position in January and April, then finally to first in the current quarter.
While all this has been happening in front of it, the Howard government has been arguing that industrial relations is the main game for business in Australia, whereas business is telling the Howard government and anyone who will listen that skill shortages are the main problem confronting business in Australia. It is not just the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that is saying this—an organisation not noted for its close affiliation to the Australian Labor Party. It does seem to have a fairly close association with the Liberal Party; its head was the party's industrial relations adviser, a former staffer. This is a great democracy and they are entitled to move from the Howard government to head up the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The point I am making is that they are hardly Labor Party sycophants yet here they are, telling the Howard government that there are acute skill shortages in this nation and the government is ignoring that advice; it is ignoring that advice from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
But it is not the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry speaking alone. The Australian Industry Group in a recent survey indicates that skill shortages are a top priority. It says:
Member responses to the Ai Group priority survey confirm that current and emerging skill shortages continue to be one of the three most critical constraints on industry growth and competitiveness.
So there is a second industry organisation trying to tell the Howard government that skill shortages are acute in Australia. A third one is the Business Council of Australia.
But the Howard government unfortunately has not been listening. Negotiations for an agreement with the states on vocational education and training have broken down, and we have in front of us a bill which would reduce the appropriation for funding to the states for skills development in our country. In fact, I warned repeatedly in the year 2000 in debate over the GST that the government, although it was talking about an intergovernmental agreement it had with the states not to reduce Commonwealth funding to the states, would renege on that agreement. Indeed, I said time and time again that the government would allow the real amount of tied grants to fall with the passage of inflation without increasing the nominal amount of tied grants to compensate for the increase in inflation; and also that, as the Australian population grew, per capita grants would fall away. The government said at the time, `Trust us; that will not happen.'
You just cannot trust the Howard government, because it has happened and is happening. It is happening in this bill and through the breakdown of negotiations between the Howard government and the states on vocational education and training for funding for ANTA. The Howard government is saying, `The states are getting the GST, so they have to foot more and more of the bill.' So only four years later the prophesy has come true and just about everywhere you look in terms of Commonwealth responsibilities—whether it be in health, higher education, vocational education and training or housing—the Howard government is saying to the states, `Well, you've got the GST, you've got the growth tax and we are in fact going to cut your real per capita funding grants.' That is exactly what is happening and it is happening with this legislation here today.
What a time to be curtailing funding for skills development in our nation. It is not as though the government is doing this just on one front. In another area of acute interest to me in terms of portfolio coverage, the Howard government—and it is hard to believe this—in its award-stripping process has a bill in the parliament to remove skill based career paths as an allowable matter. It says that these matters should not be contemplated in awards. It says effectively that employers under awards should not have any obligation to support the training of their staff—at a time when there are acute skill shortages. I refer to the Australian Industry Group's comment on that. The Australian Industry Group, regarding the removal of skill based career paths as an allowable matter, which is what is proposed in the legislation before the parliament, says in its submission to the Senate inquiry: 
While Ai Group is far from satisfied with aspects of the skill based classification structures in some awards, we do not agree that this matter would be more appropriately dealt with at the enterprise level. Skill based classification in awards when appropriately structured are able to assist in elevating skill levels and addressing skill shortages in an industry through linkages with national competency and industry training packages.
Labor agrees. But the Howard government, having had this advice from the Australian Industry Group, is persisting with its legislation to remove any obligation in relation to skill based career paths from awards. So not only is it withholding funding for vocational education and training but it is now also actively seeking to remove any obligation on the part of employers to support the training of their staff—and at a time when there are acute skill shortages.
I refer to some criticism that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has been levelling at the Labor government, particularly of our industrial relations policy in this particular area. Our industrial relations policy would allow skill based career paths to be in awards. We would not be in this government's situation of having highly prescriptive awards where the government is committed to the ongoing process of award stripping.
The minister invoked in parliament yesterday and on Lateline last night commentary of Dr John Edwards, a former Keating adviser and now Chief Economist with HSBC. The minister invoked this advice of Dr Edwards last night on Lateline, yesterday in parliament and several times over the last few days. In respect of the extension of awards beyond 20 allowable matters the same Dr Edwards says that `would not have any serious impact on employment, incomes or productivity'. Yet the minister continues to invoke what he says is criticism by Dr Edwards of our industrial relations policies. This is despite the fact that Dr Edwards on Friday, as reported in the Financial Review on Monday, said he was `reassured by Mr Emerson's commitment to enterprise bargaining with arbitration as a last resort'. That was on the record on Monday, the client note from Dr Edwards was produced last Friday and yesterday in the parliament and on Lateline last night the minister was still invoking Dr Edwards. I was very generous to the minister, wondering whether perhaps he was unaware that Dr Edwards had withdrawn that criticism. But we do know that the minister has a department full of advisers, an office full of advisers and Mr Hanke with his media liaison office, the `ministry of truth'; he would have known that Mr Edwards had withdrawn that criticism last night and yet he is persisting with it.
This is the standard Liberal tactic: you just say it over and over and over again. It does not matter whether or not it is true; you hope that, if you keep saying it, ultimately people will start believing it. The minister and this government must be called to account in respect of telling the truth. Forty-three eminent Australians have finally had enough and called the government to account on telling the truth. I expect fully, notwithstanding what I am saying here in the parliament, that the minister will be here in question time talking yet again about John Edwards's criticism, in the standard Liberal tactic of saying the same thing over and over, even when it is untrue. I seek leave to table a client note from Dr Edwards—the same Dr Edwards—which says in part: 
With Friday's release of a detailed policy ALP shadow minister Craig Emerson has gone some way towards reassuring markets that Labor in government would not put the clock back in industrial relations.
He goes on to say:
What Dr Emerson and Opposition Leader Mark Latham appear to be saying is that enterprise bargaining will remain the usual case, and the occasions for AIRC intervention would be few and far between.
Finally, he says:
Incidentally, last week's newspaper accounts of the controversy over Labor's industrial relations policy attribute to us an objection to the proposed requirement on unions and employers to “negotiate in good faith”. We have no such objection and did not express one.
I seek leave to table that document.
Leave granted.
—I do trust that the minister, his advisers, his department and Mr Hanke will take note of the fact that that criticism has been withdrawn, but I am not holding my breath. I expect the same repetition of untrue statements from this minister as he has been chortling since he became minister—a litany of Liberal lies.
The fact is Australia desperately needs a new round of productivity growth—a second round. The first round of productivity growth was created by Labor's comprehensive economic reform program of the 1980s and early 1990s. That first round created an open, competitive economy. As a direct result of those economic reforms, Australia has enjoyed a record-breaking decade of productivity growth, where we have outstripped every country in the Western world apart from Finland but including the United States. Productivity growth in Australia has exceeded that of the United States over the last 10 years. Labor in government recognised that today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity, but the truth of the matter is you cannot open up the economy twice. Once the door is open, it is open.
The Intergenerational Report produced by the Howard government in 2002 made a dire forecast. It said that, due to a combination of the ageing of the population and faltering productivity growth, growth in per capita GDP, which is a measure of living standards, will be so slow from 2010 onwards—from the next decade onwards—that it will be the slowest rate of economic growth per person since the decade of the Great Depression. Due to this poisonous combination of the ageing of the population and faltering productivity growth, that Intergenerational Report forecasts that Australian productivity growth from 2005, next year, will revert to its 30-year mediocre long-term average. That is, the advisers to the government, the Commonwealth Treasury, are advising the Howard government that from next year onwards Australia's productivity growth will slump. They are not alone; in publications from the Productivity Commission there are indications of a concern about faltering productivity growth.
You would think that in those circumstances the Howard government would be examining the ingredients, the necessary policy changes, to secure a second round of productivity growth—that very important second round of productivity growth so necessary to heading off the Intergenerational Report forecast that per capita GDP growth from 2010 onwards will be the slowest since the decade of the Great Depression. And we know from the Australian and international literature that the new sources of productivity growth—that vital second round of productivity growth—in Australia and around the world will be ongoing competition, which was created by Labor, and investment in skills and innovation. They will be the major sources of productivity growth for any country in the 21st century. 
That highlights the complete inadequacy of the Howard government when it comes to responding to the skills shortage, because this legislation does not provide any additional funding for skills development in this country. When the Howard government went on its $52 billion pre-election budget spending splurge, I asked members of the parliament: how much extra did the government allocate in the budget for skills development in Australia? The answer is zero; not one cent. Such is the government's understanding and commitment to skills development in this country and such are its priorities that it could not identify one extra cent for skills development in Australia.
I refer to some of the literature that is a damning indictment of the government over the last 8½ years. A paper from the Productivity Commission dated December 2003 and entitled `Sources of Australia's Productivity Revival' identifies and confirms what I have just said—that is, the major source of productivity growth in the last decade in Australia has been the opening up of the Australian economy, which was done by the previous Labor government. The paper says:
... the estimates suggest increases in productivity growth of the following orders of magnitude in response to changes witnessed in the Australian economy since the mid-1980s—
when the Hawke government was in power—
half a percentage point from increased openness, three-tenths of a percentage point from domestic R&D and two-tenths from ICT-related innovation.
There you go: productivity grew half a per cent from opening up the economy—that is 50 per cent of the growth—30 per cent from domestic research and development, and 20 per cent from innovation. How did skills development contribute to productivity growth in the last decade? Remember that this government has been in power for 8½ years. The answer is in the same paper. It says:
... the weight of evidence suggests there was a slower rate of accumulation of human capital in the Australian workforce in the 1990s, which all else equal would have detracted from a productivity acceleration in the 1990s.
The Productivity Commission is warning that skills formation in the last few years has detracted from productivity growth. It is the major source of new productivity growth around the world, yet it has detracted from Australia's productivity growth. Similarly, Gary Banks, Chairman of the Productivity Commission, in a speech called `Australia's economic “miracle”' says:
But there appears to have been no significant acceleration in workforce skills in the 1990s. In fact, the evidence shows a faster increase in skills in the 1980s.
That is a damning indictment of the Howard government from the Productivity Commission. The Howard government have failed even to recognise the problem, let alone address it. OECD analysis titled The policy agenda for growth indicates that policies to increase work force skills generate growth. That is the conclusion of the OECD, of economists around Australia and of the Business Council of Australia, which calls for extra investment in skills development in Australia. What have the government done in response? Nothing—there is not one extra cent in the budget for skills development in Australia. They want to strip it out of awards, they want to take Australia down the road to low skills and low wages and they want to turn their backs on the major source of productivity growth for tomorrow's prosperity: skills development. Only a Latham Labor government would be committed to creating 20,000 new TAFE places and skills development in this country.

"Hull, Kay, MP",NATS,2004-08-11,"—It is a great pleasure to rise again, albeit not as greatly prepared, to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004. After listening to the member for Rankin, it is quite obvious to me that he did not contribute in the work force as an employer in the eighties; otherwise, he would understand that productivity in the eighties was certainly not greater. Believe you me—those who were actually employers in the eighties can quite clearly tell him that productivity was not greater in the eighties. I would like to ask the member for Rankin: what has Labor ever done to assist employers of apprentices? Absolutely nothing—zero. The state Labor government attacks employment with their obscene payroll tax imposition. The member also spoke of the assertion that Australia's productivity will slump. The Productivity Commission must have received a copy of Labor's election policy and workplace relations platform wherein unions again would run our work force and our workplace agreements on productivity would be dismantled.
I would not take too much notice of the Productivity Commission. I am yet to be convinced of the Productivity Commission's access to relevant information when they are doing a productivity evaluation, having experienced some of these, particularly in the citrus industry, where the relevance of the citrus industry and the concerns that were raised were not even addressed by the Productivity Commission. So I am a bit battle scarred by the so-called Productivity Commission, which is supposed to herald and yield the truth and results for the Australian people. I would not be taking too much notice of the Productivity Commission.
In my electorate of Riverina, I have seen the number of new apprenticeships rise considerably. In 1995—and remember the coalition government did not come into place until 1996—there were 150 female new apprentices in my electorate of Riverina, and in 2003 there were 1,060. In 1995 there were 930 male new apprentices, and in 2003 there were 2,800. There has been dramatic growth. There were 70 certificate 1 and 2 new apprentices in 1995, and in 2003 there were 980. There were 970 certificate 3 and above apprentices in 1995 and—again, I reiterate this is during Labor's reign—in 2003 there were more than 2,880.
Looking at the age groups of apprentices in my electorate, we had 710 new apprentices aged 19 or less in 1995. We had a not so great but fairly significant increase to 1,220 in 2003. We had 320 apprentices aged between 20 to 24 in 1995, and in 2003 we had 920. We had barely 50 new apprentices aged 25 and over in 1995, and in 2003 we had 1,730. This is a significant difference. That number included mature age people who wanted to come back and make something out of their lives by doing an apprenticeship. I will go into the full-time or part-time status of new apprentices. In 1995 we had 1,080 new apprentices with full-time status, and in 2003 we had 3,370. The best thing about part-time new apprenticeships is that you learn in school so that when you leave school you are a full-time tradesman. We had zero part-time new apprentices in 1995 and 490 in 2003, and more now. In non-trade and related areas, in 1995 we had 130 new apprentices and in 2003 we had 2,490. In trade and related areas, we had 950 new apprentices in 1995 and in 2003 we had 1,370.
If we have look at the status for the Indigenous population, in 1995 there were zero new apprenticeships for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the Riverina electorate, and in 2003 there were 100—a significant increase. For the non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population there were 130 in 1995, and in 2003 we had 3,750. The opposition say that this government is not committed to trades and services. I say that it is time some government was committed to trade and services. 
In six years in this House, I have raised this issue continuously, tirelessly, ad nauseam. If I see an opportunity to come into this House and debate the issue of the worthiness of trades and services, I take it. We are not all rocket scientists, we are not all doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs. But, when you listen to the debate that takes place on the floor of this House—primarily being led by the opposition on the subject of HECS fees—you would think that those are the only options for the Australian people. It is the most nauseating debate that I have ever witnessed. I am a person who comes proudly from the trades and services area. I have been the owner of a medium-sized enterprise which employed a lot of tradesmen and trained a lot of people, and I am very proud to have been an Australian person who has employed Australian people day after day for 25 years. I was employing and offering opportunities to our rural youth in a business that is often regarded as less than worthy.
I think that this debate has gone too far. Over the years it has escalated to the point where our children are made to feel less than worthy if they are not heading to university. In the past it was a fact that not all students were suited for university—and nor should they be. It is an option that not everyone can have. There are many who should be aspiring towards being price takers, not price makers. There are very few people who would come out of a university, start a small business and employ trades and services people. The people who do that have actually gone through the trades and services process. They have left school and believe that they are—and they actually are—providing a very valuable career path for themselves by going into building, plumbing, electrical, panel beating or automobile mechanics trades. They are doing great jobs in their communities. They are earning wages, they are spending, and they are staying in their local rural and regional communities.
We had this escalation in the 1980s—by the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating governments—where we were trying to force everybody into university. Everyone had to get a free education, and they had to go forward into a university because we were not a knowledge nation. We were a nation of nothingness if everyone did not have a university degree. I said in this House the other day that I would like to see a survey of all of the businesses that are operating in Australia, that have been operating for a long time and employing people, to see what educational qualifications they might have had.
At times it seems to be politically correct that I should cover myself by saying, `Of course education is important.' I think that stands to reason. Of course education is important. I am not standing here saying that education is not important, or that university is not important, or that university degrees are not important. What I am saying is: yes, they are important, but so are the more than 70 per cent of the rest of the Australian children, and their choices and desires to go into their family businesses. It has got to the point now where there is no ability for business succession planning, and I have raised this in the House. I have tremendous admiration for the Deputy Prime Minister, because when he was minister for agriculture—and it has gone down through the agriculture ministers—we introduced FarmBis and a process of succession planning for farmers. But never have we gone one step further and recognised that small businesses are generally run by generations of family after family. We have not provided small businesses with the opportunity for succession planning. It costs a lot of money to have the ability to hand over businesses to our family. It actually detracts from the real joy of having built something up from the beginning to have to be concerned as to how our families are going to move into it without an enormous cost imposition, and that starts them off without the solid footing that they should have. 
On Saturday night, I attended the first regional motor traders' awards, which were held by the Motor Traders Association out in the Riverina. It was the first regional awards night. It was a sensational night. We had sensational businesses there. There were young people who had gone through, starting out as, say, a mechanic, and are now employing people. There were air conditioning businesses and a whole host of young people there on that night. But it was surprising. One of the award winners for the new vehicle industry was Hartwigs Trucks, with the principal being Tim Hartwig. Young Tim Hartwig is the fourth generation of Hartwigs in the industry. His great-grandfather started the business, and Tim is continuing to run the business with about 80 or 90 employees in rural Australia. As we saw them coming down the line, I was sitting opposite a gentleman, Gordon Braid, who owns Wagga Wagga Motors. He is the third generation in his business. We were sitting there, and we are the second generation. We started our business and our sons are in it now and continue to employ people.
There has not been recognition by past governments that small business and small to medium enterprises are the backbone and pillars of society. Small business people take out loans, mortgage their homes and have direct responsibility, seven days a week, for employing people. Not only are they not given any incentive; they are also absolutely penalised by state governments on payroll tax. The more people you want to employ, the more tax you pay to the state government. It is a direct tax on employment. It is quite obscene.
In the discussion in this chamber, I have listened to the member for Rankin putting his rubbish across the dispatch box with no understanding of how it works at all. We have not removed any funding—from the New South Wales government in particular—yet earlier this year we saw prices rise at Riverina TAFE. We saw the annual TAFE administration fee increase from $710 to $1,650 for graduate diploma courses and from $260 to $850 for graduate certificate courses, including those required for trades and apprenticeships. In an article in my local paper, The Daily Advertiser, in January this year, the New South Wales education minister, Andrew Refshauge, defended this rise in TAFE fees. He said it brought prices into line and that this was right because TAFE fees had been too low and, for too long, so many people had been getting a free education at TAFE. It did not matter when they were getting a free education at university—we think that is what should happen—but do not let anybody who wants to go into a trade or service ever get one ounce of encouragement or support from a Labor government!
It does not happen. As we have seen, anything that employers have really moved forward on and gained efficiencies in with their work force and on their workshop floors, such as workplace agreements and the exclusion of unions so that they can have meaningful and warm relations with their employees, is again going to be dismantled. We will again see the divisive process that will take place on workshop floors. I shudder to think of the situation now for people who now run small to medium enterprises and have a very established and cooperative work force. They will be thinking: `Do we take out another loan and mortgage the house a little further in order that we can provide employment for our employees when, if there is a Labor government, we are going to lose all that productivity and we will be at risk of losing our homes? We are working seven days a week now. Our thoughts and sleep patterns are always disturbed by wondering, “What if this happens?” or “What if that happens?”' Let me tell you, your sleep should not be disturbed by wondering `what if' but by `when' this will happen if we have a Labor government. With a Labor government, you will have not only unproductive work forces on your small to medium enterprise workshop floors but also no opportunity to progress your apprenticeships. It is evident from the figures that I have been quoting here today on the New Apprenticeships in my electorate that when the Labor government was in place there was and has been no commitment to ensuring that trades and services are available. 
I again urge the Labor opposition to consider the issues associated with the running of small to medium enterprises. I urge them to have as much passion and enthusiasm for and on behalf of the probably more than 70 per cent of Australian children who do not go to university, who wish to enter a trade or a field and who are feeling less than worthy for wanting to do so. I urge them to put as much passion and enthusiasm into representing those people as they do for those who attend university and have to pay HECS fees, if they are a doctor or lawyer, and have to earn $35,000 before they have to start paying that back. I think it is a pretty good loan deal. I have made my feelings pretty clear in this chamber before. I urge them to extend that passion and enthusiasm to that percentage of our children who want to do honourable trades. It was particularly heartening to see the article in the Financial Review today that espoused more articulately than I ever could the issues we are having with the shortage of trades. The shortage of trades is killing rural and regional Australia.
Last night I was speaking to someone on the phone about employment issues. This gentleman happens to be in the motor trade, as my family is. He said: `I had a piano tuner around at my house the other day. He had no instruments, and he charged $150 an hour. Yet our motor trades are getting paid $30 an hour. It is quite ridiculous. But we have few piano tuners. As fewer skilled tradesmen work in our industries, maybe some of those industries will get paid a lot more in the future.' But I do not want to risk that. I do not want to risk that our children will not have an opportunity to live and work in rural and regional Australia in the trade of their choice. I want them to feel worthy. They should feel that they are valuable citizens in Australia and, whether they are going to be a builder, mechanic, panelbeater or spray painter, that they are a valuable and worthwhile contributor to the Australian economy. We should be giving them all the support we can. This government intends to do that. It is Labor that has a very poor track record on providing assistance to employers to ensure that our skills and trades will continue into the future.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—There is no greater difference between the two major political parties than on the issue of education and training. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 provides an opportunity for me to highlight some of those fundamental differences between the government and the Labor Party. The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, said she felt we focused too much on university places and on the problems with HECS fees and indicated that she had felt nauseous that we raised those matters in this place. The fact is that it makes us nauseous to see the Minister for Education, Science and Training, a minister who was the recipient of free education, come into this place and not be sensitive to the overwhelming concerns of students who are suffering under the increases to HECS. It would be extraordinary for most people not to realise that, but clearly the member for Riverina is not sensitive to that concern that the public at large have in relation to access to university education and the fact that there is a nexus between increasing fees and the lack of capacity for people who are less economically advantaged to avail themselves of university places. 
This morning we want to focus on vocational education and training. This bill highlights that this government has an awful record since 1996 on funding for vocational education and training. In 1996 the Howard government set about reducing in real terms the funding for ANTA and the funding for this area of education and training. It cut the budget in those areas for the first few years and then from 1998 it froze the budget. In effect, from the inception of the Howard government we have seen a decline in funding in real terms in this area. That has clearly helped to produce a deficiency of skills required for this nation. It is not always the case that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Industry Group agree with Labor, although we have always spoken with those major peak bodies and there are certain areas where we would have agreement. However, it is important to note that both the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have pointed to major problems with skill shortages in this nation. Last year the submission by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education said:
Australian firms are greatly concerned at their capacity to recruit employees with appropriate levels of skill, and retaining skilled employees, with such pressures being particularly acute in regional and rural Australia.
The Australian Industry Group in its submission said that over half the businesses surveyed face skill shortages. The Australian Chamber of Commerce survey of investor confidence for July 2004 sounded this warning:
For only the second time in the history of the survey Business Taxes and Charges has been removed from its position as the foremost constraint on investment. Taking number one position for the first time is the Availability of Suitably Qualified Employees. A much tighter labour market for skilled workers has seen this constraint rise from fifth highest just one year ago to second position in January and April, then finally to first in the current quarter.
So there seems to be no disagreement amongst the Labor Party and major employer bodies that there are significant skill shortages in the workplace, particularly in regional and rural Australia.
The government has failed to address this problem. As we know, this bill will not provide any relief or remedy to change that trend. With the introduction of this bill, we will see a decline in funding for this year. As the bill highlights, it would reduce the appropriated limit of total funds for vocational education and training to be provided to the Australian National Training Authority for distribution to the states and territories for 2004 by $7 million. So there is a nominal and real decline in the funding provided. In Labor's view, there has been no justification for this. Indeed, there has been a failure by the government to respond to some of the things we believe should happen in this area.
Firstly, there should be a willingness of the government to support Labor's view that we should increase the TAFE places available to Australians by 20,000 per year. We believe that there is a need for those additional 20,000 places, which will certainly ameliorate the shortfall. There are people who seek to go to TAFE and are not able to find places. We hope that the government will accept the view that there needs to be an increase in TAFE places in order to arrest not only the lessening of opportunities for many Australians but also the skill shortages that are currently being experienced in the land. To date we have not heard anything positive from the minister for education. It would appear that the government is not interested in accepting Labor's view that there is a critical need to arrest the shortages in this area. 
It is also important to note that we live in a globalised world and there are many needs. The first and foremost need for this country is to arrest the decline in skills. We will not be able to compete in terms of labour costs with our neighbours in Asia, and if we want to make sure we maintain our position as a prosperous and independent country then we have to make sure that we increase our skills in order to compete with the cheaper labour costs that are experienced in other countries.
In my view there are only two options for what we do with our work force and with our economy at large—that is, we either focus on highly skilled jobs and areas in which we can find a niche market in this globalised world and we seek to compete, or we race to the bottom and compete with those nations whose labour costs are much lower than ours. Against that backdrop, it is critical that we focus on increasing skills where there are shortages so that we can not only maintain our current economic position and prosperity as a nation but, indeed, build upon the success that we have already established. Those are the two options. If one were to look at the government's policies in this area, one would think that the government was choosing the race to the bottom, allowing workers in this country to be divided into two parts: those who are fortunate enough to be highly skilled, well remunerated employees or independent contractors or consultants and those—the majority, I daresay, of Australian workers—who find themselves increasingly vulnerable in a work force where tenure is precarious and those who, worse still, have yet to find any work or who have found only casual or part-time employment when they want permanent full-time employment.
These are major challenges and nobody pretends that they are easy to fix. But my concern is that the government is not even seeking to address these fundamental problems. In fact, the Prime Minister in question time this week was happy to rail against Labor's view that casual employees who have been employed for 12 months be given an opportunity to become permanent employees, where possible and reasonable. John Howard may not talk to or befriend many casual employees, but it seems to me that if you spend some time in the real world you find that many people are under enormous pressure because they do not have any security of employment. That means that when they go to the bank to try to get a mortgage they are asked whether they have a permanent job and when they are looking to start a family they have to consider whether they will be employed in a year's time. There has to be some mechanism by which employers and employees can find a reasonable accommodation that can, on the one hand, ensure productivity and economic growth and, on the other hand, provide some security of employment for Australian workers. I do not suggest for a moment that that is easy.
There has been a trend—which precedes this government—that we move from permanent full-time work to part-time and casual work, and some of the changes involved in that arose out of people's personal choice to move into what seemed to be more flexible arrangements. There are and will always be employees who happily choose part-time work over full-time work and who even choose to be in temporary employment. There will always be a need for those types of jobs to fill the peaks and troughs of demand at a given workplace, but what we have been seeing in the last eight years in particular is an attempt by this government, along with some pernicious employers—not most employers, I am happy to say—to deliberately make their employees feel insecure, to deliberately remove the entitlement of security of employment as a condition, in order to change the relationship from one of relative equality to one where the employer has sole discretion over their employees' occupational future. I think we have to address that problem. 
People do not have part-time families, they have full-time families and they need full-time jobs. Indeed, they do not have casual mortgages. Many have mortgages extending over 25 years or more, and they need some certainty that they can live their lives and have a decent quality of life. But they can only do that if government ensures that conditions do not exist that allow employers to perniciously undermine security of employment so as to make the work force vulnerable. There has been so little regard for that area.
Focussing on the capacity of converting casuals to permanents is not the only way to make people secure. Increasing people's skills is another way. The more skills that each employee has the greater their capacity to maintain their relevance and their importance in the workplace. Again, there is no doubt we can look at laws to provide that capacity. The light touch regulation, which has been mentioned by the member for Rankin, the shadow minister for workplace relations, would allow for employers and employees to reach agreement on a timeframe within which a casual could become a permanent, provided it was reasonable for that to happen. In my view, that seems to be a reasonable way to proceed.
An important complement to those changes, of course, would be to ensure that every Australian worker had as many skills as possible and that those skills were continually upgraded so that those workers could remain critical to the workplace. That is probably the most important thing in the end. In the macro sense, the more high skills we have and the more technical skills that we acquire, the more the nation would have the capacity to stay off the low road and to avoid getting into the position where it is seeking to compete against countries whose labour costs—whose wages—are much lower and therefore place enormous pressure on our wage system.
We have to focus on how we can maintain our standards and our prosperity as a nation. At the same time, we should have some regard for the employees who have found things pretty difficult in the last eight years. There have been some successes; there have been beneficiaries from economic growth. However, there are too many losers in this scenario. We do not want to continue to see further division between those who have benefited as a result of globalisation and change and those who have lost. Our government should be making sure that we bring everyone with us. If our nation is to prosper, we must ensure we bring everyone with us.
This bill is another example of a government that fails to have regard for the importance of skills. It was said earlier in this debate that this government has been about removing skill based instruments from the wages system. This government sought to remove, as an allowable matter in an award, the skill based provision—in other words, it said, `We do not need a wage system based on skills.' That is the message the government sends when it seeks to disallow by law the provision that would enable people to go along career paths that are based on skills—not based on years of service or whether they bring the lunch to the boss or whatever but based on the skills that are required and that they utilise in the workplace. 
The fact that the government has sought to remove that provision from the award underlines the point that it is a government that has little regard for many employees and little understanding of the nexus between skill acquisition and skill utilisation and productivity—meaning productivity for employers, for the nation at large and, indeed, for employees, and job security for employees. That is the trade-off. If we can ensure that we have a highly skilled work force, we can ensure greater job security, greater prosperity and greater productivity, which is what employers would generally wish for.
So the government has to consider those things, but it has failed with this bill. The government has shown its failure by not continuing to fund vocational education and training in the way it should be funded. ANTA was a creature of a Labor government, and I am happy to say that the government has continued ANTA, but it has allowed it to decline. This government has lost its focus in the area of vocational education and training, and that is highlighted by the lack of funding to that area.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2004-08-11,"—My comments on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 will be very brief because the contributions made by other members cover most of the ground I want to cover here. The importance of trades has been recognised throughout all of history. In fact, when the Ottoman Turks ruled the civilised part of the world for some 200 years, every sultan had to do a trade. The trade of Suleiman the Magnificent, who was the most famous of the Ottoman rulers, was that of a jeweller. He was a very good jeweller; in fact, his jewellery is still heirloom material today. He was famous for his siege of Vienna—it took every single army in Europe to relieve the city. Also, without Henry Ford and the training that he received and gave, through what we would now call a TAFE, I do not think we would have had the motor car in the 1920s.
Like many members of parliament, I get constant complaints about the lack of tradesmen and the difficulty in getting trained tradesmen these days. Other points mentioned have been to do with multiskilling, which has undoubtedly led to greater benefits flowing through the community, and the removal of demarcation disputes. In relation to those, I always remember my first job, working in the lead smelter at Mount Isa Mines. One day, five of us were waiting around to clean out a big flue, and the boilermaker was cutting a hole for us to get into the flue. When the boilermaker took a break from his arc cutter there was one tiny piece of metal holding the section he had been cutting on, so I went over with a hammer and banged the tiny piece of metal off. There was a thundering silence then, with everyone looking at me. I said, `You can't be serious,' but I was an unskilled labourer and, of course, it was a tradesman's job. The leading hand took me aside and had a little fatherly chat to me, saying I was very lucky to still be in the job. We had that sort of stupidity—where five people were standing around waiting and there was just one tiny piece of metal that needed moving—but, all the same, there has been a downside to multiskilling and that is the fact that there is a sort of an idea around that you do not need tradesmen now. That is a very dangerous attitude that has crept in and permeated all of the training in this area. 
The major thing I wanted to say today is that, although this seems to be a fight about where there should be more money, where there should be less money and who should decide where the money goes—a typical state-federal barney—with regard to ANTA and the ANTA agreement, I think the federal government must require a trade registration system. I heard of an excellent example recently in the hairdressing profession, where a person who was claiming to have a range of licences was found to have no licences at all. This can happen because there is no central registration system, and I think, if the federal government are going to finance the states through ANTA, there is an absolute necessity that they give consumers, society as a whole and the professions themselves—the hairdressing profession, the motor vehicle electricians' profession or whatever—the security of a registration system. That way, people who are unprofessional and who have done the wrong thing can be punished and can have their registration taken away and consumers can be protected by the knowledge that a person they are dealing with is a registered—that is, a trained and skilled—hairdresser, motor vehicle electrician or whatever.
It may well be—and you and I both know this, Deputy Speaker Scott—that in country towns you cannot get people with training and you have to have people without any. But the necessity for that registration is absolute. I was appalled to find out from Brian Cox, who is a Queensland CEO—he is probably the country's best CEO—that there is no central register for hairdressers. You cannot find out who is registered. You cannot find out if someone has professional qualifications. The case I heard of involved a leasing arrangement. The business was leased to a person who claimed to have technical qualifications that they apparently did not have. The business suffered very severely, but there was no central registration system that could be contacted in order to find out whether this person was actually registered or not. That is a very big hole in the legislation as it now stands, and it is one that I hope the minister will address. It is a hole that should not be there.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 provides for the maximum amount of vocational education and training funding for distribution by the Australian National Training Authority to the states and territories for capital and recurrent purposes and for national projects, but it will reduce the appropriated limit of funds for VET to be provided to ANTA to distribute to the states and territories from $1,136,822,000 to $1,129,418,000. That decrease of several million dollars reflects the outcome of the ANTA negotiations, in which the federal minister failed to get the right outcome.
Appropriated funds for VET will be provided to ANTA for distribution up to a limit of $1,148,059,000. I think this is a rather backward step and will work against funding the most critical areas in education. Commonwealth funds make up approximately one-third of public expenditure on the vocational education and training system in Australia. A significant part of this expenditure is covered by the VET Funding Act for VET programs. VET programs are the main programs that can be found in rural and regional areas and are vital tools in helping our young people move from school to work. Yet it seems this government is moving away from funding these sorts of programs.
There have been all sorts of fights to try to increase ANTA funding. Parties failed to reach an agreement for ANTA in 2000, which resulted in the figure being the same as for the previous financial year. It was only in June 2001 that a new agreement allowed a small growth in funding. I understand that in the 2003-04 budget the minister announced he had written to the state and territory ministers with the Commonwealth's offer of $3.6 billion for three years, which included maintaining levels of Commonwealth funding but asking the territories and states to match this funding—a great way to negotiate. But the figures started to become rubbery and the states did not agree that the additional places promised—possibly only 18,000 over three years—would actually eventuate. Labor will aim much higher than that. In fact, we promise to increase the new full- and part-time TAFE places by 20,000 every year by 2008. 
In light of the discussions and the realisation that this was not a good deal, the states and territories refused to sign the agreement as they wanted a much higher level of growth funding—which Labor are certainly promising. So the toing and froing goes on, with deals being passed backwards and forwards. We should not be tampering with this funding. We are talking about our children's futures, and I for one am incensed by this shallow way of dealing with the shortage of skilled tradespeople, medical staff, nurses, nurses aides and the like—and the general shortage of people to fill the growing job vacancies in our country. It is okay to have lots of possible jobs, but it is not good enough unless we have people to undertake them.
Just today in the Hobart Mercury there is an article on the lack of skilled people to work on the west coast of Tasmania—part of my electorate of Lyons. The issue came up at a forum convened by the Australian Mines and Metals Association, which included mining and community members. We have the Renison Bell mine being reopened on the west coast of Tasmania, along with other new mines being started, producing opportunities there. The article records that the ABS has defined that, across the country, 1.5 million tradespeople are not working in their trade. Some of those might come back if there is enough to attract them to do so, but basically there is a need to ensure that we are still training people in these areas. This was seen as the biggest issue facing members of the mining industry in Tasmania and also around the nation.
I think that exposes some of the failures of this government and the Minister for Education, Science and Training—who I am pleased to see is in the House to listen to my speech. It is very kind of you, Minister, to do so. But I have to be a bit critical of you, in that you have not been able to make the negotiations work and therefore move us forward at a time when we have a shortage of tradespeople and skilled people in this country.
I recently attended the Cressy and Campbell Town District high schools, which made a commitment to the `no dole program'. Youngsters there are demanding to be trained or employed rather than going on the dole. Who wants to be on benefits when there are opportunities all over the place to do rewarding jobs? We must have the places at TAFE and at university to allow young people to have access to the training they need.
I note there have been inroads into the funding provided for adult literacy training, which is a terrible shame. There are still many people, particularly in rural and regional Australia, who struggle to read to their children, to help them with their homework and to even fill in forms for themselves. Adult literacy programs around the country gave these people a chance to become more involved in society and released them from hiding behind lies and subterfuge to get through their days. I have seen what can be achieved through these programs and the relief that these programs give to so many who have had difficulties such as those I spoke about. But I understand that these programs are suffering in that those who used to volunteer their time are not being supported anymore because programs have been cut back through ANTA and there is little money for volunteer coordinators. 
The Prime Minister is always very keen to thank volunteers and to be seen as part of these programs. But being a volunteer can almost be a heartless chore if you are not part of a system that receives some help. That help might be just to organise a space to work from or to provide some books and train the trainer courses. It could be something really simple like providing a bus fare to get to where you are volunteering. Without a small amount of funds for administration and coordination, volunteer programs can just die.
Volunteers help over and over again in education programs in the country areas. I see them all the time in Lyons. We need them. We need to encourage them and we need them to be there for young people to look up to. That support needs to be there. Some young people have a terrible tussle to get through their teen years, because of trouble at home or trouble with their health or because they have had a difficult time through school because of a disability or a mental illness. This is the time when mentors in the community can really help—people such as Arthur Pegg, a man who has worked on the land and around Campbell Town for most of his life, who cares what happens to young people.
Arthur has made a point of helping to get students job ready, giving them a start somewhere and organising it. He helps and encourages the students to participate in life. This is so important but it is rarely recognised. I salute all those who are doing that work, and I make a commitment to ensure that, when Labor gets into government, we will not stint on the funding for these programs. The young people of Australia are our future, and we should not let them down.
There are also others who should be benefiting from training, retraining and lifelong learning. We are never too old to learn. It is one of the great stimulations of life to put your mind to work to solve a problem, learn a new language or learn a skill that you thought had not been around for many years. Learning and teaching have the same excitement. It is just as much a reward to help someone achieve something they could not do before as it is to achieve something new yourself.
But, as I said, the minister has failed to negotiate with the states to make the new places available in these training areas, and that is a great shame. In Tasmania, the state government put some money aside in their last budget for low-income housing, but I note that the building industry said the other day that they are having difficulty getting enough tradesmen to build the houses. It is a great shame that there is money there to be spent but there are not enough young people who are trained to be able to go into those jobs. There is so much to be done and there is so little time. We need to have the resources to get on with this job—to get it done—and to meet the demands that are there.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I thank the members who have made a contribution to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004, although some of the remarks have not been particularly well informed. This bill appropriates a total of $1.148 billion as the Australian government's contribution to the states and territories for vocational education and training in 2005. Throughout the course of last year I sought to negotiate a new three-year funding agreement with the states and territories for the Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA as it is known. This government proposed a $3.57 billion package over three years. In nominal terms, that represented a 12.5 per cent increase in funding. In real terms, it represented a 2½ per cent real increase for each year of the three years of the triennium. I asked the states to each put on the table a 1½ per cent real increase in their own funding to match—albeit still under—that of the Australian government. 
This would have funded 71,000 additional places over the next three years, and I must say that up until November last year I was reasonably confident that we would find agreement. In that regard, I would like to pay special tribute to the Victorian Labor government, minister Lynne Kosky and her officials for engaging in the negotiation process in a very earnest and constructive way.
In the end, the states and territories refused to sign the agreement for three reasons. First, which is the norm for states and territories, they wanted more money. You always expect that. The reality is that at least four of the states and territories could not afford to meet the offer. I will not embarrass them by naming them but four of the jurisdictions could not afford a 1½ per cent real increase over the three years. Queensland had a particular concern that on a per capita basis it was being underfunded in relation to the other states for historical reasons. There was only one minister at the entire meeting that supported the Queensland position, and that was me.
Second, New South Wales, which is particularly driven by the interests and concerns of union officials, was concerned about user choice. For those unacquainted with the vocational education training sector, this does not in fact refer to drug use; it actually refers to employers having the choice of a public or a private provider for his or her apprentices. Our government strongly believes in employer led training, national consistency and user choice. So if you are a carpenter or a boilermaker, or if you are running a small manufacturing company, and you wish to use a private training provider, you should be able to. There should be a minimum budgetary allocation by the collective governments to employers to make those choices.
The third reason why the agreement fell over was because this government—our government—believe that people should actually abide by the law when they are in workplaces. We are living in a country—and this is particularly the case in Victoria—where on building sites there is no freedom of association and there is frequent abuse and flagrant ignorance and neglect of the law at best. Before we put in $200 million per year to support infrastructure projects through the Australian National Training Authority agreement, we said that if there was more than $5 million contributed—and that represents more than half the cost of the building program—then we wanted to see that the program complied with our government's policies in relation to workplace relations; and we said that if there was more than $10 million of Australian government money then there must be compliance. The states were not at all happy with that, which is unfortunate.
As a compromise, I did say to the states, `If you like, the states would be able to take the proportion of the infrastructure money which would trigger compliance with the Australian government's workplace relations policies and roll that over into places.' That would have created another 186,000 places over the three years in addition to the 71,000 places that were originally on the table with the agreement. Unfortunately, the states decided that they would not sign up to the agreement. Some people—I would not do this—impute the motive in part to the fact that they would rather have a debate in a federal election year about these things than actually have an agreement to deliver resources for training young people. 
Recognising that this was a political risk, I foreshadowed to the states and territories that, if they did not sign the agreement, not a dollar of Australian government federal money would be lost to training. What I did was remove $110 million from the $3.57 billion offer and I said to the states and territories, `We the Australian government will directly tender to the training marketplace for those places.' This year, there is just over $20.5 million available for a direct tender for 7,500 places, targeting especially mature age people, sole parents returning to the workplace who want additional training, and students with disabilities. We have now successfully completed the tender round and I can say that it is going very well.
What has happened is that that matching part of the agreement that the states and territories were required, through the course of negotiations, to provide has not been delivered; so, in some cases in some jurisdictions, there has been a reduction in training opportunities. In that sense, I should defend the state of Tasmania. As the member for Lyons has just said, Tasmania, unlike six of the other jurisdictions, has actually increased funding—I think by 6.7 per cent real—in its budget this year for training. For that at least it should take some credit, which I am very happy to acknowledge.
The reality in relation to training—and a lot has been said through the course of the debate about skill shortages—is that there are many things in this country of which we can be very proud: things that have been done by governments of Labor and of coalition persuasion. But one of our failings as a country is we have created a society in which young people feel that the value of their lives is determined by the educational choices that they make. None of us—it does not matter how earnest we are; I have three teenage children and it does not matter how much I love them or how much I attempt to understand—who live in the adult world will begin to understand what it is like to be growing up in Australia in 2004 and to be 14, 15 or 16.
We have created a country over the last 30 years—and I assign part of the blame to Mr Keating for this—where young people feel that if they do not get an outstanding year 12 result, a university education, a mobile phone, a BMW and fashionable clothes in some way their lives are of lesser value than those who do.
It is critically important in terms of our vision for education and training that every human being in this country, and every young person in particular, should be able to find and achieve their own potential—whatever that is. We should recognise that young people must have choices available to them. They should see university as an important part of their life horizon, but they should also see that training through TAFE, private training providers and apprenticeships is just as highly valued by Australia, and by their families, as are those opportunities that are offered through higher education.
For some young people, just getting to school and then from school to a job emotionally intact is a much greater achievement than anything that any of us here has ever achieved. Imagine being 15 years old and opening up a newspaper in any part of Australia on any day of the week, or turning on a radio or turning on question time—and I will get to that in a moment. What are you confronted with? You are confronted with a society that is obsessed with university education. Then we have parents, as inadequate as some of us can be in that regard, who at times project their own ambitions onto their children and want them to be what they are not, when young people work out in their hearts what they feel they are best suited to much earlier than we do. Then we have teachers, many of whom bring ideological baggage to the task of teaching our children. I know of a teacher who took a year 10 class to the Ford manufacturing plant in Broadmeadows and said to the students: `If you don't work hard at school you're going to end up here'—ignoring the fact that you can go in and get a certificate 1 in car manufacturing and come out at the other end with an MBA. 
I had the experience of asking the Master Builders Association to find me the six builders in Victoria who build the largest number of homes. I spent an afternoon with them about 18 months ago talking about skill shortages and apprenticeship numbers in building and construction. They said, `You know what our No. 1 problem is? It is an attitude in this country, and it's often reflected in what is said to young people, not just by parents but at school.' They also said: `We've got a careers expo coming up in two weeks. We expect about 4,000 kids at it, and we are going to be promoting careers, apprenticeships and training in building and construction—home building.' The CEO of the Master Builders Association then said to me, `The careers adviser from the largest high school in Melbourne said that they won't be sending any kids to that because there are no tertiary outcomes.'
The first price that we are paying for this is a university drop-out rate that is amongst the highest in the developed world. Forty per cent of people who start a university course do not finish it. Three in four come back later, but 100,000 of the 228,000 people who got a HECS place at university this year will not finish that course—and 40,000 will have left before the end of the year and will never come back. Why are they doing that? It is because they are panic buying in year 12. They do not really know what they want to do, but they have been told: `If you do not go to university, you are not as good as someone who does.' They panic buy, they get a place, then they start to think about what they really want to do and they leave. So there is a human cost and an economic cost. The second price we pay is skill shortages in at least 11 key industries—everything from aerospace to marine manufacturing, road freight, rural industries and building and construction. It includes a whole range of industries, and we have identified 11 key industries. The third price we pay is having a significant minority of young people in early secondary school who feel that there is no place for them and that they are living in a society that says, `If you don't jump through these very strict and narrow academic hurdles then you're a failure.'
Every day we are here in parliament, we go through what some describe as the theatre of question time. But there is a very serious feature to question time. Question time is when the opposition of Australia sets its priorities and agenda. About now, the key tacticians in the Labor Party are probably having a meeting and deciding what questions they will ask of the government at two o'clock. In the almost three years I have had the privilege to be this country's Minister for Education, Science and Training, I have had 59 questions in question time. Fifty-four of those questions have been about universities, and five have been about training—and in those five questions the word `apprenticeship' appeared once, as an afterthought.
When Mr Keating was the Prime Minister of this country—when I was doing home visits in Bridgewater, which the member for Lyons knows only too well—he appeared on the ABC news in June 1992 and said that in the next decade, which is now, there would be no jobs in Australia for people pushing brooms. Most of us would support the aspirational sentiment underneath that, but this country will only ever be as good as the men and women that we can train in hospitality, in the automotive industry, in retail and manufacturing and as boilermakers, chippies, tilers, plasterers and electrotechnicians. At the end of this day, when those of us who are privileged to be in this parliament leave this chamber, men and women will come in here and clean this place. Noone in this country—particularly people who want to lead it—should ever demean the choices that people, especially young people, make because, as Socrates observed in 400 BC, there are two bases to any society. The first is mutual need—we need one another—and the second is difference of aptitude: we are all different. We are all good at something, and those of us who are parents know that our kids are different. 
Last year, I asked my department to do some research—useful research. I asked it to go and survey parents and find out what they want in schooling—and their answers have been confirmed by what has been published in the Fairfax press in the last few days. Seventy-eight per cent of parents of children in non-government schools want their children to go to university. Seventy-two per cent of parents of children in government schools want their children to go to university. One-third of the parents said the kids would have no say in it. The government have announced a whole range of things to try and deal with this. For example, I recently announced that we will give 50 schools throughout Australia $10,000 each to be careers education lighthouses—to be exemplar models of best practice in relation to careers advice. At a cost of $4½ million, we are for the first time going to formally train and accredit careers advisers in Australian schools. We have developed interactive, ongoing professional development programs for them. We want to make sure that our 217 local community partnerships throughout Australia are funded to support and provide careers advice as well as careers transitions in local communities. We are also going to fund industry secondments for careers advisers so they can get out of schools and spend a bit of time in industry actually having a look at what happens in modern workplaces. We are going to provide a training module for every teacher trained in this country in terms of careers advice. And we are producing a parent tear-out, to go with a job guide that every year 10 student will receive, and it will give advice to parents about how to talk to their children about careers choices.
We want the support of the Labor Party in trying to shorten traditional training apprenticeships in automotive repair, automotive retail and building and construction. If we can train a doctor in four years, why does it take four years to train an electrician or a panel beater? Surely we can start to recognise prior learning. We need to cut through the way that the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations deliver jobs outlook forecasts to young people, and we need real information about what young people can actually earn in different careers.
In the last year there has been a 20 per cent growth in commencements in traditional trades—which is terrific. Also, over the last five years apprenticeships in traditional trades have increased by 2.7 per cent, whereas growth in that part of the labour market has been at 1.5 per cent. Today 147,000 of our 416,000 apprenticeships are in traditional trades and related occupations, which is a 17 per cent increase since this government came to office. 
In the last couple of days we have seen what happens when a Whitlam protege gets into Government House in Tasmania; it beggars belief to imagine what would happen if one got into the Lodge. I have heard a lot in the last day ot two about apprenticeships and training. It is worth remembering what is was like in 1992, when the Labor Party was in power and Paul Keating was Prime Minister of Australia. He was saying,  `There'll be no jobs in the next decade for people pushing brooms'—in other words, `If that's what you're good at, forget it; you're no good.' Under the heading `A national disgrace', the Sunday Herald Sun in June 1992 editorialised the following:
Welcome to the lucky country. University graduates are begging for unpaid jobs just to get experience in the workplace. Sacked apprentices are offering their services for nothing in return for a chance to finish their trade training. Welcome to the lucky country. Youth unemployment is an open sore on the face of Australian society. A desperate father is offering to pay an employer $100 a week for three years to give his son an apprenticeship, yet there's still no taker as teenage unemployment hits 46 per cent in Victoria—for that is what the young have inherited from the worst economic managers ever to sit in the Treasury benches in Canberra.
It obviously forgot the Whitlam government. That is what happens when Australia is not led by people who are stable and focused on doing what is right and best for Australia. If the leadership is unpredictable and erratic, that is the price that is paid. It is paid by the most vulnerable people in this country: kids, especially those from low-income families.
There is another thing that is very important. A lot has been said about TAFE here, but the members opposite have not said a word about the 300 per cent TAFE fee increases in New South Wales, thanks to a Labor government, and the 25 per cent increase in Victoria. What about the full fee degrees at Victorian TAFEs from the Bracks Labor government? Do I hear any opposition to that? None. Hypocrisy knows no ends. For those of you who are driving a social justice truck—and the member for Lyons is genuine in this regard: get on to the member for Grayndler and find out why he has not talked to this bill and ask him why he does not ask a few questions about apprenticeships.

Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Ms Livermore's motion) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—Water is one of the key critical environmental challenges for Australia—indeed, after climate change I think it is the most serious issue—and there have been manifestations of this in recent times. Over in Perth they are now going to proceed with a desalinisation plant costing an estimated $350 million simply because there are no local sources of water to meet that city's water needs. In Adelaide a great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the Murray River, aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaide's drinking water, which if nothing is done, by the year 2020 will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines for two days out of five. In Melbourne, my home city, we are now on stage 2 water restrictions, and in Sydney and many other cities there are very serious water issues as well. The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a very serious challenge facing this country.
The purpose of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. This bill's objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by Commonwealth, state and territory governments; for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements; and for an enforcement regime.
It is estimated that the bill would reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021. I would say that that is an admirable objective which the opposition supports, but in fact it is an inadequate objective. We really need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption much more rapidly than by 2021.
It is also expected that there would be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures. The legislation is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use. It is my understanding that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme and that it has not been opposed. It addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products but, in relation to mandatory performance standards, it only applies to toilets. It is the view of the opposition that the legislation is weaker than it could have been, that the environmental benefits would not be fully realised and that there is a case for standards to apply more broadly. It is our belief that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products. On that basis I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that:
(1)	the Government has failed to deliver water efficiency standards for indoor water use products other than toilets, forgoing a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption even further;
(2)	the Government should be condemned due to the failure of the Measures for a Better Environment package, from which funding has been drawn to finance this Bill, to deliver environmental outcomes; and
(3)	the Howard Government should adopt Labor's Framework for a National Water Policy”.
Having moved that amendment, I turn to some of the aspects of Labor's framework for a national water policy, which seeks to get better water management in urban Australia. We make these observations against the background that Australia is one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australian households each person uses around 350 litres per day, yet our national reuse of effluent is just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse stormwater, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey—household waste—water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and our economy. 
An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve a significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes, such as irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial purposes and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe, treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses besides. A Labor government will be working with the states and territories to improve water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. Federal Labor will be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and waste water reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas.
I would also like to mention the problem of ocean outfalls. Large and growing human populations on the coastal fringe place pressures on coastal ecosystems, particularly through the disposal of sewerage waste in coastal waters. There are over 140 sewage outfalls discharging into the ocean and estuaries within the vicinity of beaches in Australia. Federal Labor will work with state and local water authorities to dramatically reduce the amount of water being discharged via ocean outfalls. We also want to reduce urban water demand. Increasing reuse will reduce the need to build costly water storages, which have been shown to have serious impacts on the ecology of Australian rivers.
We want to use the COAG process not only for urban reuse of water but for implementing voluntary and regulatory initiatives to promote water saving measures such as rainwater tanks, water saving showerheads and tap fittings, dual flush toilets and increased use of grey water. Just yesterday I was talking about water issues to one of the representatives on a delegation of young American political leaders visiting Australia. He made the observation that in Australia he was yet to find a sensor based tap which, when it is not being used, automatically turns off. In the United States these are standard. He said to me that there is pretty much nothing else available in the US. We do have those taps in Australia, but they are by no means as common as they ought to be. They are just one of the water saving measures that we ought to be encouraging and setting standards for in legislation like this.
Another area I want to mention in relation to urban water use is the research effort. The Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. Labor would renew the role of the Commonwealth in research and development in irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research will yield many dividends, including: better design and value from experimental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. Establishing an urban water research program would support innovation in reuse of stormwater, reuse of effluent, water conservation, water sensitive urban design and urban water planning and management practices. Labor would establish a national program of research and coordination of work presently being done to promote sustainable water use in Australia, with a particular focus on water reuse.
There is a very significant challenge facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains supplied water in Australia. That is the second largest share of mains water use after the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors, as you might expect. Per household, the amount of water used for indoor purposes appears to be reasonably similar across many of Australia's larger capital cities. The main indoor use is showering, which accounts for around 29 per cent of indoor consumption, followed by toilet flushing and washing machines—about 26 per cent each. Taps over baths, sinks, hand basins and laundry tubs account for 18 per cent, and dishwashers account for one per cent. In terms of overall domestic consumption, it is worth noting that the amount of water used for outdoor purposes varies considerably between cities, with Perth using five times as much per household as Sydney—although some of the Perth supply comes from bores rather than mains sources. 
Between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas of Australia increased at around 3.4 per cent per annum. According to information from the Water Services Association of Australia, water consumption in two state capitals is already beyond the safe yield level, meaning that additional supply or effective demand measures are required immediately. According to the association, three other capitals will be beyond the safe yield level between 2012 and 2020. That is a very serious situation. It does require action. Back in December 2002, a Senate committee completed an inquiry into Australia's management of urban water, and they commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, saying that there is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies so that water efficient appliances, such as dual-flush toilets, low-flow shower heads, washing machines and dishwashers, can dramatically reduce water use in homes. This can be coupled with water-efficient gardens, the use of native plants, minimal lawns and efficient watering systems.
The committee found that the fundamental factor in a successful demand management program is changing behaviour away from habits such as hosing down driveways and gutters, watering lawns during the heat of the day, and having long showers. The committee also recommended that there be a proposed national water policy and that it should set standards including national water efficiency standards and rating schemes for appliances and building systems. That is something which the opposition endorses, and it is contained within our national water policy framework and in the second reading amendment to this bill that I have moved.
What will be the impact of the labelling scheme which is provided for in the bill? According to modelling undertaken in developing the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling component of the scheme will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021, as compared with the business as usual approach. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were considered: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers will benefit from a net saving because water bills will be lower.
The regulatory impact statement also considered manufacturers and importers—noting that labelling will come into force 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised. Consultations with manufacturers and importers indicate that this notice period will be enough to ensure that products are labelled correctly. As water efficiency labelling has an influence on consumer preference, the extent to which the sales of various manufacturers and importers are affected will depend on the water efficiency of their product ranges; manufacturers and importers that offer only products of low water efficiency will obviously be disadvantaged. Clearly, our view is that that is not a bad thing. Our intention is to improve the water efficiency of the products that they supply. 
Retailers that carry at least some water efficient models should be advantaged. Those that specialise in low-cost products with low water efficiency will disadvantaged. As the awareness of water labels is likely to build up over time, retailers should have ample time to sell their old stocks and order in more water efficient models. The regulatory impact statement also says that the impact of water efficiency labelling on plumbers and builders is likely to be gradual. These groups will still be free to select or recommend products irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and will be able to remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them; however, the labelling requirement should assist those plumbers and builders who take an interest in, or seek competitive advantage from, advising clients on water and energy efficient products. There are already programs under way to raise plumbers' awareness of water product efficiency, including the Green Plumbers program, run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia, which gets some funding from the Greenhouse Office.
It is also worth noting that the introduction of water efficiency labelling for various indoor water use products is expected to have only a modest effect on household consumption, and that effect will take some time to materialise. The requirement for labelling foreshadowed by the bill is a positive step, but it is only one aspect of managing the demand for water by Australian households. In this context, it would certainly be worth while if modelling were done on how the introduction of compulsory water efficiency standards to things like new showerheads and new washing machines would affect household consumption.
Water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is also a substantial challenge to get our water use right in urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we have sustainable practices in our cities and in the country. Against that background, we support this legislation. We do not think it goes far enough. We think the government ought to be acting with a greater sense of urgency. In our second reading amendment we indicate that the government ought to be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor water use products and that it ought to be taking up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption.
 (Mr Mossfield)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 will establish a national scheme for mandatory water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards for certain products. This scheme is the first of its kind in the world. I thank the member for Wills for supporting the bill. The first products to be subject to a determination under the act for mandatory labelling and standards include washing machines, which account for approximately half the water savings; dishwashers and toilets, which account for approximately 22 per cent of water savings; showerheads, which account for approximately 25 per cent of water savings; and taps and urinals. It is estimated that, by 2021, 610,000 megalitres will be saved by this scheme, with a reduction of five per cent of total household water use. Through a reduction in hot water use the scheme is expected to reduce greenhouse gases by 570 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum by 2021 and by a cumulative total of approximately 4,600 kilotonnes by 2021. The scheme is expected to save more than $600 million in electricity bills by 2021. 
The main game of water consumption must focus on agricultural use, which accounts for 70 per cent of water used in Australia. Overall water use is 14 per cent in other industries and eight per cent for urban and household use. Eight per cent is lost in supplying the water. The combination of climate change and increasing population demonstrates the urgent need to address the issue of urban water use. The government wants to empower the consumer by providing them with information on the water efficiency of products through labels on products covered by the scheme and through a web site and promotional material on the scheme.
The scheme provides for working in partnership with the states and territories, which will enact complementary legislation. The scheme is expected to commence in 2005, carrying water efficiency labels on the six appliances already mentioned: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. It is also proposed that toilets will be required to comply with a minimum efficiency standard and that toilets with a flush volume of more than 5½ litres will no longer be sold in Australia.
The water efficiency labelling and standards proposed certainly complement this Year of the Built Environment. The publication Talking water:an Australian guidebook for the 21st century commissioned by the Farmhand Foundation—which I recommend that every Australian read—clearly sets out under `Home truths: our water situation' that Australia is the driest inhabited continent. Although we have five per cent of the world's land area, we have only one per cent of the world's river flows. We store more water per head of population than any country in the world. In Perth, in my home state, only two per cent of the rainfall becomes rivers.
In the publication A State Water Strategy for Western Australia, ambitious but vital long-term targets are set. This publication is a commendable read for all West Australians. The strategy has targets of achieving a 14 per cent reduction in consumption per person per year by 2012 for domestic consumers and establishing 20 per cent reuse of treated wastewater by 2012. The biggest water reuse plant of its type in Australia is being built in Perth to supply key industries in Kwinana, costing approximately $25 million. It has the potential to produce 5,000 megalitres per year. The cost of treating and transporting the water to its point of use will range from 50c to $2 per kilolitre. The strategy's other targets are: to plan a major new water source for the integrated water supply system for the Perth metropolitan area, Pinjarra, Mandurah and the Goldfields, which currently use 305 gigalitres per year; to establish a broad based community eduction campaign focusing on the conservation of water; to utilise the integrated resource planning process to ensure that all water source development includes consideration of, and appropriate investment in, conservation measures; and to require water conservation management plans for large water users before a licence is renewed or a new licence is provided.
The 305 gigalitres of water used in the Perth integrated water supply system comes from an 869 millimetre annual rainfall. For many years our dams have been only 25 per cent full, storing 173 gigalitres, resulting in an increasing harvest of groundwater, particularly the Gnangara water mound north of Perth. I commend the state on its efforts to improve the efficiency of water use by agriculture and horticulture and its work with industry and communities to improve water conservation. There is commitment to a 20 per cent water treatment reuse of waste water by 2012; there are investigations of the possibility of a 45 gigalitre water allocation from the south-west Yarragadee aquifer into the integrated water supply system; and, as was mentioned by the member for Wills, there is the 30 to 45 gigalitre desalination plant facility study, at an estimated cost of $350 million. 
It is of interest to note that desalination can probably be achieved at approximately $2.20 per kilolitre, whereas water from the Ord River Dam pumped to Perth would cost approximately $5.50 per kilolitre. The current cost of Perth water ranges from 40c to $1.47 depending on consumption. It is also interesting to note that annual rainfall in the Kimberley catchment area of the Ord is 789 millimetres—less than Perth's 869 millimetres. The estimated energy consumed to pump water from the Ord to Perth would be 14 kWh per kilolitre, over three times higher than the energy required for seawater desalination, with the associated greenhouse gas emissions as a problem. An Ord River pipeline to supply 300 gigalitres of water to Perth would pipe water over 1,840 kilometres, have to elevate water over 400 metres by pumping and cost at least $10 billion to construct and $100 million per year to operate, with water treatment costs of $120 million for the 300 gigalitres. The Ord River irrigation scheme provides 310 gigalitres for irrigation around Kununurra. There is no `spare water' and the water extracted for Perth would be at the expense of environmental flows.
Desalination using reverse osmosis technology now has superseded distillation, freezing and ion exchange and is used in Bayswater power station in New South Wales and on Kangaroo Island. The problem is the energy requirements and the greenhouse problems. The energy required depends on the salinity and temperature of the feed water, the quality of water produced and the desalination technology used.
I want at this stage to urge all West Australians to check the Waterwise Rebate Program available in WA through the Water Corporation. This program rebates waterwise tap timers, AAA inflow tap regulators, soil wetting agents, grey water reuse systems, AAA rated shower heads, AAAA rated washing machines, rainwater tanks and garden bores. In summary, demand management, waste water reuse and desalination are the best and cheapest options for Perth. The Grand Water Scheme five-point plan consists of: undertaking a national water audit; fixing and rebuilding our rural water infrastructure; developing the world's best irrigation industry; recycling and reuse for towns and cities; and planning and funding the future water grid. These are all discussed in the publication Talking Water.
In the home and garden, water usage is as follows: 35 per cent in the garden, 20 per cent in the toilet, 15 per cent in the laundry and 10 per cent in the kitchen. The water saving options that can be put in place immediately to complement this bill are: (1) have a water wise garden with native plants, mulch and no weeds, and halve your lawn and use infrequent, occasional deep watering to encourage deep roots and drought resistant plants; (2) recycle your grey water from the kitchen, laundry and bathroom; (3) use drip irrigation; (4) install a rainwater tank; (5) fix leaking taps and toilets; (6) flush the toilet for solids, not liquids; (7) cover the pool to reduce evaporation; (8) install tap timers to stop the sprinklers being forgotten; (9) in old toilets put a brick into the cistern to reduce the water used with each flush; (10) do not hose the driveway; (11) rinse the vegetables in the sink and turn the tap off while brushing your teeth. I have not recommended showering together, because Western Australians would probably take longer rather than shorter times if that happened! 
All this, along with the new product labelling in this bill, will lead to more water efficient household appliances and a water sustainable Australia and no doubt will see Australia as a leading exporter of water efficient technologies. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The debate on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a timely opportunity for this House to discuss matters to do with the sustainability of our cities. There can be no greater and more important resource than water, and the way in which we handle it is very important to the way in which we develop truly sustainable cities. It has been my pleasure over the last few months to be involved in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage inquiry into sustainable cities. As we have toured Australia, amongst the numerous issues that have been raised with us the sustainable use of water has been one of the very important ones.
The purpose of this bill, as has been discussed, is to establish a national scheme to apply water efficiency labelling to appliances and to subsequently set minimum water efficiency standards for certain water use and water saving products. As has been discussed in the debate, the initial emphasis of this bill is on the labelling rather than the efficiency standards, and the opposition believes that this is a weakness in the legislation as presented. Having said that, I think that what we have here is an opportunity to discuss matters that are really very important, need ventilation and require that we as a legislature show leadership. One of the most important aspects of sustainability is to get proper understanding throughout the community. I believe that this piece of legislation, the labelling of products, is one way we can achieve this better understanding.
As we go around Australia, there is debate about whether people are switched on to these issues. How important are these issues in people's mind-set when they go forward as consumers to buy products? Slowly but surely we are seeing that people understand their importance. The energy efficiency ratings that you see on white goods are slowly but surely being used by consumers as an element in the decision making involved in making purchases. I believe this type of labelling about water efficiency will add immeasurably to people's understanding of the importance of these decisions.
This bill does not go to the way in which we tackle the issues of retro-fitting. Products that are old technology, that are not as efficient as they should be, are used in housing and commercial premises. But, if we add this step to the purchase of new products, slowly but surely people will explore the way in which they can retrofit. That may be by buying new appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines. It may be that people improve the types of shower heads and the like that they use. It is important that at a governmental level we come together and put in place measures that lead people's understanding of the problems we confront. Major cities are undertaking measures to control the use of water because the dams are insufficient for the way in which the urban sprawl has developed. Throughout the inquiry into sustainable cities we have had a dilemma: people have been saying that the infrastructure that is required is perhaps outstripping the community's ability to supply it. Water infrastructure is one important aspect that has been discussed. We can achieve greater outcomes by the more efficient use of that resource. 
In many developments that we visited throughout Australia we saw subdivisions and housing developments where effort had been put into managing the use and reuse and reclaiming of water. We saw the use of grey water for different purposes, such as for the flushing of toilets. To achieve that, separate pipes and separate infrastructure are required throughout households. That can only occur if we have in place a mind-set where people ask it of their builders, of those designing homes and of those planning subdivisions. Again I stress that that is the importance of this piece of legislation.
Often the appliances with the more efficient energy ratings have a higher cost. Quite rightly in this bill it is assumed from the outset that the more efficient appliances and devices for the use of water may have a premium. But if you analyse the economic life of those appliances, you find that the savings in the reduced use of the resource—whether it be energy or, in this case, water—mean that the appliances pay for themselves. But still there is an economic impediment because of the higher purchase price. These are the important elements to make people aware of in the continuing debate about sustainability. This is not just important to the individual; it is important to the wider community and to the nation. Despite the impediments that our quaint federation put in place which require this Commonwealth legislation to be mirrored by state and territory legislation, we can achieve outcomes in the stewardship of our environment and resources that will enable us to pass on to future generations sustainability of the environment and resource use.
The member for Wills in leading the debate for the opposition has outlined some of our concerns about this bill and about elements of the national water initiative. I want to stress one of those aspects—I see the honourable member for Flinders is in the chamber—and that is the question of ocean outfalls. In the new technologies being developed for sewage treatment, there is so much that can be achieved in the greater reuse of sewage as a resource. The national water initiative in part addresses the need for greater research into water reclamation, recycling and reuse and into the health and safety aspects involved. One of the impediments that we see for communities adopting these new technologies is the great fear about the health and safety aspects of the use of this water because of where it is sourced from. But we can see—and it has been proved in a number of cases—that these are not problems that cannot be surmounted and that these technologies to reuse water can be put in place efficiently.
One of the often intriguing things in the sustainable use of resources such as water is where we place economic triggers. In the development of national water policy and a national water initiative we have to be cognisant that in the past water has been seen as being available in infinite volumes. I do not think that we really understood until recently that we have to be wiser in the way that we use water. One measure that can be implemented to some extent is the price trigger, but for governments at any level that is a very hard decision to make. I do not raise this matter to promote an extended increase in the price of water over and above the way in which we are gradually looking at the issue. But it is an important trigger. It makes people more alert; it makes them more conscious of their use of water.
We have seen those supply and demand issues in capital cities such as Melbourne, where the level of water restrictions is such that people are very conscious about their use of water. They are very conscious when it comes to inefficient and deplorable practices, such as cleaning cement areas and driveways by watering them down. Individuals are looking at ways to make their gardens more water efficient—for instance, by using native plants—and at other measures to decrease the need to use water. 
This legislation is really about the domestic use of water. As has been said, the main indoor domestic use of water is showering, which makes up 29 per cent of domestic use. Flushing toilets and clothes washing make up about 26 per cent each and baths, sinks, hand basins and laundry tubs make up about 18 per cent. These are the areas in which people can be conscious in their day to day lives of the measures they can employ to make a contribution.
We are asking the bulk of the Australian population who live in urban areas to be conscious of the dilemmas that are confronting all of us. Whilst it is true that greater volumes of water are used in rural and agricultural purposes, the people who work in those sectors are being asked to look at the way they can use water more efficiently. Therefore, it is quite right that people in urban settings look at how they can be more water conscious. This has to be a shared responsibility, and I believe that slowly but surely there is an understanding of this shared responsibility at the national level.
As I said, the House environment committee has been inquiring into sustainable cities for all of this year. It is going to be a photo finish between this inquiry being finalised and an election being called. If an election is called before the inquiry has finished deliberating and reported, I hope that whatever the incoming government after the election may be it will ensure that this reference is given back to the House environment committee so this work can be completed. Whether we are talking about the sustainable use of water, land or energy, or the way in which we design our houses, subdivisions or cities, this is an important debate that has been going on at the national level. It is a shared responsibility between state governments, local governments and communities and we can all do our bit in partnership to ensure that these outcomes are achieved.
As this legislation goes forward and builds upon the discussions that have happened at ministerial council level and COAG level and the aspects that arise out of the Senate inquiry, I hope this important debate will continue, because this piece of legislation cannot be the end of our discussions. As I said from the outset, this is one of the rare opportunities this chamber has to debate issues about sustainability that are so important to the future of our nation, cities and communities.
The interesting thing about our inquiry into sustainable cities is that, even in the rural context of townships and small communities, there is great advantage in highlighting the issue of sustainability. By doing that, everybody can think about the way in which they can make a contribution in their daily lives and how they plan their futures; they can understand that we have a responsibility for the stewardship of our resources—in this case, the environment—and also understand how the pursuit of sustainability has economic costs and benefits and social costs and benefits. These are complicated equations.
I believe that the government, in framing this piece of legislation, has recognised these aspects. This is not just about the way in which we try to use a resource such as water more efficiently, by encouraging people to understand the water efficiency of appliances and devices; it is also about looking at the economic consequences and the social consequences. We must look at the social consequences of not using resources sustainably and not living sustainably, because these social consequences are not directly understood. It is important that these discussions take place. 
This legislation is a step in the right direction. It is an element of a rather bigger tapestry—that is, the National Water Initiative—that goes across a whole host of matters that affect different sectors of the community and the nation. It is important that we have this legislation, which gives those initiatives some impetus and gives the community a greater understanding of the importance of these issues.
I hope the government will take on board the opposition's desire to go even further and benchmark the efficiency of other devices and appliances, beyond just the flushing capacity of toilets. If it is all right to set a minimum efficiency standard of an average flush volume of no more than 5½ litres, why don't we look at ways to achieve and set standards for other appliances and devices, such as maximum flow measures for shower heads or maximum volumes used in an average cycle of a dishwasher or washing machine? These things need to be recognised. I also implore the government to continue to look at ways in which we can encourage people to purchase these devices. Unfortunately, like a whole host of things, when there are economic impediments, there is an unequal uptake. Those people in the community who would find it hard to purchase these devices need to be assisted to make these types of wise choices that this type of labelling is trying to encourage.
Whilst I support the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Wills on behalf of the opposition and the three dot points that are included in that amendment—the need to look at water efficiency standards for more types of products, the need to look at measures to fund some of the requirements needed to deliver the types of environmental outcomes we want and the need to encourage the government to look at a number of the items that are in Labor's framework for a national water policy—I give this bill my support. It is an important step towards the way in which we, as a nation, can encourage people as individuals, families and communities to look at the way in which their daily lives affect our ability to act as a sustainable community and to deliver sustainable cities and townships throughout Australia.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—It is a great pleasure to rise to speak on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 in a bipartisan way with my colleagues the member for Scullin and the member for Grey, who are both in the chamber and both speaking to the same issue. I want to start this discussion at the Mornington Peninsula and, in particular, at the Gunnamatta outfall, which is at the southern end of the Mornington Peninsula. At that outfall at Gunnamatta Beach, 150 billion litres of secondary treated sewage flows out to sea every year, only 20 metres from the shoreline, at a rate of 420 million litres a day.
This has three important consequences. Firstly, there is an obvious environmental effect. Secondly, at what is one of Australia's great surf beaches, there is a clear health risk, which has been verified through recurrent anecdotal evidence from numerous surfers, swimmers and users of that beach. Thirdly—and this brings me particularly to the water efficiency questions outlined in this bill—there is an outright waste of water. That is water which we have captured and have in the system but which we throw out to sea rather than reusing.
In this speech, I want to do two things: I want to address the question of Australia's national water infrastructure and I want to address the question of water efficiency. In looking at the question of water infrastructure, I want to make three points. The first is about the need for closure at Gunnamatta and reuse of all of the water which goes out of there. The second is about a proposal about which I am passionate—the need for a national ocean outfall strategy, aimed at ending all outfalls in Australia by 2025. That is a generational goal but an achievable one. The third point is about creating the means to do that through the establishment of a national water trust. 
I return to Gunnamatta and the question of water infrastructure. My position, and the position of residents throughout the Mornington Peninsula, is very clear: the Gunnamatta outfall should be closed. A date should be set for its closure. The state opposition in Victoria has set a date of 2015. I have committed to work towards that date for closure, and there is a means to do so. Now we seek commitment from the state as well. I hope we can have a bipartisan commitment on exactly that plan.
The question then is: how do we achieve the water's reuse? This would be a fascinating water efficiency and water reuse model for Australia and, in conjunction with the Clean Ocean Foundation and the infrastructure engineer Mr John Lawson, we have developed a proposal that sets out how it would work. The proposal involves transporting up to 110 gigalitres of water a year from the eastern treatment plant, which firstly has to have its upgrade, through largely existing pipes—with some gaps to be filled in—to the Latrobe Valley, where it can be used for pulp, paper and power production. There is an existing consumption of 110 billion litres of water a year there, and that water currently comes from the Thompson-Latrobe-Gippsland system—110 billion litres of water is drawn out of those rivers each year for that. We can keep the fresh water in the rivers and use the recycled water for those industrial purposes, which are going ahead in any event. These existing fresh water users need no longer draw on our precious river water; they could be using the water which is currently wasted and disappears out at Gunnamatta.
I welcome the fact that the state have committed to examining the feasibility of this. My understanding is that they have taken this proposal, which we put on the table in a meeting with the Deputy Premier last year, sufficiently seriously to take the managing director of Melbourne Water off line and place him directly in charge of this project. So the pipeline from the eastern treatment plant to Latrobe Valley is a real proposal. It will cost money, but I believe that it is feasible and that it will be a national model.
At the national level, I am proposing that Australia needs a national ocean outfall strategy with, as its bottom line commitment, an end to the annual dumping of 1,500 gigalitres of sewage at 142 outfalls around Australia. That amount of sewage is being dumped off our coasts, onto our beaches and into our coastal waters each year. For over two years I have been proposing a national ocean outfall strategy to end that. I believe we need to set the target of ending all ocean outfalls by 2025 and we need to work towards that goal. We need to do that through the process of recycling and reusing our water—not for the drinking system but for agriculture and industry. Agriculture and industry consume far more water than the urban areas of Australia do. So that option is a tremendous national goal. Once again, I repeat to the House that I am committed to the idea of ending all ocean outfalls in Australia by 2025 and to working, as I have with colleagues from this side of the House—in particular, the member for Grey—towards the goal of a national ocean outfall strategy.
So how do we do this? This brings me to my third point. The mechanism for achieving this outcome, I believe, is the creation of a national water trust. I believe that a national water trust could help to achieve (a) the financial backing and (b) the process of intergovernmental cooperation and commitment towards a 20-year plan. How do you establish a national water trust? I have previously argued in this House that the basis for that should be a capital transfer from the Commonwealth—we have to play our part—into a national water trust. One of the possible sources that has been identified is a percentage of five or 10 per cent of the proceeds which would come from the sale of the third part of Telstra. That is one option, and it is a serious option. It is an option that I have presented consistently in this forum and in other fora. 
That capital would lay the foundation. If there were an amount of $1 billion paid out at the equivalent of 10 per cent per year—but because of interest it will last for approximately 20 years—the total amount paid out would be double the initial capital, allowing for a 20-year depreciation. If you make it contingent on matching state funds—given that most would be spent in any event—that gives a total value of about $4 billion for a $1 billion commitment. Or if, as has been argued by some, there is a 10 per cent take from the sale of Telstra part three, that would provide a $3 billion capital trust for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work on Australia's water infrastructure.
The water trust should apply to two things. It should apply to work on our rivers across all states and it should apply to our national urban water infrastructure. I welcome the statement that the Prime Minister made in Adelaide only a few weeks ago that national urban water reform will be one of the government's major priorities on the environmental and infrastructure side going forward. So how would the water trust work? I am proposing that the national water trust would effectively work through three phases—each of which would be seven, seven and six years respectively.
In the first phase we would identify projects of a seven-year duration in each state. We would apply to the national water trust for a commitment that would be paid out over those seven years towards reforming our treatment systems, our piping systems and our reuse systems—aimed at ending the waste of 1,500 billion litres of water nationally per year, the environmental impacts and the health impacts. These are feasible things. Why? Because this is done around the world. In Europe it is standard practice to reuse and recycle grey water. In many other parts of the world it is standard practice. In fact, their water systems would not survive unless they were reusing for agricultural and industrial purposes that water which they capture, own and which is already within the system.
So, in that context, I believe that it is feasible, it is possible and it is aspirational to establish a commitment to close the Gunnamatta outfall by 2015, a commitment to work towards a national ocean outfall strategy which ends all ocean outfalls by 2025 and a commitment to establish a national water trust as the means for so doing. I believe that a national water trust, managed by the Commonwealth but with the cooperation of and in conjunction with the states—in the same way that the Murray Darling Basin Commission has been a tremendous success—can work towards upgrading our urban water systems, ensuring that the water is not wasted and addressing significant projects, such as the problem of stormwater, which has not been adequately addressed in any of the states. So we have a gap, we have a proposal and we have, I believe, a solution. I am committed to working towards this for as long as it takes to achieve any of those outcomes. 
The second great part of this debate is about the question of how we personally use our water—water efficiency. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 sets out a series of mechanisms which together will have an impact over the coming years by saving billions and billions of litres of water. By 2021, 610 billion litres of water will be saved under the efficiencies set out in this bill. In particular, the bill is about labelling the efficiency of washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, urinals and taps—all those elements of basic domestic water use which are part of our lives and which we have taken for granted. The bill sets out a series of steps on that front. I commend those steps and I commend the bill.
In summary, my position is clear. I believe that Australia needs a national ocean outfall strategy. I am committed to that strategy and to the generational goal of working towards the ending of all ocean outfalls and the recycling of all domestic water by 2025. Secondly, as a prime case under that, I am committed to working towards the closure of the Gunnamatta outfall by 2015. Thirdly, I believe that the mechanism to achieve this is a national water trust. It is something I am passionate about and something I know that many of my fellow colleagues are also passionate about.
This is something that can be achieved. It can be a great legacy, not for us but for future generations. We can create for them the same sort of progress that previous generations created for us, with the very establishment of our piping and water systems. The challenge for us today, in the Australia of the early 21st century, is to lay out for the Australia of the mid-21st century, a water system which protects our water, reuses our water and, above all else, protects and enhances our coasts.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—In speaking to the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004, I note that it is the first such bill in the world, and I compliment this government on that initiative. There are many problems with water and if ever a commodity or a resource was taken for granted, it is the resource that we call water. Some of the problems and issues described in this debate include: imperfect cost reflectiveness in water pricing; low public awareness of water and waste water prices; the widespread practice of central metering; poor information on the relative significance of end users and on the water efficiency of different models; and the incentive for developers in commercial and residential property to minimise capital costs rather than lifetime operating costs.
This legislation specifically deals with labelling and better information for consumers, particularly the urban consumer. We know that about 75 per cent of mains supplied water is used in agriculture. We know that 16 per cent is used in household water—about 35 per cent is going on the garden—and about four per cent is going to the commercial sector. We have seen a 13 per cent increase in water usage. The aim is to achieve five per cent less water usage by 2021. When you look at that sort of collective saving, it is about 610,000 megalitres by 2021, and that will be more water than is actually in Sydney Harbour.
We know a lot more about water now than we ever have. Can I just share this comparison with the House. Water is priced at about a dollar a kilolitre—that is, 1,000 litres will cost a dollar. We know that for a well-known soft drink, it would cost $1,000 for the same volume. So we value a litre of soft drink at about a thousand times a litre of water. That might just give a little idea of the culture of Australia and the Western world concerning water usage. Of course, within the Western world we do have good, clean reliable water which is of great value to us, compared to much of the rest of the world. So a well-known soft drink is valued at 1,000 times the value of a glass of water from the tap. 
Australia's history has all sorts of hallmarks in terms of water. I will go to a couple of the more famous ones. Perhaps there is none more famous than C.Y. O'Connor and the Mundaring weir. I apologise to the Western Australians, if I have that reservoir wrong.
—So far, so good.
—Thank you. I believe the Mundaring-Kalgoorlie pipeline was built by C.Y. O'Connor. There is a tragic and interesting story there about how the water got there and how the project impacted on O'Connor's life. I will quote from my own electorate. The Morgan-Whyalla pipeline was built in the 1940s, and it involves about 350 kilometres of pipe. We also have Port Lincoln, Wudinna, Kimba, Whyalla, Coober Pedy, where we have desalination, Eyre Peninsula, where we rely on underground basins, and the Polda and Uley Wanilla basins.
This bill speaks to the urban situation. I want to remind the House that you do not survive anywhere in this country without water—whether it is urban, regional, rural or remote areas. And they all have differing needs. I mentioned the infrastructure that has gone in over the last 100 to 150 years. If I could quickly refer to Port Lincoln and the project there. It is worth $1.8 million and the funds were provided from the Clean Seas Program under the Natural Heritage Trust, an initiative of the Howard government. The project involved making far better use of the waste water from Port Lincoln and protecting the ocean outflow and the aquaculture industry—a vital industry in that part of the world.
I have a little anecdote from the township of Wudinna. They had a water crisis meeting there a year or two ago and the sprinkler was watering the lawn. The local council chairman felt a bit guilty about this. Then he remembered that the watering was only occurring because of their initiative to supply their own local water. They had prepared for such dry times, and so he felt a little less guilty about watering the lawn. In other words, the ability to do much more for ourselves is very important, and that is at the core of this legislation. There they were on the Eyre Peninsula at a meeting on the water crisis. They were reliant on the central SA Water pipe system but the Wudinna community had taken the initiative itself. With local money and some help from the Commonwealth, they had taken the initiative to provide their own water to a very large degree.
The national culture has become used to this evolution in the use of water. It has been occurring for over 200 years since European settlement. So the whole issue around water pricing, water usage and how we do it in the future is vital to how successful we are in changing the culture. The members for Moore, Scullin and Flinders have given excellent contributions, following on from the second reading speech of the member for Goldstein, the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage. This has given us the spark to think about what we need to do in the future. COAG has been mentioned. Can I also mention the Murray-Darling Basin and the need to strike the balance between urban and rural and remote. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission is an iconic organisation doing great work—and all the best to Wendy Craik as she takes over as executive officer at the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in the weeks ahead.
But the main issue is the distribution of water. There is much focus on it. There are many resources going to this wonderful resource and the need for improvement. But we cannot overlook the 80 or 90 per cent of the landmass of the rest of Australia. Whether it is water harvesting, whether it is the humble tank containing water coming from the roofs of houses or sheds; whatever it is, the Commonwealth needs to consider the partnership that the member for Flinders spoke about in terms of making sure that every Australian is considered in this debate. 
In conclusion, I remind the House, this government and the opposition, that it is not just a state and territory responsibility in terms of rural and remote, it is very much part of the national culture. The federal government needs to be very aware of the need to distribute the water resources of this great nation in a very fair way and not be too preoccupied, as important as it is, with issues like the Murray-Darling Basin. In conclusion, the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is an excellent initiative. It is the first in the world. Congratulations to Dr Kemp and to our executive for bringing it forward. I am sure it will serve Australia well. But this is only the beginning, and we have much more to do.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-11,"—As the government itself acknowledged in this place on 24 June, managing Australia's fresh water resources effectively and efficiently is one of the most important environmental and resource management challenges. The government has further acknowledged:
The long-term health of our fresh water ecosystems also depends on us minimising the negative impacts of agricultural and urban water consumption.
Although the government is keen to be seen to be doing something about the water crisis in this country—and this is an important step, and so I support the final comments of the previous speaker—what it has proposed falls short of the initiatives and leadership required to address this crucial issue. As the previous speaker said, there is a lot more yet to be done.
To genuinely address the water crisis, Australia needs more than the initiatives proposed in this legislation. A national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme, as proposed by the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004, will require water efficiency labels to appear on a range of common water-using products like washing machines, dishwashers and toilets. Establishing a regime for the setting of minimum water efficiency standards is a great start, but these initiatives do not go far enough. As the government acknowledges, these initiatives are focused at the household water use level. However, at just under 1,800 gigalitres per year—that is, 1,800 billion litres per year—household water use accounts for about 16 per cent of the consumption of the main supply of water in Australia. This is only the second largest share of mains water use. Agriculture, at around 8,400 gigalitres per year, accounts for around 75 per cent of consumption. That is 75 per cent versus 16 per cent; thus domestic water use comes a distant second to agricultural usage. This is clearly where initiatives regarding water use must be focused. This bill says nothing of how the federal government has been and will be addressing the key aspect of water use in the country by the agricultural sector. This is another missed opportunity.
However, in regard to the legislation before us, the purpose of the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is, as I said, to establish a water efficiency scheme for a range of important water-using products. Through the scheme, the government wants to empower consumers by providing them with information about the water efficiency of products so that they can contribute to water conservation directly through the purchase of more water efficient products. This information will predominantly come in the form of labels on products covered by the scheme, but will also come from the associated web site and promotional material. This is an important initiative which will no doubt address issues of water use in urban areas to a certain extent; and, as I said, the government must be commended on its action in this area. 
But so much more must be done as Australia, and indeed the world, is facing a water crisis which deserves more substantial attention. A water efficiency labelling scheme is only one small part of the jigsaw. In my seat of Cunningham, in Wollongong in the Illawarra, we have been graced with ample water supplies, with plenty of fresh water available in the dams associated with the Illawarra catchment area. We are a bit spoilt, but we only need to look around us or at the TV on any day to see that there is drought throughout this country—there are even drought conditions in the Sydney basin and water restrictions are in place. That is due to weather effects and to increasing usage of water. We are all going to have to think very hard about how we use water in the future.
Through the scheme proposed in this bill, the government wants to empower consumers by providing them with information about the water efficiency of products so that they can contribute to water conservation directly through the purchase of more water efficient products. This information will, primarily, as I said, come in the form of labels. So much more needs to be done, and a water efficiency labelling scheme is only one small part of the jigsaw in regard to the government's initiatives in this area, although at this point it appears to be a substantial part of the government's program.
The House of Representatives Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which was dealing with the issue of water in this country, released its report at the end of June. The committee said that urgent research into sustainable use of fresh water sources is needed, along with a new federal ministerial portfolio to oversee it. The report also suggested the need for a national policy on recycling and reuse of stormwater and treated effluent, and the mandatory installation of rainwater tanks, subject to suitable health codes being in place. CSIRO modelling shows that a 10,000-litre rainwater tank in a typical Sydney house would reduce imported water demand by 48 per cent and stormwater run-off by 35 per cent.
On the subject of water tanks, I was impressed to read about a water saving device called RainBank, which is being developed in Australia by Davey Pumps. RainBank can reduce household demand for mains water by up to 40 per cent. RainBank automatically switches the water source from the domestic mains to rainwater in a household tank when a toilet is flushed or a washing machine is used. The product won the Savewater! Award in 2004 and is an Australian innovation which could make a substantial contribution towards addressing our urban water use. This product is a remarkable piece of technology that the government should be championing nationwide. If the government is genuine about domestic water use and bringing down some of the usage rates, what about more actively promoting the use of these products and subsidising their development, and what about accepting the recommendations of the committee and making rainwater tanks a mandatory requirement?
There is so much more that can be done. Sadly, the government is missing an excellent opportunity to more proactively address the water usage crisis that is currently facing this nation. Our use of all our resources needs to become more sustainable, and we need some leadership from the government in this area. The crisis facing the Murray-Darling is an excellent example of where greater government action is required. 
The water crisis in Australia has generally been well documented. It was reported around the world at the start of last month that Australia will suffer from severe water shortages and more wild weather if we fail to cut our greenhouse gas emissions. This is another issue that is affecting the water crisis currently facing this country and that this government is failing to adequately address. A report by the Australian Climate Group says that an increase in the average temperature of just one or two degrees Celsius could devastate farmland. It says the solution is to cut greenhouse gases by 60 per cent by 2050.
Australia, which has one of the world's highest gas emissions on a per capita basis, has not ratified the Kyoto protocol on climate change. The Australian Climate Group—an alliance of conservationists, scientists and economists—sees this vast continent becoming a land increasingly at the mercy of natural disasters such as floods, droughts and cyclones. Its report claims that an increase of just a few degrees in the average temperature could trigger serious economic losses. There are fears that other drought-prone regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of Africa, could suffer similar problems if emissions remain unchecked. The study insists that water shortages in Australia are clearly linked to global warming. Australia's plans to confront these challenges are described as `unacceptable'.
This government is failing to realise that increasing numbers of Australians are profoundly concerned about the impacts of climate change and the water crisis facing this nation. It is not just out in the country, where they are facing drought; it is in urban areas, it is in city areas, and it is in areas such as my own electorate of Cunningham on the coast of New South Wales.
In this context, slapping labels on products to aid consumers with purchasing products and thinking that this is addressing the big issue simply will not do. It is a great step, but it is just not enough. More action is required on the part of the government to address the underlying causes of the water crisis and to see themselves as part of the global community which has global responsibilities in regard to water usage and climate change.
The looming global water crisis has been well documented. As the world population continues to increase, water scarcity will affect two out of every three people by 2025, according to the United Nations' own estimates. In the 20th century, demand for fresh water grew twice as fast as the population. This imbalance is largely due to industrial agriculture, but it is also a product of unequal development in standards of living versus sound water management.
Additionally, scientists at Harvard University point out that global warming could significantly harm water availability. A warmer atmosphere could lead to higher rates of evaporation, causing droughts and more severe weather. Faster run-off rates and slower infiltration of ground water could follow. Warmer water may also promote detrimental algal and microbial blooms, which may lead to more water-borne illnesses. And, ironically, as the climate heats up, people will want to use more water for drinking, bathing, and watering.
The former Vice President of the World Bank, no less, has said, `The next world war will be over water.' Already, some competition is beginning to build between and within nations over finite water resources. Egypt has watched warily as Ethiopia has built hundreds of dams on the Nile. Syria and Iraq have squabbled over water projects with Turkey, and some of Israel's many conflicts with Jordan and the Palestinians have been over water issues. I know there are also concerns about China's damming efforts in areas such as Tibet, which is at the headwaters of some of the major rivers that flow into South-East Asia and the Indian peninsula as well. 
Certain regions of the United States, including the Colorado and Rio Grande river basins, also suffer ominous shortages. Much of the American West's integral agricultural, livestock, and recreation industries have been seriously threatened by water scarcity, and the region has endured catastrophic wildfire seasons. At the same time, sprawling development is threatening critical watershed areas throughout the world. Elizabeth Ainsley Campbell, Executive Director of the Nashua River Watershed Association, warns:
Unless we become more proactive in planning for growth and setting aside open space, our drinking water will be increasingly vulnerable to pollution from fertilizers, insecticides, fuel by-products, and other chemicals associated with commercial and residential development.
In my electorate of Cunningham and around Sydney, I think we are really facing those issues as well. We need to ensure that catchments and the areas where we build our dams and where we have our water supplies are protected. It is not just the area around the river or around the dam; the whole catchment needs to be protected so that our water supplies are clean and usable.
Ground water is similarly under siege. Overpumping and rising sea levels have resulted in falling and saltwater-invaded watertables. Initial remediation of the 300,000 contaminated ground water sites in the US, for example, will cost up to $1 trillion over the next 30 years, according to the National Research Council.
Water scarcity is also a serious threat to natural ecosystems. In the United States, for example, 37 per cent of freshwater fish are at risk of extinction, 51 per cent of crayfish and 40 per cent of amphibians are imperilled or vulnerable and 67 per cent of freshwater mussels are extinct or vulnerable to extinction. We know that things such as freshwater mussels are a good sign of how healthy our waterways are.
In Australia, the statistics are also disturbing. Australia uses more water per head than any other nation in the world, and we live on the second-driest continent in the world. Governments, especially in New South Wales, have given irrigators more water than the system can stand, shrinking river flows, bringing salt to the surfaces of land and water, and starving native fish of the chance to breed. Scientists predict that, by 2020, Adelaide's drinking water will be below World Health Organisation safety levels on two days out of five. Don Henry, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, points out that CSIRO modelling predicts that global warming will cut future rainfall in southern Australia by up to 20 per cent.
Some of the possible solutions include ending broad-scale land clearing of native vegetation, restoring environmental flows to stressed rivers and requiring farmers and ultimately consumers to pay the full costs of water used. This is an opportunity to put our world-beating irrigation technology to work in saving water that is now wasted. This is an opportunity for this government to show leadership in driving some of these reforms.
Sadly, though this legislation is very welcome, it falls short of the reforms and leadership required of this government on this crucial issue. As the Bulletin reported almost two years ago to the day, sustainability expert Dr Nicholas Fleming said:
A lack of foresight, courage and political will are the major existing barriers to improving the sustainability of urban water systems. The most effective and enduring solutions require a multi-disciplinary and holistic approach to living within the capacity of natural systems. 
Two years have passed since that time, and the government has known that action has been needed on this issue, but it has failed to demonstrate the much needed foresight, courage and political will. Future generations will sadly pay the price for this failure. That is the point here: hard decisions are going to have to be made by governments, and some of those decisions are going to impact upon the profits of individuals around this country. But, for the greater good, those decisions have to be made to ensure that we have efficient and effective clean water supplies into the future. One of the core issues of living in this country is water, and it is going to be a difficult issue for governments in the future. As I said, I welcome this initiative, but I think a lot more needs to be done.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Forrest, John, MP",NATS,2004-08-11,"—I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak to and support the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004. In response to the member for Cunningham, I think nobody is pretending that this small measure is a panacea. I agree with him: an enormous amount needs to be done from here on in. But I dispute his claim that this government has not shown leadership on the issue of water. I will take the opportunity in my contribution to refute that.
Water is the nation's most precious resource, as other members have said, but it is also the one which is under the most threat. As a continent we are blessed to have an enormous amount of natural resources and an enormous amount of resources in the people who have come to this land and developed it, creating the prosperous economy that we have. But, if we ever hope to grow, we have to find a way to address the profligate way in which Australians use water. I have spoken many times in this chamber on the issue of water. Some of my colleagues often say to me, `Do you talk about anything else?' I guess that comes as a result of my background as an engineer. It was one of the prime incentives for me to come to this place.
I was impressed with the member for Flinders, who argued that we need a national water trust. He will have my full support on that concept, but I suggest that we have already made an important start. I am proud of the fact that it is a federal coalition government that has finally shown some leadership in respect of addressing the nation's water problems. Time and time again, before my time in the parliament, section 100 of the Constitution, which says that water is the states' responsibility, has been used as the excuse for the Commonwealth keeping out of providing a leadership role on the issue. Despite that, we have had some excellent initiatives in which the Commonwealth has been involved.
The member for Grey mentioned the Murray-Darling Basin and the fact that we now have a formal commission which is governed and ruled by a ministerial council of all the state ministers for water, including the chairmanship of the Commonwealth. It is an excellent model upon which to build a directive in relation to the idea of the member for Flinders of a national water trust. We are now on our way to fulfilling the member for Grey's wish that the focus move on further than just the Murray-Darling Basin. I refer to the announcement of a national water initiative that goes beyond the Darling and Murray rivers and the stress that is occurring to those important national rivers; it includes the whole of the nation. I understand that Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have now submitted projects and initiatives in an attempt to provide the capital to meet that need and to save such a precious resource. 
In reference to this bill, I am interested in information that has been supplied by the Parliamentary Library. As someone who represents a large irrigating constituency, I am making this reference because of the constant insinuation that, as irrigators are the largest users of water, that is where the entire focus should be. Yes, of course that is necessary; and yes, of course initiatives are already under way, which I will be referring to later. But I think the challenge for the nation also includes all those water users in urban, metropolitan, provincial and rural city environments.
Whilst the initiative in this bill is a small thing, I think it is a very important and significant thing. When you buy a motor car today, it is a requirement that its environmental credentials, particularly its petrol consumption by standard tests, are indicated—and you will see a yellow square on the windscreen of motor cars, if you are fortunate enough to have the funds to purchase one. We have seen the initiatives of energy ratings on electrical whitegoods. With that model and concept in mind, it is of great credit to the member for Goldstein, who, as the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, pushed this issue and secured commitments from the states that they would introduce the necessary complementary legislation in their state legislatures to ensure that we get a similar label, not just for whitegoods such as washing machines and dishwashers but for all fixtures associated with the use of water—shower rosettes, taps and all the others. This will become a marketing advantage for manufacturers of those various goods, because all Australians are currently very interested in the issue of water.
Eighty per cent of the Australian population—roughly 16 million Australians, most of them in the southern part of the continent—have some level of water restriction. The issue is very much on their minds as they ensure those restrictions and are subject to the inconvenience. It is a message that this drought that has been occurring for the last 25 years, and is still occurring, has sent to the nation. It is almost a wake-up call. I am delighted to support this bill. Because it is about water, it gives members the opportunity to talk about initiatives in our own constituencies that can offer enormous savings.
I am very positive about the future direction the national water initiative is taking with the leadership of the Commonwealth in partnership with the states to address many of the issues that I believe the member for Cunningham, in his sincerity, was addressing. Yes, there are far too many inefficient irrigation distribution schemes around the nation. I know that the parliamentary secretary at the table representing that great wealth-producing region of Shepparton would share this view. Mine is associated with the Murray River from Tresco and Cohuna in the east and all the way to Mildura in the west. Many of the delivery schemes there are old soldier settlement supply schemes. Some of them are over 100 years old. Yes, they deserve upgrading so that they are efficient water delivery systems. I am positive, now that the momentum has commenced with the Commonwealth showing a lead through the national water initiative, that the next decade is going to be positive for those constituencies out there that have argued for a long time for genuine partnerships. These are very costly initiatives and beyond the capacity necessarily of states, and I rejoice that the Commonwealth is now looking at the opportunities for partnership and is very focused on discussion on this very important water resource.
I referred to the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline project in the grievance debate on Monday. I am pleased that the member for O'Connor is in the chamber because we know he is a great champion of piping inefficient water supply schemes. In fact, in the grievance debate, I gave him credit for visiting my constituency back in 1991. He delivered $110,000 for the first stage of a feasibility study on how the rest of the piping of the Wimmera-Mallee could be undertaken. It is a delight now, after three or four years, to have the Commonwealth investing in two further stages of the piping of the Wimmera-Mallee to the extent that now over a third of it is done. This is the largest open channel system in the world. I have made many references to that in the past and we can now boast, after eight years of coalition government in partnership with the state, that 33 per cent of it is now completed and that there is a plan in place to complete the rest of it. When it is finished it will be the largest pipe system in the world, and I will be very proud to represent Mallee when it is finished. 
It is very disappointing to be on the receiving end of the unfortunate politicisation that has occurred on this project. I put some faith in the commitments that the member for Goldstein received that the states will do their part in respect of this legislation. I hope the way they behaved on the Wimmera Mallee is not an example they will follow on this legislation. The Commonwealth has constantly been told it has no interest in this project, which is a disgraceful claim given that $33 million of Commonwealth capital has already been provided to keep the momentum going. The Commonwealth provided leadership in respect to the preparation of the first feasibility study. It waited for the states to match that cost, which they duly did, with an announcement from the Treasurer of Victoria some three or four months afterwards. I did not run around playing some cheap game and making a hero of myself. I waited for the due process of the state Treasury to find a proper way to appropriate that amount.
In a similar way, after that feasibility study, the state government recommended that a detailed design be undertaken to get a better estimate of what the cost would be. The Commonwealth quite readily said: `Here's $3½ million. Get that detail done. We very interested in this project. Please ensure that the cost estimate is accurate and much more detailed so that the public can be consulted in respect to where the pipes are going, whose properties are going to be affected and so forth.' Further to that, the Commonwealth said, `Here's another $4 million to do two more stages, so you can keep the momentum of this important water conservation project going.' We waited 18 months for the state to match that amount, but we did not run around playing a cheap game and making heroes of ourselves. The project is far too important for that.
In the community's interest, we waited for proper process. The Commonwealth has now had an indication from Victoria that they would like us to match another contribution of $125 million to keep the momentum of the project going. It is so important to Victoria, and certainly vitally important to the whole of western Victoria, where huge amounts of water become available for the environmental needs of the Glenelg River, which runs to the south through the member for Wannon's constituency. That is just one project. Other members have put their own projects forward.
I certainly support the member for Flinders and his desire for a much more responsible approach to be taken in the use of grey water. I have been very fortunate in my time, in my former life, to visit water projects around the world. It amazes me that on our continent of Australia—the second most arid of all—we have been somewhat profligate compared to what is done in countries like Israel, China and the very arid Middle Eastern countries, for example. So after 10 years in this place, I am delighted that water is very much on the national agenda. I am a little saddened that it has taken the worst drought in 100 years to achieve that focus, but they do say that good things can come from bad things. I will be looking forward to supporting in the future those initiatives that continue to urge the Australian populace to be much more conservation conscious in the use of this most precious resource. 
In conclusion, I think this particular bill has an additional attraction for people who are not normally mindful of the preciousness of this resource, busy people in employment and looking after their families—each time they consider the purchase of new whitegoods, such as a washing machine or dishwasher, they will have the advantage of a label complying with certain standards about the item's capacity to deliver water conservation standards. In that respect, I think we lead the world, and I will be very surprised if the rest of the world does not follow. It is the general story of the Australian journey: we lead the world in good suggestions. I am delighted to stand and support the bill. I congratulate all those responsible for bringing it to the House, and I look forward to the cooperation it is going to receive from all the state and territory governments around the nation.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—Australia is recognised internationally as the driest populated continent in the world. There is one continent that is drier and that is Antarctica. In other words, there is no doubt that, amongst all the resources that Australia has, water represents the one that could more than any other constrict our growth and our economic performance. I consequently welcome the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004, which moves in a particular direction in an attempt to improve—in the words of the bill—efficiency in the way that we consume water.
In this place we always seem to get stuck on populism and minutiae. I note that the second reading amendment proposed by the Labor Party says that we should have said more about household use. It is a bit like the household use of energy. Residential consumers in Australia use 13 per cent of the energy consumed throughout our nation and the transport sector uses 40 per cent. If you add all the wheels that turn in agriculture and mining, probably 50 per cent of the energy consumed in Australia goes around in wheels. Yet we keep talking about power stations. Those sorts of issues, in my mind, are fundamental to this debate.
In the life of this parliament, notwithstanding the shortage of this resource, the facts have shown that we are in a cyclical drought situation. That is not some modern occurrence. Statistics show that, in 200 years of European occupation of this nation, 40 years have been recorded as droughts. The South American continent was virtually depopulated at one stage due to drought, and we go there today and see its huge water resources. These things are cyclical. But in a period of massive reduction in available rainfall to deliver water to our communities, what have we been doing? We decided to reopen a trench called the Snowy River and ship a great quantity of good freshwater to the ocean. Why was that done? Because an Independent candidate won a seat in Victoria, in the very populist process involved, and a fella called Bracks needed his vote to form a government. You would get a lot of drinks out of that fella Ingram sitting in the parliament. You would get a lot of industry out of that water that flows down the Snowy to no great effect.
—It hasn't happened yet.
—They have been pouring it out; I have seen a picture. But it is not getting anywhere. It is water that was desperately needed in other parts of Australia for good economic purpose. Both sides of this parliament were running around thinking that there were a few votes in it and that it was good policy. And a particular individual became Premier as a result of getting that Independent to side with him. 
We are frequently told by responsible scientists that there are 22 ways of addressing the perceived problems of the Murray-Darling system. I use the word `perceived' advisedly because I think that if we revisited the history of that river we would see that on many thousands of occasions there was a lot less water in it than there is at this moment. What is the only one of those 22 issues that the politicians of Australia are prepared to address? Running more water into the ocean. We do not have enough, but all people want to talk about is putting more of it into the sea. The fish might be impressed with that, but I am not sure that it is doing much good for Australia.
They are the first two factors. Why are we coming along with the minutiae when in fact we have policies that are approved on both sides of this House? The Labor Party, who want to talk about the minutiae at your kitchen sink, are also arguing for greater quantities of fresh water—this wonderful and very scarce resource—to flow to the ocean because they think there are some votes in it. In this place we ought to have the guts to stand up to those people who make silly propositions like: `Close your economy down for the purpose of some sort of ecological benefit which is hard to measure.' I find it outstanding.
I picked up the Financial Review the other day and saw an article extracted from the Wall Street Journal that said how proud green activists were to have stopped the gigantic hardware chain in America called the Home Depot from selling sawn native timber. Yet nobody seems to make the connection with the blinding out of Malaysia by the smoke of slash and burn agricultural activity in Sumatra, Indonesia, and why it is happening. Everybody up there will tell you: `You won't buy our sawn timber, so we will permanently wipe out a forest and replace it with palm oil so that McDonald's can cook their chips.' And nobody parades up and down in front of McDonald's. There has never been a forest destroyed by the simple act of cutting down some trees, but one is destroyed when you replace entirely the flora involved, be it with soya beans in Brazil, or cattle grazing, or slash and burn and palm oil plantations in Indonesia. If people wanted to set out to destroy forests, they would have picketed the Home Depot, because these are the circumstances that arise.
We have a similar situation with water. To suggest for a moment that you might build another dam in some prospective location is like suggesting that you might build a nuclear power station in the middle of Sydney. We are not allowed to build water storages anymore—and we talk about water efficiency! At the Liberal Party conference in Western Australia the other day, I was appreciative to hear the state leader say he would govern by commonsense. Isn't it about time we did that?
Those are just the fundamentals. But all of a sudden we have a new initiative. It is all right to close down the economy and deny future generations proper economic income, provided you pay the incumbent for what you steal. This is done on specious grounds. It is called compensation. I am pleased to see the member for Kingston come in. He represents a seat in Adelaide, in South Australia—the last state in Australia to introduce water restrictions, yet the most deficient in water storage. 
The reality is that we will not build dams and we want to run rivers to the sea that have never run to the sea continuously. We want to do these things and here we are debating whether or not we can have some water efficiency. Of course we should have water efficiency. Nobody knows better than I do how that is supplied in the irrigation sector. I lived in a small country town called Carnarvon back in the 1960s where they pumped water out of a dry riverbed and used it most inefficiently. The government came along, quite properly, and said, `We are going to put meters on your bores.' Immediately, a couple of young farmers—a couple of young horticultural operators—flew to Israel and came back with the first drip irrigation. When South Australia was still whingeing about water supply, people in Western Australia went to Israel and came back with highly efficient irrigation initiatives yet to be discovered anywhere else. I have been around and I have seen that some areas have not picked them up yet.
Yes, water efficiency is a great idea, but water conservation means storing it, keeping it for the purposes of future generations. While we are about that, what about water harvesting? In my state, the Gallop Labor government have just announced they are going to build a gas-fired, hydrocarbon-energy-consuming factory to desalinise water. There are some interesting aspects of that. Quite recently, the Western Australian people discovered that there was insufficient electricity supply into Perth on a really hot day to simply keep the airconditioners going. They did not have enough energy. They had generating capacity but they could not find any fuel to put in the tank. So what are they going to do on the hottest day in Perth in a few years time? They are creating a piece of equipment that will be a massive energy consumer at the same time. They will produce this water in the wintertime presumably. I do not know where they are going to put it—
—Is it gas-fired or electricity-fired?
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member for Kingston will cease interjecting.
—They are going to have it electricity-fired and it was electricity that the state was short of. Of course it was gas that was providing the additional base load. So these are the realities. We are going to have a high-emitting, energy-consuming, countercyclical operation. Just how dumb can you get? Why would that be the choice? In Sydney, Perth or Adelaide, one of the great collection mechanisms for rainfall is our road system. We have an established collection infrastructure, but apparently nobody wants to put—or they are afraid of putting—collection points in that drainage system, with rising mains to pump that water to storage.
When I was the minister for local government and planning I pleaded with state agencies to make water harvesting and storage—a dual reticulation system, if you like—part of the subdivisional requirement for new subdivisions. That could have been used for ornamental lakes and other things. Within the established urban centres, collecting this water and pumping it back to existing storages is quite practical. Some would say, `Oh, dear me. You will have the pollution of the streets.' Of course, most of the water that is stored in dams around the place probably comes off a cow paddock.
Let me remind this House that all the stormwater and, as best I can ascertain, all the grey water associated with the property on which I am now standing flows into the Murray-Darling system and is consumed by communities all the way down the river system to Adelaide. And of course they put it back as it goes. I do not know what we can say about the member for Adelaide as to whether he is an intellectually brilliant person, but I have to say that I have received no information that drinking that water has had negative effects on the health or intellectual capacity of South Australians. By the time they drink it, it has been recycled through the streets and the sewerage schemes of numerous communities. In other words, considering that all water delivered back to the community goes through very high-tech water purification arrangements, this water should be being collected and pumped back. 
Let me make a comparison with the proposal in Western Australia to put in an energy-guzzling desalinisation plant. The simple fact is that, instead of having a conflict of energy consumption, were you to be pumping stormwater back to the reservoirs in the hills of Perth—and, by the way, you would start in the communities most adjacent—you would be pumping in the low-consumption period, which is winter, when there is plenty of energy available.
There is another factor there: dryland salinity. This is of considerable interest to me because I represent an electorate where this is a huge and ever-increasing problem. It is now recognised that this problem is caused by rising watertables and underground palaeochannel aquifers that are extremely saline—and, I might add, these acquifers are the major contributors to the salinity of the Murray-Darling system, not farmland clearing. The reality is that, out in my electorate, if farmers could pump that water out of the ground and some investment had been made in solar desalinisation technology—something equivalent to a hothouse—then they could be removing and reducing the problem of dryland salinity, which would regenerate their farmland. Operating in a dryland situation with some irrigated activity means that they would certainly have better supplies of stock water for their livestock and so on. I think that technology is relatively simple. Every boy scout knows to take a piece of plastic with him when he goes out into the dry areas so that he can obtain a bit of water from the same processes. There is even the opportunity to pump saline water from Perth up to Kalgoorlie through the existing pipeline, using oil pipeline technology separation techniques. So we would get two achievements for the price of one. You can also use renewable wind and solar generated electricity to electrolyse those bad waters and turn them into hydrogen, which can be used as a fuel.
So there is a lot to be done and there is a lot more thinking to do. I welcome this legislation. I find that the Labor Party's second reading amendment deals with the chickenfeed side of it and should be treated with the contempt it deserves. This parliament has to get away from populism and get into the realities of the most precious resource available to Australians, the shortage of which in the long-term can do the most damage to our economic progress and the high living standards that we enjoy.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—Unfortunately, very little time has been left for me to appropriately and adequately sum up the debate on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004. There have been a number of contributions, and I want to acknowledge those. There was a similar contribution made by the shadow spokesman, the member for Wills, and the member for Scullin, who seemed to feel that this bill would somehow be the silver bullet or was the panacea. As the member for Mallee very rightly observed, this is just one element of a whole series of government initiatives which are designed to make Australia world best in the water use efficiency of its domestic appliances and also in its irrigation, stock and domestic water use on the land. It is part of a whole-of-government approach to water use management across Australia. Indeed, the Howard government has led this nation for the first time since Federation towards a new way to manage water to national standards. This legislation is just one component. 
The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 required a lot of negotiation with the states before it could come before us today so that we could have a comprehensive new national scheme. The water efficiency labelling and standards scheme is the first national scheme of its kind in the world. The water efficiency scheme will introduce mandatory water efficiency labels on all showers, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers and urinals and on some types of taps, as well as introduce some minimum water efficiency standards for toilets. Its voluntary water efficiency labels will also be available for flow-control devices.
There was some concern from the member for Wills that we did not go far enough—that the scheme is not extensive enough in its application in the first instance, with minimum standards only for toilets. The member for Wills and the member for Scullin do not seem to understand that there are different capabilities across Australia when you compare the capacity of some systems to use new equipment at this time. For example, there are some parts of Australia where water-efficient shower heads do not work at the moment as water pressure is far too low, so it would be a nonsense to immediately introduce a mandated minimum standard for shower heads until we have a better idea of how the market will work in those places. This whole scheme is iterative and, as the market responds to the initial labelling scheme and the minimum standards of toilets, we will work out how to subsequently extend the minimum standards across a whole range of other products.
Water efficient appliances do not just save water—and they are going to save a significant amount in this country. We know that, by 2021, the community stands to save more than $600 million through reduced water and electricity bills. Not only will we save significant amounts of water—for example, through efficient washing machines and with savings of about 25 per cent from showers and 22 per cent from toilets—but there will be significant energy savings as we have less hot water in use for those appliances.
—Order! It being 2.00 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with the standing orders. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Murray will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Mr TRUSS,MP",NATS,2004-08-11,"—Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.
—The minister may proceed.
—Yesterday the member for Calare asked me a question about the Central West Rural Financial Counselling Service, and I undertook to obtain additional information. I informed the House yesterday that the federal budget had committed $23.3 million for funding to continue the Rural Financial Counselling Service. After the budget, Senator Troeth, who takes responsibility for these issues, immediately made a one-year extension offer for funding to the existing rural financial counsellors in Australia, while arrangements were being made for a longer-term agreement to cover 2005 to 2008.
The Central West Rural Financial Counselling Service has already finalised its funding agreement and has received its forward payment for July to October 2004. There is nothing in the central west service's 2004-05 budget and funding agreement that indicates that it is at any risk of closure by 2005, and my department has not been made aware of any concerns about the future viability of that service. Indeed, the central west service received a funding increase from the federal government for the 2002-04 period. In addition, it received a one-off $25,000 grant from the New South Wales government to cover special drought measures. It has also managed to obtain well above average local community input. In fact, it raised about $95,000 locally to support its service, which is well above the average. 
Unfortunately, the member for Calare is not here today, but he has issued a press release which I think incorrectly suggests that that service is at risk of closure. I want to assure the House that the service has received not only a continuation of its funding but also increased funding in the last period.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Financial Counselling Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The Prime Minister protesteth too much. In question time today we had an enormous amount of noise and very little light from the Prime Minister. He completely ignored the two questions from the Leader of the Opposition, which were designed to draw attention to the unfairness of this government's school funding system. How can it possibly be fair to give a 215 per cent increase in funding to the King's School—which is what the Howard government gave the King's School over the last four years, which is actually $5 million more going to a very wealthy school—while Bethel Christian School out in Mount Druitt gets an increase one-third of that of the King's School? How on earth can that be fair? Nobody thinks it is fair. I imagine not even the parents of children at the King's School think it is fair.
I must say the Prime Minister also tried very hard to make a lot of noise to cover up the reality of Labor's policy. The reality of Labor's policy is this: we will be maintaining the overall level of funding to non-government schools. The overall funding to non-government schools will be maintained by a Latham Labor government. What will that mean in reality? We will introduce a fair system of funding based on need. We will be taking money off the King's School and giving it to much more needy non-government schools that need increased funding. 
How many of us have been to little parish Catholic schools or Christian schools or other non-government schools that are far more in need of the extra $5 million that this government has given to the King's School? I can think of so many non-government schools around Australia that need that additional funding. It is only Labor that will deliver that increase in funding to needy schools in the non-government school sector.
We know that this government is determined to oppose that policy. I wonder why that might be? When you look up the government cabinet in Who's Who you can see how many of them went to these sorts of schools. How many of them actually went to schools that only about two per cent of Australian children ever see the inside of? The previous minister for education—the one who designed this outrageously unfair policy—went to Scotch College in Melbourne. That got a massive increase in funding over the last four years of over 90 per cent. We know the Deputy Prime Minister is an old boy of the King's School. They got their 215 per cent. The list goes on. The previous minister for health is also an old boy of Scotch College. About half of the government frontbench went to these very wealthy private schools.
These private schools do not need these massive increases in funding. By contrast, many non-government schools do need increases in funding and it is Labor that will make sure that those schools are lifted up to enable them to meet a decent national standard of education for the children whom they teach.
We also recognise, unlike the Howard government, that a national government—and this will certainly be true of a Latham Labor government—has a special responsibility for public schools. So a Labor government will increase funding to public education. We will make sure that public education is in fact a national responsibility, something that we will take proudly to the election. We will be members of parliament who actually stand up for public schools. We will not go out there and deride them in the way that this Prime Minister does. We will not deride our public schools. We will be proud of our public schools—proud of what they do—and they will be a national priority under a Latham Labor government.
It will be needy schools in both the government and the non-government sectors that will receive additional funding. So we can put paid to the rubbish that we heard from the Prime Minister today that suggested that the more needy non-government schools will be worse off under Labor. In fact, they will be better off under Labor because they will get the benefit of a redistribution of funding away from wealthy schools to much more needy non-government schools.
I was rather horrified to see in the Financial Review yesterday that the King's School has decided to—and I quote the Financial Review—give Labor `a caning'. The Financial Review quoted the principal of the King's School. He said:
... we could bring to bear quite a formidable amount of influence ...
An opposition member—Half the cabinet.
—That is exactly right—half the cabinet, starting with the Deputy Prime Minister, an old boy of the King's School. Maybe that explains how it got its $5 million. Maybe it was that formidable influence. I do not think that is a fair way of deciding how much money should go to a particular school. I do not think bringing formidable influence to bear on a government or a cabinet is the way that schools funding should be decided. I am sure the parents and students at Bethel Christian School in Mount Druitt would like to have some of that formidable influence. I am sure that the school I went to, Wangaratta High School, would like to have some of that formidable influence. It got a 20 per cent increase out of this government. It did not get 215 per cent, which is what the King's School got, with its vast playing fields and all the rest of it. We know where the formidable influence is. I must say the old boy network would be better advised going off and watching rugby matches rather than thinking that their job is to try and produce a very unfair system of funding for our schools. 
When we last raised the King's School in parliament, the Minister for Education, Science and Training got incredibly hot under the collar and said that we should not be criticising the capital upgrade at the King's School because the parents—and probably the old boys as well—had gone to enormous effort in raising money for this capital upgrade and had in fact raised the money through cake stalls. They must be the most extraordinary cupcakes down there at the King's School to raise $16 million. There is $16 million for a capital upgrade at the King's School, and this minister wants us to believe that that school has raised it from cake stalls.
I am pleased to say that the parents of students who go to some of these schools agree with the Labor Party's policy. One such parent is a caller to the Jon Faine talkback program on the ABC in Melbourne. I have the transcript of that call here. If the minister is happy, I will table it afterwards. Peter was on the mobile, and he said:
Hello, Jon. I think you're a bit too cynical about people's voting habits. I have three children at Geelong Grammar—
which, by the way, also received a huge increase in funding from this government—
which is a fairly big sacrifice for my wife and I, but I will be voting Labor. I very much believe in Labor policy on education, and I accept that money should go where the need is.
That is what Peter said. He accepts that money should go where the need is, which is all that Labor's policy is about. Jon Faine said:
If you believe in the Labor policy on education, why do you send your kids to a school like Geelong Grammar?
He went on, then Peter said:
I am prepared to pay for that education, and I think it is a good education. I think it is one that instils good values. But the point is that's my choice, but in terms of the government spending on education, I clearly think it should go where need is. I am happy to have to pay for the choice that I have made.
That is what Peter said, because he actually understands that. If we are to have a fair system of funding in this country, more people need to be like Peter. He wants to send his children to Geelong Grammar—that is his choice—but he recognises that it certainly does not come with huge increases in funding from the federal government. Peter went on to say:
Yes, well, I accept that it might cost me more in the future, and I think the private schools have had a pretty good run with the Howard government, but I think—
get this—
the country is very much the poorer for what the Howard government has done.
This is a father with three children at Geelong Grammar who said that the country is very much the poorer for what the Howard government has done. Jon Faine then said:
Now Peter, if you stood up and said that at a meeting of Geelong Grammar parents I think they'd pretty much shout you down, wouldn't they?
Peter said: 
I don't know. I think it's quite an eclectic group actually, but you'd be surprised where Labor voters pop up, Jon.
I think Peter had it dead right. The critical issue that Peter had dead right is that our schools funding should be on the basis of need. It is not only parents like Peter, parents at needy schools like Bethel Christian School and parents who send their children to government schools who think that. In fact, at the Senate inquiry we had evidence from the Catholic Education Commission and the Associations of Christian Schools, and both of those organisations made it very plain what they thought. I will quote first of all from the Associations of Christian Schools. Their submission to the Senate inquiry said:
To maintain the integrity of the SES—
that is the system of funding that this government has introduced—
and to ensure the accessibility of Australian families to Christian schools, some consideration may need to be given to private income per capita for recurrent purposes in assessing need.
Whose policy is that? That is Labor policy. It is not Howard government policy, because they know if the total resources of a school, including fees charged—the $16,000, $17,000 or $18,000 that is paid per child at these wealthy schools—were taken into account there would be no way that any of these schools should be granted increases in funding. The Christian schools are certainly arguing that they support the policy that Labor has put forward of making sure that the total resources available to private schools are counted. The same sort of conversation took place with the Catholic Education Commission. The chair of the Senate inquiry asked:
Would it be fair to say that that distribution system takes into account a measure of need?
Monsignor Doyle said:
It very much takes need into account.
This is where they were talking about how the Catholic schools distribute their money. The chair said:
And that need is predicated on the total resources available to a school?
Monsignor Doyle said:
Total recurrent resources ...
So the Catholic Education Commission distributes the money that it gets from the Commonwealth not on the basis that the government gives it to them but on the basis of need, which takes into account the total resources available to the school.
The Minister for Education, Science and Training nods. Maybe he has had a change of heart. No, he is shaking his head again. He has changed his mind. He does not agree with Monsignor Doyle. He does not agree that the total resources should be counted. That is Labor Party policy. That is the only way in which we can guarantee that the needs principle is actually delivered on. One thing is for sure: we have seen from this Howard government that need is a very long way away from its schools policy. The Howard government and its schools policy have absolutely nothing to do with need and everything to do with entrenching privilege. That is why we have seen these massive increases in funding going to the richest schools in the country.
Under a Latham Labor government, that will end. We will take money away from these schools and give it to needy non-government schools. We will, of course, make sure that every student gets a basic level of support but, above that basic level of support in non-government schools, we will fund on the basis of need. We will make sure that government schools receive the extra money they need, we will make sure that those government schools are a national priority, but we will not stand for this outrageous increase in funding that has gone to the wealthier schools in this country. That will end under a Labor government. ",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education: National Resource Standard</title>,Matters of Public Importance,21,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—Firstly, I say to the parents of Australia that I am sorry; I am sorry that they are going to have to endure for the next few months what will pass for a debate on school funding in Australia, and it is going to occur for the very reasons we have just heard. The Leader of the Opposition goes out publicly and says, `Oh, there shouldn't be any divide in relation to public and non-government schools in Australia,' and then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spends the rest of her time fuelling that divide and demonising not only some schools but parents who make sacrifices to send their children to them.
The reality, firstly, is that, every time in Australia a parent chooses to send his or her child to a Catholic or independent school, that parent forgoes a larger public subsidy, federal and state, to make sacrifices to send their child to that Catholic or independent school. All Australians know a number of truisms in relation to schools. The first is that state schools are owned, managed and primarily funded and run by state governments—and that is why they are called state schools. The second is that they know, if they choose to send their child to any one of the 2,600 Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia, they will have to pay fees. They know that the average fee paid is about $2,800 and they know the reason they will have to pay fees is that they are going to get a lower level of government assistance by sending their child to that Catholic or independent school. The average Australian may not understand the intricacies of school funding but they do know that, if all the kids in Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia suddenly went back to the public system, the taxpayer would have to find another $4 billion to educate the same children.
The third truism that certainly has taken root in Australia is that the Labor Party is against you sending your child to a private school. In fact, the Sydney Morning Herald published an article on 26 November 2001, a couple of weeks after the last federal election, in which a journalist went out to the Bird in Hand Inn in the electorate of Macquarie and interviewed husband and wife Greg and Gina Fletcher. Greg, a factory worker, said:
... the Labor Party's pledge to take money away from private schools had not been popular.
He continued:
People around here don't have much money, but they save and save so they can send their kids to a private school and get a good education and then Labor says you shouldn't try to do this.
It would appear that nothing has changed since. There are the forward markers. You can look firstly at what the Labor Party has done in Australia over the last three years to the parents of the 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools—and it has done a number of things. The first is, around the states and territories, all the Labor governments have been withdrawing support for Catholic and independent schools. The Western Australian government has frozen funding to former categories 1 to 6 non-government schools, which relates to a three per cent reduction in funding by a Western Australian Labor government. The Northern Territory Labor government reduced its funding by four per cent last year. Also, in the ACT there has been a withdrawal of capital works assistance for parents who send their kids to Catholic and independent schools. The New South Wales government has withdrawn all support for Catholic and independent capital works programs for those schools that were former categories 3 to 1 and it has capped it for the others. We also know that the Tasmanian Labor government actually uses this socioeconomic status system—this system which we have just heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition demonise and which she and every member of the Labor Party voted for and is about to vote for again; however, when that government introduced that system, it actually cut the funding to schools whose scores may have increased. 
The member for Jagajaga referred to Monsignor Tom Doyle, who heads the National Catholic Education Commission. As His Eminence Cardinal George Pell made clear on 29 February 2004:
The bulk of government funding for Catholic schools comes from the Federal government, although state governments also make a significant contribution. For government schools the opposite is the case, with the bulk of funding coming from state governments. Recognising the importance of parental choice in education means that we all need to work for the best possible government and non-government schools, all well-resourced, especially in areas which are socially and economically disadvantaged.
It was announced on that day that the Catholic schools throughout Australia were joining the socioeconomic status, or SES, funding system. That meant that all of the 2,652 Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia were joining the socioeconomic status funding model.
If the Labor Party had had its way—we have seen crocodile tears about a Christian school, for example, today—and this government had not come to office in 1996, there are 200 independent schools in Australia that would not exist and be funded today. Forty-nine of them are Christian schools. This government and I had to fight tooth and nail to get establishment grants for these small schools that are starting up throughout Australia; the Labor Party was resistant to that.
The next thing is the mechanism of indexation to the funding itself of the non-government schools, which we heard today has been opposed by the Labor Party. It is delivering to independent schools $300 million more than under the previous system. If the Labor Party had its way, there would be even more bureaucracy being placed on independent and Catholic schools throughout Australia in relation to their funding.
The member for Jagajaga mentioned a radio caller who said he had children going to Geelong Grammar. She should have mentioned the next caller. The next caller, Alistair, said: `I have real problems with what Jenny Macklin says. I have three of my children. The three eldest boys went to this so-called elitist school. Both my wife and I were working full time with the express intention of sending the boys there, and they did a survey through all the parents and found 75 per cent were in the same category. So there's just no way that that was an elitist school.'
The reality here is that, as the Prime Minister said, this government believes that all Australians through their state and federal taxes should pay for what should be well-resourced government schools. Having done that, all parents in this country will be supported politically and financially according to the means of those families if they choose to send their child to a Catholic, Anglican, Jewish, Islamic community, Lutheran, Adventist or Christian school, or any other religious school—and parents make enormous sacrifices to send their children to those schools.
The member for Jagajaga mentioned Monsignor Doyle. One of the things that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the member for Jagajaga have said a single word about is that the New South Wales teachers union is proposing to go to the High Court to challenge federal government funding to religious schools. That means that, for parents of children in Catholic schools, Jewish schools, Christian schools, Anglican schools and Islamic schools, the funding to their schools and their children is threatened. What is needed is earnest, stable leadership from the Leader of the Australian Labor Party and for him to join the Prime Minister and say that the Labor Party do not support this High Court challenge. Instead they have all gone to hide under a rock. 
In fact the Labor Party has made it very clear what it intends to do—although we have not seen any policy yet, and that is what Australian parents need. The Labor Party made it clear through the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on 26 March this year, when the member for Jagajaga was asked by a journalist, `Well, what is the basis of Labor's policy?' She said:
Well, as I was just mentioning, the number one issue is fees. There's a massive difference between the level of fees paid by parents at this school compared to the fees paid at the King's school.
She was then asked:
Is it just a handful of schools such as Kings and Trinity that will be affected?
She said:
It's more than a handful because once you go into Melbourne as well as Sydney, there's many ... there are a number of schools that are very wealthy. King's school, Trinity Grammar in Melbourne, of course, Geelong Grammar ... Scotch College, those sort of schools. They are very, very wealthy.
The next day, reporting on this, the Australian Financial Review listed a number of schools that had been nominated by Labor, and one of them was the Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School in Western Australia. The Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School charges $9,200 per child, so is it not a reasonable deduction to say, `Right, every school that charges more than $9,200 a year will have its funding cut'? If they do that, at least 127 independent schools, educating 123,000 Australian children, will have their funding cut under a Labor government.
If you do go into the Melbourne schools, it is very interesting. Let us firstly go to Mount Scopus Memorial College in Caulfield South, in the electorate of Chisholm. There are 1,300 children at that school. They will have their money cut under a Labor government; they charge fees higher than $9,200. The Gandel Besen House in East St Kilda, in the electorate of Melbourne Ports—again a Mount Scopus school—educates 255 children from Jewish families. They charge fees higher than the King's School in Sydney, so their funding must surely be cut. Yet the member for Melbourne Ports has gone to the school and reassured them that Gandel Besen House in the Melbourne Ports electorate will not have their funding cut. So who is misleading whom?
The reality is the Labor Party has demonised one school and said that, whatever the Labor Party does, it is going to cut the money going to the King's School. Now it is tying itself up in knots because it has discovered there are at least another 126 schools it has to cut funding to—and the member for Melbourne Ports has gone to one of those schools and reassured them they will not have their funding cut. What the Labor Party is saying here is: the greater the sacrifices you make for your children, the less support you are going to get from the government.
Another school in Melbourne is Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School, in the electorate of Jagajaga. I challenge the member for Jagajaga to bring the Leader of the Opposition to Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar School during the electorate campaign. You should both stand in front of the school assembly and explain to the 1,000 children before you, and to their parents and teachers, why the sacrifices being made by those parents are of lesser value to a Latham Labor government and why they are worthy of having their funding cut. Then the principal can take the children who will be forced to leave the school because their parents will be at financial breaking point to personally meet the Leader of the Opposition, and he can explain to them why they are going to have their funding cut. He can then explain to the Australian taxpayer why, when those girls have to go back to the public education system, the taxpayer will then have to pay four times more to educate the same children. 
I do not know if anyone on the other side has ever had this experience, but there are two bedrocks in the life of any child—two bedrocks. The first is family and the second is school. Children go through enormous pain when they have to leave a school. It is hard enough when your family is transferred interstate but when you have been at a school for four, five or six years, you have a network of friends and are understood in that community. Parents may have three jobs and may be making enormous sacrifices to keep their child at a particular school—they may never have a holiday and they may be driving a 15-year-old car. I would like the Labor Party to understand how those parents will feel if they then, as a result of a Labor government, have to explain to the child they so love that they have to leave that school. I would like the Labor Party to understand that.
When parents make decisions to send their children to Catholic and independent schools, they make long-term budgeting decisions. They have to take into account their mortgages and car loans. They work out their credit card debts and when they might be able to get a new car. They give up their holidays. They make long-term commitments to the education of their children. The last thing they need is a government that comes in and says, `Right, we're going to pull the rug out from under your children and decrease the funding for those schools.'
The reality that needs to be faced in this country is that every single time a child goes to a Catholic or independent school, they are receiving less public funding for their education than if they attended a public school. The kids from the poorest families get 30 per cent less; the kids from the wealthiest get 87 per cent less—but they all get something. Australian parents have seen in the last few days what happens when a Whitlam protege gets into Government House. Imagine what will happen when one gets into the Lodge. What is going to happen with school funding in Australia is just a taste of what is to come. The kids at the King's School are getting a quarter of what they would get were they to go to a local public school and half of what they would get if they were at the Bethel Christian School. It is time that the Labor Party realised that the class wars in education are long gone and that if they defunded every one of those schools, they would deliver $93 to every child in the rest of the non-government sector.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—I heartily support the statements by the shadow minister for education in her contribution to the MPI. It follows a failure by the Prime Minister to be honest with the Australian people about the massive inequality created by his funding system, particularly that created between independent schools. There is a wide divergence of schooling across this country. That divergence has become even more apparent under this government's flawed funding system.
Since the introduction of the Howard-Costello flawed funding model, we have seen massive increases in Commonwealth funding to some of the wealthiest schools. Schools that charge the highest fees have been given the highest increases under this government—in some cases funding increases of up to 300 per cent. In comparison Catholic and lower fee independent schools have received smaller amounts, with Catholic schools receiving only 25 per cent funding increases. Under what basis can this be justified? Absolutely none. Schools funding should not promote further inequality in schools resources by giving the largest funding increases to the schools with the highest levels of resources, yet this is exactly what the Howard government's policy has done. 
The SES model introduced by the government is not achieving its stated objective of allocating funding according to need. It is a fundamentally flawed model. The SES system uses socioeconomic status as an indicator of capacity to pay school fees. But the socioeconomic status information used to calculate schools ranking is not based on the actual incomes of the actual parents of the actual students who go to the actual schools. It is an estimate based on the average socioeconomic status of families in the areas in which they live, as determined by the five-yearly census.
The SES model makes a couple of assumptions. It assumes that all families within a census collector district have similar socioeconomic characteristics. An oddity of the job we do is that many of us actually doorknock on a CCD basis. Not many Australians, I suspect, actually do this—census collectors and the postal service would. Many of us have seen first-hand how widely inaccurate this assumption is. The second assumption in the SES model is that self-reported income—not verified—in the census is completely accurate. Both of these assumptions are incorrect.
It is like taking the average ages and incomes of all the people in a census collector district and determining that, in areas where there is a high proportion eligible for the age pension, everyone in that area should get the age pension. It is a nonsense. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee's inquiry into the Commonwealth funding for schools is looking at this very issue. Far from saying there is general satisfaction with the SES model, in the 72 submissions to the inquiry to date there is a divergence of opinions, particularly between independent schools. It is not a fair system, and it is not achieving its objective.
Funding to schools is not being distributed on the basis of need. We have seen, and will see again, a concerted campaign by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Science and Training to provide a smokescreen and a scare campaign about Labor's policies. There will be, as we have seen recently, campaigns by some principals of wealthy private schools who seek to defend what they now see as an entitlement to receive greater shares of funding then less well-off independent and Catholic schools.
The next election is going to be an important one for parents of children at our schools. Labor wants a constructive debate about education and the resources needed by schools to provide the best opportunity for all our kids to achieve. The government is totally incapable of defending its own model on this basis. We have some extraordinary schools in our country. I, like many other members of parliament, have had the opportunity to visit the 150 or so in my electorate. Not all of them are the same. We have terrific schools and we have struggling schools, not all of them in the same sector.
Setting a national resource standard is at the heart of our approach—setting a resource bar and funding all schools to meet it is at the heart of our approach. This national resource standard will drive our needs based funding for all schools by allocating funding so that schools get the resources needed to provide a great education. This means that the vast majority of government, Catholic and independent schools will be better off under Labor's school funding policy. Labor is not against the right of parents to choose what school they send their children to. But Labor does not support the Howard government policy of dramatically increasing the funding to the wealthiest schools at the expense of less well-off Catholic or other non-government schools. 
The Howard government's model is fundamentally divisive and fundamentally unfair. Across the country we have situations where parents have joined together to form their own schools. These are new schools with an outstanding reputation in Victoria for achieving constantly high marks in the VCE and providing a high-quality learning environment. Parents have established Christian, Jewish or Muslim schools. Many of these newer independent schools are struggling to find capital funding to improve learning facilities. They struggle to get the best teachers. Many of them are still teaching out of demountable classrooms. They struggle to cater for growth and to resource even their basic needs in libraries.
It is fundamentally unfair to these schools that since 2001 the government has skewed funding increases to schools such as King's in Sydney by over 200 per cent. That school already has vast playing fields, a rifle range, a swimming pool, a boatshed, a museum, a full-time archivist and a multimillion-dollar Centre for Leadership and Learning, amongst a host of other top-of-the-line resources. The non-government school sector as a whole will not lose money under a Latham Labor government. Labor will redistribute funding within the non-government sector away from high-fee schools towards Catholic and other low-fee independent schools.
Labor will also increase funding to government schools. We have promised, and will deliver when in government, more capital support for government schools. We are committed to attracting and retaining teachers in schools that are struggling. We will provide male role models in primary schools and will back this up with a recruitment campaign. Labor will be more than happy to take our policy to the voters when the Prime Minister calls the election. We will be happy to tell them that there is a choice. If the Howard government are re-elected they will continue to give private schools like King's in Sydney and Geelong Grammar increased funding. It is not fair to give schools that already have huge amounts of resources even more money when there are so many other schools with greater needs. If we want to give all children a great education, the Howard government's unfair policy must end. Most Catholic and independent schools will benefit from our needs based funding model.
Labor introduced major federal funding of non-government schools in the 1970s, under the Whitlam government. We extended this commitment through further increases under the Hawke and Keating governments. A Latham Labor government will continue in this tradition of supporting non-government schools. Only a Latham Labor government will restore balance and fairness to school funding. I look forward to the contribution from the member for Aston. I am quite convinced that, in the same tradition that we just heard from the minister for education, we will hear a number of mistruths and scaremongering about Labor's policy. I look forward to debating this issue in the election campaign. We will be debunking some of the myths that this government is intending to spread. ",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education: National Resource Standard</title>,Matters of Public Importance,21,1
"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I start by reassuring the member for Ballarat that I will not be involved in any scaremongering at all. It is a great pleasure for me to rise in the House today to talk about the government's education policy. From the outset, I want to say something that I think is very important in a debate like this. I want to record the absolute respect and admiration I have for all of the people who teach young Australians throughout this country. Australian schoolteachers are the great unsung heroes of this country, in my view. Their role and their responsibility are critical to the future prosperity of this nation.
This MPI reveals something about the Labor Party. It reveals at its core the difficulty that they have in and around the area of choice. I cannot for the life of me work out what it is that they are so opposed to. From my point of view and from the government's point of view, every parent has the right to choose the system that they wish to educate their child in. That is the fundamental basis of the government's position. That is what the Labor Party of Australia, federally and state based, cannot get over. They do not want parents to have that choice. They want to force parents into one particular decision, not provide them with choice.
The other fact that you heard about earlier from the outstanding Minister for Education, Science and Training was that parents who choose to send their children to non-government schools are taxpayers too. Before we get into any other areas of the debate, our principle is that every child in Australia deserves some support from the Australian government. Every child in Australia deserves some support. It is a point of logic. All reasonable people would have to declare that that is in the nation's interest. It is in the national interest that every child be supported. Parents who send their children to non-government schools are just as entitled to government funding of their children's education as parents who do not.
I want to talk about a couple of different points in today's debate. Firstly, I want to touch on the area of school funding. I know that the Labor Party does not like to hear this, but the facts are that under this government all schools have received greater support than they have ever received before. In every budget, and in grants to every state and territory for every year since the Howard government came to office in 1996, school funding has increased. As a matter of fact, over the next four years this government will deliver over $31 billion to Australian schools. That is the largest funding commitment to education in Australia that we have ever seen—by any government.
What is important about this is that this funding commitment will be not only for government schools but also for non-government schools. As you have heard from the federal minister, the Catholic systemic schools will now form part of the SES funding model. For the first time they will receive a significant increase from the federal government. During question time today the Prime Minister again touched on what is important about this funding model. I want to refer to comments the Prime Minister made in the parliament on Monday, 21 June. I want to read from Hansard, because this is an important point that must be made in this debate about education funding. The Prime Minister said:
I will take the opportunity of pointing out to the parliament that every time a state government in this country spends $1 on a government school, 44c in that dollar has come from the GST or Commonwealth government grants. I will say that again: every time a state government around Australia spends $1 on a government school, 44c in that dollar has come directly from the GST or Commonwealth government specific purpose payments. So when you add that to the direct funding of government schools by the federal government, the reality is that federal governments provide more money for the funding of government schools than, indeed, do the state governments from their own revenue sources. 
That is a remarkable fact. The federal government deliver more funding to government schools, from our own sources of funding, than the state and territory governments do. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know, as all members in this place know, that state and territory schools are the responsibility of the states and territories. But the fact of the matter is that, from our federal funding sources, we are giving a higher proportion of funds to those schools than the sovereign entities responsible for them—the states and territories—are delivering. I know the Labor Party find that a difficult concept to come to terms with, but it is something that links with the concept of choice that they just will not embrace and will not come to terms with.
—It's called the tax base!
—You hear the interjections—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—If the member for Braddon thinks he has a licence, I might remind him of standing order 55.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Braddon has trouble understanding standing order 55, as we know.
They do not like hearing it. It is a fact. This is one of the problems that, in my three years of being in this place, I still have not got used to. The Labor Party do not want to deal in facts; they want to deal in rhetoric. For the life of me I cannot work out why we cannot get this education debate right in all of our minds in this chamber. We are talking about the future of our children. Education is beyond politics and we should not be having this type of adversarial debate about the future of our children.
The fact is that, since the Howard government was elected in 1996, we have done an outstanding job in the area of education. Mr Deputy Speaker, you of course know about the National History Project that we have implemented. That is valued at $2.3 million. The National School Science Project is valued at $2.5 million. The national Values Education Study to support values education in schools is valued at $580,000. Values is a strong area of our government policy.
—That's less than the King's School gets in one year!
—The member for Batman would have trouble coming to terms with any sort of value, but values education is something that the government are committed to. We are committed to reinforcing values and standards in our schools. Our fantastic federal minister recently announced part of that values and citizenship policy, and that is the need for all schools in Australia to have a flagpole, but most importantly to make sure that that flagpole works and the flag is flown on that flagpole.
—This is the sort of thing that parents in my electorate—
—The member for Shortland is warned!
—and parents in other outer metropolitan electorates care about. Parents want to know that their children, when they go to school, are being taught civics and values. They are very happy that this government is supportive— 
—The member for Sydney is warned!
—This MPI talks about the need for a fair, needs based funding system. We have a fair needs based funding system. It is called the SES model.
A government member—Labor voted for it.
—That is right. The Labor Party supported this. The member for Jagajaga, who would be the minister for education and the Deputy Prime Minister, voted for it. People need to look back through the Hansard and see that she voted for this model. This is a fair, needs based funding system. This is a funding system that has worked well throughout Australia, and one of its key principles is that private investment in education should not be discouraged.
Labor's policy is all about so-called resourcing in schools. Let us examine what that seems to mean if you are a school and you have got an active school council and an active school community and you go out and raise, through all your various fundraising activities, a wonderful plethora of money so you can build resources at your school. If at your school you get together and raise money to build a fantastic new gymnasium through your own efforts as a school community, under Labor's policy they are going to look at you as a school and say, `You are resourced well so you do not need any support.' Because the parents go out and raise all these funds they are now going to be punished. Where is the logic in that? Where is the logic in punishing Australian parents for going out, raising funds and being involved in their children's education at their local school? The Australian Labor Party, the communists of this country, are going to come in and punish them for doing that sort of thing. It is an absolute farce. It is an absolute disgrace. The Labor Party need to get their act together. Talking about getting their act together, I am going to refer to the Australian Financial Review editorial that was published on 4 August, just recently. The editorial has the heading `Macklin flunks the policy test'. The reality is that Macklin has flunked the MPI test as well. (Time expired)
—Order! The discussion is now concluded.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education: National Resource Standard</title>,Matters of Public Importance,21,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's third and fourth reports for 2004 relating to the mid-life upgrade of the existing chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Wellington, New Zealand and the provision of facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command, New South Wales.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—by leave—The first of the two reports addresses the provision of essential refurbishments to the building interior and engineering services of Australia's permanent mission to New Zealand. There has been no significant refurbishment of the chancery since its construction 26 years ago, and the building no longer provides an appropriate level of service and amenity.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expects that the upgrades will fulfil the requirements of the Wellington post for the next 25 years. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $9.309 million. The works proposal includes: modernisation of building services and the removal of hazardous waste material; improvement of security provisions to meet the needs of Australia's overseas agencies; consolidation of functions and occupation into the basement, ground, second and third floors; and refurbishment of the first floor as an office shell suitable for future tenancy or moth-balling to minimise costs.
At the public hearing, the committee questioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a range of issues, including: the removal of hazardous asbestos; security arrangements; structural requirements relating to local seismic activity; and consultation with the Australian Greenhouse Office regarding energy conservation provisions. The department explained that asbestos sheeting in the eaves needed to be replaced with non-hazardous material and assured the committee that these works would be carried out by a licensed operator to the highest safety standards. In respect of security, the department outlined its intention to install a range of new security features, including more rigorous access arrangements at the main entrance.
Further, the department explained that a detailed structural audit had been undertaken and that the building would satisfy local standards for seismic stability. Details of this audit were provided to the committee subsequent to the hearing. The department added that, while it had not consulted with the Australian Greenhouse Office, energy conservation was a priority. The department expects to achieve a saving of 20 per cent in energy costs by mothballing the first floor and installing intelligent lighting and a state-of-the-art building management system. Having considered the evidence before it, the committee recommends that the proposed mid-life upgrade of the existing chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Wellington, New Zealand proceed at the estimated cost of $9.309 million.
The committee's fourth report of 2004 examines the provision of facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command near Bungendore, New South Wales. The work was referred to the committee by the Department of Defence at an estimated cost of $318.08 million. This inquiry was something of a landmark for the committee as it was the first entirely privately funded project presented for consideration. This posed some difficulties for the committee as the project was referred at a very early stage of development. This occurred because Defence requires parliamentary approval for the work in principle before it can seek tenders from private finance consortia. Detailed design, therefore, will be undertaken only after the selection of a successful tenderer. In view of this, the committee recommends that Defence provide it with reports on the progress of works and associated costs at each stage of completion of the project. 
The inquiry generated considerable local interest and there was general community support and excitement about this project. We did have the member for Eden-Monaro at the hearings, and he is very supportive of this project as well. But there were particular aspects of the project that were of some concern. One was the anticipated traffic impacts of the development. It is estimated that, once this facility is operational, it will generate some 800 additional traffic movements to and from the site each day. Having heard evidence from both the Greater Queanbeyan City Council and the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority on this matter, the committee recommends that Defence liaise with both these organisations with regard to traffic management and road safety issues arising from the proposed development.
The committee also received evidence from the University of Sydney's Molonglo Radio Observatory, a significant scientific facility located some five kilometres from the site of the proposed work. The university outlined the potential for radio frequency interference from the new headquarters to impact negatively on its operations. The university explained that, should the Molonglo radio telescope be forced to move from its hitherto radio-quiet location, this would disrupt research programs and incur large costs. The committee was pleased to note that Defence intends to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the observatory. The committee recommends that this close consultation continue. Furthermore, the committee recommends that Defence implement all possible radio frequency interference mitigation measures during both the construction and operation of the new command facility, to ensure that the observatory can continue to operate without interference.
In keeping with its continued efforts to ensure the ecological sustainability of the Commonwealth's building proposals, the committee also questioned Defence on its intentions with regard to the minimisation of waste and the reduction of energy consumption for the new headquarters. Defence stated that it aims to have no waste leaving the site and intends the new headquarters to be a five-star green building. Having received a submission from the New South Wales Department of Environment and Conservation sustainability programs division outlining a number of waste management and energy use reduction strategies, the committee recommends that Defence and its private consortium partners liaise with that agency to ensure that the Headquarters Joint Operations Command facility meets the highest possible standards for the minimisation of waste production and energy use.
Other issues investigated by the committee with regard to the proposed development included: the selection of the preferred site for the facility; impacts on the social infrastructure within the neighbourhood; impacts on neighbouring properties; consultation; processes; and project delivery. The committee also received a comprehensive in camera briefing from Defence on the financial particulars of the project and, having satisfied itself on these matters and having received assurances from Defence that further reports will be provided as the project progresses, the committee recommends that the proposed provision of facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command, New South Wales, proceed at the estimated cost of $318.08 million. I would like to take the opportunity to thank committee colleagues, Hansard and all of those who have been involved in helping and facilitating these inquiries. I commend the reports to the House.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—I support the comments made by the member for Pearce with respect to the two reports tabled today relating to the chancery building for the Australian High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand and provisions for facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command in New South Wales. The committee was, as the report tabled indicates, happy with the hearings. There is no doubt that there was a clear need for a refit of the chancery building in Wellington. There had been no refurbishment for a quarter of a century, and we are informed that there will be no need for further refit or refurbishment for the next 25 years.
Can I, in particular, make reference to the fourth report, the Provision of facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command, NSW. It is significant, as the chair indicated, that this is an entirely privately funded project presented for consideration. As the chair indicated, this posed some difficulties for the committee, as the project was referred at a very early stage of the development. I—and, I am sure, all members of the committee—concur with the chair that we must keep our eye on this project, given the amount of money involved, which is in excess of $300 million, and the unique nature of the project. As indicated by the member for Pearce, the committee were satisfied with both the need for the construction of the project and the arguments and submissions put to us.
This may be my last opportunity to thank, along with the chair, the secretariat. Without the assistance of the secretariat, I am sure the Public Works Committee, like other committees, could not do its job. In particular I would like to thank Margaret Swieringa; Vivienne Courto; Sara Edson; Tiana Di Iulio, who is on maternity leave for 12 months; and Emily Davis, who is acting in her stead. Those members of the secretariat, and possibly some others, have provided great assistance to the members of the committee, and I think that is one of the significant reasons why we have been able to achieve so much in this term.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Works Committee</title>,Committees,25,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's third and fourth reports for 2004 relating to the mid-life upgrade of the existing chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Wellington, New Zealand and the provision of facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command, New South Wales.
Ordered that the reports be printed.
—by leave—The first of the two reports addresses the provision of essential refurbishments to the building interior and engineering services of Australia's permanent mission to New Zealand. There has been no significant refurbishment of the chancery since its construction 26 years ago, and the building no longer provides an appropriate level of service and amenity.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expects that the upgrades will fulfil the requirements of the Wellington post for the next 25 years. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $9.309 million. The works proposal includes: modernisation of building services and the removal of hazardous waste material; improvement of security provisions to meet the needs of Australia's overseas agencies; consolidation of functions and occupation into the basement, ground, second and third floors; and refurbishment of the first floor as an office shell suitable for future tenancy or moth-balling to minimise costs.
At the public hearing, the committee questioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a range of issues, including: the removal of hazardous asbestos; security arrangements; structural requirements relating to local seismic activity; and consultation with the Australian Greenhouse Office regarding energy conservation provisions. The department explained that asbestos sheeting in the eaves needed to be replaced with non-hazardous material and assured the committee that these works would be carried out by a licensed operator to the highest safety standards. In respect of security, the department outlined its intention to install a range of new security features, including more rigorous access arrangements at the main entrance.
Further, the department explained that a detailed structural audit had been undertaken and that the building would satisfy local standards for seismic stability. Details of this audit were provided to the committee subsequent to the hearing. The department added that, while it had not consulted with the Australian Greenhouse Office, energy conservation was a priority. The department expects to achieve a saving of 20 per cent in energy costs by mothballing the first floor and installing intelligent lighting and a state-of-the-art building management system. Having considered the evidence before it, the committee recommends that the proposed mid-life upgrade of the existing chancery building for the Australian High Commission, Wellington, New Zealand proceed at the estimated cost of $9.309 million.
The committee's fourth report of 2004 examines the provision of facilities for Headquarters Joint Operations Command near Bungendore, New South Wales. The work was referred to the committee by the Department of Defence at an estimated cost of $318.08 million. This inquiry was something of a landmark for the committee as it was the first entirely privately funded project presented for consideration. This posed some difficulties for the committee as the project was referred at a very early stage of development. This occurred because Defence requires parliamentary approval for the work in principle before it can seek tenders from private finance consortia. Detailed design, therefore, will be undertaken only after the selection of a successful tenderer. In view of this, the committee recommends that Defence provide it with reports on the progress of works and associated costs at each stage of completion of the project. 
The inquiry generated considerable local interest and there was general community support and excitement about this project. We did have the member for Eden-Monaro at the hearings, and he is very supportive of this project as well. But there were particular aspects of the project that were of some concern. One was the anticipated traffic impacts of the development. It is estimated that, once this facility is operational, it will generate some 800 additional traffic movements to and from the site each day. Having heard evidence from both the Greater Queanbeyan City Council and the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority on this matter, the committee recommends that Defence liaise with both these organisations with regard to traffic management and road safety issues arising from the proposed development.
The committee also received evidence from the University of Sydney's Molonglo Radio Observatory, a significant scientific facility located some five kilometres from the site of the proposed work. The university outlined the potential for radio frequency interference from the new headquarters to impact negatively on its operations. The university explained that, should the Molonglo radio telescope be forced to move from its hitherto radio-quiet location, this would disrupt research programs and incur large costs. The committee was pleased to note that Defence intends to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the observatory. The committee recommends that this close consultation continue. Furthermore, the committee recommends that Defence implement all possible radio frequency interference mitigation measures during both the construction and operation of the new command facility, to ensure that the observatory can continue to operate without interference.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia from 8 to 23 November 2003. I seek leave to make a short statement.
Leave granted.
—I put on record the very good, cohesive team who formed the parliamentary delegation to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia: the member for Corio, Mr Gavan O'Connor; Senator Mason and Senator Natasha Stott Despoja. They were good ambassadors for Australia and for this parliament. During the tour, the team worked very well. I also thank the secretary, Ms Rosa Ferranda, for her assistance throughout the trip. In the short time available, I will make some brief comments. I acknowledge the assistance of the Australian diplomatic personnel in those three countries. I thank them for their hospitality, their genuine goodwill and their guidance to the delegation. 
It is interesting that the free trade agreement with Thailand has been part of the legislation in this parliament today. Some 12 months ago, last November, it was very much part of the delegation's discussion in Thailand. It is a pleasure to those of us on the delegation that this free trade agreement will be approved in the parliament. The delegation followed the Prime Minister and the foreign minister to Bangkok, so we were of rather lesser consideration because of the importance of the free trade agreement. It was apparent to the delegation that the Thai economy is booming and that Thailand is an excellent country with which to engage in a free trade agreement, and I think it augurs well for the future. It was also obvious to the delegation that there were good economic and political ties between both countries, developed from World War II.
The highlight of our trip in Thailand was the visit to Hellfire Pass. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I have had the privilege of being there with you on a previous occasion. Hellfire Pass certainly demonstrates the spirit and soul of those soldiers who fought in Thailand during World War II. The Thailand-Burma Railway Museum is a great tribute to those service personnel who lost their lives or were maimed by disease or injury. We can see exactly what took place. Mr Deputy Speaker, we acknowledge Rod Beattie who was there when you and I were there in 1996. The delegation saw first-hand in Thailand people trafficking young females in Bangkok. It was quite a moving experience to see the tragedy, in human terms, of those activities.
In Vietnam, we saw the different cultures of the north and the south. I had not been there before. It was interesting to see in the north that Hanoi is a market economy run by a different regime. North Vietnam is certainly moving ahead quite rapidly. The bicycle reigns supreme in Hanoi. That is a lasting impression we have. In Ho Chi Minh City, we visited the RMIT outpost, and that was an interesting experience. We visited some of the farmers in the delta and saw some of the experiments going on there. The AusAID programs in HIV-AIDS were very practical. Itinerant workers were advised about sexual practices. I think that program had a lot to commend it.
Our visit to Cambodia was a very thought-provoking experience. It is a war-ravaged country. The impacts of the Khmer Rouge and people trafficking came home first-hand to the delegation. We were surprised to learn that in the parliament of Cambodia the government of the day has to obtain a two-thirds majority, and that has resulted in a hung parliament. One of the highlights in Cambodia was to meet King Norodom Sihanouk. His warmth and friendship to the delegation was quite remarkable. He was full of commendations for his old friends in Australia and for the very warm friendships he has had with many Australian leaders over his 50 years as king of that country. We visited the Documentation Centre of Cambodia in Phnom Penh. That was a stark experience for those who read about the Khmer Rouge in the legal documentation identifying the victims of that horrific regime which, it is estimated, slaughtered more than two million people. Cambodia has very strong ties with Australia, and they are to be fostered and commended.
In my experience, these parliamentary visits cement ties, friendships and goodwill between these countries. This delegation was no exception.

"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House and endorse the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia in November 2003, presented to the House by my colleague the member for Corangamite, Stewart McArthur, who led the delegation. Parliamentary delegations to other countries are an important part of the rich tapestry of responsibilities and experiences of parliamentary life, and constitute a significant pillar in Australia's political relationship with the rest of the world. Every day, the cultural and commercial relationships between Australia and other countries are played out in myriad contacts and exchanges between Australians and others. But in a very special way our positive relationship as a nation with countries in our region is maintained and enhanced by the intimate and shared understandings that naturally evolve from delegations involving politicians from national parliaments.
I have always treated such delegations seriously in their preparation, participation and reporting. They have always been exciting but humbling learning experiences that remain with all parliamentarians in a personal sense and throughout their parliamentary life. Therefore it was with great disappointment that I accepted medical and embassy advice to return home midway through the delegation's time away from Australia. I became seriously ill in Vietnam and I was advised that proceeding with the trip might exacerbate a pre-existing medical condition and lead to serious health consequences in the future. I have responsibilities to my family and my electorate, and it was with a great deal of reluctance that I accepted the medical and embassy advice and returned to Australia.
I pay tribute to the professional care and advice provided to me by our fine embassy staff in Hanoi, Vietnam. Their care and attention was evidence to me yet again that our nation is blessed with one of the most professional of diplomatic corps among the family of nations. That is a sentiment that no doubt applies to all staff with whom the delegation had contact in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia.
I also thank our hosts in the two nations I was fortunate enough to visit before taking ill, namely Thailand and Vietnam. Your hospitality, courtesy and frankness in discussion has done much to build upon the positive relationship Australia has with you, and I look forward to the opportunity of reciprocating your hospitality when future delegations visit Australia.
I thank the other members of the delegation for their friendship and understanding. Many delegations that leave this parliament cannot claim to be a success from the point of view of harmonious and professional relationships between members. I think the supporting staff would agree that this delegation was an exceptionally good one from that point of view. The wisdom and experience of the leader, Mr McArthur, the infectious laughter of Senator Mason, the natural poise and enthusiasm of Senator Stott Despoja and the cooperative spirit that prevailed among members made this delegation a pleasure to be on.
My thanks go to Craig McPherson from the AFP, who provided the necessary security for the delegation in a timely and most professional manner in these troubled times we live in. Finally, I thank our secretary, Rosa, who toiled under quite difficult circumstances at times. Her cheerful demeanour, firm hand and professionalism ensured that this delegation was able to meet its stated objectives and submit to the parliament a comprehensive report of its activities with practical recommendations for further action.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Crime in the community: victims, offenders and fear of crime, volume 1, incorporating a dissenting report, and volume 2, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On 21 May 2002 the Minister for Justice and Customs referred to the committee the inquiry into crime in the community: victims, offenders and fear of crime. Crime has an enormous impact on people's lives and the Australian economy, costing an estimated $32 billion each year. Whenever Australians are surveyed, crime is one of the top three issues of concern.
In the first volume of the report, the committee has considered the fear of crime in the community, initiatives undertaken by local communities to reduce and prevent crime and the measurement of crime across Australia. The committee has made a number of recommendations, including further funding for the National Community Crime Prevention Program; standardisation of crime data collection and the introduction of a system akin to CompStat, developed so successfully during the mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani in New York; and the gathering of more accurate information on the extent of crimes committed against women. The volume presents a national perspective of how Australian communities experience and respond to crime and fear of crime. The extensive nature of the inquiry and the submissions received by the committee reveal just how aware the community is of the need for a proper functioning justice system.
The committee received substantial submissions covering all aspects of the inquiry. From New South Wales came very serious allegations of corruption in the New South Wales policing system, including allegations of protection of paedophiles, doctoring of police statistics, corruption of the newly introduced promotions system for duty officers, the failure of the Wood Royal Commission and the systemic failure of bodies set up to investigate such issues. Instead of being applauded for seeking remedies, the whistleblowers received punitive treatment. From the beginning, Labor members of the committee had a difficulty with the inquiry and seemed overwhelmingly concerned as to how it may reflect on various state Labor governments. Hence the attempt by a then Labor member of the committee to prevent former and serving police officers giving evidence of corruption to the committee. Although this action delayed evidence being taken, this attempt was thwarted and the officers gave evidence in February and March 2003.
From Queensland came submissions concerning the Heiner affair, first from Mr Kevin Lindeberg, a man who, in the words of a recent edition of Australian Story, is the David of David and Goliath and is `a pretty powerful human being', and later from Mr Bruce Grundy, journalist-in-residence at the University of Queensland. Mr Lindeberg became the crusader who revealed a cover-up of illegal behaviour by the then Premier Wayne Goss and his cabinet ministers when they joined together to authorise the destruction of documentation of evidence taken by Noel Heiner in 1989. Mr Heiner took evidence in 1989 about mismanagement and abuse of children at the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre in Brisbane. One of those cabinet ministers is currently Treasurer of Queensland in the Beattie government. 
Volume 2 of the committee's report therefore focuses on the Heiner affair, the shredding of documents by the newly elected Goss government in Queensland in 1990—documents required in evidence for a judicial proceeding. Earlier this year, a pastor, Pastor Douglas Ensbey, was convicted under section 129 of the Queensland Criminal Code for the destruction of evidence required in a judicial proceeding—the same offence committed by the Goss government, including its cabinet. Thus it seems that, if you are an ordinary citizen, the law is clear: you cannot destroy evidence that may be required for judicial proceedings. However, if you are a government minister in Queensland, the law is different: you can with immunity destroy documents even when you have been put on notice that proceedings are intended, even when the documents contain evidence of abuse.
Given the principle of equality before the law, the committee has concluded, after analysing all the evidence presented to it, that ministers of the then Goss cabinet, who authorised the shredding of evidence required in judicial proceedings, have committed the same offence and should be charged accordingly under the Queensland Criminal Code.
The evidence also shows that a number of senior public servants at the time may well have been guilty of serious misconduct. The committee therefore also recommends that a special prosecutor be appointed, with access to all the documentation, and empowered to call all relevant people to give evidence. Had action been taken in 1990 to clean up instead of cover up, subsequent abuse, which continues to this day, could have been avoided and the culture changed.
I conclude with a shocking example of how the culture remains and was illustrated by evidence of practices in a care facility for the intellectually and physically disabled on Bribie Island, a private sector institution overseen by the Queensland government. The evidence given included a description of punishment meted out to a boy whereby his artificial leg was removed to force him to crawl.
The report goes some way to righting many of the wrongs that have been perpetrated in the Heiner affair. The inquiry has been long and detailed, and in this endeavour I would like to put on record the thanks of the committee to the staff, who are in the advisers box today, who have given an enormous amount of tireless work in gathering material together and presenting it so that public hearings could take place and these reports that I have here today could be written. I would also like to thank the committee as a whole for the work that it carried out even in difficult circumstances. Members of the committee have been in the chamber today. As I said, this report goes a long way towards righting some of the wrongs that have been perpetrated and perhaps restoring some of Mr Lindeberg's life. I therefore commend volume 1 and volume 2 of the report on crime in the community to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—I rise as a member, until recently, of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I do not want to add to the comments that have already been made in this House by my friends the member for Lowe and the member for Denison. We, as Labor Party members, resigned from this committee last week on receiving the permission of the parliament to do so. It was not a step that we particularly wanted to take. 
The chairperson of the committee, the honourable member for Mackellar, is someone I actually quite like; I think she is a very nice person. Outside of the political game she is terrific. But from the beginning the Labor Party members of the committee came up with the realisation that, in terms of her political stance, the member for Mackellar was going to use this committee for the purpose of doing as much personal grandstanding as she could in relation to some of the matters that were referred to it. I say that with a great deal of regret, because as I understand it this committee has in the past, under a number of chairpersons, been a model committee. I would love to be able to stand here today and say what my friend the honourable member for Sydney said with respect to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit. She lauded the work of Mr Charles, the chairman of that committee.
I do not want to go overboard, but the Labor Party members of the committee have not seen the second volume of the committee's report. We have certainly seen the first volume, which, I must say, has a lot to commend it. Recommendation No. 1 is the recommendation with which we agree the most:
The committee recommends that the inquiry into crime in the community: victims, offenders and fear of crime be re-referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the 41st parliament.
I would ask our colleagues opposite and those on this side who might be members of that committee to ensure that they select a chairperson who is going to conduct the hearings in a bipartisan manner. The matters that were brought before the committee were of great substance. I believe that this report could have achieved a lot more in terms of real value to the community, because crime in the community and fear of crime in the community are extraordinarily important issues to people in this country.
The four Labor members who have resigned have had nothing whatsoever to do with the second volume of the committee's report. As I say, I have not seen it. It does not surprise me that it was all kept very secret. I understand that the honourable member for Mackellar certainly was not prepared to give us a look at the chairman's draft, because I think she knew what we would think of it. The reality is this: for her to use a committee of this parliament in a quest to get television news coverage and all the rest of it in trying to blame state governments—which at the moment happen to be all of Labor persuasion—I think is quite out of order. It is not in the spirit of what parliamentary committees are about. I feel very disappointed and embarrassed, actually, for the honourable member for Mackellar.
The reality is that the Heiner affair and Mr Heiner were first commissioned by the then Borbidge National Party government in Queensland. When these documents were shredded, they were shredded on advice given by the Solicitor-General. There have been something like three or four different inquiries into the so-called Heiner affair, which most people have accepted. Mr Lindeberg, who was the major whistleblower, is someone whom I know very well and whom I have known for some years; he is a constituent of mine. I appreciate that he is genuinely concerned and that he is, if you like, fixated on this particular issue. But in the end I think that putting these sorts of things in a report, giving him the sort of support that the member for Mackellar has given him, giving support to some of the matters that were raised and trying to blame governments and ministers is highly ridiculous.
I place on record that the observations in that report do not have any credibility so far as we are concerned, because we were not even consulted about them. I do not know whether the honourable member for Lowe has seen the report yet. The reality is that it lacks credibility in the sense that it is not bipartisan. We did not agree with it. We have not even put it in a dissenting report— 
—He resigned.
—Exactly. We have not even put in a dissenting report, because the chairperson of the committee kept the report pretty secret and would not even let us have a look at the chairperson's draft. In any event, this was a good inquiry in many respects. If it had not been for the chairperson, it would have been a terrific inquiry. I particularly thank the people in the committee secretariat. They have done an enormous job under very difficult circumstances. The Labor Party members of this committee had to walk out on the first day because committee members were trying to crunch numbers on us—on the first day. We had problems with this committee on the first day. It ended with us unfortunately having to resign—something which we did not want to do. So, whilst I commend most of what is in volume 1 of the report, I cannot commend what is in volume 2, because we have not seen it.
This would have been a terrific committee—this would have been something which I think we could have nutted out—if only the honourable member for Mackellar had not decided to do what she did. With great respect to her, we know what she is like: she uses these sorts of things all the time for media self-aggrandisement. I think that is unfortunate. Having said that, I hold no particular bitterness towards her because, as I said, I actually quite like her, but I hope that the next committee is chaired by somebody other than the honourable member for Mackellar and that she moves on to something else. That is as far as I can take the matter. I thank the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I wish to exercise my right under the standing orders to reply to two points. The first thing I want to say is that, yes, the committee did have to be adjourned on the first day because one member of the committee, the member for Denison, used language to me that, quite frankly, would have had him thrown out of this chamber for six months if he had used it in here.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not know if we can debate this across the chamber. The member for Mackellar has made a statement on the report and I have made a reply. I do not think this is appropriate. She is now casting aspersions on another member of the committee. The reality is that, once she has finished, I will want to seek indulgence to counteract what she has said. I do not think it is getting us anywhere.
 (Mr Jenkins)—There is no point of order.
—Accord-ingly, I reconvened the adjourned committee meeting later in the day to allow the member for Denison to apologise, which he did, and we then proceeded with the business of the committee. As I said in my tabling speech, and as Mr Sciacca confirmed in his address, it was difficult. There was a concern about how things would reflect on Labor state governments.
The second thing I would like to say is that the committee worked very well on many parts of the report and took part in things in good spirit, but the contrivance of the way in which Labor members chose to resign meant they could not see the second volume, because it would have been in breach of the standing orders to show the chairman's draft to people who were not members of the committee, which was by their own design. So, accordingly, there was no draft of volume 2 to show to you prior to your resignation. I wanted to make those two points perfectly clear because the committee has done an enormous amount of work. 
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,27,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—I would like to make a couple of small contributions and support my colleague, the member for Bowman. On a positive note and in a spirit of bipartisanship, I accept that there was a lot of good material in the first volume of the committee's report, but I think I need to place some other things on the record in this debate.
As the chair knows, when she rang me on Thursday, 22 July—after I had left her some four hours earlier at lunchtime—to say there was going to be a meeting later that night I did not think there was any justification for that meeting, notwithstanding the chair's advice to me that the Attorney-General had issued an embargoed press release in relation to jettisoning the bankruptcy bill. My concern in relation to that matter was amplified when at 20 minutes to 12, as the member for Barton and I participated in a telephone hook-up of that meeting, my mobile phone rang and I was advised that Tony Delroy on ABC radio had just broadcast that details from the very report we were discussing were going to be on page 1 of the next day's Financial Review. I informed the chair and the members of the committee who were participating in that meeting. That was clearly high farce and it certainly brought the work of the committee into disrepute.
The other point I need to make is this: how on earth were we expected to consider the first part of the draft report of the inquiry into crime in the dead of the night—at three minutes past midnight? It was like being hit with a medicine ball, and yet we were expected to make a valuable contribution. There was an opportunity for all of us in a bipartisan way to make a very valuable contribution to a lot of the good work that was done—and that included the chair of the committee.
It is sad that we had to take that unprecedented step and resign from the committee. We did not want to do it. I note the point made by the member for Mackellar that there was contrivance. I ask, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what else could we do? When has anyone been given about five hours notice to have a meeting in the dead of the night to discuss something that had been going on for 2½ years and then have to sign off on it? There was no justification for that whatsoever.
—It was after a Liberal Party fundraiser, wasn't it, John?
—I do not know what was going on at the royal suite of the Stamford Plaza Hotel on that night, but I was terribly disappointed with that because there were many good moments during that inquiry. We have not had the opportunity to have a look at the second volume, but that is fair enough. We resigned from that committee because we did not feel we could legitimise the inquiry any further. I want to strongly support recommendation 1 of this report. I hope that whoever chairs the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs after the next election follows the exemplary conduct of the member for Menzies.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Crime in the community: victims, offenders and fear of crime, volume 1, incorporating a dissenting report, and volume 2, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On 21 May 2002 the Minister for Justice and Customs referred to the committee the inquiry into crime in the community: victims, offenders and fear of crime. Crime has an enormous impact on people's lives and the Australian economy, costing an estimated $32 billion each year. Whenever Australians are surveyed, crime is one of the top three issues of concern.
In the first volume of the report, the committee has considered the fear of crime in the community, initiatives undertaken by local communities to reduce and prevent crime and the measurement of crime across Australia. The committee has made a number of recommendations, including further funding for the National Community Crime Prevention Program; standardisation of crime data collection and the introduction of a system akin to CompStat, developed so successfully during the mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani in New York; and the gathering of more accurate information on the extent of crimes committed against women. The volume presents a national perspective of how Australian communities experience and respond to crime and fear of crime. The extensive nature of the inquiry and the submissions received by the committee reveal just how aware the community is of the need for a proper functioning justice system.
The committee received substantial submissions covering all aspects of the inquiry. From New South Wales came very serious allegations of corruption in the New South Wales policing system, including allegations of protection of paedophiles, doctoring of police statistics, corruption of the newly introduced promotions system for duty officers, the failure of the Wood Royal Commission and the systemic failure of bodies set up to investigate such issues. Instead of being applauded for seeking remedies, the whistleblowers received punitive treatment. From the beginning, Labor members of the committee had a difficulty with the inquiry and seemed overwhelmingly concerned as to how it may reflect on various state Labor governments. Hence the attempt by a then Labor member of the committee to prevent former and serving police officers giving evidence of corruption to the committee. Although this action delayed evidence being taken, this attempt was thwarted and the officers gave evidence in February and March 2003.
From Queensland came submissions concerning the Heiner affair, first from Mr Kevin Lindeberg, a man who, in the words of a recent edition of Australian Story, is the David of David and Goliath and is `a pretty powerful human being', and later from Mr Bruce Grundy, journalist-in-residence at the University of Queensland. Mr Lindeberg became the crusader who revealed a cover-up of illegal behaviour by the then Premier Wayne Goss and his cabinet ministers when they joined together to authorise the destruction of documentation of evidence taken by Noel Heiner in 1989. Mr Heiner took evidence in 1989 about mismanagement and abuse of children at the John Oxley Youth Detention Centre in Brisbane. One of those cabinet ministers is currently Treasurer of Queensland in the Beattie government. 
Volume 2 of the committee's report therefore focuses on the Heiner affair, the shredding of documents by the newly elected Goss government in Queensland in 1990—documents required in evidence for a judicial proceeding. Earlier this year, a pastor, Pastor Douglas Ensbey, was convicted under section 129 of the Queensland Criminal Code for the destruction of evidence required in a judicial proceeding—the same offence committed by the Goss government, including its cabinet. Thus it seems that, if you are an ordinary citizen, the law is clear: you cannot destroy evidence that may be required for judicial proceedings. However, if you are a government minister in Queensland, the law is different: you can with immunity destroy documents even when you have been put on notice that proceedings are intended, even when the documents contain evidence of abuse.
Given the principle of equality before the law, the committee has concluded, after analysing all the evidence presented to it, that ministers of the then Goss cabinet, who authorised the shredding of evidence required in judicial proceedings, have committed the same offence and should be charged accordingly under the Queensland Criminal Code.
The evidence also shows that a number of senior public servants at the time may well have been guilty of serious misconduct. The committee therefore also recommends that a special prosecutor be appointed, with access to all the documentation, and empowered to call all relevant people to give evidence. Had action been taken in 1990 to clean up instead of cover up, subsequent abuse, which continues to this day, could have been avoided and the culture changed.
I conclude with a shocking example of how the culture remains and was illustrated by evidence of practices in a care facility for the intellectually and physically disabled on Bribie Island, a private sector institution overseen by the Queensland government. The evidence given included a description of punishment meted out to a boy whereby his artificial leg was removed to force him to crawl.
The report goes some way to righting many of the wrongs that have been perpetrated in the Heiner affair. The inquiry has been long and detailed, and in this endeavour I would like to put on record the thanks of the committee to the staff, who are in the advisers box today, who have given an enormous amount of tireless work in gathering material together and presenting it so that public hearings could take place and these reports that I have here today could be written. I would also like to thank the committee as a whole for the work that it carried out even in difficult circumstances. Members of the committee have been in the chamber today. As I said, this report goes a long way towards righting some of the wrongs that have been perpetrated and perhaps restoring some of Mr Lindeberg's life. I therefore commend volume 1 and volume 2 of the report on crime in the community to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—I rise as a member, until recently, of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I do not want to add to the comments that have already been made in this House by my friends the member for Lowe and the member for Denison. We, as Labor Party members, resigned from this committee last week on receiving the permission of the parliament to do so. It was not a step that we particularly wanted to take. 
The chairperson of the committee, the honourable member for Mackellar, is someone I actually quite like; I think she is a very nice person. Outside of the political game she is terrific. But from the beginning the Labor Party members of the committee came up with the realisation that, in terms of her political stance, the member for Mackellar was going to use this committee for the purpose of doing as much personal grandstanding as she could in relation to some of the matters that were referred to it. I say that with a great deal of regret, because as I understand it this committee has in the past, under a number of chairpersons, been a model committee. I would love to be able to stand here today and say what my friend the honourable member for Sydney said with respect to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit. She lauded the work of Mr Charles, the chairman of that committee.
I do not want to go overboard, but the Labor Party members of the committee have not seen the second volume of the committee's report. We have certainly seen the first volume, which, I must say, has a lot to commend it. Recommendation No. 1 is the recommendation with which we agree the most:
The committee recommends that the inquiry into crime in the community: victims, offenders and fear of crime be re-referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in the 41st parliament.
I would ask our colleagues opposite and those on this side who might be members of that committee to ensure that they select a chairperson who is going to conduct the hearings in a bipartisan manner. The matters that were brought before the committee were of great substance. I believe that this report could have achieved a lot more in terms of real value to the community, because crime in the community and fear of crime in the community are extraordinarily important issues to people in this country.
The four Labor members who have resigned have had nothing whatsoever to do with the second volume of the committee's report. As I say, I have not seen it. It does not surprise me that it was all kept very secret. I understand that the honourable member for Mackellar certainly was not prepared to give us a look at the chairman's draft, because I think she knew what we would think of it. The reality is this: for her to use a committee of this parliament in a quest to get television news coverage and all the rest of it in trying to blame state governments—which at the moment happen to be all of Labor persuasion—I think is quite out of order. It is not in the spirit of what parliamentary committees are about. I feel very disappointed and embarrassed, actually, for the honourable member for Mackellar.
The reality is that the Heiner affair and Mr Heiner were first commissioned by the then Borbidge National Party government in Queensland. When these documents were shredded, they were shredded on advice given by the Solicitor-General. There have been something like three or four different inquiries into the so-called Heiner affair, which most people have accepted. Mr Lindeberg, who was the major whistleblower, is someone whom I know very well and whom I have known for some years; he is a constituent of mine. I appreciate that he is genuinely concerned and that he is, if you like, fixated on this particular issue. But in the end I think that putting these sorts of things in a report, giving him the sort of support that the member for Mackellar has given him, giving support to some of the matters that were raised and trying to blame governments and ministers is highly ridiculous.
I place on record that the observations in that report do not have any credibility so far as we are concerned, because we were not even consulted about them. I do not know whether the honourable member for Lowe has seen the report yet. The reality is that it lacks credibility in the sense that it is not bipartisan. We did not agree with it. We have not even put it in a dissenting report— 
—He resigned.
—Exactly. We have not even put in a dissenting report, because the chairperson of the committee kept the report pretty secret and would not even let us have a look at the chairperson's draft. In any event, this was a good inquiry in many respects. If it had not been for the chairperson, it would have been a terrific inquiry. I particularly thank the people in the committee secretariat. They have done an enormous job under very difficult circumstances. The Labor Party members of this committee had to walk out on the first day because committee members were trying to crunch numbers on us—on the first day. We had problems with this committee on the first day. It ended with us unfortunately having to resign—something which we did not want to do. So, whilst I commend most of what is in volume 1 of the report, I cannot commend what is in volume 2, because we have not seen it.
This would have been a terrific committee—this would have been something which I think we could have nutted out—if only the honourable member for Mackellar had not decided to do what she did. With great respect to her, we know what she is like: she uses these sorts of things all the time for media self-aggrandisement. I think that is unfortunate. Having said that, I hold no particular bitterness towards her because, as I said, I actually quite like her, but I hope that the next committee is chaired by somebody other than the honourable member for Mackellar and that she moves on to something else. That is as far as I can take the matter. I thank the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—by leave—I move:
That the House take note of the report.
I wish to exercise my right under the standing orders to reply to two points. The first thing I want to say is that, yes, the committee did have to be adjourned on the first day because one member of the committee, the member for Denison, used language to me that, quite frankly, would have had him thrown out of this chamber for six months if he had used it in here.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not know if we can debate this across the chamber. The member for Mackellar has made a statement on the report and I have made a reply. I do not think this is appropriate. She is now casting aspersions on another member of the committee. The reality is that, once she has finished, I will want to seek indulgence to counteract what she has said. I do not think it is getting us anywhere.
 (Mr Jenkins)—There is no point of order.
—Accord-ingly, I reconvened the adjourned committee meeting later in the day to allow the member for Denison to apologise, which he did, and we then proceeded with the business of the committee. As I said in my tabling speech, and as Mr Sciacca confirmed in his address, it was difficult. There was a concern about how things would reflect on Labor state governments.
The second thing I would like to say is that the committee worked very well on many parts of the report and took part in things in good spirit, but the contrivance of the way in which Labor members chose to resign meant they could not see the second volume, because it would have been in breach of the standing orders to show the chairman's draft to people who were not members of the committee, which was by their own design. So, accordingly, there was no draft of volume 2 to show to you prior to your resignation. I wanted to make those two points perfectly clear because the committee has done an enormous amount of work. 
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,27,2
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—I would like to make a couple of small contributions and support my colleague, the member for Bowman. On a positive note and in a spirit of bipartisanship, I accept that there was a lot of good material in the first volume of the committee's report, but I think I need to place some other things on the record in this debate.
As the chair knows, when she rang me on Thursday, 22 July—after I had left her some four hours earlier at lunchtime—to say there was going to be a meeting later that night I did not think there was any justification for that meeting, notwithstanding the chair's advice to me that the Attorney-General had issued an embargoed press release in relation to jettisoning the bankruptcy bill. My concern in relation to that matter was amplified when at 20 minutes to 12, as the member for Barton and I participated in a telephone hook-up of that meeting, my mobile phone rang and I was advised that Tony Delroy on ABC radio had just broadcast that details from the very report we were discussing were going to be on page 1 of the next day's Financial Review. I informed the chair and the members of the committee who were participating in that meeting. That was clearly high farce and it certainly brought the work of the committee into disrepute.
The other point I need to make is this: how on earth were we expected to consider the first part of the draft report of the inquiry into crime in the dead of the night—at three minutes past midnight? It was like being hit with a medicine ball, and yet we were expected to make a valuable contribution. There was an opportunity for all of us in a bipartisan way to make a very valuable contribution to a lot of the good work that was done—and that included the chair of the committee.
It is sad that we had to take that unprecedented step and resign from the committee. We did not want to do it. I note the point made by the member for Mackellar that there was contrivance. I ask, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what else could we do? When has anyone been given about five hours notice to have a meeting in the dead of the night to discuss something that had been going on for 2½ years and then have to sign off on it? There was no justification for that whatsoever.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I rise in continuation. Before question time, I was addressing my remarks to the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 and I was summarising the debate that we had heard, which included a number of contributions from both sides of the House. I thank those people for participating. Before question time I had been saying that this bill is in fact a national first—creating a scheme that is the first of its kind in the world. It is going to deliver very significant water efficiency savings for a whole range of products in our country—in which, despite being one of the driest continents on earth, we have in the past used water as if there were no tomorrow.
The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Scheme will introduce mandatory water efficiency labels on all showers, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers, urinals and some types of taps, as well as minimum water efficiency standards for toilets. Water, as I said, is one of Australia's most critical environmental issues. Water use restrictions are becoming increasingly common in urban areas and are likely to become more severe with population increases and the impacts of global warming in some areas where it affects rainfall. In our country we are still coming to grips with the notion of more water recycling, which has been encouraged significantly by our government.
Some of the previous speakers—in particular, the member for Wills, who is the shadow spokesman for the environment, and the member for Scullin—referred to this not being an all-encompassing panacea for Australia's water problems. But how could it be? It is one of a whole range of elements that this government has introduced, beginning in 1996. At this time, when we have in front of us for the first time a national water initiative, championed by our Prime Minister, we are beginning to see the problems of Federation solved. We had whole water catchments divided by state and territory borders, leading to inefficiencies, water law anomalies and lack of consistency in water management in all shapes and forms. At last we are seeing some consistency—driven, as I said, by our Prime Minister, John Howard, and by our Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson.
By 2021, when water-efficient appliances are expected to have achieved a high level of market penetration, this measure is projected to reduce domestic water use by 87,200 megalitres per year, or five per cent. This will total a water saving of 610,000 megalitres by 2021. By then—2021—the community also stands to have saved more than $600 million through reduced water and electricity bills. That is a most significant saving. In addition, greenhouse reductions are projected to total 570 kilotons of CO2 equivalent per annum by 2021. After that, our water efficiency labelling scheme is expected to deliver an ongoing annual reduction in domestic water consumption of five per cent. So this legislation will make a most significant contribution to improving water use efficiency around Australia, particularly in our domestic households.
We will not mandate minimum standards for some equipment—for example, shower heads—overnight. As I said before, you need to understand that there is life beyond the cities in this country. Unfortunately, the Labor Party does not tend to represent many people beyond the cities and so it fails to understand that in, for example, Sydney you have sufficient water pressure to run a shower with a lower level of water pressure than is currently available but in Darwin right now you could not use a water-efficient shower rose. It simply would not work with the pressures that are available to Darwin households. Where you are working your showers off a rainwater tank, as is the case in many of our rural and regional towns throughout Australia, it would be impossible for you to use one of those appliances were we to immediately mandate a minimum standard of water use and pressure through those systems. So we have to evolve this system, and we will do it as technology improves and as the market becomes more familiar with what is intended and more conscious of the benefits—as this labelling system takes hold. 
I want to commend our government very highly for making sure that we are looking at all elements of water management, water quality and water use efficiency in this great dry continent of ours. We, of course, totally reject the notion, put by the shadow spokesman, the member for Wills, that Labor's water policy should be on the table. He suggested that their policy would create the solutions to Australia's water use needs. Most people would regard that as a joke.
Let me give this issue some serious attention for a minute and say that the government have acted comprehensively in addressing national water issues—in particular with the new national water initiative. The government have brought states and territories to the table and we are looking hard at urban areas—particularly at national guidelines for water use and recycling and water sensitive urban design principles. This is the first time in the more than a century since Federation that we have had that discussion around a national table.
The key elements of the national water initiative include a commitment to addressing our overallocated water supply systems; a commitment to a more sophisticated, transparent and comprehensive process of water planning in all jurisdictions; and, in terms of security for individual consumers of water, a commitment to ensuring perpetual access to water and to ensuring that the water is tradable and appropriately and fully costed, so that we achieve better and more efficient management of all water across this country, sustaining a resource that has been under threat for a very long time.
This bill provides an excellent framework for addressing urban water efficiency in partnership with the state and territory governments. The act will provide successive governments with a mechanism for extending the scope of labelling requirements and minimum standards over time, as needs arise and the markets make it possible for us to do so. I believe the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is an excellent initiative which is truly in the interests of the nation and of every family in this country. I commend it to the House.
 (Mr Jenkins)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Wills has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.
Question agreed to.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 4) Bill 2004 is an omnibus tax bill with largely technical amendments to the tax law. Labor will support it. Schedule 1 of the bill deals with the new consolidation regime which came into operation on 1 July 2002. The amendments aim to provide greater flexibility to consolidated groups, clarifying the operation of the consolidation regime and ensuring that the regime interacts appropriately with other aspects of the income tax law. The amendments will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2002 but will only benefit affected taxpayers.
Schedule 1 includes clarification of the meaning of `beneficial ownership' for the purposes of the consolidation membership rules. The amendments will ensure that entities under external administration will not be prevented from being or remaining members of consolidated groups. The amendments also provide special rules for setting the tax cost of assets that are subject to a finance lease held by an entity that becomes a member or ceases to be a member of a consolidated group. These rules will ensure that the cost-setting rules apply appropriately and take into account the different treatment of finance leases under accounting standards and under the income tax law. The bill also clarifies the operation of the cost-setting rules and the inherited history rules for assets arising from allowable capital expenditure, transport capital expenditure and exploration and prospecting expenditure in the mining industry.
The bill amends the income tax law dealing with low-value pools to ensure that the head company of a consolidated group receives appropriate allowances for the decline in value of these pools. The rules will ensure that the head company and a leaving entity receive an appropriate allowance for the decline in value of the pools where a leaving entity takes some of the pool with it upon exiting the consolidated group. Similarly, the bill ensures that the head company of a consolidated group and a leaving entity receive an appropriate allowance for the decline in value of software development pools where an entity takes some of the pool with it upon exiting the consolidated group.
The bill also amends the income tax law to alleviate the notice requirements under the inter-entity loss multiplication rules for entities that are in the same consolidatable group during the consolidation transitional period. The amendments will give the Commissioner of Taxation the discretion to extend the time for giving notices or waiving the notice requirement in appropriate circumstances.
Schedule 2 of the bill deals with the taxation treatment of copyright collecting societies. Copyright collecting societies administer certain rights of copyright on behalf of copyright owners, such as composers. Income received in relation to copyrights is held by societies pending identification of and allocation to the copyright owner. Historically, these societies have not been subject to taxation, with tax being levied on the royalties in the hands of the copyright owner.
Following a review of the tax treatment of copyright collecting societies, the tax commissioner determined that a trust relationship existed between the societies and their members. From 1 July 2002 the societies lost their income tax exemption and have been subject to taxation as discretionary trusts. Consequently, if the society has not identified the copyright holder entitled to certain royalties by the end of a financial year, those royalties are taxed in the hands of the trustee at the top marginal rate. While the tax law allows two months after the end of the financial year for the copyright owner to be identified, a significant percentage of copyright income is generally not allocated within that time frame. As such, without these amendments a significant proportion of the income of copyright collecting societies would face tax at the top marginal rate. 
The then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, announced on 1 August 2002 that copyright collecting societies would be exempt from tax on copyright income that they collect on behalf of copyright owners. In addition, other income generated by copyright collecting societies will also be exempt from tax providing that this non-copyright income does not exceed the lesser of five per cent of the copyright collecting society's total income for the year and $5 million or an amount prescribed by regulations. This test is designed to minimise compliance costs for copyright collecting societies. The amendments also ensure that any income derived by copyright collecting societies that is not taxed in their hands is included in the assessable income of members upon distribution.
Because the amendments do not create a tax liability for the member at the time they become entitled to that income—that is, when their entitlement was identified by the copyright collecting society—these amendments do present a slight opportunity for income tax deferral. There are some safeguards in this bill to protect the revenue against copyright collecting societies being used on a large scale to defer tax. If these safeguards prove ineffective, it may be necessary to revisit the issue. The amendments will significantly reduce the compliance costs for copyright collecting societies, which are important in ensuring that intellectual property rights are protected in Australia.
Schedule 3 of the bill deals with the simplified imputation system which commenced on 1 July 2002. The amendments in this bill contain mainly consequential and technical amendments to other areas of the income tax law to ensure that the SIS operates as intended—in particular, replacing references to the former imputation system with those of the simplified imputation system and updating terminology of the former imputation provisions to SIS equivalent terms.
Schedule 3 also contains four minor technical amendments. The first ensures that a deduction continues to be available for on-payments of unfranked dividends made from a resident company to its wholly owned foreign parent. This was meant to have been effected by Taxation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Bill 2004, but one relevant paragraph was not amended by that legislation, resulting in this deduction inadvertently remaining inoperative.
The second amendment is to the exempting entity rules to replicate under SIS the treatment of dividends paid to an eligible continuing shareholder or an employee who has acquired a share under an employee share scheme under the old imputation regime and the SIS. The third amendment ensures that the priority rule for refundable tax offsets interacts properly with the franking deficit tax offset rules. And the fourth amendment alters the conditions that a recipient of a distribution franked with venture capital credits must satisfy before they are entitled to a tax offset—in particular, to ensure that they are not party to a franking credit trading arrangement.
Schedule 4 of the bill deals with specific listing of numerous organisations as deductible gift recipients. DGRs have access to a range of tax concessions, including being able to provide a deduction to a donor for donations over $2. Organisations that fall within the general categories of DGRs can be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation as DGRs. Organisations that do not fall within those categories must be specifically listed in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. 
The Howard government has been attempting to change this requirement so that organisations could be specifically listed as DGRs by regulation rather than by legislation. This would have presented a number of issues, including lack of scrutiny of organisations being granted specific listing and the ability of the government to place restrictions on organisations specifically listed, such as to ensure that they do not criticise the government. The Australian Democrats have also expressed concern that determining DGR status through regulation would remove the right of non-government members to propose specific listing of organisations. Regardless of the last point, Labor opposed these provisions.
Labor welcomes the government's backflip during the last session of parliament to remove these provisions from Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003. Organisations that will be granted specific listing by this bill include state country fire authorities; the International Social Service Australian Branch from 18 March 2004; the Victorian Crime Stoppers program from 23 April 2004; the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial Fund from 20 October 2003 to 19 October 2005; the Tamworth Waler Memorial Fund from 20 April 2004 to 19 April 2006; and Australian Business Week Ltd from 9 December 2003.
The last of those organisations I would particularly cite as being an organisation that provides very worthy educational services in schools. I make it an absolute rule to attend Australian Business Week in any school that is running one in my electorate. It is a wonderful opportunity for young people who may not have had any experience with business to get a very broad understanding of what a company is about.
For kids whose parents are not affluent and do not have ready access to a supply of annual reports of major companies, to go through the process of actually putting one together—going through a detailed computer simulation so that they start to understand various relationships in business and doing simple things like putting on a trade show and making a short commercial—really enlivens their interest. I suspect that many of them who have not thought about careers in those sorts of areas might well be stimulated to do so. It is always difficult for schools, particularly those in low-income areas, to get the necessary money together to run an Australian Business Week. Anything that can make Australian Business Week more affordable and more accessible to a larger range of students is to be welcomed.
Schedule 5 of the bill deals with the debt to equity rules and the treatment of at-call loans. While Labor will support these amendments, they are another example of a government bending over backwards not to offend anyone in an election year. This time it is small business. New debt/equity rules were introduced from 1 July 2001. Whether an interest is considered debt or equity has important taxation consequences. In particular, if it is considered debt then an interest expense can be claimed by a business.
At-call loans are typically made by small business owners to their own businesses, have no fixed term and are repayable on demand. Transitional rules allowed certain related party at-call loans entered into between 21 February 2001 and 31 December 2002 to be considered a debt interest, so that an interest deduction would continue to be available. The amendments in this bill will extend the transitional period until 30 June 2005, with the effect that any at call loans made to a company by a connected entity on or before that date will be treated as debt interests under the debt to equity rules so the company will continue to be able to claim an interest expense. While this will allow small businesses more time to adjust to the new rules, these amendments are largely driven by opposition to the new rule from the small business sector and are yet another example of the Howard government putting off a potential problem until after the election.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I hear cries of pain and protest from the minister at the table, and I have to say that I agree with him that the previous speaker has completely misunderstood the government here. This is a very strongly directed and well-guided government that has made decisions in the interests of small business. It has listened to small business. It has an excellent minister listening to small business, understanding what needs to be done and getting the Treasurer and Treasury to understand that some changes were needed—and those changes were made. The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 4) Bill 2004 is an interesting bill. I will briefly run through what is in it and then make some more general remarks.
The proposals in this legislation deal firstly with consolidation rules. The consolidation process is one that has caused some pain to the industry, where there has been some lack of clarity and some unnecessary prescription. These amendments allow greater flexibility, and I am delighted to see that they have been introduced and will pass the House today and the Senate shortly. The bill gives effect to measures that allow certain changes. Where there is an external administration, those certain changes will allow entities to be brought within the consolidation process. The legislation also includes the modification of tax cost setting in relation to finance leases, the application of cost setting rules for certain types of mining expenditure, low-value and software development pools, and notice requirements for inter-entity loss multiplication rules. All of these are applicable under schedule 1 of these changes. I think they are commendable and necessary and will clarify a number of areas.
I understand the provisions regarding the copyright collecting societies, and there seems to be adequate protection. The previous speaker mentioned the fact that there could be some loss of revenue and some opportunity to delay the application of taxation through societies responsible for collecting copyright. I understand that point, and it is one that I agree with. The simplified imputation system and consequential amendments are part of this legislation. In the schedule relating to specific gift recipients, an interesting list is produced of those organisations available to be recipients. I pick up one in particular, which is particularly close to me and the member for Parramatta, and that is St Patrick's Cathedral Parramatta and the rebuilding fund. A marvellous edifice has been built, and I am proud that the government has extended the period for which deductions for gifts to DGRs are allowed and that St Patrick's Cathedral Parramatta was one of those. Previously, gifts must have been made after 24 February 1998 and before 25 February 2004. Now it is proposed that gifts may have been made after 24 February 1998 and before 1 July 2004, which has extended the period, and justifiably so. It is of benefit to that great reconstruction program following the disastrous fire which occurred at St Patrick's. 
I want to make some general remarks about taxation, because I think that we need to look at the record of the government in regard to taxation. In particular, I would like to list some of the government's achievements, because this legislation impinges on some of the achievements, and they all point to a government which is in charge, on the job and making changes to get effective results. I refer in particular to the first initiative, which was the $12 billion personal income tax cut which took place on 1 July 2000. It was a massive change to the way in which people could look at their income and predict a certain sustainability. I think that the economic status of Australia—the envy of many similar nations—has been brought about by the freedom that people feel to be able to plan ahead and make investments and decisions.
That initiative was followed by a further personal income tax cut on 1 July 2003, which was worth $10 billion over a four-year period. The tax cuts in the 200405 budget give tax relief to middle-income and higher income tax earners matching the previous decision, and the total value to those people, who missed out on the earlier rounds of tax relief, was $14.7 billion over four years. The tax cuts for older Australians in changes to the 200001 budget provided $4 billion to older Australians over a four-year period. The family tax benefits, which were introduced in July 2000, provide benefits of about $10 billion per annum to Australian families.
These are all parts of a regime giving back to people part of the money that they have paid in the form of taxation. The largest package of assistance to families ever to take place and ever to be put into operation by an Australian government was announced in the 200405 budget at a cost of $37 billion over four years. It included increases to the family tax benefits and a maternity payment of $3,000. The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate provided about $600 million to taxpayers over four years from 1999-2000. Refunding excess imputation credits provides extra benefits to many older Australians, particularly those investing, and is of great benefit to many. The changes to the capital gains tax for individuals are significant, halving capital gains tax.
In comparison, I have to say that the Australian Labor Party has opposed every one of these tax cuts. Prior to the 1993 election, Labor proposed l-a-w law tax cuts which were never delivered. I understand that the Australian Labor Party is reviewing the private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent, and we have yet to hear whether that will be delivered or not.
In addition to these reforms, the indirect tax has been able to provide a direct payment to states and territories, which is a key element in the new tax system. It has only taken four years since the introduction of the new tax system to see that the states and territories are better off than they would have been had tax reform not been implemented. That means that, in 200405, every state and territory will receive more revenue from the GST than they would have under the previous system of financial assistance grants and the state and territory taxes that were abolished by the new tax system.
Under the indirect tax system changes, 10 tax types were abolished. The first was the wholesale sales tax. Another nine have been or are in the process of being abolished. They include the financial institutions duty, the stamp duty on marketable securities, the bed tax and the bank account debits tax—that is, the BAD tax. They will be abolished by 1 July 2005.
 An intergovernment agreement has been established for the reform of Commonwealth-state financial relationships. Leases, mortgages, debentures and stamp duties which have been put in place by states on a whole range of products are under review, so further review and change to taxation is on the way. Also, there has been the abolition of the twice a year automatic indexation of petrol excise, which has cut around $2.5 billion from government income over the four years from 200102. This government has also cut excise by 1.5c per litre, which is worth about $2 billion over the four years from 200102. Business taxes have been reduced. There has been simplification and extension of the capital gains tax and rollover relief for small business; CGT exemption for active assets on retirement; measures to promote investment in venture capital; a simplified tax system for small business; a number of integrity measures to improve the fairness of the tax system; and consolidation reforms, which are dealt with by this bill that is before the House today. All of these proposals were opposed by the Australian Labor Party; none was really part of its agenda. 
On top of these measures, there has been consideration for families, particularly families with children. From 1 July 2004, new parents have received a non-means-tested payment of $3,000, replacing the existing baby bonus and maternity allowance. This will rise to $4,000 on 1 July 2006, and $5,000 on 1 July 2008. Labor has promised to means test all of these measures.
They are the general measures that I want to refer to, because they are very significant and bring huge changes to the way in which this country looks at taxation. It is no surprise then to find that the government has delivered seven surpluses since 1996 compared with nine deficits by Labor over 13 years. After coming to office in 1996 and dealing with the budget black hole, we are now in the black with $33 billion. When we took office, the Labor Party was $74 billion in the red, which included $69 billion of deficits in the last five years of their office. While we continue to return surpluses, most OECD countries are expected to record budget deficits in 200405. Since reducing this debt from around $96 billion, which is 19 per cent of GDP, to about $26 billion, which is three per cent of GDP, we have found that there has been a $5.5 billion reduction in net interest payments and that has been moved to priority spending like health, education and security. There is no doubt about it: relieving Australians of debt has paid big dividends to the average Australian. There was some hard work in the early years, but we are now reaping the benefits. I commend this government for both this legislation and the general thrust of its policies.",REPS,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 4) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I thank the member for Mitchell and the assistant shadow Treasurer and shadow minister for revenue, the two speakers who have addressed this bill this evening, for their comments. The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 4) Bill 2004 gives effect to several taxation measures. Firstly, after listening to the concerns of business, the government is giving taxpayers greater flexibility and certainty as they move into this new consolidation regime. The bill clarifies the consolidation cost-setting rules with respect to financial leases, certain types of mining expenditure and low-value and software development pools. The changes also reduce compliance costs by alleviating the notice requirements under the inter-entity loss multiplication rules. As the new consolidation regime has changed the taxation landscape for many corporate groups, the government has continued its active consultation with business on its implementation. This bill further demonstrates the government's commitment to this process. 
Secondly, this bill ensures that copyright-collecting societies are not taxed on income they collect on behalf of members. The provisions will ensure that copyright-collecting societies that are appropriately structured and administered are exempt from income tax on certain types of income that they derive and hold pending allocation to the final recipients. The provisions will also ensure that any amounts of income that are exempt at the society level are included in the assessable income of the recipients once these amounts are distributed to them.
The third measure implements a further component of the simplified imputation system, including anti-avoidance rules in relation to exempt entities that are eligible for a refund of imputation credits. The bill also makes a number of consequential amendments to the income tax laws to replace references to the former imputation system and to update terminology of the former imputation system.
The bill also specifically lists a number of organisations as deductible gift recipients, some of which have been alluded to here today, particularly by the member for Mitchell. This includes adding certain fire and emergency services bodies as specifically listed deductible gift recipients. Deductible gift recipient status will assist these organisations to attract public support for their activities.
Lastly, this bill will extend an existing transitional rule in the debt equity rules for at-call loans. Current transitional arrangements which treat at-call loans as debt for income tax purposes end on 30 June 2004. After this date, such loans may be classified as equity interest for tax purposes. To provide additional certainty for business, the existing transitional rules will be extended to at-call loans before, on and to 30 June 2005. In the meantime the government will develop a carve-out from the debt equity rules to reduce unnecessary compliance costs for small businesses using at-call loans. This will address small business concerns about red tape while maintaining the integrity of the debt equity tax rule. I commend this bill to the House.
Question agreed to.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004 is the fourth tranche of legislation implementing the government's reforms to international taxation announced in the 2003-04 budget. The reforms to international taxation followed a long process of consultation with industry which at the beginning offered the hope of substantial reform of Australia's international taxation regime to meet the challenges of globalisation and international tax competitiveness. These hopes were never realised. The measures in this bill and its three predecessors represent a bare minimum set of changes intended to reduce compliance costs and remove some completely unnecessary impediments to Australian business. 
The more significant international tax reform options—streaming and a tax credit for foreign dividends—were left on the shelf, largely because of the cost, estimated by Treasury at between $520 million and $590 million per year. Streaming and tax credits for foreign dividends would have made it easier for Australian businesses to expand offshore and to attract foreign investment to Australia. Those options would also be easier to integrate with our domestic tax regime than the alternative approach of returning to a classical system of fully taxing dividends in the hands of shareholders but cutting the company tax rate, as has been done in Ireland.
Despite $52 billion in net new spending, the budget was a lost opportunity in many areas. The government did not have the foresight, vision or, because of its pork-barrelling, the money to undertake a major reform of Australian's international taxation regime. Labor will support the measures in this bill, the most important of which remove impediments for the Australian funds management industry to attracting foreign business.
Schedule 1 deals with the capital gains tax treatment of foreign residents. Under current tax law, foreign residents investing in Australian assets directly or through a foreign resident fund are given more favourable taxation treatment than are foreign residents investing through Australian managed funds, or fixed trusts. The tax law effectively impedes foreign residents investing in assets through Australian managed funds, stifling employment growth in the managed fund industry in Australia. The amendments in this bill aim to more closely align the capital gains tax treatment of investments made by foreign residents directly or through foreign managed funds, and investments made through Australian managed funds.
Currently, if a foreign resident disposes of an interest in an Australian managed fund, a capital gains tax event is triggered—and I am really surprised that the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, did not do something about this when he was Minister for Financial Services and Regulation. This occurs even where the underlying assets of that fund are without the necessary connection to Australia to trigger a capital gains tax event if those assets were held directly.
Foreigners are therefore penalised for investing in those assets through Australian managed funds rather than investing directly in those assets. As a consequence, foreigners have not been able to use Australian managed funds, which otherwise would have a comparative advantage in that they understand investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific. The changes will result in a capital gains tax event being triggered only if more than 10 per cent of underlying assets of an Australian managed fund have the necessary connection with Australia. This provides closer alignment of the tax treatment of foreigners investing directly and foreigners investing through Australian managed funds.
In addition, capital gains or losses made by foreign residents due to the disposal of assets by an Australian fund will also be disregarded where the gain or loss relates to an asset without the necessary connection to Australia. This change will again ensure that foreign residents are not penalised for holding assets through Australian managed funds. A CGT exemption will also be provided where distributions of foreign source income are made from a fund to a foreign resident. This effectively allows foreign income to flow through an Australian managed fund to a foreign resident. This is appropriate, as foreign residents investing directly in assets generating foreign source income are in general not subject to capital gains tax. 
Schedule 2 will ensure that foreign residents are taxed in the same way on foreign source income derived from foreign assets held through Australian managed funds as they are on income from directly held foreign assets. Under Australia's international tax treaties, income derived by a resident of a treaty partner that may be taxed in Australia is deemed to have a source in Australia. Where residents of a treaty partner invest in foreign assets through an Australian managed fund, it is possible to tax income from those foreign assets in Australia; therefore, that income is currently deemed to have an Australian source. If this situation were not corrected, residents of treaty partners would be taxed on income from foreign assets where they invested through Australian managed funds but residents of non-treaty partners would not be taxed. These amendments effectively allow foreign income to flow through an Australian managed fund to a resident of a treaty partner without being subject to Australian tax. These amendments will improve the competitiveness of Australian managed funds in providing services to foreign investors.
Schedule 3 deals with withholding tax provisions. Withholding tax has the effect of increasing the cost of capital to Australian borrowers. The bill makes three changes to the interest withholding tax regime: first, it broadens the range of financial instruments eligible for interest withholding tax exemption by including debt interests; second, it complements the government's decision to treat certain upper tier 2 capital instruments as debt interests for taxation purposes by ensuring that non-capital payments on them are treated as interest for interest withholding tax purposes; and, third, it allows assets and debts to be transferred from Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks to their Australian branches without losing interest withholding tax exemptions.
With an election about to be called, this bill represents the final tranche of the review of international tax arrangement reforms that will be dealt with. The budget estimate of the cost of those international tax measures was $270 million over the budget year 2003-04 and the three forward estimate years. This raised concerns about the budget estimate because the direct cost of the UK double tax agreement was $280 million over four years. The government then introduced the International Tax Arrangements Amendment Bill 2003, which had a further cost of $62.5 million. Subsequently, the government introduced the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Bill 2004 with a total cost of $105 million over the forward estimates. This bill has a total cost of $20 million over the forward estimates. The total direct cost of the original $270 million RITA budget measures has now reached $467.5 million.
For a long time, the government refused to provide a reconciliation of the budget measure and the total cost of the reforms. Why the government chose not to be transparent on the actual cost of the RITA measures is unclear. I put it down to either total arrogance or not wanting to set any precedent that might involve greater transparency. Eventually, Treasury provided some information that allowed an imperfect reconciliation—in particular, that the cost of the original RITA budget measures also included an offset, which was the result of the government's decision to defer implementation of an earlier decision to provide franking credits for foreign dividend withholding tax. At the time the original decision to provide franking credits for foreign dividend withholding tax was made, in November 1999, the estimates of its cost were $340 million in 2002-03, $190 million in 2003-04 and $200 million in 2004-05. While these numbers do not coincide with the whole of the current budget year and forward estimates period, they do indicate a very substantial offset within that period for 2003-04 and 2004-05 totalling $390 million. 
While the likely cost of that measure may have changed, it is safe to conclude on the basis of the information provided by Treasury that the total direct cost of the RITA measures in the 2003 budget will be less than the $270 million estimate contained in that budget. It should also be noted that Treasury provided estimates in the explanatory memorandum for the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 2003 of the extra revenue from increased economic activity resulting from the UK double tax agreement of a further $70 million a year. Treasury's modelling shows this activity building up rapidly in the second year of the new UK double tax agreement and continuing at a relatively steady state thereafter. So overall the financial impact of the RITA measures has turned out to be insignificant, indicating a limited cost for limited reforms.",REPS,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I rise to speak in support of the New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004. This bill focuses on making the Australian managed funds industry more attractive to foreign clients. Australia has a significant managed funds industry facilitated by strong economic performance, a highly educated work force, low-cost infrastructure, advanced regulatory systems and a sophisticated financial market. In the 2003-04 budget period, following extensive consultation and a report to the Treasurer by the Board of Taxation, the government announced a package of reforms to international taxation. The measures contained in this bill are a further instalment of those reforms, and the proposed amendments relate to capital gains tax, treaty source rules and interest withholding tax.
Under current capital gains tax arrangements, non-residents investing in assets through an Australian managed fund may be taxed more heavily than if they invested directly in those assets or through a foreign fund. The measures proposed in schedule 1 of this bill will eliminate these distortions. The measures amend the law to provide comparable tax outcomes for foreign residents in Australian managed funds and are designed to reduce taxation impediments to further growth in this area. This will improve the international competitiveness of Australian managed funds, increasing their attractiveness to foreign investors and non-residents investing in Australia and the region.
Schedule 1 of this bill makes a number of changes to the Australian tax treatment of foreign residents that make a capital gain or capital loss in respect of an interest in a fixed trust. Presently, parts of the income tax law make it less attractive for foreign residents to invest in an Australian resident trust holding assets than it is for them to invest directly in those assets. This makes the Australian funds management industry, which commonly uses trusts to pool funds and manage investments, less competitive and efficient than it would otherwise be. It also discourages foreign investment in Australia more generally.
The amendments in schedule 1 of this bill seek to overcome these problems by more closely aligning the tax treatment of foreign residents who invest in fixed trusts with the tax treatment of foreign residents who invest directly in assets in Australia or abroad. This will mean that the tax law will no longer impede foreign residents who seek to invest in assets through Australian resident trusts, including managed funds. The amendments provide a capital gain or capital loss that a foreign resident makes from a capital gains tax event happening to an interest in a fixed trust that is disregarded where the assets underlying the interest in the trust do not have the necessary connection with Australia. 
There are nine categories of assets with the necessary connection with Australia listed in the table in section 136-25 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Assets listed in the table include land in Australia, shares in an Australian resident private company, holdings of at least 10 per cent of the units in a resident unit trust, an interest of any size in any other resident trust, and holdings of at least 10 per cent of the shares in a resident public company.
Schedule 1 to this bill changes the law so that a capital gain or capital loss made by a foreign resident on an interest in a fixed trust, the `first trust', will be disregarded if at least 90 per cent by market value of the trust's assets are without the necessary connection with Australia. A capital gain or capital loss will also be disregarded if at least 90 per cent of assets held by other fixed trusts in which the first trust has an interest, directly or indirectly, through a chain of fixed trusts, are without the necessary connection with Australia.
A capital gain that a foreign resident makes in respect of an interest in a fixed trust is disregarded where the gain relates to an asset without the necessary connection and an exemption to capital gains tax for a distribution of foreign source income by the trustee of a trust to a foreign resident beneficiary. Reflecting the conduit principle of international taxation, foreign source income flowing through an Australian trust to a non-resident is not taxed in Australia. However, under current arrangements when a trust interest is sold, previously distributed foreign source income is, on a delayed basis, subject to Australian capital gains taxation. On the other hand, non-residents investing directly or through an offshore managed fund do not pay Australian capital gains tax in respect of the foreign source income. This amendment will eliminate this distortion. I have also been informed that this will remove an impediment to foreign residents investing in assets through Australian fixed trusts, thereby making the Australian managed funds sector more internationally competitive. This should encourage foreign investors to use Australian funds managers to make investments in Australia and the region.
Schedule 2 of the bill amends the rules for determining the source of income derived by certain residents of treaty partner countries. The interaction of treaty source rules and other treaty rules relating to non-resident beneficiaries of income derived by business trusts operating in Australia has implications for the managed funds industry. This interaction may result in foreign source passive income derived by those foreign beneficiaries through an Australian trust being treated as sourced in Australia and therefore taxed in Australia. For example, an offshore customer invests in an Australian managed fund investing offshore. This interaction inappropriately exposes the offshore beneficiary to Australian tax on conduit income. The amendments ensure the domestic source rules, rather than treaty source rules, apply in this case. The effect of this amendment would be to relieve the conduit income from Australian taxation.
The amendments seek to align the tax treatment of foreign residents who invest in managed funds and derive income from sources outside Australia with the tax treatment that would apply if those foreign residents made such investments directly. Where business profits are attributable to a permanent establishment, generally a branch, operated in Australia by a resident of a treaty partner country, the treaties provide that those profits may be taxed in Australia. In the case of a funds management trust, income from the investment of funds outside Australia may be attributable to activities carried on by the trustee through a permanent establishment in Australia. 
Australia's treaties also provide that where business is carried on by a trustee through a permanent establishment in Australia, a non-resident beneficiary who is presently entitled to the income of the trust will be deemed to carry on that business through that permanent establishment. These provisions were introduced to ensure that non-resident beneficiaries of business trusts operating in Australia would be taxed in accordance with the principles of the business profits article in our tax treaties. The interaction of the deemed source rules and the permanent establishment rules for beneficiaries of business trusts can have the effect that income derived by non-resident beneficiaries from funds management activities of the trust is deemed to have an Australian source even though the income arises from funds invested offshore. The amendments proposed in this bill will ensure that, where such income has a source outside Australia under the ordinary rules for determining source of income for domestic law purposes, the income will continue to have a foreign source.
Under the current law, the business profits articles of Australia's treaties provide for the taxation in Australia of income attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of the treaty partner country in Australia. Attributable income can include income that might normally be considered to be sourced outside Australia. The source rules applicable to Australia's treaties provide that where Australia has a taxing right over that income of a resident of the treaty partner country under the treaty, that income is deemed to have an Australian source. Where the trustee of a managed fund has a permanent establishment in Australia under the treaty—regardless of whether the trustee is an Australian resident or not—and, in the course of carrying on a business of funds management through that permanent establishment, it invests funds offshore, the income from such investments will be attributable to that permanent establishment. This income is currently deemed to be sourced in Australia and will be subject to tax in Australia.
The deemed permanent establishment rules for non-resident beneficiaries mean that this result also applies to the beneficiaries. By exempting from Australian tax, foreign-source income derived by Australia's fixed trusts, to which foreign-resident beneficiaries are presently entitled, will remove tax barriers to foreign residents investing in assets through Australian fixed trusts, such as managed funds. In turn, this should improve the international competitiveness of Australia's managed funds industry, enabling the industry to attract more offshore funds for investment in Australian and foreign assets.
Ensuring that such foreign-source income is no longer subject to Australian tax will reduce compliance costs for resident investors in Australia's managed funds, and trustees of fund managers will no longer be required to withhold tax in respect of foreign-source income. In removing Australian tax in these cases, the amendments will improve Australia's international competitiveness in providing funds management services to foreign investors.
Schedule 3 to this bill amends the taxation law relating to interest withholding tax arrangements and impediments. There are three distinct amendments that relate to the imposition of income tax withholding. They seek to ensure that IWT provisions operate as intended and are consistent with recent developments in tax law. These changes will allow Australian businesses generally to take advantage of global opportunities to lower their cost of debt and facilitate efficient business structures. 
The first amendment broadens the range of financial instruments eligible for IWT exemption by adding `debt interest' as a debt for tax purposes. It arises as a consequence of the introduction of the debt-equity rules in 2001. While the concept of `interest' in the IWT provisions was partially aligned with the new debt-equity rules in 2001, the concepts of `debenture' and `offshore borrowing' need to be similarly updated to make the IWT provisions work as intended. This current measure will ensure that payments on financial instruments now treated as debt for tax purposes, including certain redeemable preference shares, will also be exempt from IWT, provided that certain conditions are met, if those payments qualify as `interest'.
The second amendment treats payments of a non-capital nature made on certain upper tier 2 hybrid capital instruments as interest for IWT purposes. This amendment complements the government's decision, announced in March 2003, to introduce regulations to treat as debt for taxation purposes certain upper tier 2 capital instruments issued by authorised deposit-taking institutions that are banks. This amendment ensures that non-capital payments on such instruments are interest for IWT purposes. This change, together with the first set of amendments, will ensure that these payments are exempt from withholding tax in the appropriate circumstances.
The final amendment allows additional assets and debts to be transferred from Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks to their Australian branches without losing IWT exemptions. In 2001, changes were made to the IWT legislation to allow non-resident companies, including foreign banks, carrying on business through permanent establishments in Australia to issue debentures that qualify for exemption from IWT. However, the legislation allowing debentures issued after 18 June 1993 to be transferred from Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks to their branches without the loss of IWT exemption was not amended. Therefore, the banks' subsidiaries could not transfer debentures issued after that date to their branches and then wind-up their subsidiaries without the loss of the exemption. The final amendment ensures that the IWT exemption is not lost if IWT-exempt instruments are transferred from an Australian subsidiary of a foreign bank to a branch. This will facilitate the transfer of all business from foreign banks' Australian subsidiaries to their Australian branches, if they wish. The amendments are expected to reduce compliance costs for the taxpayers affected.
The size of Australia's funds management pool, and its prospects for continued growth, is drawing global firms to establish operations in Australia. The resultant clustering of activity and the concentration of expertise has created a robust domestic industry. This infrastructure provides the framework for Australia to become a funds management hub for the Asia-Pacific region and these reforms will remove the impediments to achieving that goal.
The measures in this bill are a further instalment of the reforms to implement the government's response to the review of international taxation arrangements. The measures are consistent with the government's policy objectives of enhancing the competitiveness of Australian based managed funds and removing barriers to Australia's development as a global financial services centre. There has been strong business support for the bills, and the business community has played a valuable and constructive role in helping to develop the proposed legislation. This bill again demonstrates that the government has listened and been responsive to industry calls for specific tax reforms to remove the distortions from the tax system and allow Australian businesses to grow and prosper. The future of the Australian economy is fundamentally linked to global prosperity and to Australians being a part of that prosperity. This bill is an important part of modernising Australia's international tax system to make the most of Australia's potential to market financial products to foreign investors. I commend the bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>NEW INTERNATIONAL TAX ARRANGEMENTS (MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I thank the members for Forrest and Hotham for their comments on the New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Bill 2004. In the 2003 budget, the Treasurer announced the outcome of the review of international tax arrangements, foreshadowing over 30 initiatives designed to modernise Australia's international tax system. In a statement at the time, the Treasurer said:
To maintain Australia's status as an attractive place for business and investment, the tax system needs continually to adapt to the increasingly integrated global business environment.
...	...	...
The package of reforms announced by the Government will improve the competitiveness of Australian companies with offshore operations. These reforms will reduce the costs of complying with the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules, reduce tax on foreign `active' business income, and effectively reduce foreign taxes by modernising Australia's tax treaties.
The reforms will encourage the establishment in Australia of regional headquarters for foreign groups and improve Australia's attractiveness as a continuing base for our multinational companies. The reforms will also enhance the competitiveness and reduce the compliance costs of Australian based managed funds.
The government first delivered on those announced reforms with the signing of the new tax treaty with the United Kingdom. That treaty was enacted last year. It provided significant benefits for Australian based multinationals operating in the United Kingdom. The New International Tax Arrangements Act 2004 and the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation and Exemption) (Other Measures) Act 2004 implemented many more of these initiatives. The changes reduce compliance costs and minimise the tax burden on the offshore operation of Australia's multinationals.
The bill before the House is a further instalment of these ongoing and important international tax reforms. This bill focuses on making the Australian managed fund industry more attractive to foreign clients. Australia has a significant managed fund industry facilitated by strong economic performance, a highly educated work force, low-cost infrastructure, advanced regulatory systems and sophisticated financial markets. Reforms in the bill reduce taxation impediments to further growth in this area. These changes allow Australia's managed funds to become more internationally competitive, increasing their attractiveness to nonresidents. Under current capital gains tax arrangements, nonresidents investing in assets through an Australian managed fund may be taxed more heavily than if they invested in those assets directly or through a foreign fund. Measures in this bill will eliminate these distortions. The size of Australia's fund management pool and its prospects for continued growth are drawing global firms to establish operations here in Australia. The resultant clustering of activities and concentration of expertise have created a robust domestic industry. This infrastructure provides a framework for Australia to become the funds management hub for the Asia-Pacific region, and these reforms will remove impediments to achieving this goal.
This bill has strong business support. As with all the international tax changes, I understand that the business community have played a valuable and constructive role in helping develop the proposed legislation. I look forward to their continuing involvement into the future. The future of the Australian economy is fundamentally linked to global prosperity and to Australia being part of that prosperity. This bill is an important part of the modernising of Australia's international tax system to make the most of Australia's potential to market financial products to foreign investors. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment (Oil, Gas and Other Measures) Bill 2004 addresses three separate issues. The first relates to extending duty free provisions relating to goods for oil and gas exploration and production activities. The second is a technical amendment to bring country codes into line with the international standard under the Customs Act. The third will impose an upper limit for alcohol content in grape wine to ensure consistency between the tariff for imported wine and the excise regime for domestically produced wine.
With respect to the first issue, item 22 of the tariff currently allows for the duty-free entry of goods for use in exploration or development activities in the oil and gas industries to the wellhead stage, except when substitutable goods are produced or capable of being produced in Australia.
I remind the House that it was this provision which caused the opposition some concern during the debate on the international unitisation agreement for the Greater Sunrise field in the Timor Sea. I am delighted that these provisions give me an opportunity to say that no-one could be more pleased than me that today, during a joint press conference with Minister Horta, Minister Downer expressed a preparedness to take a far more cooperative and friendly approach to negotiations over revenues from oil and gas developments in the Timor Sea. It was apparent to everyone that the bullying tactics adopted earlier by Minister Downer were not enhancing those negotiations and taking them forward, and we are delighted that he has changed his tune and is prepared to be more accommodating and to take a friendlier approach to those negotiations. Hopefully, this means that the Sunrise project is back on track and we will get an outcome in terms of those negotiations, the successful conclusion of which will have enormous economic and social benefit to both Australia and East Timor.
The new item 22 will accommodate changes in technology and extend the coverage to include re-entering an existing well, extending a well into a new oil or gas zone, and workovers for the maintenance of a well. This will be specified in the by-law under the new item 22. The changes will clarify an area which has been of considerable confusion for some time in the sense that the same goods and equipment used in exploration and development are also used in workover wells. Yet only some wells have been eligible for duty-free entry of goods under circumstances where those goods are not available in Australia. 
One example of the confusion created is that service companies using the concession could not always be sure at the time of entry exactly what type of well the goods and equipment would be used in. This would depend on future client needs and work sequencing. After the event, such companies could be exposed to audit and recovery of duty despite no mal-intent at the time of entry. To not allow item 22 to apply to workover wells would be inconsistent and discourage the drilling of these wells, which are aimed at maximising oil and gas recovery.
At a time when oil is being consumed three times faster than it is being discovered and petrol, diesel and LPG prices continue to rise, maximising oilfield recovery should be a key public policy objective. Australia's dependence on imported oil is fast approaching 60 per cent, exposing Australia and Australian consumers more and more to the whims of OPEC and, of course, to growing instability in the Middle East. This is an issue of great concern to the Australian community but one which the Howard government dismisses as a nonevent, saying in its energy white paper:
The level of security in transport fuels is not currently under threat.
Labor in government will be absolutely committed to lifting Australia's self-sufficiency.
The question has to be asked: when are we going to wake up? We have an enormous abundance of natural gas and coal reserves which can easily be transformed into liquid transport fuels. The technology is there. The only doubt in recent years has been the economic viability of such projects, but, with oil prices going through $US40 a barrel, there is no doubt that these are commercial projects. What is required is some leadership and some vision from the Commonwealth and some encouragement to the many market participants who have a role to play in the development of those resources. We are doing some great things in terms of LNG exports and opening up new markets. Similarly we must start to focus not only on domestic opportunities but on our domestic needs. We cannot continue to allow our dependency on imported oil to grow at the rate that it is growing currently.
In terms of maximising oilfield recovery in Australia, we would want to make workovers as attractive as possible and not penalise them with duty in circumstances where the equipment is simply not available in Australia. At the end of a field's life, operations are driven by marginal costs: as costs go up, less oil will ultimately be recovered. The public policy objective should be to get the last drop of oil out of every field and not to waste this valuable and finite resource. Failure to provide the right conditions to maximise recovery will result in lower tax receipts to government on behalf of the community and lower returns to project developers. Therefore Labor fully supports this amendment to the tariff.
The second issue, as I said earlier, is a technical amendment to bring country codes used in the tariff into line with international standards. The change will insert `PL' as the country code for Poland and `XC' as the country code for Wake Island. The change has no effect on customs duty applicable to goods from either country and is supported by Labor. The third measure aligns the customs duty with the excise regime for grape wine. Additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 in schedule 3 of the tariff will be amended to insert a 22 per cent upper limit on alcohol content of grape wine—defined by the note. This amendment will ensure that imported grape wine with a higher alcohol content than 22 per cent will attract a rate of customs duty equal to the excise on locally manufactured wine with that alcohol content. Labor supports the bill and commends the amendments to the House. ",REPS,"<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (OIL, GAS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I am pleased to rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Oil, Gas and Other Measures) Bill 2004. This is a relatively straightforward bill and I am pleased that the Australian Labor Party is supporting the government in terms of the amendments that are made to this bill. Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I would like to touch on some comments that were made by the member for Hunter. I am intrigued that the member for Hunter would claim that the Australian Labor Party is concerning itself with the prices that ordinary Australians pay at the petrol pump, and I am concerned that the Australian Labor Party claims that, by following Labor Party policies, Australians would be more inclined to be less reliant on overseas fuel imports and more reliant on Australia's natural resources.
Perhaps the member for Hunter should go and pay a visit to the member for Fremantle, the National President of the Australian Labor Party. As memory serves me, it was only a matter of a few months ago that the Australian Labor Party's National President, the member for Fremantle, was suggesting that it would be a good thing if Australian consumers paid $2.50 a litre for petrol. That is the Labor Party's policy as espoused by their national president; that is what she would like to see Australian consumers paying at the pump. It is a case once again of: do not be concerned with what the Australian Labor Party says it is concerned with; focus on what the Australian Labor Party is doing. The Australian Labor Party is about trying to introduce a policy that would see Australian people paying $2.50 a litre at the pump for their petrol. That is something that concerns me greatly.
I would like to turn briefly to remarks that the member for Hunter made about this government's tactics with respect to the Greater Sunrise oilfield in the Timor Gap. As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, it seems to me that the member for Hunter should concern himself with reading the report of the committee on the inquiry that we undertook with regard to the Greater Sunrise oilfield. The member for Hunter would see that there was no bullying involved. Despite the rhetoric that we have heard from those on the left of the political spectrum and despite the rhetoric we hear from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian government did the right thing by the people of East Timor both in terms of protection for them when the Australian Army was in East Timor and subsequently in negotiations over Greater Sunrise. They are getting a lion's share of revenue from that project and in every respect the Australian government has done the right thing by those involved in the Greater Sunrise oilfield—and by those involved with East Timor. Proof positive of this is not only the report that came from the treaties committee but also the fact that those companies that would be involved are very pleased with the way that the Australian government has gone about undertaking negotiations and also with the certainty that the Australian government brings to the table in this particular development. I make those remarks in passing, because the member for Hunter has made certain claims which, quite frankly, I cannot reject any more strongly than I have.
I turn now to the issues contained within the bill. As was espoused by the member for Hunter, the bill deals with three key issues. The first issue is the creation of a new item 22 and schedule 4 of the tariff. The second issue is an amendment to additional note 3(a) in chapter 22 in schedule 3 of the tariff and the insertion of a 22 per cent upper limit on the alcohol content of grape wine. The third issue is correction of the country code abbreviations for Poland and Wake Island as specified in schedule 1 of the customs tariff. 
The first change replaces existing item 22, which is concerned with goods used in oil and gas exploration. This change is necessary due to a number of changes in detection and exploration technology as well as in the preproduction development of wells on those deposits in the oil and gas industries. These changes extend the reach of the item, and the new by-law reduces the cost of particular goods for importation by allowing duty-free entry, provided suitable Australian made goods are not available. In that regard, there is suitable incentive to ensure that Australian made goods are used, but, when they are not available, there is no disincentive that would affect the ability of companies to use those goods with regard to oil and gas exploration and predevelopment of wells.
This particular change addresses a number of industry concerns by reducing the cost of imports as well as maximising the recovery of Australia's petroleum resources, which promotes this government's objective of encouraging a good environment for investment and enhanced productivity. The reality is that the desire for there to be a stronger and more sustainable long-term investment in Australia's natural resources, particularly with regard to oil and gas, is not a monopoly held by the Australian Labor Party; rather, the Howard government is demonstrating a concrete way of achieving this realisation.
The second issue inserts a 22 per cent upper limit on the alcohol content of grape wine, as is defined by the note. This effectively ensures there is a level playing field whereby imported grape wine with more than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol will have the same excise duty payable on comparable locally produced grape wine.
Finally, the bill corrects the country code abbreviations for Poland and Wake Island, specified in schedule 1 to the customs tariff, to ensure the codes are consistent with those used by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This will not have an effect on the duty applicable to goods imported from Poland or Wake Island or on the margins of tariff preference those countries are subject to. I commend the bill to the House. I am pleased that the Australian Labor Party is supporting the bill. I certainly hope that it travels easily in the other chamber.",REPS,"<title>CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (OIL, GAS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—in reply—The Customs Tariff Amendment (Oil, Gas and Other Measures) Bill 2004 contains several amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. First, the bill replaces item 22 in schedule 4 of the tariff. Item 22 provides duty-free entry for certain goods for use in oil and gas exploration, provided that substitutable goods are not available from Australian manufacturers. The new item 22 reflects changes in technology in the oil and gas industries and extends the coverage of the item. The new item 22 will reduce the cost of certain goods imported for use directly in connection with exploration for, and discovery of, oil and gas deposits, and the preproduction development of wells on those deposits, by allowing duty-free entry of those goods provided that substitutable goods are not available from Australian manufacturers.
Secondly, the bill amends additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 in schedule 3 of the tariff by inserting a 22 per cent upper limit on the alcohol content of grape wine, which is defined by the note. The amendment ensures that, under the tariff, wine of fresh grapes that does not comply with the revised additional note will attract excise equivalent rates of customs duty. Finally, the bill amends the country code abbreviations for Poland and Wake Island, to ensure consistency with international standards. On behalf of the government, I thank those honourable members who participated in the debate and I commend the Customs Tariff Amendment (Oil, Gas and Other Measures) Bill 2004 to the House.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—It is like Groundhog Day. Here we are again debating the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004, which has already been debated in this parliament, by the government's own reckoning, 43 times. This is the 44th time.
—That is a significant figure. There were 43 eminent people.
—That is right; there were 43 eminent people who this week produced a declaration that the government had been less than honest in discharging its obligations to the Australian people. They are right and this bill tonight is yet another example of the government's dishonesty, because this bill is already a double dissolution trigger. It may be the first time in Australian history that a triple dissolution trigger has been debated. There is no constitutional provision for this. The government is so keen to demonstrate its support for the small business community that it has brought this bill on, but what it in fact reveals is that the government treats the small business community with contempt. The small business community are well aware of the government's tactics and the facade that is the debate on this legislation.
The small business community will take no heart from the government reintroducing this bill, because the small business community actually want to see an agreement between the government and Labor on a streamlining of the unfair dismissal processes. The fact is that Labor has developed practical proposals for the streamlining of the unfair dismissal processes that would be of real and lasting benefit to the small business community, and the government have refused to even discuss the matter. The reason the government have refused to discuss Labor's amendments, as contained in the private member's bill, is that they have no intention whatsoever of assisting the small business community of Australia. Rather, they treat the small business community with contempt, by thinking they can go back to them and say, `We pursued this bill for the 44th time.'
Labor have made it clear—and we continue to hold the position—that we oppose this legislation. When will the government get the message? I made this clear in a speech to the parliament on 27 May, as my predecessors in this portfolio have made it absolutely clear. I made it clear the week before the minister reintroduced this bill on 3 June. 
The government claims that small business needs to be totally exempt from unfair dismissal laws. It claims that unfair dismissal laws create a huge regulatory burden for small businesses and that they are a disincentive to small business employment. But the fact is that the government's assertions in these matters are false. The statistics are as follows. In his second reading speech, the minister said that more than 96 per cent of Australian businesses are small businesses. That is true, but more than half of these are one-person operations that do not employ anyone. Yes, there are 1.2 million small businesses, but only 540,000 of them are employers, and at least half of these are not covered by federal unfair dismissal laws at all; they are covered by state industrial relations laws.
Nevertheless, around one million Australians are employed by businesses that employ fewer than 20 employees and are under the federal system. Why should these one million Australians have no protection from unfair dismissal whatsoever? If this bill were passed, it would create a two-tier system. It would mean that if you were employed at a business with 21 employees you would have some sense of job security but if the business that employed you had fewer than 20 staff you would wake up each day knowing that you could legally be dismissed at the whim of your employer, even if you had done nothing wrong, with no recourse whatsoever through the unfair dismissal laws. That is bad and unfair policy, and for those reasons Labor will continue to reject this legislation.
The government claims that, because unfair dismissal laws are costly and complex, small business should never have to deal with them. Labor take a different approach. We say, `Let's streamline the unfair dismissal system.' This bill would mean that small business employees who felt that they had been unfairly dismissed would have to resort to even more costly proceedings—very costly proceedings—under antidiscrimination law or common law action. This is a point I make to small business whenever I speak to them.
It is not as if there would be no alternative remedies if the unfair dismissal laws were in fact to be abolished for small business. Before the introduction of the unfair dismissal laws there were alternative remedies, and they would be available after those laws were abolished. Those remedies are common law actions and antidiscrimination actions. The problem is that, if these laws were abolished, then small businesses could be confronted with the spectre of employees taking common law actions or antidiscrimination actions which would be much more protracted, much more costly and much more disruptive for small business. Small business understands this simple proposition. The government also knows it. But, such is the contempt with which it treats small business, it is batting on with this legislation nevertheless.
Unfair dismissal laws were originally introduced to avoid these formal, expensive and protracted court proceedings. The Industrial Relations Commission is a low-cost, informal tribunal, yet the Minister for Small Business and Tourism has claimed, as recently as in the last week, that small businesses would be subject in the commission to filing fees of $1,000. In fact, there are no filing fees for employers at all—none. The only filing fee in the Industrial Relations Commission is for employees; there is an amount of $51.20 to lodge an unfair dismissal application. So, while the government claims to be easing the regulatory burden on small business employers, this bill would increase that burden by shifting claims to more expensive, more protracted proceedings in more expensive courts. 
I will speak now on the research on which the government has based its claims. Recall that the original claims were that if unfair dismissal laws for small businesses were abolished there would be 50,000 new jobs. I happen to know the source of that: it was Rob Bastian, who was then the head of the Council of Small Businesses of Australia, COSBOA. Rob Bastian told me that he made that calculation when he received a phone call. Someone from the media rang him up and said, `What do you think the impact of abolishing the unfair dismissal laws for small business would be?' and he said, `Oh, about 50,000 jobs.' So the government used that figure, and then it applied an indexation amount to it—so it got up to 55,000 and then 57,000 as this debate went on and on in the parliament.
The author of the original estimate readily admits that he made the number up, so the government has now moved to what it considers to be a slightly more authoritative source to support its claims. The government paid a favoured researcher $45,000 to come up with a report about how many jobs might be created if there were no unfair dismissal laws. That $45,000 research contract was awarded without going to tender, as ascertained by Labor senators during Senate estimates questioning. The resulting research paper is titled The effect of unfair dismissal laws on small and medium sized businesses, and it comes up with some very heroic results. Even though the report states that the cost `of unfair dismissal laws is a very difficult thing for businesses to quantify', it goes on and seeks to do exactly that.
The report about the potential job impact of unfair dismissal laws is based on responses from less than 10 per cent of the businesses surveyed. That has no statistical viability or credibility whatsoever. Of the 1,802 businesses surveyed, only 158 businesses answered the relevant question about the impact of unfair dismissal laws on hiring decisions. Of that tiny group of 158: 17 said that unfair dismissal laws had a major influence on a firm's decision to reduce employee numbers—that is 17 out of 1,802; 10 said that unfair dismissal laws had a moderate influence on a firm's decision to reduce employee numbers; and 14 said that unfair dismissal laws had a minor influence on a firm's decision to reduce employee numbers. In total, that is less than two per cent of the 1,802 businesses surveyed, and it is on that two per cent that the conclusions were drawn in this study.
The authors have aggregated these three responses and then extrapolated them to the rest of the small business population to get a completely shonky potential job creation figure of 77,000. I respect the fact that Rob Bastian at least had the honesty to admit that he made the figure up. So this is not much more than making the figure up. Based on two per cent of the respondents to this survey, this report has extrapolated to say, `We have proved that 77,000 jobs could be created if small businesses were exempt from the unfair dismissal laws.'
A very different report has been published researchers who are totally independent of both the government and the Labor Party. Dr Bill Robbins and Gerry Voll from Charles Sturt University undertook a study of regional small businesses—with no private sector funding; no private funding whatsoever. They presented their findings at a conference in February 2004. They found that, for 64 per cent of small businesses, the key reasons for hiring or not hiring staff were economic or work related issues. That seems to make sense. It is intuitively obvious. They also found that fewer than six per cent of the businesses said that their main concern was unfair dismissal laws. That is according to Dr Bill Robbins and Gerry Voll from Charles Sturt University. 
Small business employers did not all think that they should be exempt from unfair dismissal laws. Some 37 per cent said that they should not be exempt. It is true that 38 per cent said that they should be exempt, but 22 per cent said that they did not know and three per cent had no response. Obviously, many small businesses are happy to do the right thing by their employees and are concerned that their competitors should also be required to do so.
The Charles Sturt study noted that, even if every single claim for federal unfair dismissal had been against a small business, this would mean that less than one per cent of all small businesses has been affected by a claim since January 1977. It also noted that more than 70 per cent of unfair dismissal claims—against this one per cent of employers—never proceed to full arbitration as they are settled before then. The Charles Sturt report made the following conclusions:
The number of unfair dismissal claims against small business is not alarming but is confined to a very small number, the processes of settlement are not costly or difficult and the outcomes are not unfair.
The only thing that this survey confirms for the government is that small businesses have been made to fear unfair dismissal claims (and indeed employees encouraged to make claims) by its campaign of reform, although a pragmatic and innate sense of fairness still prevails and small businesses have not yet embraced removing this right for their employees.
So there you have it: these respected researchers saying that this issue has been heightened in the small business community by the campaign of the Howard government—the Howard government's campaign of fear. And here we are yet again—on the 44th occasion—discussing the same legislation that has been debated 43 times before.
Labor have a proposal that is workable, sensible and fair. Labor accept that the misuse of unfair dismissal proceedings is not a good thing, and we support measures to ensure that abuse of the system is stamped out. We have introduced a private member's bill to this effect, but the government not only did not support that bill but also was not even interested in discussing it. Labor's bill would have streamlined and improved the operation of the unfair dismissal laws while still protecting employees from unjustly losing their jobs. Labor's bill was designed to reduce costs and the time spent on cases by employers. Unlike the government's bill, Labor's bill would not leave small business owners vulnerable to expensive and protracted common law action or antidiscrimination action.
We have put forward constructive proposals to lift the red tape burden from small businesses struggling with the GST—through the ratio method. Similarly, our private member's bill is designed to address the real issues of most concern to small business. Labor's plan would lower costs, simplify procedures and reduce uncertainty and confusion for small business. Our plan is targeted at the unethical ambulance chasing agents who sit outside the unfair dismissal jurisdiction, approach people who do not have a good case and say to those people that they will provide support and advice on a contingency basis—and a very lopsided basis, where the fee is anywhere between 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the amount that is extracted from the small business. That unethical agent then goes to the small business with threats to draw out the unfair dismissal process to make it as time consuming and as costly as possible. Under duress in those circumstances, small businesses are, from time to time, bullied by unethical agents into a situation where they have to pay some money just so the case will go away. 
Labor does not support that sort of approach. Labor will create the circumstances whereby unethical ambulance-chasing agents who pursue cases that do not have any merit will not be allowed to operate in the system and will be deregistered from the system. That is Labor's commitment, as outlined in Labor's industrial relations policy that I released just a few days ago. It is a real, practical policy designed to address the issue at hand. But of course the government is completely uninterested. I urge the small business community to have a careful look at Labor's proposals and understand that Labor is genuine about streamlining the unfair dismissal processes for small businesses in the very small number of cases where problems do exist.
The dimension of this problem has been wildly exaggerated by the government for base political purposes—for no other reason than to instil fear into the small business community so that the government can say to the small business community that it is the party of small business and Labor opposes small business. That is completely inaccurate—it is wrong. Small business is right to treat the government with disdain for assuming that small business would be so naive as to respond to that very base political manoeuvre by this government.
I draw the attention of the House to an opinion piece written in the Daily Telegraph by Malcolm Farr, who says that he has direct experience of and an anecdotal interest in small business and unfair dismissal laws. This particular opinion piece was on 12 July 2004. It begins:
It must be confusing for some small business operators to be told, in violent bouts of Government fury, that their No. 1 problem is the inability to sack staff.
It goes on:
Small Business Minister Joe Hockey said another survey last month, by Australian Business Ltd, showed 75 per cent of its members saw dismissal laws as a major or moderate concern.
That was true, but as Labor frontbencher Craig Emerson pointed out, the survey found there was more concern about the Government's tax policies and red tape.
Whatever the surveys might say, anecdotal evidence, including some collected by this column, is that small business people can get by with current laws.
If existing laws (state and federal) deter job creation, why are we experiencing some of the lowest unemployment rates in a quarter of a century?
And perhaps more telling, figures show there is less and less use of the federal unfair dismissal system.
The column goes on to make what I believe is a very persuasive case that this government is engaged in a base political manoeuvre, and it is here, in its own version of Groundhog Day, yet again pursuing legislation that for very good reasons the Senate has rejected on something like 43 occasions.
There is a pretty good explanation for the reintroduction of this legislation and it comes from the words of the minister for small business—who is treated with complete derision by the small business community. The minister for small business in an interview of great candour and frankness on 22 June in the Australian Financial Reviewmade some startling statements. The front page story begins in this way:
It is no surprise that federal Small Business Minister Joe Hockey is struggling to win friends among what should be his core constituency. Hockey, who is keen to trumpet his background in small business, accuses the sector of having colourful accounting practices and poor corporate governance, and candidly admits he is unsure whether it would welcome his return to the portfolio after the federal election. `You would need to ask them,' he told the Australian Financial Review.
It goes on to say:
... many are frustrated by what they see as Hockey's failure to address their perennial concerns about red tape, training and ballooning compliance costs, despite his creation of the Small Business Council last year.
The small business community say the same thing to me. The small business community say the same thing in surveys that are conducted by Australian Business Ltd and other industry associations: that is, that their No. 1 problem is the red tape burden imposed upon them by this government. Their No. 2 problem is tax and the compliance burden associated with the GST and other tax obligations.
But the small business community tell me that they cannot get the minister for small business interested in these issues. I wonder why. I do not know that he is from the small end of town; it is pretty clear that he is from the big end of town. The minister says in this interview:
`Small business hasn't got the same corporate governance as larger businesses. Therefore poor corporate governance practices in small businesses are one of the biggest hurdles to transferability.' Warming to the theme, he declares that if he were not a politician, he would be a property developer—
I would have thought he would be a restaurant owner, but it says here that he would be a property developer. He says:
I've got real estate in the blood.
This is the minister for small business who is an embarrassment to the portfolio and an embarrassment to the Australian parliament. He wants to create any diversion that he possibly can from the real issues confronting small business—and they are the compliance burden of the GST and the regulatory burden that is imposed by this government.
Labor, through a private member's bill, has a greatly simplified process—it is an option—for lodging GST returns. It is called the ratio method. It is based on the historical experience of each small business and provides that the Australian Taxation Office, upon the request of a small business—if a small business wishes to exercise this option—provides that small business with a ratio based on the business's historical experience. That ratio would normally fall somewhere in the range of zero per cent to 10 per cent. A small business, having received that ratio—let us say it is 5.5. per cent—from the tax office, simply multiplies its GST sales for the relevant accounting period by the ratio—one calculation—and submits that amount to the tax office as GST paid. There is no annual reconciliation required.
It could not be simpler and the small business community tell me—I am sure they tell the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for small business too—that they think the ratio method is a very attractive option.
—It is so simple.
—They are bemused about why the Howard government would not embrace a simple GST calculation—a simple method. The answer is that the Howard government is long on rhetoric about simplifying the GST—this so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century—but has no real commitment to doing it. Is it any wonder that this streamlined new tax system for a new century has caused such compliance problems that an audit of the Australian Taxation Office's processes for the collection of GST has shown a very high level of small business concern and confusion? Here we are four years after the introduction of the GST.
The compliance burden of the tax system has mushroomed—exploded, in fact—under this government, and yet the government are not interested in simplifying it. Red tape has exploded under this government. There was supposed to be a streamlined new tax system for a new century, and yet the barometer of regulation in this country is the size of the income tax act. When the government came to office with the promise of reducing red tape by 50 per cent the income tax act ran to 3,000 pages. It now runs to well in excess of 9,000 pages. If you add in some of the other major taxes, it runs to well above 10,000 pages. 
So the regulatory burden on small business has exploded under this government, the compliance costs for the GST have exploded under this government and the minister for small business is not interested in dealing with these matters. Not only that; he is not interested in dealing with the issues of competition policy and reform of the Trade Practices Act. There is only one explanation for that, and that is that the minister for small business is the minister for big business—against small business. He is not interested in any constructive proposals to reduce the compliance costs for small business.
There is another massive problem confronting small businesses, medium businesses and large businesses in this country, and that is the skill shortage. The skill shortage being faced by businesses is already acute and can only get worse, yet in its $52 billion pre-election spending splurge the government has found not one extra cent for vocational education and training in this country. The very surveys to which I have referred and other surveys by the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have shown that the skill shortage has zoomed to the top of the priority list of concerns for business in this country, yet the government has no response to it whatsoever. In fact, in the industrial relations arena the government has in this parliament at this very moment a bill that would remove from awards any obligation on the part of employers to support the training of their staff. Again, there can only be one explanation for this, and that is that the government is firmly committed to taking vulnerable Australians down the low road to low skills and low wages. That is exactly the opposite direction to that needed to address the problem of skill shortages in this country.
Only Labor is committed to addressing skill shortages in Australia through its commitment to create 20,000 extra TAFE places and 20,000 extra university places a year. There is only one party in this parliament that is committed to easing the skill shortage and to looking at innovative solutions in relation to apprentices. What happened to the old apprenticeship system? Apprentices are not being put on at anything like the required rate, and reform of the apprenticeship system is needed in this country, but the government is deafeningly silent in terms of responding to the problem of apprenticeships and skill shortages in Australia. Instead, it continues to bring in stunts—time-wasting legislation such as this on Groundhog Day—when it should be addressing the No. 1 issue: skill shortages in Australia.
My colleague the shadow Treasurer delivered a speech a couple of weeks ago which addressed the whole area of new growth economics. He explained very clearly that it is vital that Australia engage in a new round of productivity growth, because the current round of productivity growth based on the economic reforms of previous Labor governments may be coming to an end. That is what the Productivity Commission is saying, and it is what the government's own Intergenerational Report forecasts—that is, from next year onwards, productivity growth will slump back to its mediocre 30year long-term average after a record-breaking decade. What are the new sources of productivity growth in the 21st century as identified by the shadow Treasurer, based on national and international literature? They are skills formation, innovation and infrastructure development. On all three counts, this government gets a massive fail. It gets an E, and the E does not even stand for effort. It has put no effort into this. It has simply coasted on productivity gains that have been harvested from the hard and comprehensive economic reform program of previous Labor governments. 
The problem is that the Intergenerational Report, using these forecasts of faltering productivity growth and the ageing of the population, comes up with the deeply worrying forecast that, from the end of this decade onwards—which is now only six years away—Australia's growth in per capita gross domestic product, which is the conventional measure of living standards, will be the slowest since the decade of the Great Depression. The alarm bells are no doubt ringing in the Treasury, but they are not connected to the Treasurer's office or the Prime Minister's office. This government should have been acting on the problem of faltering productivity growth years ago—back in 2000. Here we are in 2004, and the government has no program for skills formation in Australia, no program to support skills development and no effective program to support innovation. Instead, it spends the parliament's time and its time in a completely wasteful exercise on Groundhog Day, bringing legislation like this into the parliament. It is a disgrace, and the Australian people—and, most particularly, the small business community—will come to understand that this government has completely run out of ideas and puff and that it is essential for Australia's future that this government be tossed out at the coming election and a forward visionary Latham Labor government be elected.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—Now the member for Rankin has finished his contribution on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2004, I bet he does not stay around to get a little history on labour law during the member for Hotham's ascendancy as the president of the ACTU. If the member for Rankin had been around as an employer back in the seventies, he would have discovered that every award had a restriction. Union written awards had a restriction on the number of apprentices an employer could employ. The wording was quite clear. It was all about protecting the jobs of union members, because you could not get an apprentice to join a union.
That was pretty good. Then he lectured us on training, but he forgot that a previous member of this House, who is not unknown to me, called John Dawkins, brought in a training levy—another form of payroll tax—when he was Treasurer. He did not bother to remind small businesses—many of which have a casual work force because they need a lot of employees on Friday night or something of that nature—that under a Labor government they are going to be subject to a payroll tax. It will not be your gross payroll as applies in the states. It is going to be related to how many people you employ. You might be a small tavern operator. You and your wife might run it during the week, but if you put on a band, a musician or something on Friday and Saturday nights you will be over 20 employees in a matter of minutes.
What is this bloke up to? Why does he not explain to people what things were like? He talked about his idea of a new tax system. What do we call it? The ratio method. We used to have a ratio method for provisional tax, then the tax man introduced the uplift factor. You signed off one year at five per cent, and he wrote you a letter the next year that said: `Your business must have improved, therefore I've applied an uplift factor, and you will pay tax at six per cent.' It is all a matter of history. 
I just wonder how much this fellow realises about how his mates, including the member for Hotham, dealt with the small business community in the past. I remember it, both as a small business person and as a member of this House. I have stood here and watched it. I have watched all the truck drivers being told there would be no tax increases under l-a-w; the next thing was that their fuel tax went up by 3c or 4c a litre—and that is a lot when you are running a truck as a subcontractor.
The member for Rankin has lectured us on skills shortages. Time and time again in this place statistics have been quoted on how many more apprenticeships there are now. But have they ever gone back to their union mates and said, `Look, if someone chooses academic studies, they are no cost to the employer until they're a graduate.' The employer of the creme de la creme has no financial obligation until somebody turns up in response to an advertisement and says, `Here's my graduate certificate.' But what do we do with apprentices? On the day they start work they are paid wages but they are never there. Historically they learnt their trade on the job and they were of some worth to the employer. Today, as the employer will tell you, most of the time they are not there and their wages escalate to full tradesman's wages at a speed which is just beyond people's capacity to pay.
—What rubbish!
—It is not rubbish. A fool says it is rubbish. It is a fact; it is what happens. I can tell you because, unlike the interjector, I have actually employed people. Schoolteachers are great advisers to the small business sector; we know all about them. And we know who runs the ACTU today—not the Federated Storemen and Packers Union.
—Yes, that is great too. The member apparently does not know that the last two presidents of the ACTU have both been schoolteachers. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations constantly reminds us that in the private sector there is only 17 per cent trade unionism. It is about time someone did the analysis on how many of that 17 per cent are there to buy a job—no ticket, no start. They find the ticket easier to get than a clip behind the ear from Tom Domican or the likes of him.
—What's this got to do with—
—Of course it has plenty to do with it. You should have been in here, listening to your speaker. He ran off the rails and spoke about everything that you could think of relating to small business—and I am quite happy to follow that trend. If the member wants to talk about my contribution, she had better demonstrate that she has been out there at least working in a McDonald's when she was a kid—although I doubt we had McDonald's when she was a kid.
—No; we had Franklins.
—Right—and you went out and counted stock, did you? I am pleased to hear it. The reality is that the great argument of the member for Rankin is: this law does not really have any effect; it does not hurt anyone. If that is the case, why do we have it? If it is so ineffective and it is so loved by the small business community—I believe their belief is that you do not sack people unfairly and you value good staff—why do we need the law? Why do we need it in the first place? If 30 per cent—as he asserts—say, `We have a commitment,' they do not need the law, do they?
We have the constant parading in this place that small business proprietors have a habit of getting up in the morning and asking themselves: `Who can I sack today? Who can I get to sit in front of me so I can break their heart?' What a load of rubbish. The only time that a small business employer chooses to retrench someone is typically when they cannot afford to keep them, or—and quite properly so—when they do not fit into that business. Some are lazy, some are disruptive and some are incapable. I have employed thousands of people and have had to make instant assessments of them on occasions. 
You talk about training? There was not an apprenticeship for chefs when I first entered the hotel industry. Within 12 months of that opportunity being opened up, I put on two. To the best of my knowledge, both of those kids—in fact, middle aged men now—are still employed in that category. But then we started getting letters telling us how their wages were going to escalate. It was not that we did not want to go on training people and have them available within the work force; we just had to sit down and ask, `Well, do our kids eat? Is there enough money left?' We could not sack the chef—we had to have a chef—so we ceased employing them. We had kids queuing up. We could not manage as they escalated the cost. That is just a fact. It was not that we did not think it was a good idea and that we did not have a commitment. But here we go today with all this lecturing about training. The training record of the previous government by comparison with this government was disastrous. But go back to those awards. The awards limited the number of apprenticeships that an employer could have, when we had this wonderful totally regulated system, where you could not look sideways. As the minister has described, they even told you the size of the toilet and which way the door had to swing. How silly can that be.
This is the 43rd introduction of a fair dismissal bill. I am reminded by the second reading speech that there is plenty of protection for workers. The bill would not exclude employees of small businesses from the unlawful termination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. It will remain unlawful for any business in Australia, regardless of its size, to dismiss any employee for a discriminatory reason—for example, because of their age, gender or religion. In addition, all businesses in Australia will continue to be required to give employees appropriate notice of termination. In other words, there has been a law there for a long time to deal with the fundamental issues. But the member for Rankin said, `It doesn't matter. You can deal with people who steal from you.'
I happened to be in Alice Springs, staying at a motel, and got into conversation with the proprietor. Something came up about overseas travel and he said, `I've just got back from my proposed extended holiday.' He and his wife had done well in their business and they wanted to go overseas for two or three months, so they appointed a manager. This fellow seemed to be doing the job, so off they went. Then they got a frantic call from one of their loyal staff, saying, `You'd better come home. You'd better have a look at the books.' In fact, I am not sure if it was a loyal staff member; it might have been the bank manager, because nothing was going into the bank—from a big motel in Alice Springs. They got home and they were $40,000 short. They sacked the bloke, and he took them to court on unfair dismissal charges and won because the police investigations had not been concluded. That is not myth. That is not rewriting history. That is a fact. How do people feel about that small business?
We had another discourse from the member for Rankin where he said that the laws do not stop people employing people. Well, why have we got this massive rate of casual employment? One of the reasons is that it suits employers, depending on their demand for labour, and employees, depending on their need for employment. A hell of a lot of married women want that flexibility, to name just one category. The other reason is that a small business can keep an informal, casual arrangement going and not sack anybody; they just do not ring them up again. Is that good for workers? Does that give them reliability? There are people who consciously will not keep even reasonably qualified and capable workers on their payroll for too long for fear that if they were obliged to retrench them in a business downturn they will be taken up on these issues. 
We are told that it is only the ambulance chasers that pursue people for unfair dismissal cases. You might want to go and see how many times those people are represented by the union, maybe sometimes properly. But to suggest that the trade union movement are not ambulance chasers in this area is patently ridiculous.
Half of the member for Rankin's speech was about why this legislation was ineffective. So I say: why do we want to keep it? Why don't we just go back to the times when people dealt with their staff as best they could?
It has been pointed out that there are difficulties getting apprentices. That is true. Business is desperate in many cases to get more, and they are not there. Why? Because we have got high levels of employment and kids are maybe looking at other options. Even then, if you put on an apprentice and you are a self-employed plumber or electrician, what do you do when suddenly there is a downturn in the industry? What do you do—pull the kids out of school because you have an obligation to an employee? People are entitled to make a profit, if only to keep their family.
We have this silly law, and we have had a discourse that says, `It really doesn't hurt or affect anyone anyway—and people love it.' Well, they do not love it; they are frightened of it—and there is no need for it, because unfair dismissal is either covered under the Workplace Relations Act or it is not unfair. It is this old union scare tactic, `We'll save you,' when in fact they do not.
I thought it was pretty interesting to note these factors, because it was very interesting to hear the member for Rankin trying to calm the masses. The opposition have done it across their whole industrial relations argument: `It's all right. New South Wales is going all right, mate, therefore it will be all right.' It does not have to be all right; there has to be a need—it is a funny thing about the work force!
I well remember a great controversy in the north, in the Pilbara, when an excavator had to have two people squeezed into the seat. It was probably an occupational health and safety danger, because the seat was only designed for one person, but they had to have two. The crib for a train driver going out to the mine and back in a day to bring in a load of iron ore included a side of lamb. I do not know how many chops he ate on the trip, or where he managed to cook them, but you know what happened: the crib went straight home and mum handed him over some sandwiches for the trip.
That is where we were at. When Copeman and others moved in and the Western Australian government gave people the opportunity to do their own deal with the boss and get vastly improved wages in return for higher productivity, that was the result of picketing and all sorts of things. While that controversy was going on, people used to ring me up and say, `For God's sake, get these unions out of our hair. We want to do a deal with the boss. We're going to get more money. We're not frightened of him; we know how to deal with him. We've been to school. We are not kids being sent down the mines in Wales.' 
—What's that got to do with the bill?
—Mr Speaker, that is of some interest. She thinks we are talking about a bill other than the unfair dismissal bill.
—Why don't you talk about it?
—What are you embarrassed about?
—If the member for Throsby has a point of order, I will hear her.
—The point is that she is getting angry because she does not like history repeating and, as I said, I will repeat a bit of history in this place. When training became an issue under Labor, the first thing they did was put a payroll tax on workers. We had the training levy of two per cent. Remember that? That was a great help! It did not help anyone; it just went into the coffers.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—It gives me no pleasure to have to again bring to the attention of this House the actions of Qantas in regional Australia and, in particular, in Central Queensland. I wish to refer specifically to the Central Queensland coalmining town of Blackwater. Blackwater is one of a number of Bowen Basin towns currently enjoying somewhat of a boom, and business opportunities are increasing for all types of businesses. One company, BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance, BMA, operates seven mines in Central Queensland and has been a Qantas account holder for many years. BMA employs a large number of people and relies on regular and consistent flights in and out of towns like Blackwater.
On more than one occasion BMA inquired about flights and was assured that flights would remain frequent and convenient for customers. Unfortunately, this has not happened. From week to week schedules are changing, and recently all early flights were cancelled into Blackwater. As a result, rosters are difficult to maintain, costs have increased due to the hire of vehicles to transport employees from Emerald to Blackwater and, most importantly, this additional driving on unfamiliar roads has increased the risk of injury to BMA employees.
BMA is about to undertake a major construction project at Blackwater involving some 400 people over the next two years. It would be expected that many of these people would use air travel for their R and R and that many service providers would need to be able to fly in and out. But Qantas management has decided to vastly reduce the number of flights into Blackwater at the very time that business for them is about to increase. How can this be justified? What sort of business decision is this? I would say there is only one answer: Qantas management has made a decision to abandon regional Australia and concentrate on the Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne axis.
Qantas has reduced services all over Central Queensland and other parts of regional Australia. Qantas has treated the people of regional Australia with utter contempt. Qantas is attempting to use the people of regional Australia as a cash base on which to found its new cut-price, no service Jetstar operation. This downgrading of services by Jetstar and the effect that this has on regional Australia is the core of our problem. It is obvious that Qantas management has not the slightest idea about how to run a truly Australian company, servicing all Australians and understanding the needs of all Australians no matter where in Australia they live. 
A new example of this came to light recently. For many years young people in regional Australia have been able to travel to boarding schools or to visit their grandparents and other family members as unaccompanied minors on all airlines. Many families rely on this service for the education of their children and for keeping families in touch. In deserting regional Australia, Qantas has now abandoned this policy. Jetstar's conditions of travel say:
Jetstar generally requires that passengers are able to travel independently. We do not have the systems, staff or facilities required to assume responsibility for assistance and supervision of passengers. Children requiring supervision will not be regarded as able to travel independently on the basis that they may cause a disruption or endanger themselves or others if travelling unaccompanied ... Jetstar is not able to carry such passengers unaccompanied.
So we now have Qantas, an Australian airline which was founded in Central Queensland, abandoning the people of Central Queensland. One can only wonder what the founders of this great airline would think.
I want to take the opportunity this evening to express my appreciation to the management of Virgin Blue, which is moving to fill the service gaps at our major regional centres left abandoned by Qantas. I also note that Virgin Blue is now providing a number of new connecting services out of Brisbane to link with flights from regional Queensland. Again, these services were once provided by Qantas but have now been abandoned as part of the Qantas policy of leaving regional Australia behind. Those of us who live in regional Australia have seen the banks do a runner, we have seen this federal government cut services to regional centres and now we watch as Qantas, which was once our own airline, cuts and runs from service obligations to Central Queensland and my constituents.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Airline Services</title>,Adjournment,33,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—It is becoming very clear that there is a very significant disconnect between what ordinary Australian people—in particular those in country districts—are feeling and what the Howard government is doing in response to those people's concerns. You would never find a better example of this than in the budget recently brought down by the Howard government. In my electorate—and, I suspect, in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and in the electorates of other country members of parliament as well—a very large percentage of people will get no benefit at all from the tax cuts. In fact, the figures reveal that only six per cent of people in the electorate of McMillan earn incomes of more than $52,000 per year. So only six per cent of people in my electorate will get any benefit out of the tax cuts.
At the same time as this is happening, no additional support is being provided to ordinary age pensioners, who in many parts of rural and regional Australia are having to put up with increased rates as the value of their properties go up, increased costs of insurance and, because of the GST, the increased cost of living associated with their ordinary grocery and other expenses which they pay week to week. We know that people are doing it tough. We know that hardly anyone is getting any benefit out of these tax cuts. But still there is no support from the government for pensioners or for those people who have been identified as finding it particularly tough going at the moment.
We know as well that, in the Gippsland region, bulk-billing is down. You get no better illustration of that than in the West Gippsland region in the area around the Baw Baw Shire—Warragul, Drouin and Trafalgar—where bulk-billing has declined from 63 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent. We know that dairy farmers are struggling with a very low milk price and the federal government still continues to do nothing to provide a fair dairy market so that people can get a decent price for their product. We know as well that the federal government has been handling the import risk assessment for importing apples and pears from New Zealand in a disastrous way, which has created a lot of uncertainty for local apple and pear orchardists. We know that schools funding, as delivered by the Howard government, favours the category 1 schools, mostly based in Melbourne and Sydney.
There is a massive disconnect between what is going on in ordinary people's lives in country electorates in Australia and what the Howard government is doing. Whilst it might be seen in the newspapers that things are very close in the opinion polls, it is my belief that people are quietly very angry with this government—very angry indeed—and that will be shown on the day of the election.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Policy</title>,Statements by Members,35,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The opposition supports the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004. The bill contains offences which were originally introduced in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2004. Earlier this week, I set out the background to the development of that bill. After its introduction in the Senate, the government agreed to split the bill in two, and it reintroduced them into the House last week as two bills. The government has also referred this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 6 September. I am previously on the record as commending that committee in particular for the very productive, balanced and constructive work that it has done on the process of legislation in quite often controversial areas. Again I reiterate my congratulations to all members of that committee, from all parties.
This bill would create two offences which in summary relate to the use of a carriage service, including the Internet, to access or make available material which incites or counsels suicide or promotes or instructs on a particular method of committing suicide. The offences require the prosecution to prove—and this is important—an intention on the part of the accused to use the material or for another person to use the material or, where relevant, to incite, counsel, promote, instruct in or commit suicide. For those who are interested in the debate, I draw their attention to the specifics of the legislation rather than second-hand accounts of the legislation. It actually involves that element of intention, which is a necessary ingredient of the offence. I ask that those who would argue against this bill have regard to the specific provisions.
Each offence, if proven on the basis of the requirements of intention, carries a maximum penalty of 1,000 penalty units, which is equivalent to $110,000. There are, of course, offences in each state and territory relating to the incitement of suicide. They by and large tend to be incitement to suicide by a specific individual and carry very substantial penalties—in some cases, periods of penal servitude. The offences in those state acts are expressed in different ways, using a variety of terms. These include aiding, abetting, inciting, counselling, procuring, inducing or instigating suicide. As I have said, the offences carry a variety of maximum penalties that range from five years imprisonment to, in some jurisdictions, life imprisonment. The bulk of the jurisdictions have penalties at the higher end of sentencing.
It should be observed that all of these existing offences can be committed using a carriage service, including the Internet. In that sense, the bill does not extend the criminal law to this subject matter for the first time. Rather, it establishes specific Commonwealth offences in reliance on the telecommunications power in section 51 of the Constitution. The government has referred in debate to Internet sites and Internet chat rooms that provide explicit instructions on methods of committing suicide and, in some cases, encouragement to do so. This is of course a concern, given that people, and in particular young people, are increasingly likely to turn to the Internet when trying to cope with loneliness or depression—not necessarily for instruction in suicide but simply in search of help for their problems. 
I think anyone who advocates in favour of the cause of legislature agreeing to voluntary euthanasia should appreciate the potential risks of a young person, in particular, seeking support via the Internet and coming up to a site that actually promotes suicide. In the context of their mental framework they could see that as a justification for suicide or an acceptable way out of their problems rather than resolving them. We have in a democracy those who advocate a particular point of view, and understandably do so with passion, but when we are talking about extreme consequences it is important that passion, and in some cases dogma, does not blind to those potential risks those who are so advocating the proposal.
I have some personal interest with respect to this matter. Our family, the broader family unit, like so many Australian families, has experienced the consequences of a suicide in the family. It is something that cannot be ignored by those who would seek to agitate a broader political argument in favour of the issue of voluntary euthanasia in circumstances where someone faces a terminal illness. I draw that to the attention of those who would advance such an argument, in an uncompromising and dogmatic way, in seeking to oppose this legislation. I thought it appropriate to put those matters on the record. Moreover, delicacy is obviously required, even in the advancement of arguments in favour of euthanasia, whatever point of view you have on that matter.
It is clearly a difficult area to regulate and we must be careful to ensure laws are appropriately targeted at the issue. Many hundreds of members of the community have written to me expressing concern about the impact of the legislation on their right to campaign for law reform relating to voluntary euthanasia. As I have said, the right of Australians to advocate reform of the law relating to this or any other issue is fundamental to our democratic society. I note the government's statement that the offences are not intended to affect this right, but it is argued that fear of prosecution inevitably has a limiting effect on debate.
I believe members of our community are entitled to have the matter clarified beyond reasonable doubt to achieve that balance between the right to advocate in the interests of a cause that, unquestionably, people feel passionately about—that is, the right to voluntary euthanasia—and the other issues and the risks, particularly to young people, who I think it is fair to say are probably more likely to engage in Internet communication. Accordingly, I foreshadow that the Labor Party will be moving an amendment in the Senate which provides that the offence does not apply to the extent that it would infringe the implied constitutional freedom of political communication. There is in fact a precedent for this in the provisions included in the government's Anti-terrorism Bill (No.  2), which, as the Attorney-General's Department has said, recognises that legislation has an educative as well as a regulatory function.
We consider that the advocacy of reform of the law relating to euthanasia falls squarely within the implied freedom of political communication under its most recent formulation by the High Court in its decision in David Russell Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1997. Of course, the Senate committee will look more closely at these concerns and that proposal, with the benefit of more detailed submissions from the community and legal experts, and naturally we will consider any other recommendations that the committee might make for improvement to the drafting of these offences. Accordingly, the opposition support the passage of the bill in the House and we look forward to the Senate committee's report examining the broader issues.

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I rise today to offer my full support to the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004. This bill amends the Criminal Code Act 1995 to insert new offences in relation to the use of a carriage service, including the Internet, to access, transmit or make available suicide related material; and the possession, production or supply of such material with intent to make it available on the Internet. Crime and fear of crime continually rank amongst the highest concerns of the Australian community. The government share this concern and we are committed to taking a leadership role in assisting local communities to recognise local problems and find local solutions. We have delivered in full on all law and order election commitments since coming to government in 1996 and we are committed to fighting crime and violence through effective policing at a federal level, targeting issues including cybercrime, illicit drug importation, people-smuggling, organised crime, terrorism, money-laundering and fraud against the Commonwealth, and through crime prevention programs to stop crime before it happens. These programs are complemented by a host of other measures, such as enhanced intelligence collection, analysis and sharing within Australia to more effectively fight transnational and organised crime; uniform national firearms laws to ensure only those with a genuine need can own firearms; and model uniform national criminal laws.
Since 1996 we have committed $38 million for a range of initiatives aimed at reducing crime and violence in Australian society. One of our major initiatives in this area has been the National Crime Prevention Program. Building on the foundation of the program, this government committed $20 million in the 2004-05 budget to a new National Community Crime Prevention Program. This new initiative will focus on how to increase the community's capacity to respond to safety and crime prevention issues. The centrepiece of this initiative is a new National Community Grants Program. The sum of $16 million over four years will be available for a new nationwide competitive scheme, under which not-for-profit incorporated community organisations and local government associations can apply for funding to develop their own projects and strategies to tackle crime. Prevention still remains the best protection, and this new national crime prevention initiative demonstrates the government's commitment to empowering communities to deal with crime locally. We have not just talked about being tough on crime; we have implemented a tough comprehensive plan to provide a safer, more secure Australia for all Australians.
This bill introduces important new measures that will criminalise use of the Internet where the intention of that use is to counsel or incite suicide or to promote or provide instruction on a particular method of committing suicide. Internet use continues to grow, particularly in the younger age groups, and this government must protect these people from accessing such harmful information. The Internet is now used by 55 per cent of children aged between 10 and 14 years, whilst teenagers in the age bracket from 15 to 19 years have the highest use of any age group, at 63 per cent. At the moment many Internet sites are too easily accessible for these often unsupervised age groups, with some providing detailed instructions on methods of committing suicide. Some Internet chat rooms have even been found to host discussions where participants have urged others to attempt suicide online. Such potential offences highlight the urgent need for law reform in this area.
Important measures that will protect society's most vulnerable are contained in this bill, and they will help to prevent the Internet from being used for destructive purposes towards those individuals. It needs to be said as part of this debate that suicide is one of the most prevalent problems in society today, particularly amongst young males. Males aged from 25 to 29 have the highest suicide rates of any age group—over 30 per cent of every 100,000 deaths. Suicide accounts for a significant proportion of deaths amongst young people, with people in these age groups dying from few other causes. 
At the moment Internet service providers are responsible for web site content. As such, they should see that they have a moral obligation to society to protect such vulnerable groups from accessing materials on the Net that might provide encouragement or assistance in relation to suicide. Currently, this industry is highly unregulated and ISPs are not taking responsibility for their sites and the contents of them. With the introduction of this bill, this government seeks to protect young individuals where these private organisations refuse to do so.
The issue of censorship will always divide public opinion. This government attempts to find a balance between the need to protect people from material they find offensive, harmful, disturbing or even dangerous and the premise that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they wish. As a government we are committed to keeping up with technology and media convergence so that people can continue to make informed choices about entertainment for themselves and those in their care. The coalition will continue its program of ongoing review of classification schemes—including those for film, video, computer games, digital versatile discs and publications—to ensure that our classification system appropriately reflects community attitudes.
Findings from the Online Content Co-regulatory Scheme in 2000—required under schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992—relating to online content established that, firstly, Internet safety would be improved by more active promotion of filtering technologies by Australian Internet service providers. Options considered in the report included greater promotion of filtering to subscribers and/or requiring ISPs to provide filtering services on an `opt-out' basis. There should be greater promotion of the Australian Broadcasting Association's complaint process about offensive Internet content referenced or linked in spam emails. A revised industry code should address the delivery of Internet content on mobile devices and promote greater cooperation between ISPs and relevant law enforcement agencies, particularly in relation to investigations of potentially criminal behaviour in chat rooms.
In conclusion, such findings demonstrate that the government must take a stand against these practices where ISPs are currently unable to or refuse to. We as a government have a moral obligation to all members of Australian society to provide them with a safe environment—which, whilst this material is allowed to circulate on the Internet, we are not doing to the best of our capabilities. I therefore urge members of this House to pass this bill and protect our youth from the harmful content that they currently have access to. Through acceptance of this bill, this government will be helping to save the lives of many young, innocent individuals. For that reason, I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-11,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004. This bill seeks to criminalise a person's use of the Internet—in particular, to access, transmit to themselves, transmit generally, make available, publish or otherwise distribute material that directly or indirectly counsels or incites suicide with the intention that they or another person will use the material to counsel or incite suicide. To do so attracts a penalty of 1,000 penalty units, currently valued at $110,000. The reasoning behind the government's approach to this bill is explained by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who stated in his second reading speech: 
Currently there are a range of easily accessible Internet sites and Internet chat rooms that provide explicit instructions on methods of committing suicide and, in the case of Internet chat rooms, sometimes contain actual discussions where one person or even a group of persons urge another to commit suicide. Studies have shown that in some cases such Internet chat room discussions have led to a person attempting suicide, sometimes successfully.
The proposed offences reflect the harm that can be done by those who use the Internet with destructive intent and they will assist in preventing the use of the Internet in this way to encourage vulnerable individuals to take their own lives.
According to the parliamentary secretary, safeguards are in place to protect people from prosecution where they discuss but do not promote suicide. The parliamentary secretary states:
Advocacy of, or debate about, law reform on voluntary euthanasia or suicide related issues that takes place on the Internet will in no way be affected by the proposed offences, because these types of communications would not carry the requisite intention. For the same reason, the offences are unlikely to capture material such as research papers dealing with suicide related issues or suicide prevention, or support material.
On that basis, it is useful to consider just what `intent' means in Australian law so as to be sure that this bill will not have any unintended consequences; otherwise this bill will have purposes that are unintended by the government that will in turn impact on the community. Section 5.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act defines intention in three ways:
(1)	A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.
(2)	A person has intention with respect to a circumstance if he or she believes that it exists or will exist.
(3)	A person has intention with respect to a result if he or she means to bring it about or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.
The first definition is the most straightforward. It requires a person to want to do something to satisfy intent. The second and third definitions are not so narrow, as they require a belief of something existing now or in the future or, in the case of the last of the definitions, an awareness that it will occur in the ordinary course of events.
When I typed the search term `suicide: how to' into the Google search engine I received a massive 3.21 million responses. AltaVista found 12.7 million responses and the ninemsn web site search engine recorded some 2.6 million hits. On that basis, people and, in particular, Internet service providers would appear to be satisfying intention in this context as this result will certainly occur in the `ordinary course of events'. Under this bill it will be an offence to transmit, make available, publish or otherwise distribute material. So where does this leave Internet service providers throughout Australia? It seems clear that they may be inadvertently committing an offence under this bill.
As importantly, though, this bill seems to have its work cut out for it. Laws condone or prohibit behaviour. From the amount of suicide information on the Internet, it seems that this bill, if it results in an amendment to part of the Criminal Code, will not come close to achieving its aim of reducing suicide related material. So the question must be asked: is this yet another instalment of government window-dressing? Does the government know that this bill will have no real effect on the amount of suicide related material on the Internet? Is this another tired old pretence of doing something while the opposite occurs? 
It reminds me of the way in which the war on drugs is being waged. People are imprisoned and demonised, and there is no real effect on the production, distribution or supply of drugs. But it makes a good news filler. Instead of punishing those people that offer information or advice about suicide, the government would do better to get to the cause and then treat the cause. The causes of suicide are neatly summed up by the Australian Institute of Criminology research paper No. 52, `Social factors in suicide in Australia', by Riaz Hassan. In 1996, he wrote:
Every day there are about 6 suicides in Australia, and a further 180 attempts. Notwithstanding the enormous personal and family emotional costs, and the great financial costs, suicide is a significant concern for the criminal justice system.
Since 1964, suicide rates in Australia for females (except teenagers) have fallen dramatically, and for men over 30 have fallen significantly. For teenage boys the rate has tripled, for men in their early twenties it has almost tripled, and for those in their late twenties it has increased by more than two-thirds. Young men of these ages are also the prime focus of the criminal justice system.
When we combine this with Institute findings for the period 1990-95 that 43 per cent of deaths in custody or custody-related police operations were the result of suicide (again predominantly young men), and Institute homicide data for the period 1989-93 which indicate that 7 per cent of identified offenders committed suicide after a homicide event, we have a picture of despair, despondency and “aimlessness” which cries out for preventive programs. The criminal justice system can focus on part of the problem only, and collaborative work with other agencies is needed in order to have any effect on the incidence of suicide.
So it seems that the best way to reduce suicide would be to reduce the occurrence of despair, despondency and aimlessness. That means providing people with a purpose such as employment and education and not ignoring people in need, year after year, as this government continues to do. Most pointedly, the government has chosen to squander the budget surplus on tax cuts for the wealthy rather than spend it on education and employment for those in poverty—and for those who are subject to despair, despondency and aimlessness, refer to the above. The government has made a conscious choice to give money to the wealthy and ignore poverty, even having the gall to dispute that the phenomenon exists.
So there is a relationship between what the government can do and what the government is currently doing with regard to the issue of suicide. On that issue the Catholic Health Australia 2004 federal budget submission implored the government to:
Urgently fund suicide prevention and volatile substance misuse prevention programs to address the current situation in regard to youth mental health issues.
It argued:
It is unconscionable that such deficiencies in health care provision continue to exist in many indigenous communities in Australia, particularly in an environment of significant budget surpluses.
I could not agree more. More importantly, the Greens do not encourage suicide but we certainly think it appropriate for people to be able to choose the time of their death. Part of our position means allowing people to access information that provides guidance on euthanasia. There are good reasons in doing this. Suicide can be painful or traumatic or, as we have seen, death can be peaceful and timely. That is what we would wish for all people. To achieve the latter, we must allow people to be able to research what options are available to them so that they can make an informed choice. That may mean looking on the Internet, particularly for those people that are bedridden or immobile. For these reasons, the Greens oppose this bill and call on the government to put vastly more resources into suicide prevention and eradicating poverty in this country.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—I rise to speak about the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004 that is before us and about issues relating to suicide and voluntary euthanasia. I believe that these are very difficult and important issues that the parliament must take very seriously. We cannot stop suicide by restricting information about it. We cannot stop voluntary euthanasia by restricting information about it. The truth is that some people will always make a decision to end their lives, because of mental illness, depression or because they have a physical condition that causes them too much pain to bear. To simply imagine that we will reduce the number of suicides by restricting information is naive in the extreme.
Some time ago there was a very good ABC radio program—I think it was Background Briefing—about a doctor in Queensland who worked with young men who had attempted suicide. He specifically worked with young men who had attempted suicide using a gun. It is hard to believe that many people survive such an attempt but, in fact, a substantial number do. Most of them end up with quite serious injuries and often serious brain damage, as you can imagine. In talking about the young men that he dealt with, that doctor spoke about the sort of despair and alienation that they felt as teenagers. Frankly, whether or not there was information available to those young men on the Internet was going to make absolutely no difference to (a) whether they attempted suicide and (b) the method they chose.
It would be much wiser if we as a parliament, when we are trying to address the issue of suicide, talked about the incredible poverty of resources for dealing with mental illness in our community. Having seen the husband of a close friend try to commit suicide under very violent and disturbed circumstances, the support that was subsequently available to him and that family was obviously not enough to give me or them any confidence that he would be healed of his mental illness or that he would learn to live with it in a way that removed all doubt that he would never try to commit suicide again.
We need a great deal more resources for treating people who suffer mental illness. We also need to address some of the societal factors that drive people to suicide, such as depression, alienation, unemployment—all of these things are factors. Another factor that I think features largely—particularly with young men—is confusion about their sexuality. It is often reported that that is a factor in youth suicides, or attempted suicides. I think that if we, as a parliament, continue to vilify homosexuality, we only contribute to a society that sends young people the message that they are second-class citizens if they are homosexual. That is another area we have to address, rather than going for the quick fix of trying to ban information on suicide on the Internet.
Of course we have to discourage it. Of course in dealing with mental illness and depression and other factors that lead to suicide, we have to make a case very strongly that life is worth living and that young people or anyone considering suicide can get the help they need to get through life. But we do not get through to everyone and, when it comes to voluntary euthanasia in particular, I do not think it would matter how much of a contrary case we put to people. Someone who is suffering a terminal illness and is dealing with a great deal of pain is very unlikely, when they have determined to commit suicide—to engage in voluntary euthanasia—to be convinced by any amount of argument that that is not the right decision. In that situation I think it would be almost impossible to convince them of that, and I actually wonder whether it would be a fair thing to ask them to do. I do not know how much physical pain I could bear, especially if I was certain that the end result would be my death anyway. It may be a cowardly thing—people call it cowardly—but certainly, not knowing my own capacity for dealing with such a situation, I hardly feel in a position as a legislator to make decisions for other people in these circumstances. 
Turning to the actual provisions of the legislation, the ones that concern me the most are those that state that a person is guilty of an offence if the material directly or indirectly promotes a particular method of committing suicide or provides instruction on a particular method of committing suicide and if the person intends to use the material to promote a method of committing suicide or provide instruction on that method of committing suicide or intends the material to be used by another person to commit suicide. It is pretty clear that an organisation like Exit Australia, which provides information about different methods of committing suicide, should feel nervous about this legislation. It is very possible for us as legislators to do something about situations where people are being harassed or where the Internet is being used to circulate images of child pornography or about other things such as credit card skimming, fraudulent activity to do with Internet banking, contamination of goods, mobile phone fraud and emergency service hoaxes. It makes sense to do something about these other things—hoaxes, threats, menacing, harassing, offensive behaviour and, particularly, child pornography and child abuse. Of course we should legislate against the Internet being used to circulate images of crime, but when it comes to circulating information that talks about methods of committing suicide I think we go into quite different territory.
The government has agreed, I believe, to split the bill and to refer the euthanasia and suicide sections to a Senate inquiry. That will be a very important opportunity for the voluntary euthanasia societies in each state—for Exit Australia and for others—to put a case for any amendments that are necessary to clarify that providing information about voluntary euthanasia should not be a crime. Certainly the Labor Party intends to move amendments that clarify that political discussion about voluntary euthanasia is certainly not a crime. We believe that we need to clarify beyond reasonable doubt that there is no offence where the constitutional doctrine of implied freedom of political communication applies.
The question arises: is there actually a lot of information floating around on the Internet that encourages or incites suicide? I did a little bit of investigation about this to see whether the government's concern is legitimate or whether they are actually trying to crack down on the discussion of voluntary euthanasia. Frankly, it was not easy to find sites that could be described as promoting suicide. In fact, I do not think any of the sites that I found promoted suicide, but there were a number that went into the details of how one might commit suicide if one wished to.
Probably the most well known of these is called ASH, alt.suicide.holiday, which originated from a newsgroup. It is not youth oriented; it is pitched to everyone. It seems that the maintenance of the site has fallen through, but it does talk about different ways of committing suicide. Another web site, ASBS or alt.suicide.bus.stop, grew from this site. It describes itself as neither advocating nor denouncing suicide but as being pro-choice about both suicide and euthanasia. It does not pitch itself specifically at a youth audience either. There is another site called How to Kill Yourself Using Inhalation of Carbon Monoxide, which is a personal account of the method used by Jerry Hunt to end his life. The web site Suicide and Attempted Suicide describes methods of suicide based on a book by Geo Stone. It appears to be restricted to providing information only, and it is not pitched at any particular demographic. It provides a links page to other neutral or pro-choice—as they describe themselves—suicide web sites. There is another site, called A Practical Guide to Suicide, which clearly outlines in detail various methods for committing suicide, although it suggests that people ideating suicide, particularly those under 23, should seek medical help. It goes on to provide quite detailed information on methods of how to commit suicide. We managed to find a couple of other sites as well. 
It is not a great number—if you think about how many sites there are dealing with any particular topic, you could very easily find thousands of them. It is really very difficult to see how this legislation, even if it restricts access to half-a-dozen sites—which is difficult to understand because most of them would be based overseas in any case—will make any impact at all on the rate of suicide in this country, which I presume is the intention of the legislation. What it will do, I think, is to restrict information about voluntary euthanasia, which is a perfectly legitimate topic for discussion in Australia today.
I conclude by saying that Labor will support the referral of this legislation in the Senate to a Senate inquiry. I hope that the Senate inquiry examines the issues surrounding the implications for free speech and proper debate about voluntary euthanasia in particular. If the government does have a sincere intention to do something about suicide, it needs to look a lot further than the Internet for some real solutions.",REPS,<title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUICIDE RELATED MATERIAL OFFENCES) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—in reply—I would like to thank the honourable members who have made a contribution to this debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Bill 2004. This is a very serious topic, and the amendments in this bill address an issue that can cut the heart out of Australian families. The Howard government is committed to dealing with people who use the Internet to push people over the edge and commit suicide. Those who reach that stage of desperation have a life ahead of them. It is not acceptable that they should be treated just as pawns in a game played over the Internet.
A 1997 study entitled Cybersuicide: the role of interactive suicide notes on the Internet reviewed cases of interactive Internet notes involving individuals who later committed suicide. The citation is: Baume, Cantor and Rolfe, Crisis, 18/2, 1997. The study indicated that there is potential for the Internet to influence suicidal behaviour. The authors observed that the Internet makes it all too easy for self-destructive individuals to incite others to kill themselves. A 1999 study entitled Cybersuicide: the Internet and suicide reported on two suicide attempts in which information about the methods used was obtained from the Internet. The citation is: Alao, Yolles and Armenta, American Journal of Psychiatry, 156, 11 November 1999. The study suggested that both cases illustrated the danger of having Internet access to certain information. The authors noted that it is extremely easy to access information about suicide on the Internet. They described a number of sites that provided detailed information on various methods of suicide. 
While the member for Sydney might highlight some of her concerns, I think that families right across the nation are concerned about suicide. I think it is one of the major issues that we as a civilised society confront. Anything that any government can do to discourage suicide is, I think, a step very much in the right direction.
In this bill the proposed offences target the accessing, transmission and making available of material that counsels or incites suicide with intent to use that material to counsel or incite suicide, and the accessing, transmission and making available of material that promotes or provides instruction on a particular method of committing suicide with intent to promote that method or intending another person to use that information to commit suicide. The offences are intended to complement existing customs regulations prohibiting the physical importation and exportation of suicide kits and information related to those kits.
The decision to deal with suicide related Internet material in a bill that is separate from the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2004 stems from misunderstandings about the nature of the proposed offences by some who have commented on the provisions. Contrary to what some have said, the proposed offences will not cover Internet material that advocates or debates law reform on voluntary euthanasia or suicide related issues. My personal position on voluntary euthanasia is that I am opposed to it. In a debate in relation to the Northern Territory laws I voted to overturn those laws, and I do not apologise for that. I do accept that debate on voluntary euthanasia is a legitimate debate in our society. The concerns expressed—quite genuinely, I believe—by the member for Sydney in her contribution are concerns which she ought not to have with respect to the provisions of this bill.
It is important to recognise that Internet material such as research papers dealing with suicide related issues, suicide prevention and support material will not be caught by the proposed offences. It is unfortunate that these concerns have been raised very late in the day. The government started consultation on the telecommunications offences bill in March of this year—quite a number of months ago, during which only half-a-dozen submissions expressed any concerns about the proposed suicide related material offences. Following consultation, aspects of the proposed offences were tightened up in response to some concerns. The offences now cover only conduct in relation to Internet material that counsels or incites suicide—that is, urges suicide—where there is an intention to counsel or incite a person to commit suicide, or Internet material that promotes or provides instruction on a particular method of committing suicide, where there is an intention to promote that method of suicide or, alternatively, where there is an intention that another person use that method to commit suicide.
The telecommunications offences bill was introduced in the other place on 24 June this year and it has taken until very recently for some non-government parties to start raising objections. Indeed, the bill was not referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee following its introduction in June.
The member for Cunningham mentioned in his speech his belief that Internet service providers and Internet content hosts may be caught by the offences. I want to reassure the member for Cunningham that they will not be caught by the offences. The intention fault element for the possession offences applies to the conduct of using the material to incite or counsel suicide, or promote or provide instruction on suicide. This means that the ISP or ICH must mean to possess the material as well as use it in this way. 
The member for Sydney in her speech also claimed that the law was not likely to make a difference. She might be right in that in many cases it may make little difference, but I think the member for Sydney would have to concede the point that, if some lives are saved, then these amendments are certainly worth pursuing. That is one of the reasons the government is particularly keen to see this bill pass into the statute books of this nation as soon as possible.
I mentioned that my belief is that voluntary euthanasia is a matter for legitimate community debate. After I introduced this bill in the parliament, in the Sunshine Coast Daily on 5 August this year the Sunshine Coast branch of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Queensland claimed that this bill was the thin end of the wedge and suggested that the next thing could be a complete ban on all matters pertaining to voluntary euthanasia. They went on to claim that the bill was `ludicrous' and that all it amounted to was censorship—imposing censorship on things which, according to them, are not right. Mr Michael Traugott, from the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, is quite wrong. As I said, voluntary euthanasia is a matter of legitimate debate. Each of us has a different view in relation to it. As I have said in the substantive portion of my speech, this bill's aim is discouraging suicide and it does not seek, in any way, shape or form, to inhibit debate in the community on the issue of voluntary euthanasia.
I find it personally disappointing that we have last-minute and misinformed speculation that could interrupt progress on such an important issue and impact on the lives of many Australian families. I think it is a matter of regret that this bill may be referred to the Senate committee, as was suggested by the member for Sydney. I believe that this bill is a really important bill. I believe that many Australian families want to see this bill become law as soon as possible. With an election a matter of months away, if that, I think it would be eminently regrettable if there were any delay in the passage of this law, because such a delay could well cost lives. I think that would be a very real tragedy, and so I implore the opposition in the other place to support this bill, to support Australian families, and to join the government in doing whatever we can collectively do to try to discourage suicide in our community. I commend this bill to the House.

"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2004-08-11,"—The opposition supports the government's changes to the antisiphoning regime that are put forward in the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004. The main change being promulgated with this legislation is that the period of time in which the free-to-air networks can get exclusive coverage of a particular sporting event that is on the antisiphoning list has been narrowed to a period up to 12 weeks prior to the commencement of the event. Under the previous arrangements, that period was up to six weeks prior to the commencement of the event. 
The opposition supports this change. It provides a greater opportunity for subscription television to get the rights to an event and to properly publicise that event should the free-to-air networks not take up the opportunity offered to them by the antisiphoning list to get exclusive access to that event. Under the previous arrangements, I think the subscription broadcasters had a legitimate complaint that, if the event had not been taken up by free-to-air television prior to that six-week period, the six weeks was too short a period for them to genuinely be able to publicise the event through, for example, their monthly magazines sent out to subscribers. The government's initiative to expand that window of opportunity to 12 weeks is something the opposition therefore supports.
I do, however, want to make a couple of comments about some associated issues with respect to the antisiphoning regime for the government's consideration. One is that there is a loophole in the existing regime that has been exposed recently by the fact that Fox Sports has acquired the rights to broadcast on pay TV the Ashes tour to England next year, well before that six-week period—or 12 weeks, as it will now be—comes into effect, thereby effectively circumventing the operation of the antisiphoning regime, which is intended to ensure that free-to-air TV gets an unencumbered opportunity to get exclusive rights, including buying the pay TV rights as well as the free-to-air rights to a particular event. Having an associated entity which is not a broadcaster—in this case Fox Sports, which is a content provider to a broadcaster and which is, of course, owned by two of the co-owners of Foxtel, the actual broadcaster—acquire those rights in advance of the time when it is illegal for the broadcaster, Foxtel, to acquire the rights exposes a loophole in the antisiphoning regime.
I have indicated that Labor in office will plug this loophole, and I reiterate that commitment. It is true to say that, if the use of this loophole stays at its current level with events like the Ashes tours in England—which have been subject to rather sporadic and debatable levels of coverage on the part of the free-to-air networks in recent years—then the problem is not great. My concern is that, if this becomes entrenched, the opportunity for associated entities which are not directly covered by the antisiphoning rules to circumvent them and thereby completely undermine the spirit and rationale of those rules will be substantial. If Labor is elected in the forthcoming election, I intend to take action, after consulting with all the various interests, to ensure that this particular loophole is fixed.
Secondly, I would like to make some observations about one particular sport which has been the subject of some controversy recently regarding the antisiphoning rules—that is, soccer. I am a soccer fan and huge numbers of Australians are soccer fans. A growing proportion of Australians are interested in this sport. I am pleased to see ASTRA and Foxtel representatives here because they will no doubt be interested to hear some of comments that I make. As a result of considerable public interest in the Euro 2004 competition, previously known as the European championship, there has been a lot of controversy about the fact that it was not available on free-to-air TV.
I have indicated publicly that, in my view, the primary rationale for sports being listed on the antisiphoning list is that they are sports that actually or potentially involve Australians. By definition, the European Championship cannot involve Australia and cannot involve Australians in any sense representing Australia, although there may well be the odd Australian who ends up acquiring citizenship of another country and actually does participate. For that reason, I have yet to be convinced that that tournament ought to be on the antisiphoning list. However, I have undertaken to have some discussions with all of the relevant interests involved in that debate before making any kind of final decision as to what I would do. I do, however, believe—and I have also indicated this publicly—that the exclusion from the antisiphoning list of the World Cup for 2010 and the preliminary games involving Australia in the World Cup is a mistake which ought to be corrected. 
The final observation I make is that negotiations between Foxtel and SBS with respect to SBS being able to broadcast some UK Premier League soccer on free-to-air TV appear to have reached some difficulties or maybe even broken down. I regard that as a serious problem. My rationale for the antisiphoning list—the involvement of Australia—at one level precludes the notion that the Premier League ought to be on the antisiphoning list. I certainly do not have any present intention, should Labor be in government, to add the Premier League to the antisiphoning list. However, it is important to emphasise to both sides of the debate—to the free-to-air TV networks and to the subscription TV providers—that a certain amount of commonsense and give and take is necessary on both sides in order to ensure that the underlying logic of the antisiphoning list prevails. Therefore I urge Foxtel and Fox Sports to do everything possible to reach agreement with SBS to ensure that some Premier League soccer does remain on free-to-air TV. I think the previous arrangements have worked well and have provided a good balance. The more serious zealots, like me, who do have Foxtel, are able to watch whole games—when we have the time, which is not often. Others who may be slightly less fascinated by the Premier League soccer but still follow it are at least able to get some coverage on SBS. I urge Foxtel and Fox Sports to do everything possible to bring agreement about.
I have expressed similar views to the free-to-air networks on other matters to do with making the antisiphoning list work. For example, I pointed out to Channel 9 a couple of years ago that, if they continued to gobble up virtually all of the major sporting rights—as they did when they had the AFL, rugby league, World Cup soccer, Wimbledon and I think one other thing all at once and therefore significantly detracted from their ability to provide full genuine coverage across Australia for all of these events—that would undermine the integrity of the antisiphoning list as well. I said that there therefore needed to be at least some sharing of rights to these events across the free-to-air networks, otherwise the capacity for ordinary Australians to see these events on free-to-air television would be diminished and the effectiveness of the antisiphoning list would be affected and ultimately its integrity undermined.
I do think it is important for all parties to maintain a commitment to ensuring that the list works as it is intended to work. I support the recent modifications that the government has made and I certainly have a view that the antisiphoning list should operate according to a `use it or lose it' approach, which means that, if the free-to-air networks are not broadcasting events, then the question of whether they should be on the list should be viewed in a very different light. I think Australian soccer fans have some legitimate complaints. It is not easy to resolve these issues, because there is a difficult balance to be maintained here. I am committed to ensuring that Australians can continue to see their favourite sports on free-to-air TV as they have traditionally done, but I am also committed to ensuring that subscription television has an opportunity to promote, sell and make money from a premium product. That requires striking a very difficult balance between those competing interests to ensure that everybody ultimately gets a reasonable go. 
The antisiphoning list is an extremely difficult issue to deal with for both the government and the opposition. I acknowledge that it will never be perfect. But, in order for it to function properly and in order for governments from either side of politics to be able to get the outcomes that are necessary in the interests of all Australian consumers, that degree of give-and-take and commonsense from both sides concerning pay TV and subscription TV is, I think, extremely important.
I commend this legislation to the Main Committee and to the parliament. The opposition broadly supports the government's decision to slightly liberalise the list and to reform it. I have indicated a couple of exceptions that I think need to be fixed up. But, broadly, I think the movement of six weeks to 12 weeks is entirely sensible. It gives the subscription TV sector a much more realistic opportunity to promote and develop particular sporting events as products that it is going to show which have not been taken up by the free-to-air sector.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—I am pleased to speak to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004. In terms of the core values within this bill, I believe it is doing the right thing by the community. The bill effectively amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to extend the time when a sporting event protected by the antisiphoning scheme may become available to pay TV operators. Currently, an event referred to as a listed event is automatically delisted 1,008 hours, or roughly six weeks, beforehand. This bill, if passed, will increase that lead-in time to 2,016 hours, or approximately 12 weeks.
It is interesting that I should be speaking at this juncture in the debate, after the shadow minister for communications, the member for Melbourne, and, I assume, before the Greens member, the member for Cunningham. Based on past comments from both of those speakers, in my view they approach this bill from two different perspectives. It is interesting that, as a government member, I should be wedged between the two of them.
From my perspective, many of the problems that this bill is seeking to address are problems that have been addressed by previous comments, both from the member for Melbourne and the member for Cunningham. I just heard the populist rhetoric from the member for Melbourne about the need to achieve a fine balance and the need to ensure that Australians have access via free-to-air TV to major sporting events. By the same token, the member for Melbourne does not want to see pay TV operators prevented from showing events that are on the antisiphoning list because they were cut out by the free-to-air broadcasters. I note that comments have previously been made by the member for Cunningham along the lines that this bill is there implicitly to benefit only pay TV operators. I think the actual comment was that if the government wants to get into bed with pay TV, then they should come out and say so, instead of pretending that changes in the legislation benefit viewers.
Despite strong comments on both sides, the reality is that this bill achieves a balance. Despite the shadow minister's comments in the chamber today—and I note that he is supporting this bill—about the need to achieve a balance, there are no concrete examples from the Australian Labor Party as to how they intend to do this. With this bill, the government is moving to ensure that we appropriately balance the competing demands that exist in the public domain. In particular, I believe many Australians have a very valid right to demand that the government ensures that free-to-air services of major sporting events are available. The reality is that approximately one in four households have subscribed to pay TV. In that light, there remains a valid rationale for ensuring that there is an antisiphoning list and that events placed on the antisiphoning list continue to remain on that list so that free-to-air broadcasters have the opportunity to have, I guess, the first right of negotiation to broadcast those events. But there is also some truth in the argument that it should be the case that, when events are purchased by free-to-air broadcasters, there should also be an opportunity for pay TV operators to be able to utilise those programs to fill a market need and a demand for those particular services. 
This bill, I believe, although not perfect, certainly encapsulates those two competing demands and it does so through the delisting process and doubling that delisting period to 12 weeks. The effect of this is that it forces the hand of free-to-air broadcasters to lock in programming 12 weeks out from an event, thus providing an opportunity for pay TV operators, should they also choose to broadcast that event, to be able to engage sponsors, make programming decisions and ensure that those that are in fact subscribers to pay television have the opportunity to be able to enjoy the benefits on pay TV as well.
I would like to comment on the background to the antisiphoning scheme. Section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act is the key legislative provision in what is known as the antisiphoning scheme. The scheme protects the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance on free-to-air television by preventing pay TV operators from siphoning off television coverage of those events before free-to-air broadcasters have had the opportunity to obtain the broadcasting rights. Section 115(1) provides that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts:
... may, by notice published in the Gazette, specify an event, or events of a kind, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the Minister, be available free to the general public.
Section 115(1A) provides:
The Minister may ... amend a notice ... to specify an additional event, or events of a kind ...
This list is referred to as the `antisiphoning list'.
I note comments that the shadow minister made with regard to the type of events that should be contained on the antisiphoning list and I note that the government has moved—most recently on 11 May this year—to revise and revisit the issue of the antisiphoning list. In doing so we ensured that there were some events which were included and continued to be included whilst there were other events that were omitted from the revised list. This again shows that this is quite a dynamic piece of legislation in the sense of ensuring that it remains relevant to the demands of the Australian population and to the demands and competing interests that exist between subscription television and free-to-air television.
The minister on 11 May this year, when he revisited the antisiphoning list, specified events in the sports of horseracing, Australian rules football, rugby league football, rugby union football, cricket, soccer, tennis, netball, basketball, golf and motor sports. These were all specified on the list. One of the problems, though, is that, simply because an event is listed in the notice, it does not automatically mean that it will be televised on free-to-air television. It simply means that free-to-air broadcasters are entitled to acquire the rights to televise the event without having to compete with pay TV operators. Of course, in accordance with section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act, the event will currently be delisted at 1,008 hours, or six weeks, before the event, in which case pay TV operators may apply for the rights to televise the event. There is provision under the act that an event does not automatically have to be delisted. The minister is able to exercise powers under subsections 115(1AA) and (1AB) to continue the specification of an event if he or she is satisfied that at least one commercial television broadcasting licensee or national broadcaster has not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the right to televise the event. 
The reason that the Howard government is increasing the delisting period of time is as I have outlined: the current six-week period—and this has been stated by the minister—has proved to be insufficient time for pay television operators to acquire the rights as well as finalise schedules, negotiate advertising contracts and promote the event. It is also worth noting that the operation of the antisiphoning scheme is such that, if a free-to-air broadcaster acquires the right to televise the listed event, it is not an exclusive right to broadcast the event. If the free-to-air broadcast will reach more than 50 per cent of the population, a pay TV operator may also acquire the right to broadcast the same event.
I note as well that the shadow minister raised the issue of UEFA Euro 2004. In fact, it is worth noting in this debate that in this particular context that event was not listed on the antisiphoning list. Rather, the problem that arose was that SBS was unable to compete with the pay TV operator that obtained the rights to broadcast that event. In this situation, it is also clear that there are competing interests and that it is not always the free-to-air broadcasters that cause problems.
From a local perspective the opposite is true. On the Gold Coast many concerns have been expressed at numerous times by many of my constituents who have contacted me about free-to-air broadcasters choosing not to broadcast AFL, and those constituents take as a godsend that they are able to access certain games through subscription television services. There is a very large ex-Victorian population on the Gold Coast these days, and with the success of the Brisbane Lions I am not surprised that the popularity of AFL is growing—but there will always be a demand for these types of services. So, as has been outlined by the shadow minister, there is a need to balance these competing objectives. This bill does that.
I am pleased that there is support from the Australian Labor Party for this bill. Contrary to the assertions that the member for Cunningham has made in the past, I do not believe this bill is an indication of the Howard government getting into bed with the pay TV operators; rather, we are simply trying to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between the demands. I do not deny that it is not a perfect balance, but in a very concrete way the bill does address the need to ensure that both consumers and free-to-air broadcasters, as well as subscription TV operators, deal with these cultural events—that is, Australian sporting events—as much as possible from a level playing field. I commend the bill to this chamber.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-08-11,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004. Although it may be seen as a minor technical amendment, the bill has implications for what sports Australians are able to see on their television screens. The bill basically amends section 115(1AA) of the Broadcasting Services Act and extends the automatic delisting period from 1,008 hours, or six weeks, prior to the start of a sporting event to 2,016 hours, or 12 weeks, prior to its start.
According to ASTRA, the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association, representing the pay TV sector, this amendment will basically assist operators in the management of their business—for example, in extending the cut-off from six weeks to 12 weeks, or three months, they will now have more time to appropriately publicise events they have acquired via their program magazines and other sources. ASTRA strongly believe that the present six-week cut-off is too short a time period in which to deal with items that become available from the list after not having been taken up by the free-to-air networks. 
ASTRA cite licensee negotiations, sponsorship engagement, programming deadlines and publicity as some of the everyday issues facing them in such circumstances. I can accept these arguments and therefore support the amendment, along with the government and the opposition, especially in knowledge of the fact that television networks often have extensive lead times in their planning for the acquisition of programs—that is, they know a long time out, often many years, what programs they want to acquire. The extension of the cut-off from six weeks to 12 weeks is therefore reasonable. However, there are other issues associated with the cut-off, and the previous two speakers have talked about some of the problems with the antisiphoning issue generally. There are also problems with the antisiphoning list. These issues must be cause for concern and this parliament must ultimately address them.
With regard to the antisiphoning scheme, the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in his second reading speech introducing this amendment bill, informed the House:
The scheme continues to protect the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance by giving priority to free-to-air television broadcasters in acquiring the broadcast rights to those events.
Unfortunately I cannot agree with the minister's statement, and recent events provide ample evidence of where events of national importance and cultural significance are not accessible to all Australians via the free-to-air networks. For example, as we heard from the previous two speakers, outrage was expressed across the nation recently when the Euro 2004 international soccer competition was not shown on SBS, a free-to-air service. SBS, known to many of us and many in the community as the `Soccer Broadcasting System', with people such as Les Murray and Johnny Warren at the helm, has for many years been a committed supporter of Australian soccer—through the good times and the bad, I might add.
Soccer is the most popular sport played in Australia at the moment. I understand that there are some 1.2 million participants, and there are a lot more supporters, including the families and friends of players. When it was revealed that SBS had not been able to secure rights to Euro 2004, it brought home to many Australians the harsh commercial realities of the antisiphoning system in modern-day sport. It raised with many of them the term `antisiphoning'. I suggest that a lot of people in the community do not know what we are talking about when we talk about antisiphoning. They might think it is something to do with stopping petrol sniffing or something like that. Euro 2004 was very educational. It informed the community about the list, about the term `antisiphoning' and about why they are seeing certain things and not others on TV. It informed them about why pay TV has certain sports and why, for example, the ABC now shows a lot of lawn bowls and other such niche market sports. I think it was useful, although it was not very well accepted by the general community.
Euro 2004 was an event that hundreds of thousands of Australians wanted to watch. Yet, as we have heard, it was only accessible on pay TV. Pay TV was overwhelmed by the support for Euro 2004. I understand extra measures were taken to get some screens up and running so that more Australians could see the competition, especially when Greece did so well—and we have such a high proportion of Greeks in our community at the moment. The basic reality is that less than a quarter of Australians have access to pay TV. At the time of the kerfuffle over the Euro soccer, SBS commentators raised the issue of discrimination against the poor and low-income earners who were unable to afford pay TV and who were missing out on the Euro 2004 telecast. This included people in my electorate of Cunningham. A friend of mine has three sons who play soccer, and they are soccer fans, but they could not afford pay TV. As a result, they were unable to see one of the world's best soccer tournaments—if not the best soccer tournament in the world. 
This has really caused us to go back and look at statements from the minister, saying how events of national importance and cultural significance are given priority. Euro 2004 showed the failings and inherent faults of the antisiphoning system and the failings of the current legislation—and this amendment is just about one element of that. Despite all the rhetoric from the government, the reality is that the whole issue of TV rights to sport is driven by money, not by national importance and cultural significance. It could be argued, for example, that Euro 2004 was of national importance and cultural significance. As the member for Melbourne said, Labor is supporting the list based on its relationship with Australian teams and Australia's involvement. Euro 2004 may be cited as of national importance and cultural significance not because the Australian team was involved, which they were not, but because it meant something to a large section of the 1.2 million active participants in soccer in Australia and their families and friends.
We should be quite aware that money is driving the TV rights agenda. The overwhelming commercial realities of both pay TV and commercial free-to-air networks are going to drive this into the future. We should not have any illusions that in this place we can have a significant role in what is happening out there in the free market. We also have to consider the ABC and SBS—the poor cousins in this whole issue. If money and finances are driving this issue, the competing interests of pay TV and the commercial free-to-air networks—7, 9 and 10—and the interlinking between them are going to continue as time goes on. The previous speaker said that this is dynamic legislation, that there is a need for more tweaking of it and more consideration by this place of how it is going to best work to serve the interests of as many Australians as possible. We also have to remember that the actual sporting codes and organisations are looking to generate as much profit as possible from their product. As a result, the government's antisiphoning legislation is very vulnerable.
I have been informed by Free TV Australia that pay TV operator Fox Sports has acquired the rights to the 2005 Ashes cricket test to be played in the United Kingdom. If we go to section 5.1 of the antisiphoning list, which relates to cricket, we see that each test match involving the senior Australian representative team selected by Cricket Australia, whether played in Australia or overseas, is on the list. Therefore, the 2005 Ashes cricket test to be played in the United Kingdom is on the list, but operator Fox Sports has acquired the rights. According to Free TV Australia:
The Ashes have been only offered to free to air television in Australia on a non-exclusive basis, and as a result the event will only be available to pay TV subscribers.
And yet, as I said, it is on the list.
What is going on here? What will Australia's number one cricket fan, the Prime Minister, think of this? I am sure he has access to pay TV but, if he did not have access to pay TV, in all likelihood he would not be able to watch the Ashes test. The fact is that the vast majority—those 75 per cent—who do not have access to pay TV will at this stage not be able to watch the 2005 Ashes test. This seems to go against the list. The rights have been acquired. Does that mean that the free-to-air networks are now out of the loop and cannot get access to it? I do not know. They might have the rights, but are they able to use them? I do not know. There are lots of question about how the list is operating. Is the list operating, or is the whole system operating according to who has enough money to buy the rights? 
I mentioned earlier how SBS and the ABC are the poor cousins in this instance. We know that SBS would dearly have loved to have the rights to Euro 2004. They basically could not afford it. We know that the ABC has not got the funding to get access to a lot of the sports that Australians want to see and that the ABC has been forced, due to funding constraints, to develop niche markets such as women's basketball and the national netball finals. So it is important that the ABC and SBS continue to have some involvement in the whole area of promoting Australian sport and providing sport to Australians, because the ABC is basically everywhere—it is the most common broadcaster. I think the government should give consideration to how the ABC and SBS are going to play a role in broadcasting sport to the Australian community over the next couple of decades. If we are going to go down this path of purely contracts and money driving it, the ABC and SBS will not have much left at all. As I said, they are the poor cousins, and the harsh reality of the market out there is that they will remain the poor cousins.
With the current legislation and the antisiphoning list et cetera, with the sports themselves wanting to maximise the money they are getting from their product, and with it costing more and more for elite sports to run elite sport, there is not doubt that a lot of money has to go in. Obviously, if it is coming in from the pay TV and the free-to-air stations and from sponsors et cetera, that is going to be what is driving it. Frankly, it seems to me that, at the end of the day, the community is going to miss out. We have seen how the community missed out with Euro 2004. A lot of people were not at all happy that they could not watch those games on TV. They would have loved to have sat up at 2 o'clock in the morning and watched some of those games.
As a result of all this argument, the community is missing out more and more. The antisiphoning monitoring report by ASTRA points out that channel 10, for example, failed to broadcast any Formula One or motor GP race live in May 2004. Here is something that is on the list that people out there want to see. I myself am a fan of motor sports, and I know that a lot of people out there who are fans of motor sports would expect—based on what has happened over the last decade or so—to be able to see the Grand Prix and the Motorcycle Grand Prix live.
We remember the days when Wayne Gardner, from Wollongong, was the world champion in the Motorcycle Grand Prix and how a lot of people were able to see that on free-to-air television. We remember the days when Alan Jones was a world champion Formula One Grand Prix driver. But now, in 2004, even though these races are on the list and Channel 10 has access to them, they are not being broadcast live. So we seem to be going backwards in many ways. I know this ASTRA antisiphoning list includes some of those other items on the list, such as the French Open, where there was a lot of angst in the community because, even though the free-to-air networks had these programs, they were not showing them. They were not giving the community access to them. So once again the community was missing out. 
Frankly, this country is getting itself into a very complicated situation. As I said, for the networks, free-to-air television and pay TV money will generate a lot of what will happen in the future. But I think it is important that the government, if they can do anything, are able to protect community interests. If significant sporting events are happening, whether in Australia or around the world, at the top of the government's priorities should be working out how we are going to ensure that Australians who want to see these events can see them.
Pay TV has approximately 25 per cent of the market; 75 per cent of the market is free-to-air. If it ends up that pay TV has the money and is getting all the rights, even to those items on the antisiphoning list, that means that the government is faced with the situation where only those people who can afford pay TV will be able to enjoy some of those important sporting events. I frankly do not see that as the best way forward.
I think we need to reconsider this whole issue, reconsider the antisiphoning list. The government needs to sit down with both sides—with the pay TV operators and the free-to-air operators—and put it to them that, `At the end of the day, with some of these significant events, we want to make sure that they are available, so that all Australians who want to see them can see them.' Sure, it is not going to be every sport, and people have to realise that, but I think there is a real problem at the moment.
In summary, I support this amendment bill, but I look forward to further consideration of this matter over the coming months and years. I referred earlier to the fact that Foxtel has already acquired rights to an item on the list, namely the 2005 Ashes series. I feel that that loophole in the law needs to be addressed so that those rights are clearly available to the free-to-air networks for the three-month period so that they can get access to them. The Greens will be considering amendments along those lines in the Senate when this bill reaches the Senate.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ANTI-SIPHONING) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,37,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-08-11,"—The government would like to thank members who have contributed to this very important debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-Siphoning) Bill 2004. Honourable members and people in the community more generally would be aware of the fact that the Howard government has reaffirmed its commitment to the antisiphoning scheme, which protects the access of Australian viewers to events of national importance and cultural significance on free-to-air television. Following extensive consultations, the government updated the antisiphoning list to better reflect the attitudes of Australians and the commercial realities of the sporting and broadcasting sectors. The new list will protect events which will take place between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010.
Some people might well ask: how did the government decide which events would be removed from the antisiphoning list? The revised antisiphoning list continues to protect the access of free-to-air broadcasters to the broadcast rights to events that are truly of national significance and cultural importance. The intervention of the government in the broadcast rights market has been removed for events which are of lesser significance and which, in most cases, have also received restricted or no free-to-air coverage.
In determining which events should be on the antisiphoning list, the government has also considered whether the event has been consistently broadcast by free-to-air broadcasters live, in full and in peak viewing hours. For example, international one-day cricket matches involving Australia played overseas in recent times received no FTA coverage, other than the Cricket World Cup. In contrast, the high level of interest in events such as Australian Football League premiership matches indicates the importance attached by viewers to such events and the necessity of retaining them on the antisiphoning list. It is also important to note that many events that are now broadcast on free-to-air television are not currently included on the antisiphoning list, including swimming, first-class cricket and major international events such as the Tour de France. The government will continue to monitor the operation of the antisiphoning list to ensure that it properly reflects the attitudes of Australians and the commercial realities of the sporting and broadcasting sectors. 
Mr Deputy Speaker Price, you would be aware that the new list retains nationally significant sporting events and adds new ones—specifically, the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, both of which are obviously important to the Australian public. Most events to be removed, as I said, have received little or no free-to-air coverage despite their listing. Interestingly enough, their removal from the list may actually increase the total television coverage they receive. It is also important to note that many events that are now broadcast on free-to-air television are not currently listed, including swimming and first-class cricket.
The government does acknowledge that the antisiphoning scheme represents an intervention in the broadcast rights market. However, given the low penetration rates of pay TV—23 per cent of households—it remains necessary to ensure that as many viewers as possible are able to access events of national significance or cultural importance. The level of free-to-air television coverage of events on the antisiphoning list will continue to be monitored to gauge whether the coverage they receive is consistent with their place on the list.
In their contributions to the debate, the member for Melbourne and the member for Cunningham referred to Euro 2004. The member for Melbourne pointed out that Euro 2004 soccer was not available on free-to-air television. I point out to the member for Melbourne that Euro 2004 soccer is not and has never been on the antisiphoning list. This means that it is open to both free-to-air and pay television broadcasters in Australia to compete to purchase the rights to this event. In this instance, I understand that no free-to-air broadcasters acquired the rights to the event. The antisiphoning list was designed to protect events of national significance and cultural importance. Participation in Euro 2004 was open only to member countries of the Union of European Football Associations, and as such there is no prospect of involvement of the Australian national soccer team or even leading Australian players. It is therefore debateable whether the Euro football championship is of national importance or cultural significance for the purposes of the antisiphoning scheme.
The government's package of reforms to the antisiphoning scheme also included a decision to extend the automatic delisting period from six to 12 weeks, which requires a legislative amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Anti-siphoning) Bill 2004 seeks to give effect to that decision. At present, events on the antisiphoning list are automatically removed from the list six weeks prior to the commencement of the event, unless the minister stops this automatic delisting, by a declaration published in the Gazette. The six-week automatic delisting provision was introduced in 2001 as an amendment to the BSA. Under the six-week automatic delisting provision, a pay TV licensee can acquire the rights to a listed event without having to wait for a free-to-air broadcaster to first purchase the rights to that event or having the minister remove the event from the antisiphoning list. 
The introduction of the six-week automatic delisting provision was intended to directly improve the effective operation of the delisting provisions and to remove the requirement for events to be specifically delisted by the minister in every case. In practice it has been proven that the period of six weeks is an inadequate amount of time for the automatic delisting period. The bill therefore amends the BSA to extend the automatic delisting period from 1,008 hours, which calculates as six weeks prior to the start of an event, to 2,016 hours—that is, 12 weeks prior to its start.
The member for Melbourne indicated that the opposition would close what the free-to-air networks refer to as the loophole in the antisiphoning regime. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts would like to be here personally to respond to the remarks made by the member for Melbourne, but as you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Price, the minister for communications is a member of the other place. I suspect that you or the member for Melbourne would be the first to call out `Stranger in the House!' if the minister for communications came in to deal with the member for Melbourne personally in the way that she would like. While the issue raised by the member for Melbourne is one that the government is prepared to look at, I note that free-to-air broadcasters and their viewers will continue to be protected through the ability of the government to defer the automatic delisting of an event if it is considered that free-to-air broadcasters have not had a reasonable opportunity to acquire the relevant rights.
This bill will improve the efficiency of the operation of the delisting provisions of the antisiphoning scheme for the benefit of sporting bodies and viewers by allowing pay television operators a reasonable opportunity to acquire unwanted rights, arrange coverage and market the programs to viewers. This is a particularly important item of legislation; the government is particularly proud of its contents. I am pleased to be able to commend the bill to the chamber.
