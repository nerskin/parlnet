"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2013-03-19,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (15:17):  I rise on this very important issue: the adverse impacts that the carbon tax is having on jobs and manufacturing. What compounds the damage that the carbon tax has caused to Australian jobs is the fact that the government has ignored warnings. Last year in February we had the CEO of Penrice Soda say:


The carbon tax, if it is implemented the way it is intended to be, could be the death knell for a lot of Australian industry … From this year Penrice will pay $8m in carbon tax. Adelaide Brighton $80m, one of our big clients. The timing of it is excruciatingly poor.


But this government did not listen.


The government did not listen to the very basic logic. And the logic is this: if you impose a tax on Australian energy intended to increase the price of energy, to increase the price of electricity, it makes conducting business in Australia more expensive. That means running hospitals becomes more expensive. It means manufacturing operations are more expensive. And why? Let us remember why.


The purpose of this tax was not to reduce emissions. It was not for some environmental benefit because, as we know, when Australian businesses go offshore, we are exporting our emissions offshore to nations that do not have the same clean, green production processes and regulations we do. What happens is: they will make the same things we used to make but create more emissions in the process, so it is a lose-lose.


We know from the government's own modelling that the carbon tax is intended to cut production in key areas. We see that their own modelling shows that aluminium production is supposed to fall by 61.7 per cent, and that alumina production is supposed to fall by 44.1 per cent and iron and steel production by over 21 per cent.


What that is telling you is that, with the fall in production, necessarily there is a fall in jobs in those industries that are directly affected by the carbon tax, because, in the manufacturing sector, those businesses that compete with imports are put at a competitive disadvantage. It is a very simple thing to understand. When you put the cost up of making something in Australia and an import comes in that competes with an Australian-made product, that import, which obviously does not have a carbon tax imposed upon it, is even cheaper than it would have been.


Now let us take our exports, because manufacturing contributes to 29 per cent of our exports. Our exports in manufacturing are also put at a competitive disadvantage when they are competing with goods overseas that do not have the high costs of production that we have.


The government are in pure denial. They are in pure denial because there is the lack of maturity to make a very simple statement: 'We got it wrong.' The Prime Minister is not big enough to say she got it wrong in choosing the Greens over Australian workers; she got it wrong in caving in, showing poor judgment. It was not very tough then, was it? No woman of iron then, no tough cookie then, in standing up to the Greens. She could have thrown the Greens a bit of a carrot; they would have still supported her. But, no. The Prime Minister, in what will arguably—and there is a lot of competition for this—go down as her worst judgment call ever, chose the Greens and this ridiculous, job-destroying policy over Australian workers. For what? Not to reduce emissions but to desperately try to cling on to power.


Over this year alone, let's look at some of those businesses. In March, CSR announced the loss of 150 jobs at Ingleburn, with its managing director later confirming that the carbon tax had added around $500,000 to annual costs at the Ingleburn facility. In February, Amcor announced that over 300 jobs were lost across the country, many in Brisbane and also in the Prime Minister's own electorate. What did the company say at the time? It cited significant cost increases, and it included energy as one of a series of factors that had a significant impact on its ability to remain competitive. That is what it is about. The Prime Minister may think that costs in relation to a business operation is a boring topic, but it is a basic fact that, if a business cannot keep its costs under control, it will not remain competitive. It is not a charity; it must make a profit in order to employ people, and in the manufacturing sector we are seeing that this is becoming more and more difficult.


There are significant international challenges. We know that there are challenges, but why on earth, in that environment, would any government ignore the challenges and sometimes use them as a crutch to absolve themselves of their poor policy, their job destroying policy? And there is the economic sabotage of the carbon tax at a time when we can least afford it. Often you get the response from the minister or the minister's spokesman. It is interesting that, in the areas of industry policy and manufacturing policy, when things get a bit too tough, ministers are too afraid to front up to the media to pursue their argument. Instead, they send out a spokesman. One of the things they invariably rely on is the high Australian dollar. That is their crutch. It is not the carbon tax. In fact, there is the perverse Orwellian language, as if the carbon tax is great. Well, if it is so great, they should have put it at a higher rate and it would have created more jobs. But they know in their heart of hearts that that is absolutely absurd. So when they rely on the high dollar, not only are they not being totally up-front with Australian workers but they are insulting the businesses that are trying to remain competitive and continue to employ Australians.


Rob Sindel, CSR's managing director, said only the other day that it is 'just too easy for people to say it's just the Australian dollar'. CSR is a company that has experienced job losses recently. What we see is continued evidence from business and industry groups when they tell the government about the cost of making things in Australia: the barrier to investment and growth is increasing costs, and energy costs, important input costs, are an increasing barrier to that growth and investment.


Greg Evans from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:


The lack of pricing power and inability to pass on cost increases, such as the effect of the carbon tax, has dented small business profits and its ability to employ and expand.


But, of course, the Prime Minister and the minister for industry are totally and utterly deaf to that, because to accept that would mean accepting responsibility—a very grown-up thing—which, unfortunately for this nation and the workers of this nation, this government is incapable of doing.


We have seen a record number of companies go into liquidation. We saw reports in the media on Monday about over 10½ thousand companies. The government just brushed that aside. In relation to that, insolvency practitioners have said that the carbon tax for many of those companies was the last straw. We heard that it was like pulling a leg from under a chair. What do the government do in response? They say, 'You're all pretending, because, really, the number of jobs has gone up.'


The other week the government quoted some figures from the ABS. According to media reports, the ABS briefed the government on labour force gains for February 2013 and warned them. This is according to media reports. It will be very interesting to see what happens with the update on job figures next month. They were briefed that the figures would be overstated, most likely by a factor of two. Of course, this did not stop the Treasurer and the Prime Minister boasting about all the jobs, even though it was reported that they had been briefed that the figures would be overstated. So the Labor Party should stop the spin and tell the truth, because out there—not just in the suburbs of Western Sydney but in the regional towns and centres of this country, in the manufacturing centres of our capital cities—people are seeing Australian jobs disappear. For every large listed company that has its job losses reported in the newspapers, there are dozens of small and medium-sized businesses whose job losses go unreported, but the impacts are felt just as deeply in the families that lose their livelihood. Why? Only because the government are incapable of owning up to the fact that the greatest economic sabotage inflicted on the Australian economy was the carbon tax.


We even see the impact of the carbon tax on the auto sector. The Labor Party likes to pretend to promise the industry the earth, the moon and the stars.




Mr Champion:
  We know what you'll do with the auto sector. There won't be an auto sector.




Mrs MIRABELLA:
  There is a lot of delicacy and sensitivity on the other side, because at the last election they promised the industry whatever they needed to get over the line, and what did we see after the election? Not only did the Prime Minister break her promise not to introduce a carbon tax but she imposed $460 million in increased costs on Australian manufacturing.


They also broke $1.4 billion worth of their promises to the auto sector. So, the Labor Party is saying: 'We will tell you whatever you want to hear. We will promise you anything you want up until the election, and afterwards we will do the exact opposite.' So much of the discussion about the auto sector is around the components sector. We have heard the chief executive of the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers say:


We are going to be impacted by a carbon tax, and our competitors (overseas) won't.


And in a very challenging environment, this government is saying, 'That's too bad.'


We even see, in the case of the large companies that were awarded compensation and in the words of Graham Cray of BlueScope, that any compensation is like a bandaid over a bullet wound—because, let's face it, you can never totally compensate for the damage you have caused. At least the so-called compensation was admission of the damage the carbon tax would cause. But even these large companies need to make decisions for when the so-called compensation runs out. Companies do not make decisions for a three-year period; they look to the long term, particularly when they are looking at significant investments. But what about all those businesses that do not even get the pretense of a look-in with compensation? They are left there to accept the additional burden.


You will have the Labor Party tell you, 'But we've given all this free money to households so they can afford the increased energy costs.' But they ignore—and the reality is—that so many of the products made in Australia are being replaced by cheaper imports that are given a head start because they do not have the additional electricity and energy charges imposed upon them, because they come from countries, unlike Australia, that do not subject their manufacturers to the world's largest carbon tax.


The reality is that there is great concern about job security in this country, particularly across the manufacturing sector, where 109,000 jobs have been lost since this party came to power. They can get up here and come to the dispatch box and pretend that the reality is something else. But workers out there, and their families, know the damage that is being done, because they are losing their jobs and their friends are losing their jobs. Manufacturers have come together in a new organisation called Manufacturing Australia to ensure that their voice is heard, because they want to continue to have viable businesses and they want to continue to have a viable future. And there is every reason that we can have that viable future. The simple first step is to remove damaging government policies like the carbon tax that are intended to slug and slow down the production of our manufacturing sector.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie—Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (15:33):  It is my pleasure to stand up and speak to this matter of public importance before the House this afternoon. What a surprise! Here we go again: the scare campaign. We saw it last year being rolled out by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, commenting on price rises. In June 2011 we heard that the hit on Australians' cost of living would be 'almost unimaginable', and the Productivity Commission found that if Australia were to impose a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme it would dramatically raise prices to consumers. We heard the Leader of the Opposition saying in August last year in parliament: 


The thing about the carbon tax is that it … will clean out people's wallets and it will wipe out jobs big time.


We heard the Leader of the Opposition saying, in June 2011, on radio 4BC:


It will destroy the steel industry, the cement industry, the aluminium industry, the motor industry and it will be, over time, the death of heavy manufacturing in Australia.'


That is what we have heard time and time again from the opposition: that hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost. The Leader of the Opposition said that 'entire towns, like Whyalla, will be wiped off the map'. And we have heard it again today from the member for Indi.


We heard it over the weekend as well. We heard the O'Farrell government carrying on about electricity prices and once again trying to shift the blame onto the carbon price. The fact is that the O'Farrell government should start being honest to householders in New South Wales and acknowledge that the biggest contributor to increases in electricity prices is rising network charges. The question is: when is the O'Farrell government going to actually start doing something about tackling network charges and taking that pressure off households in New South Wales? We are taking the pressure off, because we are providing tax cuts to 2.2 million people across New South Wales and helping nine out of 10 households with household assistance of $10.10 per week.


In the past we have also heard from Senator Barnaby Joyce about the $100 leg of lamb. Finally, last night on Q&A there was this question to Senator Joyce:


Senator Joyce, in November 2011, you said that citizens would not be happy when they were paying $100 for a roast under the carbon price. Now that the scheme has been in for some six months, this seems highly unlikely. Was your original comment intended to be hyperbole, or were you being deliberately deceptive?


Senator Joyce's answer: 'No, I tell you what, um, er, there's a whole range of things.' He went on to say: 'Okay, I agree it is not going to make it $100.' We are really glad that Senator Joyce was able to set the record straight last night—just in case we had not figured it out yet—that lamb roast is not going to go up $100.


And of course we have heard all about jobs. We heard the member for Indi talking about jobs today. We heard her saying that Australian jobs are disappearing. And I agree: Australian jobs are disappearing—but not at the hands of the federal Labor government. They are disappearing at the hands of state Liberal and LNP governments all over this country.


Campbell Newman is sacking public servants left, right and centre. I cannot do a mobile office in my electorate without someone coming up and telling me they have lost their job because of decisions of the state LNP government. If we want to talk about job losses, let us be honest with the Australian people. We have already heard the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition saying: 'Elect me. We will make savings by cutting jobs. We will sack public servants.' That is how the opposition supports jobs in this country. 


We have heard other fear campaigns. Yesterday in the Daily Telegraph we saw the headline, 'Carbon collapse'. You do not want to read past the heading because you would have read that a lot of businesses in the manufacturing sector in Australia acknowledge that the biggest pressure is the high value of the Australian dollar. You do not want to delve into the article to see what it is all about.


We saw a further heading today, in the Daily Telegraph, 'Carbon tax is sinking tourism'. About three-quarters of the way through that article it does not state that it is a correction but restates yesterday's Daily Telegraph report and talks about the number of businesses which have closed over a certain period. It is interesting that today's article has different figures based on different time frames. Yesterday it was up until 1 March and today it has figures up to 12 months to 31 December 2012. So, when we talk about the Australian Securities and Investments Commission data  showing 10,632 businesses going into voluntary administration, only six months of that crosses over with the carbon price; but they do not want to state that fact.


I am happy to talk about the figures from the article yesterday and the number of businesses which have gone into voluntary liquidation or administration over the last 12 months. For 12 months up to 1 March 2013, 10,632 businesses closed, but let us also talk about how, in that 12-month period, 186,583 new companies were registered, according to ASIC figures. If we want to quote figures, let us be honest about those figures. Let us give the Australian people all of the information which is out there about these allegations.


I am always in awe of the detailed analysis and research that the opposition put in when deciding their position on a government policy. They get up in the morning, they read the newspaper, they put out a press release and they prepare an MPI. Then they come and argue an MPI based on what they read in the paper that day or the day before. That is what we are talking about. What we see from the opposition is a bit like playing bluff in poker. We have seen the member for Indi today quoting industries and how they say it is all doom and gloom. I say to the member for Indi: I am happy to see her industry group and to raise her an industry group. In recent surveys of businesses the Australian Industry Group noted that it appears the businesses surveyed had overestimated the impact of the carbon price on electricity prices and that these estimates are not consistent with the PPI or CPI estimates. The survey found that most business estimates of electricity price increases were 2.1c to 2.3c per kilowatt hour. This is broadly consistent with Treasury modelling of projected increases in electricity prices of 10 per cent and actual jurisdictional price determinations. The Australian Industry Group highlights that recent electricity prices have mainly been driven by increases in network costs and that this will continue to be a source of upward pressure on electricity costs. I call on the opposition to start quoting those Industry Group comments as opposed to the ones they bandy around in this House all too often. 


We have heard the member for Indi talking about insulting businesses. I agree: it is an insult to businesses for members of the opposition time and time again to come in here and start twisting the words of businesses on why they have shut down part or the whole of their business. We heard it again today on the Penrice closure. On 18 January 2013, Penrice announced it would cease production of soda ash, partially cited in the introduction of a carbon price. What the member for Indi did not state is that, when asked whether the soda ash plant would have closed without the carbon price in operation, Penrice's general manager of chemical operations said yes.




Dr Southcott:
  It didn't help. He said it had a major bearing.




Mrs D'ATH:
  'It didn't help'—that is the contribution of the opposition. Let us be honest with the Australian people about what we are doing. I am happy to stand here and state the facts for the Australian people and the opposition. Since the start of the carbon price on 1 July 2012, 133,500 extra jobs have been created, more than 20 every hour. There have been 118,546 new companies registered, more than 20 every hour. Company share prices have grown strongly with the S&P and ASX200 index up 25 per cent. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 per cent in the year to December. 


Australia has retained one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world at 5.4 per cent. The average weekly earnings grew by 4.6 per cent in the year to December, and business investment has continued at very high levels with almost $270 billion in confirmed investment into Australia's resources industry alone in the pipeline, according to the latest Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics figures. Last week we saw a strong employment result highlighting that 926,000 jobs had been created since the Labor government came into office in November 2007 and that 71,580 jobs were created in the last month—the largest monthly growth in jobs since July 2000. So I am happy to talk about our record.


We want to talk about manufacturing. We want to talk about jobs. We know that parts of the economy are experiencing pressures from the high dollar and other structural changes. That is why we are taking action to support jobs through our $5.4 billion new car plan, supporting 250,000 jobs. Through our support for Vodafone, with which we are bringing 750 jobs back to Tasmania from India, we are actually onshoring. The Gillard government is investing $1 billion to grow jobs through our plans for Australian jobs.


If we want to talk about the clean energy future package, we can talk about the support that we are giving manufacturers through the Jobs and Competitiveness Program, the support we are giving through the Clean Technology Investment Program and the Community Energy Efficiency Program and the assistance that peak bodies are providing through the Energy Efficiency Information Grants. But let us talk about real examples: Mackay Sugar Ltd. Mackay Sugar is investing over $120 million to reduce carbon emissions across its operations by 70 per cent for every unit of production. There is Crafty Chef of Emu Plains. With the help of nearly $500,000 from carbon pricing revenue, Crafty Chef, a Western Sydney food processor, will install a new commercial blast freezer. This will reduce the carbon intensity of its operations by 54.1 per cent, reducing energy intensity by over 56 per cent and boosting turnover by 150 per cent to $50 million. We have already heard from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency today in relation to AJ Bush & Sons. They were one of the loudest opponents to the carbon tax and they are now saying, 'You know what? It works, and it puts us at the forefront of energy efficiency and we are leading our industry.' So do not take our word for it. Go talk to these companies. 


I quoted before the Leader of the Opposition saying that the cement industry will be gone. Does he extend that to asphalt and clay products? Boral Bricks in Queensland are increasing their energy efficiency by 56 per cent and saving over half a million dollars through the Clean Technology Investment Grants. Downer EDI Works have just received a grant from the Gillard government's Clean Technology Investment Program, which means that they will be able to upgrade their plant to manufacture asphalt containing up to 40 per cent of recycled material. This project will allow Downer EDI Works to cut energy costs at the site by $480,000 a year and reduce the facility's carbon emissions intensity by 33 per cent. These reductions will be achieved through cutting-edge processes and technologies that will allow asphalt to be produced at a lower temperature and therefore it will require less energy. So I welcome these industries, small and large across this country, stepping up and seeing the opportunities that come with moving to a clean energy and renewable energies future and becoming more energy efficient in their business. 


I will finish with this: the member for Indi talked about significant challenges for businesses and about the international pressures. We agree that there are international pressures, and that is why we need to step up and be part of the action on climate change. If we were to see the Clean Energy Future Package ripped up after 14 September, all of these businesses would be left in the lurch. It will set this country back years in relation to our international negotiations for taking action, and all of these companies will be left behind, because they are out there taking the initiative, investing in clean energy, investing in energy efficiency, and the opposition are saying: 'Vote for us and we'll rip the whole lot up.'

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2013-03-19,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (15:48):  The previous speaker mentioned Boral as an example of how good and how fantastic the carbon tax is, and not two months ago Boral announced that 790 of its workers would be made redundant. This is just one in a very long roll call. I want to speak about this government's record on jobs. I want to go through the roll call of major companies that have shed their workers. These are Australian icons. They are well-known major manufacturing firms. Let us just run through the list: CSR, Rosella Foods, Amcor, Penrice Soda, Boral, BlueScope Steel, Holden, Ford, Pacific Brands, Goodman Fielder, Holden again, Toyota, CSR, BlueScope Steel again, OneSteel, SPC Ardmona, Golden Circle, Ford again. Bosch, Bradken, Boral for the second time, National Foods, Austal Shipbuilder, Cadbury, Bridgestone, Caterpillar, Rio Tinto, Pacific Brands with a massive 1,850 jobs, Ford for a third time, Holden for a third time, and one very close to my heart—the closure of Mitsubishi. 


This is the record of the government over the last five years on jobs. This is their record. Paul Keating once famously said of a trade union leader that he had the jobs of 100,000 workers around his neck. This government has the jobs of thousands of these workers around its neck. These are people who had a breadwinner one day and then they came home to their family having lost their job the next day. These are private sector jobs. The government is responsible for the economy. What we have seen is a terrible indictment of this government—a roll call of Australian icon business after Australian icon business and the loss of thousands of jobs. 


I want to now turn to the carbon tax and—



Mr Perrett interjecting—




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  They are Australian workers, you dope. They are Australian workers and they are Australian jobs. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott

  I withdraw that I called the member for Moreton a dope. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, you withdraw unreservedly.

  I withdraw. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You use the words again: 'I withdraw unreservedly.' 




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  I withdraw unreservedly. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Boothby has the call. 




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  Thank you very much. I now want to speak on a very important matter for Australia and particularly for South Australia, and that is the impact of the carbon tax. I have spoken about the job losses we have already seen under this government, and that is the climate in which the carbon tax was introduced. It is a tax based on a lie. We all remember that quote, when six days before the last election the current Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' It was explicit and unequivocal.


Not a single member of the current government, not a single member of the Labor party and not a single Labor candidate campaigned on the introduction of a carbon tax. The lesson from Australian political history and from politics around the world is that a party that says one thing before an election and does another thing in government pays a very high price at the ballot box.


This is a tax that will impact on every facet of our lives. It is going to increase the cost of everything and put further financial pressures on businesses within Australia. Businesses are calling the carbon tax 'the straw that broke the camel's back'. Many Australian businesses were surviving on wafer-thin profit margins before the introduction of the carbon tax. All the carbon tax has done is put their budget bottom line into the red. ASIC reports that over the past 12 months to March there were 10,632 company collapses—886 a month. The number of firms being placed into administration is now 12 per cent higher than it was during the GFC. While the carbon tax is not the sole reason for these closures, the carbon tax is adding to the financial burdens of already struggling firms, tipping them over the edge of profitability.


Greg Evans, the chief economist of ACCI, has stated, 'Rapidly escalating energy prices caused by the carbon tax and other green programs are taking their toll on many Australian businesses'. He went on to state that this is already being demonstrated in job losses, deferred investment and, in the worst cases, business closures. Businesses in industries like steel, cement, chemicals and plastics, car and car component manufacturing, food and grocery processing and aluminium and glass have been crippled by the introduction of the carbon tax. These industries are all electricity-heavy industries, and the carbon tax has caused their electricity prices to skyrocket. You only need to look at the list of businesses that have cut jobs since the carbon tax was announced and then introduced. The introduction of the carbon tax is just sending manufacturing and jobs overseas to countries that are not crippling their industries with unnecessary costs for emissions. In food and grocery industries, the cost is only compounded, increasing the cost of transport, power, refrigeration and logistics.


I turn to South Australia and the impact of the carbon tax on jobs and manufacturing there. The carbon tax is having and will continue to have a negative effect on jobs and manufacturing across the state. On 2 November 2012, Holden announced that it would cut 170 jobs at the Elizabeth plant. That came on top of two previous job cuts under this government. On 18 January 2013, Penrice Soda announced that it will cease soda ash production at their Adelaide plant in June 2013. They have been producing soda ash there for the past 70 years—in the forties, the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, eighties, the nineties and the noughties. Now, under this government, they have decided that they will cease soda production. This will cause the loss of up to 70 jobs at the plant. The jobs will now go overseas, as Penrice have decided to import soda ash from now on. They specifically cited the carbon tax as having had a major bearing on this decision.


On 16 January 2013, Boral announced the loss of 790 jobs across its Australian operations. This will impact on local operations in South Australia. Peter Macks, the principal at a local Adelaide based insolvency firm, Macks Advisory, has stated publicly that the carbon tax has been quite debilitating for many hotel operators who have been struggling for a long time. You only need to look at the Belair Hotel, a hotel in my electorate. I raised this issue in this chamber late last year. The hotel's off peak power rate increased by 45 per cent. The bill clearly listed 'carbon adjustment' as the main reason for the increase. The effect of this, according to the hotel manager, was either jobs or prices. The first post carbon tax electricity bill—a monthly bill—of the Lakes Resort Hotel in South Australia cost them an extra $3500 a month due to the carbon adjustment alone. These costs will have an impact either on price or on jobs.


The carbon tax is a bad tax. It was introduced dishonestly. It has crippled industry. The single biggest thing that this parliament could do to help with the cost of living, to help jobs and to help the economy would be to abolish the job-destroying carbon tax. That would restore the confidence of and give support to the manufacturing industry in Australia. It would support the creation of local jobs. The coalition, in government, will abolish the carbon tax.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:57):  The other day I was looking at Twitter. There was a very interesting tweet from an individual quoting the Economist from 1848. What the Economist said in 1848 was 'Suffering and evil are nature’s admonitions; they cannot be got rid of'. That is what the Economist magazine said about the introduction of the sewer. You can be sure that whenever there is some form of progress in human affairs there will be some conservative out there saying: 'The sky's going to fall. You can't fix these problems. It's all too hard. It'll all cost too much. It's the end of the world as we know it.' Haven't we just heard that from the previous speaker? He got up there with a long list of jobs. He was all grim. He talked about armageddon and all the rest of it. He talked about Mitsubishi, which closed in 2008, in discussing the carbon price.


There is a fair bit of disingenuous conduct going on over there among the opposition on these matters. That is because they cannot win the substantive argument that is going on not just in Australia but around the world. That argument is, on one hand, jobs, growth and investment and, on the other hand, austerity, recession and the downward spiral of disinvestment. That is the choice that Australia has and that indeed is the choice that is having to be made around the world. This country during the GFC made the right choice. That is why we have an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent. That is why we have seen growth in our economy. That is why we have seen business investment in our economy. That is why around the world Australia is regarded as something of a lone survivor of the GFC period. Look at the nations that have embraced the austerity policies of the opposition. The United Kingdom had a jobless rate of 7.8 per cent the last time the figures came out. That country has zero growth.


As their economy fails to grow, their ability to service their debts lessens. That is what is happening in the United Kingdom.


If you look at Europe, where they have embraced austerity, you will see 50 per cent youth unemployment rates in places like Spain and Greece. The choice that the world has had—it has been no different since the depression—is about how you tackle these periods that occur periodically in capitalism. There was the global financial crisis and, before that, the Great Depression. The right way to embrace it is through Keynesian economics—that is, to support growth and economic confidence and to use the benefits of economic growth to service debt. The wrong way to go about it is to try to cut your way out of trouble—to try to cut government expenditure—because cutting government expenditure destroys growth in your economy, and, as you destroy growth, your capacity to service any debt goes downwards. 


The approach of the opposition was best espoused by Hoover's Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon. What he said was, 'Liquidate labour, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate; purge all the rottenness out of the system.' That was the approach of conservatives in the 1930s and that is the approach of conservatives now. They have not learnt a single thing along the way from these great crises in capitalism.


It is a critical point that you are always better growing your economy to service your debt. You heard the Leader of the Opposition in question time today referring to the nation's credit card. Of course, it is completely misleading to the public to talk about household budgets and credits cards. A nation's economy is not a household budget, and it isn't a credit card. If you are going to use those sorts of analogies, a much better analogy is to say, 'It's like a young person taking out a loan to go to university, to get higher skills to get a higher income to produce more to be able to service that debt.' That would be a much better analogy to make than the one that is made constantly by those in opposition, which is based on the idea that there is some sort of fixed amount of money and some sort of fixed debt and your capacity to service it is best served by cut, cut, cut. I tell you: it is not. The proof is in the pudding. Go to the United Kingdom. Look at what they have tried over there. They have tried exactly what you are going to do, and it has been a dismal failure. 


There is another debate going on around the world, and that is about how best to deal with climate change. You have two choices here. You can deal with it through a market mechanism, which this nation has done. Electricity emissions have dropped by 8.6 per cent since the carbon price was introduced, jobs have been created—I will go through the figures later on—and investment has continued and the ASX risen. The market mechanism is sending a price signal to people—to companies and consumers alike—and that puts the onus on the polluter. 


The other alternative is to have big-government plans. In this case the opposition wants to have a big-government subsidy to polluters. In effect they are saying: 'We're not going to leave it to investors, markets and businesses to deal with this problem. We're going to leave it is politicians and bureaucrats.' Common sense would tell you that a price signal and markets are a much better way of dealing with this issue and a much better way of sorting out climate change; and around the world we are now starting to see price signals being put into place. In China, in California and in other places around the world, this is the way the world will deal with climate change. 


Having gone through all of this debate and legislation, and having had the parliament's attention on it, the opposition intends to tear up the government's reforms—to unscramble the egg and to cause massive dislocation to the economy of this country and the business community of this country by tearing it all up. They are going to cut pensions. They are going to put their hands into the pocket of every low-income earner in the country and put them back into the tax system—one million people going into the tax system. But for what? Look at the facts. Do not listen to me; listen to Stephen Koukoulas from the Climate Spectator, who said that since the carbon price has been put in the Australian Stock Exchange has gone up 25 per cent—that is, by $296 billion. It paid out $30 billion in dividends. House prices have gone up 2.8 per cent since the carbon price came in, and that adds about $110 billion to household wealth. So the gains overall are about $410 billion in the eight months, which is about $50,000 per household. That does not sound like disaster to me. It does not sound as if the world is going to cave in. As I said before, in electricity emissions there has been 7.6 million fewer tonnes of carbon—an 8.6 per cent drop. 


Look at the facts that the parliamentary secretary read out before. There have been 133,000 extra jobs—more than 20 extra jobs every hour since carbon pricing started. There have been 118,000 new companies—20 every hour. Company share prices have grown strongly, as I said before, and growth has been at the rate of 3.1 per cent. There has been low unemployment—5.4 per cent: the envy of the world. There were 71,000 jobs created in February alone.


This is an economy that is operating exactly as it has always operated. It has taken the carbon price in its stride. We know that the Henny Pennys from the opposition want to go out there and talk everything down. We heard the member for Boothby talk about Holdens. Those on the opposite side of the chamber come in here with all this doom and gloom and concern, but the very same people criticised Holden workers getting a pay rise. The very same people were crying crocodile tears over job losses.


Those on the opposite side of the chamber do not talk about the Holden Cruze coming off the line. They do not talk about the new model Commodore. They do not talk about the exports to the United States of police cars and performance cars. They do not talk about the two new models that we have locked in, maintaining production at Holden until 2022. The most important thing a government can do is co-invest to ensure a billion dollars worth of investment down there at Holden at Elizabeth.


The member for Boothby comes in here. But they do not have an automotive policy—and the policies they do have terrify those in the automotive industry. For him to come into this chamber and talk about jobs is just ridiculous. The choice around the world is growth and jobs and investment versus austerity and recession. That is the choice that we face, and the opposition insist on embracing austerity and recession. It is a fool's errand, and the people of Australia will find that out.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2013-03-19,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:07):  We have just had five minutes from the member for Wakefield as to how fantastic the carbon tax is and the impacts it is having. He says house prices are up, job numbers are up, new companies are being created and cars are running off the line because of the carbon tax at $23 per tonne. If the carbon tax is so fantastic for house prices, so fantastic for jobs and for new company creation, why not make it $50 per tonne, or $100 per tonne, or $200 per tonne? On the Labor Party's warped logic, that would mean that house prices would be even higher, there would be even more jobs, there would be even more companies created and the share price would be even higher, according to the member for Wakefield. But, of course, it is absolute nonsense. The carbon price has no such impact. The carbon price is a dampener on all of those activities, and every economist in the nation will tell you. 


I would like to give the member for Wakefield and those opposite, first of all, some cold, sober and tragic facts. Let me just go through what happened last week. On 12 March 2013, the last wholly Australian-owned cannery, Cowra's Windsor Farm Foods factory, was placed into voluntary administration, with 70 jobs lost. The day before that, on 11 March, CSR's Viridian put off 150 jobs. The week before that, on 1 March, the iconic soup manufacturer, Rosella, shut down, with the loss of 70 jobs. The week before that, Amcor announced that over 300 jobs will be lost. The week before that, Penrice Soda announced that it will cease soda ash production and cited the carbon tax as having a big bearing on its decision. A couple of weeks before that Boral announced that 790 jobs will be lost. The week before that BlueScope Steel announced the loss of 170 jobs. That just brings me back to mid-January. I could continue to go through this exhaustive list, going week by week by week, all the way back to find jobs lost after jobs lost after jobs lost in our manufacturers.


I ask the Labor government members, in all seriousness: how many jobs need to be lost before they realise that the manufacturing sector is struggling? And why is it struggling? In part it is because the Aussie dollar is high. But a big part is also because the government's policies are making it so much harder for Australian manufacturers. We know that they have re-regulated the labour market, which makes it tougher. We know that they have added 20,000 new regulations and only removed 200. But the worst aspect of it all is the introduction of the world's largest carbon tax. This diminishes the key competitive advantage of our manufacturers, which is cheap energy. Do not just believe me or the coalition in making these statements, but listen to the businesses themselves as to why they are laying off workers or why they are closing down their businesses. Many will cite that the carbon tax has been a direct contributor to it.


Or you can read yesterday's ASIC report, which also blamed the carbon tax for contributing to so many businesses closing across Australia. That report found that there were 10,632 company collapses over the last 12 months. That is 12 per cent higher than during the global financial crisis. The member for Wakefield tells us how fantastic everything is, and yet we have had company collapses 12 per cent higher than during the peak of the global financial crisis. This report says that, while the high Aussie dollar is seen as the main factor behind manufacturing closures, experts say the carbon tax is adding to increasing cost burdens for many firms struggling to stay afloat.


You also could listen to what the ACCI chief, Mr Greg Evans, says in relation to the carbon tax:


In energy reliant industries—


such as manufacturers—


it is already showing up in job losses, deferred investment and in the worst cases, business closures.


That is the reality. The member for Wakefield and those opposite can say for as long as they like how fantastic this carbon tax is, how it is leading to growth and to companies starting up and how it is leading to additional jobs and all sorts of other great things. But the reality is in fact the opposite. The reality is that we have had more companies close than at the peak of the GFC, and almost every week we are having manufacturers laying off workers. The reason this is occurring is very simple. The carbon tax is damaging to our manufacturers because it makes them less competitive versus their fierce competitors from overseas, because the carbon tax applies to the production here in Australia but does not apply to manufactured goods produced overseas and imported into Australia. In that regard it acts like a reverse tariff. Nearly all manufacturers these days compete against Chinese, Indian or Vietnamese imports. All this does is make the cost burden high for our manufacturers compared to those manufacturers of imports. It is a remarkably simple concept.


The Labor Party do not understand these basic business concepts because they do not have any business people on their benches. They are all union leaders, and it is terrific that they are all union bosses and they are all union members now. But they do not have any people who have had experience in business or in basic economics to understand that if you make our businesses more expensive and you do not put the same costs on our competitor businesses then our businesses will be worse off and will therefore be at a competitive disadvantage. The member for Wakefield talked about the car industry. PricewaterhouseCoopers examined the impact of the carbon tax on the car industry and it said that there would be a $400 per car cost associated with the carbon tax. That applies to every car manufactured in Australia, but it does not apply to the cars coming in from Japan or from China or from South Korea or from the UK or from Germany. So what does that do to our car manufacturers? It adds $400 to our cars but not to those imported ones.


The Prime Minister talks about sending price signals, but what price signal does this send, when you add $400 to the cost of an Australian made car but that does not apply to an imported car? The price signal it sends is, 'Go and buy the imported car,' and that consequently leads to fewer jobs.


In my own electorate I have 1,000 manufacturers, employing about 10,000 people. It is a huge proportion of my electorate. Nearly all of them are competing with overseas players, and many of them have told me that they are struggling because of the high energy costs. Those high energy costs, particularly in the last 12 months, have been driven almost entirely by the carbon tax. This year is just the start of the carbon tax. It is $23 per tonne and it is causing a 10 to 20 per cent increase on electricity prices for businesses. But that is just the start. In two years time it will be $29 per tonne. By 2050 it will be $350 per tonne, according to the government's own figures. You can look up the government's own figures and they say it will be $350 per tonne by 2050.


If this carbon tax stays in place and it goes up to $350 per tonne, I would predict that that will be the end of manufacturing in my electorate and almost all manufacturing across Australia. I cannot see how manufacturing in this country could survive if the carbon tax went up fifteenfold to $350. That is what is at stake here in this debate, and that is what is at stake in this election coming up. We have two competing visions in relation to our manufacturing sector. From our side, we would scrap the carbon tax. Make no bones about that—it would be gone, and we would provide other incentives to boost manufacturing in this country. On the other side of the ledger, the Labor Party are promising to continue with the carbon tax and continue with the upward trajectory of that tax—starting at $23 this year, going to $29 in two years time and going all the way up to $350 in 2050. That is exactly what the government has forecast and exactly what the government actually desires. This carbon tax needs to go, for the benefit of our manufacturers and the benefit of Australian jobs. (Time expired)

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:17):  Since 1 July last year, 133,500 extra jobs have been created. That is almost 20 each hour. There have been 118,546 new companies registered. That is more than 20 every hour. Company share prices have grown strongly, with the S&P/ASX 200 index up 25 per cent. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, and Australia has retained one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world, at 5.4 per cent. I understand that this is devastating news for those opposite, who hate good economic news. But it is good news for the people in my electorate and it is good news for Australia.



I listened with great interest to the member for Aston's contribution to this debate, because the debate has at its centre the policy to reduce carbon emissions. I should say that, if you are going to have a policy to reduce carbon emissions, it is not a bad starting point to actually believe that carbon emissions are having an impact on climate change. Many on that side of the House do not seem to believe that. I actually respect and listen very carefully to the member for Aston's contributions because I learn a lot from him. I particularly learned a lot from him when I read the article that he wrote in the Australian on 27 February 2007. Members sitting alongside the member for Aston might want to listen to what he had to say before he came to this place. He had this to say:


In determining the appropriate climate change responses, what is needed is not grandstanding … but hard, rational analysis to determine how we can reduce global greenhouse gas emissions with the least possible cost.


…   …   …


Governments are poor at making such hard-headed assessments to determine what gives the best return for a dollar invested: political considerations and emotional arguments inevitably cloud judgments. The decisions should be left to the market.


I could not agree more. I see the member for Wentworth has entered the chamber. If the member for Wentworth and the member for Aston had more authority and more say over the economic and environmental policies of the coalition they would not be in the confused and irrational mess they are in today.


What we have in this debate is a clear choice between a market based solution and the solution once decried by the member for Aston and the member for Wentworth—the policy of planting trees and picking winners. It is the plant-and-pick policy, aiming to plant more trees than the entire surface area of Tasmania, at last count. Is it any wonder that the serious end of town, when it comes to business, are running away from this policy at a great rate of knots? They know that it will not work. But it will cost business more and it will cost Australian consumers more.


As the head of the AiG, Mr Inness Wilcox, has noted:


The scheme has shaped forward and contracted prices for electricity, gas and other business inputs.


Businesses have factored it in; they are getting on with the business. I have to say the policy is working. As the member for Wakefield said in his thoughtful contribution, the policy is working, because carbon emissions from electricity generation have dropped 8.6 per cent since July last year. The policy is clearly working at the lowest cost of abatement.


If you are going to come into parliament this afternoon and say that manufacturing is a matter of public importance, it would not be a bad idea if you had a manufacturing policy yourself. If you are going to say that manufacturing in this country is a matter of public importance it would be a damn good idea if you had a policy yourself—then we could have a proper debate.


I searched for a policy on the member for Indi's website. Do you think I could find one? No, I could not. There was not a policy. It was a policy-free zone. There was a bunch of ideas and some dot points including: toughening up our anti-dumping laws—we have done that; better targeting funding for commercialisation—we have done that; and redrafting the current legislation in relation to research and development tax incentives—we are doing that. I love this one: consider a national inquiry into manufacturing with wide stakeholder involvement. This is devastating stuff.


If you are going to say that manufacturing is a matter of public importance, do your policy homework. Come in to this chamber and have a policy in hand. We have a well-thought-out policy, one that has been arrived at after wide stakeholder consultation and one that will work. It includes putting Australian workers first in the labour market. What we are saying to employers is: you cannot be job snobs. I do not have a problem with employers using the 457 skilled migration program to fill genuine shortfalls in the skilled workforce. I do not have a problem with that. I come from an electorate which took workers from all around the world in the sixties, seventies and eighties to fill workforce shortages. I do not have a problem with that program, but what we do say quite clearly is that, if there are skilled Australian workers who can fill those vacancies, they should be at the front of the queue.


We are establishing a $1 billion program to establish industry and innovation precincts around the country because we know we have put an enormous amount of money into research, development and scientific research in this country through our universities and other fine research institutions around the country. The challenge for us is to ensure that we can connect that great research, those great innovations that are occurring at universities like my own university, the University of Wollongong, where I graduated from. It is a very important part of the local economy in my region. We need to join that research up to ensure that we have a well-informed, well-resourced national innovation strategy and to also join it up with small and medium-sized businesses in our regions.


We need to have an Australian industry participation policy to ensure that, when we have large government investments in new infrastructure or when the private sector is investing, as it is with billions of dollars in new resource projects around the country—despite the doom and gloom that has been spouted by those opposite—Australian businesses, Australian fabricators and Australian manufacturers get a chop at getting some of those contracts they have the capacity to win to ensure that they are able to thrive with this great mining boom going on.


I have to say it is already working. I can tell the story of Maintech, an engineering company from my own electorate which, once upon a time, not two years ago, had over 90 per cent of its work from BlueScope but saw the writing on the wall and decided that it had to diversify. It is now winning large contracts including a $100 million contract with Anglo American Australia, a large mining project in Queensland, which is going to employ over 100 people in my electorate.


There are numerous other elements to our policy I could talk about. I could talk about how small and medium-sized enterprises, which have great innovations or great ideas, can convert those great innovations or ideas into a business opportunity. We are doing that through our jobs program and by ensuring that they have access to venture capital.


The one thing that matters more than anything else in my electorate is ensuring that BlueScope is able to see its way through this difficult period it has encountered due to the high Australian dollar having a bigger impact than anything else. The $300 million steel transformation plan, which was voted against by each and every one of those coalition members on the other side of the chamber, is ensuring that not only are the doors of BlueScope being kept open but they are turning the corner. In the latest announcement to the Australian Stock Exchange, BlueScope said it expects to turn a profit in the very near future.


As the member for Wakefield said, you have two options: you can bury your head in a bucket of sand—or pick and plant—which is their policy, or you can try and show some leadership. That is the policy that is adopted by this side of the House. (Time expired)

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2013-03-19,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (16:27):  Manufacturing in Australia is on a knife edge. There is no denying that. The government's carbon tax is proving to be job destroying and confidence crushing. Over the last five years since 2008, 109,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing. The Gillard government proved its negligence of and contempt for the manufacturing sector when it dumped the manufacturing portfolio in December 2011, before realising its mistake and reinstating it.


The Australian manufacturing industry once enjoyed a huge competitive advantage. It had access to cheap and abundant energy and access to cheap water. Now the industry has to cope with a $23-per-tonne carbon tax, which will increase on 1 July each year rising to $350 per tonne by the year 2050. That is something for the industry to look forward to indeed.


Some industries receive bailout money while others are ignored. There is no formula with this government on who gets it and who does not. It is just handed out on a whim. There is no science behind it they wants industry to survive. As we all know, the high Australian dollar has made market conditions difficult for our manufacturers.


But the implementation of a carbon tax has significantly added to the pressures, and the government says, to the contrary, 'It's going to be okay; everyone's going to thrive.' As the people on this side say, if it is such a good thing, why not double it? Why not triple it?


The 20 per cent by 2020 renewable energy target has also added to the problems of the manufacturing industry, and it affects their bottom line. The 20 per cent renewable energy target cannot be achieved by 2020—and, if it is, it is going to be too expensive, which will add another burden to our manufacturing arm.


Repeated budget deficits are placing pressure on interest rates and the availability of capital, as the government is competing in the money market with our private enterprise. This means that many Aussie businesses and manufacturers are surviving on paper-thin margins. How much longer can they take to get back into profit? As the member on the other side has just said, they hope to come into profit soon. How soon is 'soon'?


Industries affected by the government's destructive policies include steel—BlueScope, OneSteel. When they put up their hands and asked for help they were told by this government: 'Get used to the new world.' What does that mean?


Vehicles and car-component manufacturers are also under the pump. Toyota and Ford not only have to compete against each other in Australia but have to compete with other plants run by Toyota, Ford and Holden in other parts of the world. They rely on 50 per cent local consumption of their vehicles and 50 per cent for the overseas market. If one of those markets falls, the car industry is in deep trouble. The carbon tax will cost the car industry about $500 million a year, but the government says, 'Well, we will refund them $500 million a year.'


Cement companies that are based in my town of Gladstone are under the pump as well. They have to compete with the Chinese clinker, which can be imported cheaper than they can produce them in Gladstone. Chemical companies like Orica, which again are situated in Gladstone, are facing competition from overseas. Our food and food processors certainly have to compete.


The cost of aluminium production is about $2,300 a tonne. The current price for aluminium is about $2,000 a tonne. Glass, and the rag trade—textiles—are also disappearing. You cannot buy locally made stubbies, shorts or uniforms—they now all come to us from overseas. They are all under the pump. The government have perfected the art of chasing our industries offshore. They are doing a very good job at that—that is about the only good job they are doing.


The carbon tax is a total contradiction: whilst our emissions will go down, globally they will increase. Our cement industry in Gladstone is the most efficient plant in the world—and yet, if we were to lose that plant to some overseas country, you would find that Australia's best practice, as with a lot of industries in Australia, would be lost to other countries that can produce a similar product but for a much lower price.


The carbon tax has elevated costs in the transport, power, logistics and refrigeration industries. A friend of mine who has a hotel in Yeppoon told me at a luncheon that his electricity prices have risen from $12,000 a month to $19,000 a month—and that spells a loss of jobs for that industry. The power bill of the cement industry in Gladstone has risen by $1 million a year. That puts that industry under a lot of pressure.


The Gillard government has failed to reward those companies who have had voluntary programs to reduce their emissions. The aluminium industry has reduced its emissions by 26 per cent since 1990. Cement companies have reduced their emissions by 20 per cent since 1990 and reduced their carbon intensity by 24 per cent per tonne. Meatworks, and all sorts of other industries, have reduced their emissions—not because of the carbon tax but on their own initiative and their own pride in their workplace. And now those particular industries are being punished by this reckless government.


Senator Penny Wong, on 21 and 22 June 2012, could not define what a 'green job' was; she could not give an example of one. And they say these green jobs are going to replace the tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs that have been lost. They just don't get it—no-one can tell me what a green job is and how they are going to replace the manufacturing jobs. They cannot. The government has conceded that the carbon tax has brutalised the Australian manufacturing sector. The coalition knows what needs to be done: we need to scrap the tax and give our manufacturers a fighting chance.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2013-03-19,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (21:32):  Last Thursday, 14 March 2013, I had a visit from Cowan delegates from the Roadtrip to End Poverty. I thank Shenae Hunter, Jade Contarino, Nasreen Lang and Rebecca Miller for coming to see me. I appreciate their keen interest in foreign aid.


I would say clearly that I support foreign aid, and I hope that this country will soon be able to reach the goal of 0.5 per cent of GDP. I support foreign aid that makes a difference and that goes to making improvements in the capacities of communities. I do not believe that all of our foreign aid is effective. By example, in 2012 the Australian reported that World Vision was working with a group that has 'deep links' with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group, a proscribed terrorist agency.


It is also notable that some NGOs that receive aid funding had been actively lobbying against the Labor's now abandoned decision to prioritise a budget surplus ahead of increasing aid funding. They are within their rights to lobby for the government to increase government aid spending, but, when there is a perception that they use that money to lobby in Australia, that is not providing faith in the effectiveness of the aid. I also understand that the Australian Conservation Foundation uses aid funding to run programs to promote grassroots engagement on climate change policy and to support the Labor government's introduction of the carbon tax.


I referred before to capacity development. It has also been noted that in some cases aid funded NGOs are engaged to undermine the objectives of Australia's aid program to promote sustainable economic development. There is unwillingness to accept that the use and development of natural resources in developing countries helps those countries to move from subsistence economies to manufacturing and eventually to service based economies.


It should be remembered that AusAID recipient organisations cannot be engaged in political activity that is primarily isolated to partisan activities. It is a fairly narrow definition of political activity, meaning they can be engaged in political campaigns so long as they do not involve directly endorsing parties in Australia or abroad. I do wonder whether aid funding is being used for political activity in this country.


As I said on the day of their visit, in all my doorknocking I have not once been asked about foreign aid. Yet, despite that, I do support the concept of foreign aid, and I and the coalition support the goal of 0.5 per cent of GDP. What I would, however, like to do is to remind all those who visited parliament last Thursday that it was this Labor government that cut foreign aid by $3 billion in the 2011-12 budget. It was this Labor government that ensured that goal of 0.5 per cent of GDP going to foreign aid would not be achieved by 2015.


I know that it is fashionable for many that support foreign aid to always see the coalition as somehow being against foreign aid. Those same people vote Green or Labor because they falsely believe that those parties are the friends of foreign aid. As we know, anyone who follows the Green how-to-vote card will end up voting Labor. Those that support the 0.5 per cent of GDP ambition should ask themselves: which side of politics stopped that goal being achieved? Who was responsible? The answer is that it was this Labor government that cut foreign aid. It was this Labor government, which was maintained by the support of the Greens and was the recipient of so many Green preferences, that cut foreign aid. That is the fact of the matter.


I therefore call upon those that lobby so hard on this issue to hold to account Labor and the Greens. They failed you, and if you wish to be taken seriously then you should do this. But the sad truth is that it seems there is no interest in holding those responsible to account. It is far easier, it seems, to start talking about a 0.7 per cent goal, the next goal, glossing over the betrayal of the left side of politics and instead talking about getting the coalition to commit to that goal, and to be negative about us. It is far easier to do that than it is to speak of the reality of what the Labor Party has done to you.


I actually expect that the vast majority will continue to support the left, blinded by a political dogma that falsely supposes that compassion exists only on the left and is oblivious as to who made the cuts that trashed the 0.5 per cent of GDP.


In spite of that, I reiterate that I support the 0.5 per cent of GDP goal. I do support it, but I would take this opportunity to speak of the certainty with regard to poverty.


The certainty is that, through a strong economy, jobs are created and poverty can be alleviated. That is why capacity building in economic growth and education are the areas that must particularly be targeted. To achieve maximum effect in this area, we need governance to also be addressed. I often wonder what could be done in these countries where poverty exists and those living with poverty are held down by the decisions of self-serving governments. So I say yes to foreign aid, but keep every dollar away from political activity particularly here, and concentrate on building strong economies and better education. These are outcomes for effective taxpayer funded foreign aid.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:01):  I was visited yesterday by Ric Bull and Sara Hourigan, from Water for Rivers, which is delivering water savings with community, commercial and environmental benefits. Unfortunately, Water for Rivers is now winding up. It is a public company established in 2003 by the Australian, New South Wales and Victorian governments with the objective of recovering water, principally through water savings projects in those aforementioned states.


Underpinning each of these projects was the goal of leaving a regional legacy of water use efficiency and increased agricultural productivity, and they have achieved much. Water savings targets set for Water for Rivers have been exceeded by a full 11 per cent, or a total of 313 gigalitres of water saved, all within the anticipated time frame and within budget. Eighty per cent of water recovered by Water for Rivers has been through regional projects and investments. As a result, there is now an acknowledged legacy of infrastructure capable of improving the sustainability of regional farms and communities in the context of a future with less water.


Water for Rivers projects have yielded an average recovery cost of water of about $1,400 per megalitre, a figure on par with and in some cases under that of direct water purchase costs. Smarter use of water using real-time technology, epitomised by the Murrumbidgee Computer Aided River Management project, can ultimately and will ultimately deliver better solutions and outcomes for the Murray-Darling Basin, with environmental watering targets met sustainably rather than through water purchase alone. We know that unfortunately, for every $5 the Labor government has spent on water buybacks, it has only spent a dollar on water savings infrastructure, and shame on it for that.


In February 2011, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, said that the government would move to change current taxation arrangements—they were current at the time and they still are, unfortunately—for irrigators who took up water efficiency investment grants to allow more strategic infrastructure investment. I have taken this up with the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, and I know that that particular piece of legislation, that amendment that is so desperately needed, is at the moment being debated and still being worked through, but it is more than two years on and it really needs to happen. The irrigators desperately, desperately need it. Certainly in my area at the moment we are seeing the effects of environmental water flows: inundation levels which residents say will cause man-made flooding, cut off access to their land and cause infrastructure damage.


This is not needed. We could have and should have had good water policy. I am glad that the coalition in government will cap buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres. With the recovery already done, that will only mean 249 more gigalitres. We need better water policy and we need it now. (Time expired)

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:32):  It is my pleasure to speak on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013 on behalf the shadow Treasurer and member for North Sydney. The coalition is supporting this bill, which seeks to implement recommendations made by the coalition government's 2004 review into the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The bill had its origins in recommendations made to the Howard government review of 2003-04 of the Insurance Contracts Act. The review panel's main conclusion was that the act was generally working satisfactorily to the benefit of insurers and the insured; however, the review panel found that some changes would be beneficial given the passage of time since the 1984 act, and given developments in the insurance market over time.


The changes foreshadowed by the review were put in an exposure draft bill by the Howard government in February 2007. With the change of government at the end of that year, the matter lay dormant until 2010, when the Labor government introduced the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill of that year. The 2010 bill had the support of the coalition; however, it lapsed with the calling of the 2010 election, and it has now been reintroduced with minor changes. As I said at the outset, the coalition will again be supporting this bill; however, as the reforms in their current form may not have been examined in detail to determine whether they may add to the cost of living of consumers, reduce specific forms of cover or introduce greater complexity in the form and content of future policies, the bill should be referred to committee. The coalition has sought to do this in the Senate.


The bill has seven schedules and I will briefly go through each of them. The first schedule amends the 1984 act to ensure that a failure to comply with the duty of good faith within an insurance contract is a breach of the 1984 act. The duty of good faith is extended to third-party beneficiaries, but the duty only commences after the contract is entered into.


The bill also gives ASIC the power to commence or continue representative action on behalf of the insured where the party has suffered damage or where there has been a breach of the act. ASIC will be able to access the various remedies under the Corporations Act in relation to Australian financial service licence holders.


Bundled insurance contracts, bundled contracts that include insurance cover for compulsory workers compensation purposes and liability to employees at common law arising from employment related personal injury will be made exempt from the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. However, bundled contracts are to be unbundled where a contract of insurance includes elements of cover that are exempt from the 1984 act as well as elements of cover that are not exempt. Once unbundled, only the elements of cover that are exempt from the 1984 act will be treated as such, whereas before even the non-exempt elements of the bundle were treated as exempt by being part of such a bundle.


The second schedule deals with electronic communications and it amends the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 and the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to allow electronic communication of documents and statutory notices. Electronic communication is, of course, increasingly used for these kinds of transactions, and barriers to its use are a significant cost and red-tape impost to both business and consumers.


Schedule 3 deals with the powers of ASIC and amends the Insurance Contracts Act to give ASIC a statutory right to intervene in any proceeding that relates to matters arising under the 1984 act and under part 3 of the Medical Indemnity (Prudential Supervision and Product Standards) Act 2003.


The fourth schedule deals with disclosure and misrepresentation, and it makes a number of changes to the duty-of-disclosure obligations placed on insurers. The test in section 21 of the 1984 act for whether an insurer has breached a duty is clarified by including a non-exclusive factor to which the court may have regard when determining whether a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know a matter was relevant to the decision of the insurer, the factor involved and the nature and extent of the insurance cover under the contract.


Amendments to section 21A will prevent insurers from asking catch-all questions relating to the risk of the contract as a means of avoiding their duty. Insurers will be required to gain specific agreement on each individual request in relation to any risk in the proposed insurance contract. This will apply at both inception and renewal of the contract. However, on renewal, insurers may choose to seek updates to answers previously provided by the insured person rather than asking specific questions again.


Compliance by the insured with the duty of disclosure on renewal does not mean that a failure to comply with the duty on the original inception or previous renewal is negated. Insurers will be required to notify the insured before the contract of issuance is entered into that the duty-of-disclosure obligations continue until the time the policy is actually entered into. A form of words may be prescribed by regulation for use by insurers to inform persons of their duty of disclosure, and any person subject to the contract is under a duty not to misrepresent.


The fifth schedule deals with remedies for life insurance contracts, and it rectifies remedies in respect of bundled contracts which have been judged by the industry and the government as being inappropriate. These remedies apply to life insurance contracts involving a surrender value and death cover. Bundled contracts will now be able to be unbundled to apply the relevant remedies. The current law forces remedies to be applied to the contract as a whole, which restricts the options for both parties. Insurers will be able to change the expiry date of a life insurance contract where that date has been incorrectly stated by the insured. Also, the statutory framework in the ICA for cancellation of general insurance contracts will be extended to life insurance contracts.


Schedule 6 deals with third parties and inserts new definitions for third-party beneficiaries to ensure that individuals who have rights under a contract of issuance but who are not insured have access to particular rights and obligations currently held by the insured.


Third parties with damages claims against an insured or third-party beneficiary who has died or cannot be found may recover directly against the insurer. ASIC will have powers to bring representative actions on behalf of third-party beneficiaries. Remedies for misrepresentation and nondisclosure are available in relation to life insurance contracts that are offered as part of a group scheme that is unrelated to superannuation and remedies are available with respect to any representation or nondisclosure that occurs between when the insured became a member of the superannuation or other group scheme and when the life insurance takes effect.


The last schedule deals with the allocation of moneys recovered when an insurer exercises a right of subrogation in relation to an insurance claim. On payment of a loss the insurer is subrogated to the rights and remedies of the insured in respect of the subject matter insured. In particular, the insurer may bring an action in the insured's name against any third party who has caused loss. Those seven schedules are outlined in great detail in the minister's second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum. 


As I have said, the coalition is supporting the bill and has supported the bill in the last parliament prior to it lapsing before the election. We do, however, note that its reintroduction, while welcome, is long overdue. Industry stakeholders have been waiting for this to be reintroduced for some time. They are happy with its provisions and the level of input they previously had into the process. They have been consulted at numerous stages now over a number of years, beginning in the final years of the Howard government. This bill is the result of the Howard government's reform agenda on insurance contract regulation. Whilst Labor has dragged its heels in the last couple of years and allowed it to drift, the bill is now before us and the coalition is supporting it.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:42):  I speak in support of Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013. Whilst the member for Casey has accurately gone through the schedules, he says that this particular piece of legislation arises out of the review back in 2004 by the panel consisting of Mr Alan Cameron AM and Ms Nancy Milne. It is a bit broader than that. In fact, or response in relation to insurance contracts also arises out of the natural disaster insurance review report which was commissioned to examine insurance for flood and other natural disasters following the 2010 and 2011 summer floods and also was in part a response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs report In the Wake of Disasters—volume 1: The Operation of the Insurance Industry during Disaster Events, which was presented in parliament in February 2012. So it is broader than that.


I will not go through it schedule by schedule but I will deal with the issue of insurance and how it affects natural disaster. We live in a country of fires, floods and cyclones and other extreme weather events. Those recent natural disasters have been catastrophic not just nationally, not just interstate but in my electorate of Blair, which contains most of Ipswich and all the Somerset region, containing places like the Wivenhoe Dam, the Somerset Dam, Lockyer Creek, Bremer River and the Brisbane River. We have seen catastrophe and people having to interact with the insurance industry, from farmers to businessmen to householders from Mount Stanley and Mount Kilcoy to Karalee and Ebbw Vale and other places in and around Ipswich as well, from stormwater in Redbank Plains to floods in Churchill to terrible disasters from flooding in places like Basin Pocket, North Booval, East Ipswich and Bundamba.


It is not just my electorate that has been affected but in 2009 Victoria experienced the tragic Black Saturday bushfires and 2009 and 2011 fires affected Western Australia. The people of North Queensland, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Littlemore, in our home state have suffered terribly with cyclones Larry, Yasi and Oswald, and we have seen flooding in Western Australia, New South Wales and regional Victoria. And of course there have been 17 major floods since 1840 in the Ipswich and Brisbane region of South-East Queensland. I am sure that many people would not have known places like Grantham, the Lockyer Valley and Ferndale in the Somerset region but have heard of them now.


In 2011 we saw about 186,000 insurance claims as a result of the floods and cyclone in Queensland, the floods in Victoria and the storms and fires in Western Australia. That is an enormous number of insurance claims. Australia has a very large and profitable insurance industry. The gross premiums are about $35 billion per annum and they have total assets of nearly $114 billion. The industry employs about 60,000 people. It pays out on average about $95 million per working day in claims. The big players are companies like Suncorp, IAG, QBE insurance and Allianz Australia. It is a pretty volatile market, of course, but there are high levels of competition.


The experience of my community during the floods was that they were brutalised by the floods and brutalised by the claims process they endured dealing with their insurance. Contracts of insurance are really a transfer of economic risk from an insured to an insurer. People do not quite understand that. A premium is paid in relation to it. We have very much adopted the English law in relation to insurance. The main legislation came into Australia in 1986 with the Insurance Contracts Act, which we amended when we came to office. Under that Insurance Contracts Act, people must act with utmost good faith towards one another. Sadly, the insurance industry has had a real get-out-of-jail-free card in relation to those types of breaches. There are of course precontractual negotiations. Some of them can just be a phone call. Others can be correspondence through email. It is a very serious thing to mislead people, particularly in relation to material facts. As a litigation lawyer, I dealt with those kinds of things in private practice.


There are many changes in this bill. One in the first schedule is an amendment to the Insurance Contracts Act so that failure to comply with the duty of utmost good faith is a breach of the Insurance Contracts Act. That is something that the House of Representatives standing committee recommended that we do. We found during our inquiry that insurance companies not only were unaccountable in that regard but had their own insurance code of practice which they felt they could use to get out of jail free when a natural disaster took place. In other words, they had obligations which their clients felt they had contracted with the insurance company in terms of notification, processing of claims and getting back information. But then the insurance companies simply junked the code of practice via a provision that they had in 4.3 of that code of practice. 


I admit that, subsequent to that, with pressure from a lot of people from both sides of the House, particularly Minister Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, they did see the need for an amendment in that regard. I commend the Insurance Council of Australia for their review. They have engaged Ian Enright, an independent reviewer, to look at their code of practice. I met with him recently and discussed the issues that have affected my community. I raised the issue that is before us tonight, about the breach of utmost good faith, and the fact that we need this type of legislation as the insurance industry, by virtue of legislative omission, found itself in a very privileged position.


That standing committee of the House of Representatives recommended a number of changes in relation to the Insurance Contracts Act, and I am pleased that the government took them up. Those included a single definition of 'flood' for home building, home contents, small business, strata title and corporate insurance, and the provision of a key facts sheet, something that was intelligible, in simple and clear English, and did not require a doctorate of law to understand.


I have said before that during the 2011 flood—we were not flooded in Ipswich at my house, although it happened when I was a child—my wife actually asked me, 'Do we have flood insurance?' I looked at my own personal insurance contract and it mentioned 'flood' a number of times. Having had 20 years as a litigation lawyer with a law degree, I can read a contract pretty well. It took me a number of goes to read that I actually personally was not covered for flood insurance. When you are in a time of vulnerability, when your home, farm or business has been flooded, and you are having to deal with an insurance company and you do not understand all these things, the power imbalance is enormous. What we are trying to do with the legislation before us is to get a fairer insurance regime in this country to equalise the power imbalance. That is what we are trying to do. And we are trying to get ASIC involved. I am pleased that we are legislating to protect consumers from unfair terms in insurance contracts. I think those protections should have been for a long time enshrined in our laws to cover these types of situations. Consumer protection legislation is vital. I am pleased it is being extended to general insurance contracts, which in the past have been excluded. 


Australians should not really have to fight and fight and fight in this regard. I have seen on numerous occasions the Financial Ombudsman actually give decisions negative to constituents in Blair but then criticise the insurance company for the claims process handling that they undertook in relation to those particular people. I can think of a flower farmer and his wife who have just recently been involved in one of those cases. I can think of another case where a businessman and his wife in Ipswich were in a similar situation—denied a claim but then the insurance company was criticised by the Financial Ombudsman for the way in which the process was conducted by the insurance company. That is simply unacceptable. People should not be brutalised by a flood and then brutalised by the claims process handling by the insurance company—someone they have contracted with and engaged with in good faith. People need to know that when they pay their premiums they are going to get a fair go, and the insurance company should not hide behind unfair terms to leave people high and dry when it comes to claims. 


There are many reforms in this particular piece of legislation. But I think that it needs to be seen in the context of what we are doing to fix flood insurance in this country. I was pleased recently to see the Prime Minister visit my electorate, and to see steps taken to reduce the cost of insurance across Queensland and elsewhere. It is particularly important because the insurance industry, as I outlined earlier, is a large employer, a large business and a large group of companies that deal with Australians every day. Most Australians do not get charged with criminal offences. Most Australians do not have car accidents. Most Australians do not get injured at work. But most Australians at some point in their life will have an insurance contract. In relation to the reform, the whole package needs to be seen: the single definition of flood, the product disclosure statement and the key facts statement. The amendments before this particular chamber tonight and the work we are doing in terms of flood mitigation and insurance affordability are absolutely critical. We have proposed establishing a national insurance affordability council, and we are working with the insurance industry. I am pleased to see press releases from the Insurance Council of Australia, which is not always favourable to us, welcoming the announcement that this government has undertaken $100 million in funding over two years for flood mitigation projects. The purpose of that is to deal with the insurance industry and reduce the cost of insurance. Reducing the cost of insurance, reducing the burden of the claims process handling is so critical.


In my electorate of Blair, I am pleased to announce $10 million to the Ipswich City Council for flood mitigation projects. That was a terrible experience for people from Rosewood to Redbank Plains, experiencing flood again and again. We saw floods in Ipswich not just in 1893 and in 1974 but in 2011 and in 2013. The floods have really terrorised the people. I was pleased to see that the flood work will be undertaken in places like Thagoona, $1.8 million; Rosewood, $2.8 million; and Redbank Plains, $3.9 million. Nine of the top 10 projects of the Ipswich City Council to reduce the impact of floods on the people of Ipswich will be proceeded with. This is what the Insurance Council of Australia have been calling for. This is what I have been calling for—in the Queensland Times, on River 94.9 radio—again and again, because, by legislation and by action, we can actually make an impact. The Insurance Council have talked about levies in country towns in Queensland and the prospect of levies reducing insurance premiums. Insurance premiums have gone up massively in my community. One of those projects I mentioned involves a levy. I have been to Thagoona many times. This is particularly important for my electorate. I think this is the sort of reform that we need to undertake.


I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am pleased about these legislative changes. I am pleased about the recent announcement. I am also pleased that the Queensland government is going to match the funding that we have put aside for an $80 million mitigation fund to better the situation in Queensland and elsewhere. I support this legislation that is before the chamber.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (16:56):  I thank the members for Casey and Blair for the contributions that they have made to the debate on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013. The measures in the bill modernise and streamline the operation of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The government has undertaken extensive consultation on these measures to ensure that the balance between the interests of insurers, the insured and the wider public is maintained. The measures will help ensure a better-functioning, more efficient insurance market that will ultimately benefit the entire Australian community.


Schedule 1 to the bill makes changes to the scope and application of the act. The changes provide that a failure to comply with the duty of utmost good faith is a breach of the act; that contracts of insurance that are entered into or proposed to be entered into for the purpose of workers compensation law continue to be exempt under the act; and that contracts of insurance that include elements of cover that are exempted from the act as well as cover that falls under the act are treated as exempt from the act only in respect of the exempt elements.


Schedule 2 to the bill makes technical changes to provisions in the act regarding the giving of notices, documents and information. These changes will apply to permit insurers to use electronic communication for the purposes of providing notices or documents that are required to be given in writing.


Schedule 3 to the bill provides ASIC with an additional power to intervene in matters arising under the act. The new power is similar to the existing power ASIC has to intervene in proceedings begun by other persons about matters arising under section 1330 of the Corporations Act. It also allows ASIC to be represented in the proceedings by a staff member, a delegate, a solicitor or counsel.


Schedule 4 to the bill changes the way the act deals with particular types of disclosure and misrepresentations, to clarify how the duty of disclosure test is applied. It amends the law to make the duty of disclosure apply on renewal of an eligible contract of insurance and remove the option for insurers to ask catch-all questions in relation to eligible contracts of insurance. It amends the law regarding circumstances in which an insurer must provide an insured with a reminder as to when their duty of disclosure obligations apply. In respect of life insurance contracts, it amends the law so insurers must give a potential life insured who is not the insured under the relevant contract of insurance notice of their duty of disclosure.


Schedule 5 to the bill changes the way the act deals with the remedies for life insurers in cases of misrepresentation and nondisclosure by insureds prior to their entering into life insurance contracts. The changes provide insurers with additional flexibility when seeking remedies for misrepresentation and nondisclosure, by allowing the unbundling of life insurance contracts so that remedies can be applied to each separate type of cover provided within a bundled life insurance contract; by providing a new remedy for misrepresentation and nondisclosure which will apply to all types of life insurance cover, with the exception of death and surrender value cover; and by expanding the range of remedies available to a life insurer where a misrepresentation of an insured involves a misstatement of the date of birth of the insured under the contract.


Schedule 6 to the bill makes technical changes to the act so that individuals who have rights under a contract of insurance—that is, third-party beneficiaries—but who are not the insured have access to particular rights and obligations currently held by those insured.


Schedule 7 to the bill amends the act to provide improved rules for the division of any proceeds that are received from a recovery action when those proceeds are recovered from a third party by an insurer under a right of subrogation.


In conclusion, these measures are another significant step made by the Gillard government to improve Australia's insurance market. While the measures in the bill, by and large, are technical in nature, as a package they will operate to streamline and clarify requirements while ensuring appropriate consumer protections are maintained.


Question agreed to.

On payment of a loss the insurer is subrogated to the rights and remedies of the insured in respect of the subject matter insured. In particular, the insurer may bring an action in the insured's name against any third party who has caused loss. Those seven schedules are outlined in great detail in the minister's second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum. 


As I have said, the coalition is supporting the bill and has supported the bill in the last parliament prior to it lapsing before the election. We do, however, note that its reintroduction, while welcome, is long overdue. Industry stakeholders have been waiting for this to be reintroduced for some time. They are happy with its provisions and the level of input they previously had into the process. They have been consulted at numerous stages now over a number of years, beginning in the final years of the Howard government. This bill is the result of the Howard government's reform agenda on insurance contract regulation. Whilst Labor has dragged its heels in the last couple of years and allowed it to drift, the bill is now before us and the coalition is supporting it.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:42):  I speak in support of Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013. Whilst the member for Casey has accurately gone through the schedules, he says that this particular piece of legislation arises out of the review back in 2004 by the panel consisting of Mr Alan Cameron AM and Ms Nancy Milne. It is a bit broader than that. In fact, or response in relation to insurance contracts also arises out of the natural disaster insurance review report which was commissioned to examine insurance for flood and other natural disasters following the 2010 and 2011 summer floods and also was in part a response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs report In the Wake of Disasters—volume 1: The Operation of the Insurance Industry during Disaster Events, which was presented in parliament in February 2012. So it is broader than that.


I will not go through it schedule by schedule but I will deal with the issue of insurance and how it affects natural disaster. We live in a country of fires, floods and cyclones and other extreme weather events. Those recent natural disasters have been catastrophic not just nationally, not just interstate but in my electorate of Blair, which contains most of Ipswich and all the Somerset region, containing places like the Wivenhoe Dam, the Somerset Dam, Lockyer Creek, Bremer River and the Brisbane River. We have seen catastrophe and people having to interact with the insurance industry, from farmers to businessmen to householders from Mount Stanley and Mount Kilcoy to Karalee and Ebbw Vale and other places in and around Ipswich as well, from stormwater in Redbank Plains to floods in Churchill to terrible disasters from flooding in places like Basin Pocket, North Booval, East Ipswich and Bundamba.


It is not just my electorate that has been affected but in 2009 Victoria experienced the tragic Black Saturday bushfires and 2009 and 2011 fires affected Western Australia. The people of North Queensland, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Littlemore, in our home state have suffered terribly with cyclones Larry, Yasi and Oswald, and we have seen flooding in Western Australia, New South Wales and regional Victoria. And of course there have been 17 major floods since 1840 in the Ipswich and Brisbane region of South-East Queensland. I am sure that many people would not have known places like Grantham, the Lockyer Valley and Ferndale in the Somerset region but have heard of them now.


In 2011 we saw about 186,000 insurance claims as a result of the floods and cyclone in Queensland, the floods in Victoria and the storms and fires in Western Australia. That is an enormous number of insurance claims. Australia has a very large and profitable insurance industry. The gross premiums are about $35 billion per annum and they have total assets of nearly $114 billion. The industry employs about 60,000 people. It pays out on average about $95 million per working day in claims. The big players are companies like Suncorp, IAG, QBE insurance and Allianz Australia. It is a pretty volatile market, of course, but there are high levels of competition.


The experience of my community during the floods was that they were brutalised by the floods and brutalised by the claims process they endured dealing with their insurance. Contracts of insurance are really a transfer of economic risk from an insured to an insurer. People do not quite understand that. A premium is paid in relation to it. We have very much adopted the English law in relation to insurance. The main legislation came into Australia in 1986 with the Insurance Contracts Act, which we amended when we came to office. Under that Insurance Contracts Act, people must act with utmost good faith towards one another. Sadly, the insurance industry has had a real get-out-of-jail-free card in relation to those types of breaches. There are of course precontractual negotiations. Some of them can just be a phone call. Others can be correspondence through email. It is a very serious thing to mislead people, particularly in relation to material facts. As a litigation lawyer, I dealt with those kinds of things in private practice.


There are many changes in this bill. One in the first schedule is an amendment to the Insurance Contracts Act so that failure to comply with the duty of utmost good faith is a breach of the Insurance Contracts Act. That is something that the House of Representatives standing committee recommended that we do. We found during our inquiry that insurance companies not only were unaccountable in that regard but had their own insurance code of practice which they felt they could use to get out of jail free when a natural disaster took place. In other words, they had obligations which their clients felt they had contracted with the insurance company in terms of notification, processing of claims and getting back information. But then the insurance companies simply junked the code of practice via a provision that they had in 4.3 of that code of practice. 


I admit that, subsequent to that, with pressure from a lot of people from both sides of the House, particularly Minister Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong, they did see the need for an amendment in that regard. I commend the Insurance Council of Australia for their review. They have engaged Ian Enright, an independent reviewer, to look at their code of practice. I met with him recently and discussed the issues that have affected my community. I raised the issue that is before us tonight, about the breach of utmost good faith, and the fact that we need this type of legislation as the insurance industry, by virtue of legislative omission, found itself in a very privileged position.


That standing committee of the House of Representatives recommended a number of changes in relation to the Insurance Contracts Act, and I am pleased that the government took them up. Those included a single definition of 'flood' for home building, home contents, small business, strata title and corporate insurance, and the provision of a key facts sheet, something that was intelligible, in simple and clear English, and did not require a doctorate of law to understand.


I have said before that during the 2011 flood—we were not flooded in Ipswich at my house, although it happened when I was a child—my wife actually asked me, 'Do we have flood insurance?' I looked at my own personal insurance contract and it mentioned 'flood' a number of times. Having had 20 years as a litigation lawyer with a law degree, I can read a contract pretty well. It took me a number of goes to read that I actually personally was not covered for flood insurance. When you are in a time of vulnerability, when your home, farm or business has been flooded, and you are having to deal with an insurance company and you do not understand all these things, the power imbalance is enormous. What we are trying to do with the legislation before us is to get a fairer insurance regime in this country to equalise the power imbalance. That is what we are trying to do. And we are trying to get ASIC involved. I am pleased that we are legislating to protect consumers from unfair terms in insurance contracts. I think those protections should have been for a long time enshrined in our laws to cover these types of situations. Consumer protection legislation is vital. I am pleased it is being extended to general insurance contracts, which in the past have been excluded. 


Australians should not really have to fight and fight and fight in this regard. I have seen on numerous occasions the Financial Ombudsman actually give decisions negative to constituents in Blair but then criticise the insurance company for the claims process handling that they undertook in relation to those particular people. I can think of a flower farmer and his wife who have just recently been involved in one of those cases. I can think of another case where a businessman and his wife in Ipswich were in a similar situation—denied a claim but then the insurance company was criticised by the Financial Ombudsman for the way in which the process was conducted by the insurance company. That is simply unacceptable. People should not be brutalised by a flood and then brutalised by the claims process handling by the insurance company—someone they have contracted with and engaged with in good faith. People need to know that when they pay their premiums they are going to get a fair go, and the insurance company should not hide behind unfair terms to leave people high and dry when it comes to claims. 


There are many reforms in this particular piece of legislation. But I think that it needs to be seen in the context of what we are doing to fix flood insurance in this country. I was pleased recently to see the Prime Minister visit my electorate, and to see steps taken to reduce the cost of insurance across Queensland and elsewhere. It is particularly important because the insurance industry, as I outlined earlier, is a large employer, a large business and a large group of companies that deal with Australians every day. Most Australians do not get charged with criminal offences. Most Australians do not have car accidents. Most Australians do not get injured at work. But most Australians at some point in their life will have an insurance contract. In relation to the reform, the whole package needs to be seen: the single definition of flood, the product disclosure statement and the key facts statement. The amendments before this particular chamber tonight and the work we are doing in terms of flood mitigation and insurance affordability are absolutely critical. We have proposed establishing a national insurance affordability council, and we are working with the insurance industry. I am pleased to see press releases from the Insurance Council of Australia, which is not always favourable to us, welcoming the announcement that this government has undertaken $100 million in funding over two years for flood mitigation projects. The purpose of that is to deal with the insurance industry and reduce the cost of insurance. Reducing the cost of insurance, reducing the burden of the claims process handling is so critical.


In my electorate of Blair, I am pleased to announce $10 million to the Ipswich City Council for flood mitigation projects. That was a terrible experience for people from Rosewood to Redbank Plains, experiencing flood again and again. We saw floods in Ipswich not just in 1893 and in 1974 but in 2011 and in 2013. The floods have really terrorised the people. I was pleased to see that the flood work will be undertaken in places like Thagoona, $1.8 million; Rosewood, $2.8 million; and Redbank Plains, $3.9 million. Nine of the top 10 projects of the Ipswich City Council to reduce the impact of floods on the people of Ipswich will be proceeded with. This is what the Insurance Council of Australia have been calling for. This is what I have been calling for—in the Queensland Times, on River 94.9 radio—again and again, because, by legislation and by action, we can actually make an impact. The Insurance Council have talked about levies in country towns in Queensland and the prospect of levies reducing insurance premiums. Insurance premiums have gone up massively in my community. One of those projects I mentioned involves a levy. I have been to Thagoona many times. This is particularly important for my electorate. I think this is the sort of reform that we need to undertake.


I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am pleased about these legislative changes. I am pleased about the recent announcement. I am also pleased that the Queensland government is going to match the funding that we have put aside for an $80 million mitigation fund to better the situation in Queensland and elsewhere. I support this legislation that is before the chamber.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (16:56):  I thank the members for Casey and Blair for the contributions that they have made to the debate on the Insurance Contracts Amendment Bill 2013. The measures in the bill modernise and streamline the operation of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The government has undertaken extensive consultation on these measures to ensure that the balance between the interests of insurers, the insured and the wider public is maintained. The measures will help ensure a better-functioning, more efficient insurance market that will ultimately benefit the entire Australian community.


Schedule 1 to the bill makes changes to the scope and application of the act. The changes provide that a failure to comply with the duty of utmost good faith is a breach of the act; that contracts of insurance that are entered into or proposed to be entered into for the purpose of workers compensation law continue to be exempt under the act; and that contracts of insurance that include elements of cover that are exempted from the act as well as cover that falls under the act are treated as exempt from the act only in respect of the exempt elements.


Schedule 2 to the bill makes technical changes to provisions in the act regarding the giving of notices, documents and information. These changes will apply to permit insurers to use electronic communication for the purposes of providing notices or documents that are required to be given in writing.


Schedule 3 to the bill provides ASIC with an additional power to intervene in matters arising under the act. The new power is similar to the existing power ASIC has to intervene in proceedings begun by other persons about matters arising under section 1330 of the Corporations Act. It also allows ASIC to be represented in the proceedings by a staff member, a delegate, a solicitor or counsel.


Schedule 4 to the bill changes the way the act deals with particular types of disclosure and misrepresentations, to clarify how the duty of disclosure test is applied. It amends the law to make the duty of disclosure apply on renewal of an eligible contract of insurance and remove the option for insurers to ask catch-all questions in relation to eligible contracts of insurance. It amends the law regarding circumstances in which an insurer must provide an insured with a reminder as to when their duty of disclosure obligations apply. In respect of life insurance contracts, it amends the law so insurers must give a potential life insured who is not the insured under the relevant contract of insurance notice of their duty of disclosure.


Schedule 5 to the bill changes the way the act deals with the remedies for life insurers in cases of misrepresentation and nondisclosure by insureds prior to their entering into life insurance contracts. The changes provide insurers with additional flexibility when seeking remedies for misrepresentation and nondisclosure, by allowing the unbundling of life insurance contracts so that remedies can be applied to each separate type of cover provided within a bundled life insurance contract; by providing a new remedy for misrepresentation and nondisclosure which will apply to all types of life insurance cover, with the exception of death and surrender value cover; and by expanding the range of remedies available to a life insurer where a misrepresentation of an insured involves a misstatement of the date of birth of the insured under the contract.


Schedule 6 to the bill makes technical changes to the act so that individuals who have rights under a contract of insurance—that is, third-party beneficiaries—but who are not the insured have access to particular rights and obligations currently held by those insured.


Schedule 7 to the bill amends the act to provide improved rules for the division of any proceeds that are received from a recovery action when those proceeds are recovered from a third party by an insurer under a right of subrogation.


In conclusion, these measures are another significant step made by the Gillard government to improve Australia's insurance market. While the measures in the bill, by and large, are technical in nature, as a package they will operate to streamline and clarify requirements while ensuring appropriate consumer protections are maintained.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:10):  I rise to take note of the Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2012 (first report) specifically to highlight an issue that the committee was made aware of during the recent oversight hearing of the Reserve Bank, just the other month. It was at that time that the committee first had an opportunity to speak with the Governor of the Reserve Bank about an issue that had been raised in MYEFO—that is, the paying by the RBA of a half-a-billion-dollar dividend from the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. This was the first opportunity we had to publicly scrutinise this dividend payment.


I was particularly interested in this dividend payment because less than two years ago the Reserve Bank described the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund as having a capital level of around $6.2 billion. At that time, in the annual report, it described it as:


… modestly below that which the Board regards as desirable in the long term …


Less than two years after that statement, we have seen a hit to the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. That hit was just over $4 billion—in fact, it was well over $4 billion. This means that the bank's capital is actually below $2 billion now.


This is quite concerning. Two billion dollars is not much of a reserve fund, particularly not in today's times, and it is certainly well below the amount that the Reserve Bank itself said was adequate and desirable in the long term. So one would think that in fact every opportunity that the Reserve Bank got to put money back into the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund would be duly taken—but not so. When I queried the Reserve Bank governor about the government taking a $500 million dividend—that is half a billion dollars—from the Reserve Bank, I asked him whether his advice had been sought. He said that it did not quite work out that he was asked for approval, despite the fact that, under the law, he is required to have his advice asked for. He said that he provided his views to the Treasurer that he thought ripping $500 million out of the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund would not be a prudent course of action. I am paraphrasing him here; I am not quoting him directly, but he gave very clear evidence on the Hansard that it was not his recommendation for the government to be paid this half-a-billion-dollar dividend and that in his mind the money ought better to go back into the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund.


I raise this because this is part of a pattern. Part of the pattern of this government's behaviour is its ripping out of dividend payments not only from the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank reserve funds but also from other government organisations. We have seen the same pattern in the case of both the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation and the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, which paid a one-off special dividend in 2012-13 totalling not $10 million, not $20 million but $300 million. We have seen other money shuffles in the 2012-13 budget, where Medibank Private was required to pay $391 million in dividends this year—more than three times Medibank Private's latest profit of $126 million—which amounts to almost $250 for every policyholder. Why is the government ripping this money out? There is one very clear answer: the government has desperately sought to bolster its budget bottom line because its spending is out of control and is going to the wrong priorities. This government is spending more than $90 billion each and every year over and above what was spent during the last years of the coalition government.


But lest you think that that is the only money being ripped out of Medibank Private, I tell you that this government has in fact taken over $850.6 million out of Medibank Private over the three years since Medibank Private converted to for-profit status in 2009. This concerns us, and I am sure that it concerns every Australian. Ultimately, when the government rips this money out and has in addition to borrow money to cover its spending, it hurts current taxpayers, who end up having to foot the bill, and future taxpayers—the next generation of Australians—who will end up footing the bill for the government's incompetence, waste and mismanagement. This profit-stripping of Medibank Private must seriously weaken Medibank Private's balance sheet, and I think it is right for us to understand how Medibank Private has funded the payment of the dividend. Has it had to borrow money to fund the dividend? Has it had to maintain higher borrowings than it otherwise would have if the dividend payments had not been made? The government has not answered these legitimate questions, and it must answer them. When you consider the money which has been stripped out of Medibank Private and the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, and when you consider the money has now been shipped out of the Reserve Bank reserve fund—half a billion dollars—you can only come to the following conclusions: this government does not know how to manage the budget; this government is not prudent with the finances of Australians; this government is reckless in its disregard for the future impost on taxpayers.


The government has sought to increase the taxes on private health insurance. We have seen them rip more than $4 billion out of private health insurance. One can only ask the following question when considering Medibank Private: if this money had not been stripped out of private health insurance, would it mean that people would not have to pay higher premiums on the whole? Who knows the answer to that question?


There will be a change come 14 September, and we hope it will be a change for the better in the form of a return to the responsible economic management that we saw under the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, and a coalition government which understood that you cannot spend—




Mr Perrett:
  How many times did he get a AAA rating from all three ratings agencies?




Ms O'DWYER:
  That is a very good point you raise about AAA credit ratings. Let me just put on the record for my friend on the other side that, after repaying $96 billion of Labor's debt, the Treasurer was able to restore Australia's AAA credit rating in 1986 and 1989. This is something that he was able to do after repaying $96 billion of Labor's debt.





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Vamvakinou
):  Order! The member for Moreton will cease interjecting.




Ms O'DWYER:
  Sorry; he was quite right to call my attention to that. Those dates were the dates when we dropped credit ratings. We were able to restore the balance sheet under the stewardship of Treasurer Peter Costello, after we had dropped our AAA credit rating in 1986 and 1989. Clearly I needed another coffee this afternoon before coming to speak in the chamber!


It is an important point that you raise: we need to ensure prudent, responsible economic management. This can only be delivered by a coalition government. It will be delivered under the leadership of Tony Abbott and the treasurership of Joe Hockey. The 14th of September cannot come soon enough for all Australians.
