"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2014-09-23,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (12:01):  by leave—I am pleased to present and table the inaugural annual Investment Statement to the parliament. This delivers on a commitment the coalition made at the 2013 federal election. It also follows my appointment as Australia's first federal minister for both trade and investment. This highlights the priority the Abbott government has placed on attracting inbound capital to support our nation's continued economic growth.


Since the arrival of the First Fleet, Australia, with its relatively small population, developing economy and thin capital market, has always been reliant on foreign investment. This remains the case today notwithstanding our emergence as the world's 12th largest economy; an economy which has delivered an extraordinary 23 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Foreign investment has been a key element of this success story—driving successive waves of growth this country has enjoyed in gold, wool, agribusiness and mining.


We are of course a resource-rich country. But, in order to exploit this, foreign capital has been required to finance the shortfalls in our own savings and investment to support project construction and ultimately production. Continued waves of investment remain critical as we seek to diversify our economy and to reduce our reliance on any one sector, regardless of how strong.


Foreign investment supports the expansion of our businesses and industries and the creation of jobs and has helped build the enviable standards of living we enjoy today as a nation. It also supports Australia's involvement in global value chains, drives innovation and productivity and helps us remain competitive in increasingly competitive global markets. Put simply, without foreign investment, our productive capacity, employment levels and income would all be significantly lower.


New foreign capital is required to support this government's ambitious infrastructure program and to further develop those areas of our economy that are clear strengths; the things as a country we do as well as any and better than most. These include agriculture and agribusiness; tourism and hospitality; international education; health, ageing and medical research; obviously resources and energy; and all the services, logistics and high-end manufacturing which cluster around these sectors of great strength. These areas already contribute much to our economy but they have great further potential, particularly given the demand from an exploding middle class across the Asia Pacific—with numbers expected to surge from 600 million to around three billion within 20 years. It is almost incomprehensible, the phenomena that is going on in the region around us.


As a consequence, this will be the century of food, water and energy security, and Australia is extremely well positioned to take advantage. Northern Australia can play a major role, but again foreign capital is required to help drive its development. This explains why so much of my attention is dedicated to doing everything I can to promote Australia as an attractive investment destination and to encourage its inward flow.


The world is in fact awash with capital in search of a home, but the economic and geopolitical uncertainty that worries people around the globe has seriously impacted on business confidence in new investment. Risk-taking is much diminished. An investment environment of certainty and stability is more important than ever. This is why the government is determined to do everything reasonably possible to ensure Australia is viewed by the world as a stable, certain, attractive investment destination; as a country that is indeed 'open for business'.




Australia and foreign investment



In 2013 Australia attracted an additional $115 billion of new foreign 'direct investment'—that is, investment into business in which a foreign investor had some element of control, by owning 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power. The other main part of foreign investment is investment of a portfolio nature, such as diversified investments into equities or long-term bonds by international investors here—and I will come back to this other part of investment in a moment.


Globally, Australia was the ninth largest destination for global foreign direct investment net inflows in 2013—accounting for almost 3.5 per cent of global flows. The largest amounts of new foreign direct investment into Australia in 2013 came from:


The United States, $35 billion


Singapore, $14 billion


United Kingdom $12 billion, and


Japan, $10 billion.


Investors from China made new direct investments of $5 billion into Australia in 2013 (up from $3.5 billion in 2012).


The total amount (or stock) of 'direct investment' in Australia reached A$630 billion in 2013—40 per cent higher than in 2008. Traditionally—and still today—the bulk of our stock of direct investment is held by investors from developed countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In 2013, the United States was the largest total investor here, holding $149 billion—or nearly a quarter of the stock of all direct investment in Australia. The United Kingdom was second at $87 billion, with nearly 14 per cent of total direct investment. Japan was third at $63 billion, with 10 per cent of the total direct investment. But, increasingly, foreign investment is now coming from emerging markets in Asia. Australia is a leading destination for Chinese investment, for example. China is now our sixth-largest source of inward foreign direct investment, holding three per cent of the total stock, with A$21 billion. China's surge is set to continue.


In addition to all this foreign direct investment, there is an additional $1.4 trillion of 'portfolio investment' in Australia—highlighting the attractiveness of Australia to international fund managers—plus other forms of investment (such as loans, bank deposits and trade credits), for a grand total of foreign investment in Australia in 2013 of $2.5 trillion.




Foreign investment and jobs



For Australia, direct foreign investment means more jobs. One in five businesses in Australia with more than 200 employees are at least 50 per cent foreign owned. And foreign investors often deliver high-quality jobs. US majority owned affiliates in Australia, for example, pay wages well in excess of the average wage. According to a database of announced foreign direct investment transactions published by The Financial Times, in the five years to July, there were 1,635 investment projects in Australia. These attracted US$100 billion in capital expenditure and generated over 140,000 jobs.




The economic reform agenda—supporting investment



As mentioned earlier, this government is committed to attracting more foreign investment. This explains our aggressive domestic reform agenda, which is aimed at improving Australia's 'ease of doing business'. We are working to restore Australia's reputational 'gold standard', which sadly slipped under our predecessors. We are removing the damaging taxes—the carbon tax and the mining tax have been repealed. I know that these measures alone have dramatically improved our standing among serious international investors.


We are committed to a serious attack on red and green tape to the value of $1 billion each year. Already, through our first repeal day in March, we cut more than 10,000 pieces of regulation and legislation and more than 50,000 pages were deleted from the statute book. This will save over $700 million in compliance costs across the economy every year. More will be on its way in the next repeal day in October.


We are also streamlining approval processes for major projects through the 'one-stop shop' initiative. This will reduce duplication between states, territories and the Commonwealth and save time, which is money for businesses and investors. The time for a large $30 billion LNG project approval, for instance, has drifted out by up to two years since 2007, and at a cost of $30 million to $40 million a month that puts a huge millstone around the neck of our competitiveness for a resource which is going to be in huge demand in the years ahead. The environment minister has already, in a most responsible way, approved in the order of 300 projects, including 94 in resources, worth $800 billion in economic value—some of which had stalled for six years under our predecessors.


We are also committed to restoring the rule of law in the construction industry to stamp out rogue union behaviour, which undermines investment and productivity. The last time that we introduced a building and construction commission we saw a $7 billion increase in productivity. We are investing a record $50 billion in infrastructure, which will help leverage $125 billion worth of projects, including road and rail. And we are driving an innovative asset recycling program with incentives for the states and territories to privatise assets and infrastructure. Again, this has captured the imagination of international investors, including, for example, the major pension funds of Canada and the big investment houses in New York.


In the free trade agreements we have recently concluded with Korea and Japan, we have also dramatically increased the private investment screening threshold to $1.078 billion, the same level that applies to the United States and New Zealand. This is the non-discriminatory approach we are looking to take in future trade agreements which reduces the regulatory burden for investors.


We are also committed to major reviews of competition policy and the taxation policy through a comprehensive tax white paper process. Already, the government's pro-investment approach is having a material impact. The Chair of China Merchants Group, Liming Yu, wrote to me advising of the company's $1.75 billion investment with Hastings in the Port of Newcastle. He wrote:


One of the key factors that gave us confidence in making such a significant investment in Australia is the proactive approach your ministry has taken in attracting foreign investments and your commitment of providing an open, fair and level playing field for all the investors to invest in Australia.



He went on:


I strongly believe that with such an open, transparent and pragmatic approach to investment and business under your ministry, there will be more larger investments occur in Australia.



Likewise, the chairman of China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) told the Treasurer and me during a visit in June that Australia's investment environment had improved a great deal over the last 12 months. He also praised the coalition for its decisions to repeal both the carbon tax and the mining tax.


As mentioned, we have also sent a strong signal in regard to our support for the development of northern Australia, with a white paper being advanced. I have made no secret of my belief that there are massive significant untapped opportunities waiting for us in northern Australia. But, if we are to win the capital that will unlock the North, we must have a regulatory framework that is attractive to and reliable for business. Next year I will host a major forum in the North for some of the world's biggest investors to showcase the opportunity and investment-ready projects. Infrastructure requirements will be a major focus.


Investment has also been identified as one of the four key pillars of our recently outlined Economic Diplomacy program. We are taking a true 'Team Australia' approach working hand in hand with state and territory governments to attract investment. In February of this year, I chaired the inaugural meeting of Commonwealth and state and territory trade and investment ministers and in September I chaired the second meeting in Cairns. Together we identified national investment priorities which align with the strengths I mentioned earlier. These include:


tourism infrastructure,


agribusiness and food,


resources and energy,


major infrastructure, and


advanced manufacturing, services and technology.


In addition, I am appointing five senior investment specialists to work with Austrade to identify inward investment opportunities and to help realise them across these five areas. Four of those specialists have already started work.


In tourism, we have major prospects ahead. With the rise of the Asian middle class, tourism will be a major driver of growth. By 2020, almost 200 million Chinese tourists are expected to travel internationally, a doubling of current numbers in just the next five years. Australia is well placed to capitalise on this rising demand. But we need significant investment in tourism infrastructure if we are to realise our potential in that market. That huge potential lies particularly at the high-value, high-margin end. We are a high-cost country and in order to get a return that warrants the investment, we need to pitch so much of what we do, including in tourism, at the high-value end. We require something like 20,000 new and upgraded rooms. Funds are already starting to flow. There are reports of $20 billion in prospective investment in high-quality Australian tourism infrastructure, which includes five-star integrated resorts near Cairns, in Brisbane and also on the Gold Coast. Hong Kong-listed Far East Consortium International was recently announced as the successful bidder for the Elizabeth Quay Lot 9 & 10 project in Western Australia. Construction is valued at more than $350 million—and something like 1,000 jobs will be created.


In agribusiness, Australia is exceptionally well placed to help meet Asia's massive, emerging demand for safe, premium food and fibre—again, at the premium end of the market. ANZ estimates we stand to capture up to $1.7 trillion in 2011 dollars in new agricultural exports out to 2050. But we will need investment, including foreign investment, to make this happen. And it is happening.


Just last week, I witnessed a signing ceremony held for the establishment of the Beijing Australia Agricultural Resource Cooperative Development Fund. The fund is planning to invest around $3 billion in capital in various Australian agricultural projects, including in dairy, particularly infant formula, and in beef, lamb, seafood and other products. This has followed some eight meetings I have had with the companies involved over nine months.


In another example, Italian chocolatier Ferrero recently made an A$70 million investment to set up a hazelnut plantation of one million trees on 2,000 hectares in the Riverina region in NSW. This spread of investment type is exceptional and presents enormous opportunities. Invariably all of this new investment brings different perspectives and invariably a lot of IP, which again we share in. It makes our work force more skilful and makes our ventures more innovative, and it keeps us at the forefront of trade and investment. 


In resources and energy, we know Australia's prospects remain bright, particularly in areas like LNG. There are major new projects that offer 25- to 50-year lifespans, in oil, gas and mining. The recent approval of Adani Mining's Carmichael coal mine and rail infrastructure project in Queensland offers something like 2,500 construction-phase jobs. It will open up the Galilee Basin, which has been spoken about for 40 years. It is the first new province for coal development in 40 years. And 4,000 ongoing operations positions will be part of that project. The project has a resource value of $300 billion over 60 years. By the way, that project will provide electricity for 100 million Indians for 90 years, so we are providing a humanitarian outcome as well as a commercial outcome for Australia.


Equally, we are keen to draw investment into our advanced manufacturing and services sectors. So we can continue to develop great Australian products that have global significance—like penicillin, the bionic ear, wi-fi, the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, and so on. The proposed $20 billion health endowment fund for future medical research and development is prompting major international investment interest.


Boeing's investment in a new R&D facility in Port Melbourne, Victoria, is a great example of how Australian R&D capability is attracting the attention of major multinationals.


And in infrastructure, we simply do not have enough capital to fund all the projects that we need to truly link Australia to the world, to tap into global best practice and maximise our economic growth. According to the Business Council of Australia, we have an infrastructure need of more than $760 billion. That sort of funding simply cannot be obtained locally. The A$1.5 billion Legacy Way Project in Brisbane is a great example of foreign investors partnering with a local firm to reduce costs and introduce innovation in the development of Australian infrastructure.


Austrade is at the forefront of our efforts to attract new investment. For the fiscal year 2013-14, Austrade supported a total of 72 investment projects with an estimated total value of $2.7 billion. These projects are expected to create over 4,440 jobs once fully operational and lead to further export potential.


In the nine months to 30 June 2014 the government, through the Foreign Investment Review Board, approved around 770 proposals valued at around $110 billion in (non-residential real estate) foreign investment projects.


In my role I travel frequently and use all visits abroad as opportunities to promote Australia to major investors. Since coming to office, I have conducted 40 major investment roundtables in 16 countries, including most recently in India. For example, one roundtable in the United States had five investment funds representing well over $1 trillion in funds under management. I had two hours to sell Australia to investors who had never had any contact with Australian governments in the past. Likewise, in Canada, I had a roundtable with major pension funds representing nearly $500 billion. And I have received strong interest in Australia from around the globe, particularly out of financial centres in Asia.


During Australia Week in China earlier this year MOUs worth around $900 million were signed. And as a direct result of a tourism infrastructure roundtable which I chaired during Australia Week in China, the Wanda Group recently announced a $900 million investment in tourism-related infrastructure on the Gold Coast.


Recently I hosted an Australian Investment Forum on the sidelines of the G20 trade ministers meeting in Sydney, which brought together 100 of the most senior representatives of current and future foreign investment in Australia. Many of the members had attended the B20 meetings in the previous two days. During this, Chinese property giant Greenland confirmed that on account of the improving investment environment in Australia it was planning up to $4 billion of additional investment in tourism, infrastructure and agriculture in addition to $1.5 billion of existing investment.




Conclusion



In concluding, the Abbott government unequivocally welcomes foreign investment. Attracting foreign investment is vital if we are to maintain sustainable economic growth and to create sustainable additional jobs. But there is great competition globally in obtaining the capital. We need to develop the Australian economy of the 21st century.


But we have advantages we are determined to leverage. We have strong economic fundamentals. We have some great sectors of strength that offer enormous opportunity, and greatly complement the emerging economies around us. We have a highly skilled, knowledge based work force. And we have a pro-investment government, with policies designed to restore our gold standard. I look forward to updating the parliament next year on our efforts and achievements over the coming 12 months.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Rankin to speak for 22 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ROBB:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Dr Chalmers speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 22 minutes.


Question agreed to.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-09-23,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (12:24):  Labor supports foreign investment. We see foreign investment as one way to create the jobs and to create the opportunities that might not otherwise be created or be made available in our economy. Our engagement with the world has made Australia a more competitive, a more productive and a more prosperous nation. As others have said, including the Minister for Trade and Investment today, we are a capital-hungry country and there is a lot of capital looking for a home around the world. We do not have in Australia sufficient capital to maintain the sort of employment opportunities and living standards that Australians have a right to expect and that Australians deserve. 


The benefits of an open market have flowed to everyday Australians through lower consumer prices and increased employment opportunities. Labor knows that we will not improve living standards and opportunities for working people by pulling down the shutters on the world, so we do support foreign investment. Subject to the right arrangements and subject to the right protections, we do want a more open Australian economy. We are the ones who believe very deeply that it is possible to combine economic expansion and Asian integration and opportunities for a greater number of Australians here at home. This is effectively the Keating model that so many of us on this side of the House see as an article of faith. Some of us joined the Labor Party to advance the cause of, for example, Asian integration and a more open economy and to do so in a way that gives our people more opportunities to prosper. 


Labor does have a really proud record when it comes to investment. Contrary to a lot of the commentary that you hear from the government's cheerleaders, there was an investment boom under the Labor government despite a global financial crisis. In the minister's own statement, he refers to a really stunning statistic—and I do congratulate him for informing the House of this statistic, because it is important. Between 2008 and 2013—so for the period of the former Labor government—there was an investment boom. Foreign direct investment was up 40 per cent over that period, which is an extraordinary amount of growth and something that we are very proud of on this side of the House. I think the whole nation should be proud of the way that Australia has attracted that level of foreign investment. Unfortunately, for the government and for the minister, it undermines the rest of his argument that Labor was in some way an impediment to this kind of investment. There was an investment boom under Labor. His own speech refers to 40 per cent growth in foreign direct investment under Rudd and Gillard. It is extraordinary that he would then go on to make his partisan points about Labor, having already quoted the key statistic. 


I am proud in my own personal sense to have been involved in some of these foreign investment decisions in a former role working with the member for Lilley, the member for McMahon and the member for Maribyrnong—the Treasurer and various Assistant Treasurers over that period. I was proud that we took such a pro-investment stance when it came to many of the applications that came before us as a government. So I do thank the minister for mentioning that crucial stat about the growth in foreign direct investment under the former Labor government. 


Of course I do not have time to go through it in detail here, but the Asian century white paper was also geared towards how we would become a more attractive destination for investment here in Australia, in the most dynamic region in the global economy, which is, of course, Asia. How do we attract investment from these countries that are becoming not just big exporters of capital but also big consumers so that we have this virtuous cycle of investment and trade in our region. 


It was also good of the minister to mention 23 years of consecutive economic growth in Australia. That is almost a quarter-century of economic growth and continuous expansion in the Australian economy—every Australian should be proud of that fact—with half of it under us and half of it under our opponents across the table here. It is worth mentioning that whenever we think of that quarter-century of continuous economic expansion in our economy, we should pay tribute again to the reforms put in place by the Keating and Hawke governments and also by the efforts that all Australians put in, including the government, in saving Australia from the global recession. Without the Keating reforms, without the stimulus and all the other factors that helped us over that difficult period in the global economy, those 23 years—entering 24 now—would not have been possible. So I think that, with our credentials as attractors of foreign investment and our economic record, we do come to this conversation with some credibility. 


We also take a national interest approach to these questions. It is the only way to go. It is no use conducting these debates in an overly partisan way. It is of course our responsibility to highlight the flaws in each other's arguments. But this is after all about Australian prosperity, and we should always take a national interest approach to these sorts of questions. I think it is wonderful to hear from the minister for trade, for example, about the success that he might have in some of these forums. We support him touting Australia's wares around the world; that is the job of a trade and investment minister. As patriots first and partisans second we do want Australia to succeed in the global economy. We do want to have that success. We do want to have that prosperity. We do want to create jobs. So, where we can, we support the government. So we do not disagree with everything the minister said; we disagree with parts of what the minister said. 


One of things we do disagree on is that we believe being 'open for business' should be more than just hanging a sign on a lectern. We need to be serious about it. You are not serious about it if you are hopelessly split as a party on decisions like the GrainCorp decision, which was a shocking decision for Australia. There was not a single mention of it in the minister's statement. When I was flicking through the minister's statement, I thought that a page had dropped out because there was nothing in there about GrainCorp, which was the most significant and detrimental decision that the government has taken when it comes to foreign investment, and I want to go through that in detail in a moment. 


You are not serious about foreign investment if you have members like the member for Higgins denigrating the Foreign Investment Review Board, in the Treasurer's portfolio. I thought that they were disgraceful multiple interventions from the member for Higgins when she was running down Brian Wilson, who is a top servant of Australia, who runs the Foreign Investment Review Board, in the Treasurer's portfolio—not a peep from the Treasurer to defend his own Foreign Investment Review Board. You are not serious about foreign investment if you attack the confidence that overseas investors might have in that body. You can say what you want about their resourcing, you can even say what you want about their decisions, but for the member for Higgins to get into Brian Wilson about a lack of leadership, I think, sends the wrong message to the rest of the world. It would not surprise me entirely of some members opposite agreed with me. I would hope that the Treasurer would agree with me, given that the FIRB is in his own portfolio. 


You are not serious about foreign direct investment if you have two views on agriculture, and we know that those opposite have very different views in terms of the threshold for—




Mr McCormack:
  You've got no views on agriculture—




Dr CHALMERS:
  I will run through them in a minute if you like. We have outlined our position on agriculture. They have outlined two positions on agriculture. 


You are not serious about foreign investment if you play around with the renewable energy target like those opposite are. You are not serious about the billions of dollars that should flow into our renewable energy sector if you have ministers saying one thing, including here, and other ministers saying another. You need to be sending a signal to those who want to invest in renewable energy that we are fair dinkum about renewable energy.


With regard to what we heard from the Minister for Trade and Investment today, as I said before, there were some things we agree with and some things that we disagree with. We think that the most important thing that you need to contemplate when you are talking about being 'open for business' is not just the rhetoric, as important as that can be in some of these international fora, but also the decisions made, and I do want to spend some time on the inconsistency of those opposite when it comes to foreign investment.


The Abbott government failed its first test on foreign investment when it blocked the proposed takeover of GrainCorp by Archer Daniels Midland. Not only did the government block the takeover but it has been completely inconsistent in its reasons for doing so, showing that it is making up investment policy on the run. It is noteworthy that the minister mentioned the First Fleet in his statement but not the Treasury decision on that foreign investment proposal. 


In April this year, the Treasurer claimed that he had blocked ADM's proposed takeover of GrainCorp because the American company was of 'not particularly good character'. The Treasurer's extraordinary claim was made public five months after blocking the ADM investment and raises serious questions about the transparency and fairness of the government's approach to foreign investment. This sorry saga of confusion and contradiction on ADM's proposed $3.4 billion investment gives the lie to the government's claim that Australia is open for business. The Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Investment have made a series of inconsistent statements about ADM's proposed acquisition of GrainCorp. When the Treasurer announced he was blocking the deal last November, he cited national interest grounds and the impact on competition and made no mention whatsoever of the character grounds that he has since talked about. Then, in March this year, the Minister for Trade and Investment told an investor conference the decision to block the takeover was just a signal that the deal's timing was wrong and that 'there may be an opportunity at some stage' for ADM to renew its bid for GrainCorp. A month later, the Treasurer made a new claim when he said that one of the reasons it was knocked back was concern about the company's character. Given this claim was made so long after the decision to knock it back, we do wonder whether ADM was given the opportunity to respond. 


If the Abbott government wants to show some leadership and find some consistency on foreign investment, it could start by providing a coherent explanation for that particular shambles. As the BCA's chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said at the time of the ADM decision, certainty about Australia's foreign investment policy and transparency in communicating the reasons for decisions are important for global confidence in Australia. Inconsistent and incoherent behaviour by the government on major investment proposals will erode Australia's reputation as an investment destination, which will be bad news for jobs and growth. 


In addition to the Treasurer's retrograde decision against ADM, we also have the tail wagging the dog inside the coalition party room, with the imposition of new and arbitrary limits on investments in agricultural land. The minister talks big when he is on the phone to financial journalists, but he cannot stare down the Nats in his own joint party room. 


In a speech to the Economic and Social Outlook Conference in Melbourne in July, Labor's shadow minister for trade and investment, Senator Penny Wong, outlined Labor's ambitious approach to lifting the thresholds on foreign investment. Australia has always built its economy with investment funded by a mixture of domestic and overseas capital. We agree, as I said before, with the minister that our economy is capital hungry and it does rely on foreign investment to create jobs and business opportunities and to boost growth. As part of a comprehensive agreement delivering real market access gains and dealing responsibly with the labour movement, Labor is inclined to support China enjoying the same investment thresholds as the United States. That means a threshold of just over a billion dollars for Foreign Investment Review Board screening of proposed investments in non-sensitive sectors. Lower thresholds should continue to apply for investments in sensitive sectors or by state owned enterprises where issues of national interest can arise. The proposed treatment of state owned enterprises must be outlined by the minister before any agreement is signed.


Labor does not agree with the Abbott government's policy of imposing more restrictive rules on foreign investment in agriculture. As Penny Wong has said:


If we are serious about significantly expanding our food exports to Asia, we must front up to the reality and necessity of foreign investment in our agricultural sector.


It is inconceivable that we will be able to scale up production to fully tap into the growing consumer markets of Asia without foreign investment.


Placing hurdles in the way of foreign investment in our primary production industries will only jeopardise their growth.


That is why Chinese investment in agriculture should be treated in the same way as investment in other non-sensitive sectors.


Looking further ahead, once Australia has a $1 billion-plus threshold for FIRB screening for investors from the United States, Korea, China and New Zealand, it is hard to see why we should discriminate against other major trading partners.


Minister Robb has also cited the increased threshold for these countries in his statement, but Labor believes that Australia should consider unilaterally extending the FIRB screening rules offered to these FTA partners to all countries. Just like domestic investments, foreign investment proposals would still need approval from competition and corporate regulators to maintain competitive markets and protect shareholder interests, and for proposals worth more than $1 billion, the government would retain its powers to scrutinise investments on national interest grounds. But for a country that thrives on investment, it makes no sense to impose unnecessary red tape or barriers to investors looking to build businesses and create jobs legitimately in Australia.


Labor has a proud record when it comes to foreign investment. We in Labor understand that foreign investment means growth and jobs when it comes to broader measures to open up our economy. Over the years, Labor trade ministers from John Dawkins and Peter Cook to Simon Crean and my own predecessor Craig Emerson have played important roles in dismantling protectionist barriers. Labor wants to see more opening up of our economy on a wider range of fronts, with deeper integration into our region and into the world, because this will deliver growth for Australia and will improve living standards for working people. If Australian policy makers handle this shift intelligently they will deliver great economic benefits for future Australian generations.


The Gillard government's Asian century white paper set the goal of ensuring that Australia's economy becomes more integrated with Asia, with goods and services, capital, ideas and people flowing more readily between Australia and the economies of our region. If this can be achieved there will be tremendous opportunities for Australian businesses and investors in countries like China and India. But it will not just happen by itself. It will require getting a raft of policies right, not just in trade but also in industry and innovation, education and science, investment and infrastructure. Unfortunately, in so many of these areas billions of dollars have been cut from investment right across the board. To be serious about boosting Australia's trade performance, it is necessary to be serious about boosting productivity and competitiveness. Declaring that Australia is open for business requires more than signage on a lectern. We need continuing economic reform.


Labor wants an innovative, competitive, dynamic and outward-looking Australian economy. We want to think more broadly about the kind of country that other companies around the world would want to invest in. The minister outlined some of those factors that companies around the world take into account. We think that that shopping list of policy measures was characteristically narrow and exclusive and an excuse to pursue some pet ideologies. To give a speech about investment and not to mention superannuation, to be the minister for investment and not talk up super in our economy, is bizarre in the extreme. Anyone who knows anything about this sort of stuff knows that that combination of foreign and domestic investment—that capital—comes not only from overseas but also from our own super funds and other sources. I think if we are going to have a minister for investment he should understand and should value and should treasure the role of superannuation in our economy, including the role of superannuation in helping Australia get through the global financial crisis.


The other thing we want to hear from the government is that a lot of companies around the world want to invest in a country where the people are smart and well trained and where there has been substantial, proper investment in the human capital of a nation. To be attracted to Australia, people want to know that they are investing in a country full of dynamic, adaptive and resilient people. That goes to some of the unfortunate, disappointing and devastating reforms to the higher education system proposed by the Minister for Education which will price some people out of the market. Those opposite do not have a great understanding of people who are vulnerable in our community. Some people will finish high school and they will think about higher education, but they will decide against it on the basis that they do not want to owe Chris Pyne $100,000, they do not want to take all their life to pay back that money and they do not want to choose between a higher education—a degree—and buying a house or starting a family. The massive majority of the Australian people are with Labor on that issue.



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Dr CHALMERS:
  No, they did not. When we talk about 'Team Australia', its membership should be broad. What I mean is that when we are talking about foreign investment we need to make people understand that foreign investment is a big opportunity for Australia and that its benefits need to be more broadly felt. We need more people to be able to grasp the benefits of prosperity in our country. That means we need to do a better job—all sides of politics, anyone involved in the public conversation—of explaining to the Australian people the benefits of foreign investment and the benefits of opening up our economy so that those who adopt a reflexively defensive position do not dominate the debate. I think probably we could agree, and I am sure the minister would agree, that it needs constant effort on both sides of politics and all parts of the country to consistently sell the benefits of that effort if you do believe in foreign investment and in opening up the economy.


The minister mentioned before the global value chains that are dominating the trade structure of the global economy right now, particularly in our own region. When we talk about foreign investment and trade we want to make sure that we are training our people for the best parts of those global value chains. We want to be at the good end; we want to be at the high-wage, high-skill end of those global value chains. I think that is a worthy aspiration for a First World, first-rate country like ours. We cannot compete with other countries on wages. We cannot win a race to the bottom. So it is important that we are training our people up for the best parts of those global value chains.


In finishing up my response to the Minister for Trade and Investment, I will say that we do agree with the government on the tremendous opportunities available to Australia out of foreign investment and trade. We welcome the opportunity to engage on these issues, and we thank the minister for the opportunity to respond.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-09-23,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (12:52):  At the last election the coalition promised to apply cost-benefit analysis to infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million. The Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 provides cover for a breach of that promise. Once again this government has treated its election promises like plates at Greek wedding. Labor will support this bill but with amendments to keep the government to its promises, to ensure that there is proper value for taxpayers for infrastructure investment and that we get the right infrastructure investment to boost productivity. These amendments are consistent with the approach we have taken on earlier legislation.


This legislation purports to require proper cost-benefit analysis for major infrastructure projects to help decide whether they are worth the investment of scarce public dollars. But it comes, of course, more than two months after this minister handed out $3½ billion for two road projects that have not been the subject of proper cost-benefit analysis. I speak here of the Westconnex road project in Sydney and Melbourne's East West Link. Even worse, the government has obtained the funding for these untested projects by cancelling approved funding for two critical public transport projects which have been the subject of full analysis by Infrastructure Australia.


Far from creating a proper process, the legislation before us will institutionalise this retrospective cost-benefit analysis. Retrospective cost-benefit analysis is by definition next to useless. This legislation requires cost-benefit analysis only after the allocation of more than $100 million of taxpayers' funds to a particular project. So instead of doing the analysis, finding out what the benefit is of a particular project, doing comparative analysis of projects that are submitted to Infrastructure Australia, then determining a payment could be made and then making milestone payments upon delivering on the objectives of the project, this legislation does the opposite. You pay the money first—over $100 million—and then you do the analysis to decide whether it was a good idea or not.


This government says it wants expert opinion to help it decide how to spend money effectively, but it is legislating to make that advice irrelevant. The minister is in effect legislating to entrench his breaches of his election promises of cost-benefit analysis before funding is allocated—fund now, check later. This is a bizarre proposition from this government. Labor will seek to amend this bill to make it clear that infrastructure project selection starts with a measurement of cost benefit prior to any decision to fund. This is consistent with Labor's approach to the Building Australia Fund, where projects are required to be prior assessed by Infrastructure Australia. Labor will achieve this by making the $100 million about the capital value of the project rather than how much funding has been earmarked to it. This amendment will also ensure that projects nominated by the minister for evaluation are also assessed by Infrastructure Australia. Labor will also move to amend the Land Transport Infrastructure Act to make Infrastructure Australia assessment a pre-requisite for funding projects over $100 million in value. Finally, we will move amendments to require a standard method for cost-benefit analysis and to strengthen transparency. The government, if it is fair dinkum, should support these amendments. 


In his contribution to this debate the Minister for Infrastructure said this:


To maximise productivity improvement through investment, funding must flow to projects that yield the highest benefits.


The minister went on to say:


It is critical to base project selection on rigorous analysis and sound planning to avoid wasteful investment.


Of course the minister was right, which is why it makes complete sense to check out the bona fides of the project before providing funding. If that were the effect of this bill, it would have my unqualified support, but that is not the effect of this bill—the opposite is so.


Under this bill, by the time experts have given their opinion on the economics of investing in a particular project the funding will have already been provided. While the experts weigh up costs and benefits, ministers of this government will already be out there spruiking a project. The people of Australia have lately become accustomed to this government treating its election commitments with contempt, but what is truly remarkable in this case is the way in which this minister is continuing to pretend that he is delivering on these promises. In his contribution to this debate the minister said:


IA is already assessing projects which involve Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million and will make public the details of the valuations.


This was the Government's election commitment and this is what we are delivering without the trigger being specific in legislation. 


The problem with this is twofold: the fact that the minister is saying that IA are assessing projects that have already received funding—which speaks for itself—but it is very different from what the government actually promised. Just two days before the election the coalition released its infrastructure policy so there could not be much scrutiny before 7 September. It said:


To ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis … Infrastructure Australia will also be required to calculate and publish the net present value of recommended infrastructure projects and to justify why a given project has been recommended and prioritised.


That is the policy and it could not be clearer. I support that policy; it is what we put into practice in government and it can only be interpreted the cost-benefit analysis should take place first. 


It is not as though the government said one thing before the election and another afterwards. After the election, on 12 September, the minister told Infrastructure Partnerships Australia:


Infrastructure Australia will publish its reports on its website as transparent advice for the Government to consider when allocating its infrastructure funding.


The minister made clear that that would be when, not after, it was making the decision. That is why the legislation today is so flawed. Within months of the government being elected the Prime Minister had gone from speaking about proper analysis to calling proper analysis, to quote him, 'analysis paralysis'. That was the term he used to justify not sticking to the commitment made prior to the election just as he said, prior to the election, that there would be no cuts to health or education or pensions.


The Prime Minister's position as outlined in this bill also entrenches his absurd refusal to invest in public transport. Given that the bill requires cost-benefit analysis after funding is allocated and the fact that the government refuses to fund any new public transport project, we can conclude that Infrastructure Australia will never be asked to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on any public transport project. We know that that will reinforce what the Productivity Commission and others have said is a result of this government's policy. That is, not only is the federal government's refusal to fund any public transport project bringing that figure down to zero but, of course, states are responding by also reducing their funding for public transport projects, because they are seeking to prioritise projects that will attract some co-funding from the federal government. Therefore, where they have before them two projects, a road project and a rail project, common sense—as well as the Productivity Commission, Infrastructure Australia and others—tells you that they will fund the road project and not the public transport projects.


We created Infrastructure Australia to take the politics out of infrastructure delivery, to break the nexus between the political cycle, which by definition is three or four years, and the infrastructure investment cycle, which is long-term. We inherited an enormous infrastructure deficit. When we came to office Australia was ranked 20th in the OECD for infrastructure investment as a proportion of the national economy. When we left office we were ranked first. Australia went from 20th to first over those six years. We invested not just in any project; we invested in the right projects. We invested in all 15 projects that were identified by Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia also ensured that there was more rigour in state government processes. Quite frankly, the states had in the past been negligent in doing the proper planning work and getting that up to scratch. For example, when the global financial crisis hit and there was an opportunity for projects to be funded to stimulate the economy and to see us through that crisis, there were very few projects that were actually ready to go, on which the hard work of planning had been done.


One of the things that Infrastructure Australia also did, and I see nothing wrong with the government doing this, was provide seed funding for state governments, such as the $40 million we provided for the Melbourne Metro project, to see if projects could be got up to speed. It was a dynamic process between Infrastructure Australia and the state governments to make sure that projects could truly deliver on maximising productivity benefits. That dynamic process prior to major funding being delivered was exactly what we envisaged Infrastructure Australia would do, not just doing an analysis after. In this case, $3½ billion was already prepaid last financial year to the Victorian and New South Wales governments. The government has ignored that. It has ignored proper advice. It has ensured that we have a process that is deeply flawed.


An example of that is the East West Link project. We asked after the budget, in Senate estimates, where $1½ billion has been allocated—$500 million for stage 1 and $1 billion for stage 2. They cannot even say where the tunnels are coming up. They cannot say precisely what the route of the project is. But $1 billion of taxpayers money was paid, in advance, last financial year. The government says that there is a budget crisis but $1½ billion was paid in advance before a contract has been signed, before plans have been finalised and before a cost-benefit analysis has been published. We have seen only two cost-benefit analyses for the East West Link: one of 0.5—that is, 50c returned for every dollar invested—and one of 0.8, which lifts it up to 80c, if you take into account a whole range of other factors to lift it up as high as possible. After the allocation of that $1½ billion, during the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's estimates hearing held on 26 May, Senator Conroy asked Infrastructure Australia: 


So Infrastructure Australia has not seen the full business case?


Infrastructure Australia:


No.


That is on page 31 of the hearing transcript. Senator Conroy asked a question about East West Link stage 1:


But it does not recover costs?


Infrastructure Australia:


Not for the core benefit-cost ratio.


That was their statement—very clear. Then Senator Conroy asked:


You have not been able, with all the information you have got so far, to classify it as ready to proceed? 


The reply from Mr Roe of Infrastructure Australia was:


That is correct. 


Then, when asked at the same estimates meeting about East West Link stage 2—to which a billion dollars has already been paid—Infrastructure Australia acknowledged that it had only received 'conceptual information'. Mr Fitzgerald from IA said:


There is significantly more information that we would require for it to be a full business case.


So you have the extraordinary situation that money has been forwarded well in advance of any proper analysis being undertaken.


The independence of Infrastructure Australia is central to Labor's approach to infrastructure delivery. Under this government, however, Infrastructure Australia is already moving away from the independent model it was designed to follow. It started when the minister brought legislation to this House proposing to give himself the right to dictate Infrastructure Australia's research agenda. He also proposed giving himself a right of veto over publication of IA research, which would have destroyed the transparency of the current system. I am pleased to say that Labor, backed by the Business Council of Australia, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and several other groups, campaigned against these proposals. That led to the government accepting Labor amendments that preserved IA's independence.


But I do worry about how Infrastructure Australia has been functioning in recent times. We have had a range of new board members appointed, as well as an acting Infrastructure Coordinator—John Fitzgerald. I have asked for information about how the CEO of Infrastructure Australia is going to be chosen. I have asked what advertising is taking place and how the recruitment process for that position is being determined. It is not a position that should be determined politically. Based on what we have seen so far, Mr Fitzgerald can hardly be described as an unbiased analyst. In the budget estimates committee hearing in May, Mr Fitzgerald revealed that he had been with consulting firm KPMG, where he had been a lobbyist for the East West Link project. The job he had prior to that was working on the East West Link project for the Victorian government.


Senator Conroy raised this issue and asked at Senate estimates if there were any potential conflicts involved—because it stood out as an obvious one. Challenged about this at the hearing, Mr Fitzgerald declared himself an advocate for major national projects. Infrastructure Australia is not supposed to be an advocate; it is supposed to be an impartial organisation that deals with facts. That is why I was very concerned that, on 29 April, Mr Fitzgerald produced a media release—on Infrastructure Australia letterhead—in which he said that Infrastructure Australia had consistently held the view that the East West Link was a meritorious project. It was quite extraordinary for him, as a public servant, to put out such a press release. 


Mr Fitzgerald has since then continued to take an increasingly political approach to what is supposed to be a non-political position. In July, TheAge revealed that an Infrastructure Australia report had questioned the amount of money that was being spent on roads around the nation and had asked whether proper analysis was being conducted in order to maximise the benefit of that investment. This report was a contribution to the debate and was consistent with the way Infrastructure Australia works. It was put out for comment from the sector. Mr Fitzgerald intervened to disown the report, a report which had come from the organisation he was the acting Infrastructure Coordinator of. That is quite extraordinary. 


Just a few weeks ago there was some controversy about court action that two local councils were taking over the East West Link project. It is, after all, a very controversial project in Victoria—and it should be noted that Victoria is facing an election in the next few months. On the Friday, Mr Fitzgerald again issued a media release—again on Infrastructure Australia letterhead—this time criticising the position that was being advanced by the Labor opposition on the project, in particular the Labor opposition questioning whether, in the circumstances, signing a contract for the project would be legal. I would find it unbelievable if, say, Mike Mrdak, the secretary of the department, or Dr Watt from PM&C or any other senior public servant were to intervene in such a situation. But Mr Fitzgerald did—by putting out a media release. 


One has to ask the question: who authorised Mr Fitzgerald's intervention? The Infrastructure Australia board had certainly not met. The government—not the minister, to be fair, but his errand boy, the assistant minister—has been quite critical from time to time about the former Infrastructure Coordinator, Michael Deegan, and in the past has talked a lot about having an independent board at arm's length. It is absolutely extraordinary that this occurred. Mr Fitzgerald, as a former public servant, should frankly know better. You can be a political participant or a public servant. If you want to be a political participant, join a political party and run for public office. But do not be an acting public servant in a senior position who behaves in such an extraordinary fashion.


That is my concern with regard to proper processes. Similarly, with the WestConnex project in Sydney, we in government were of the view that there is a real argument to extend the M4 from where it currently finishes through to the city. It is absurd that it ends some considerable distance from the city and then people, after being on the M4, hit a traffic jam. This is just like how the M5, which I have also been critical of, needs to be extended to the port.



Indeed, the current Prime Minister identified this objective in his book Battlelines. He said this:


Sydney, for instance, should fill the gaps between the CBD and the M4 at Strathfield... There should be a link between the northern beaches and the city and between the western suburbs at Port Botany.


If you look at the contribution of Mr Tony Shepherd—and I have raised my concerns with Tony Shepherd, as the head of WestConnex—the problem is at the moment, as they themselves say, the proposed stage 1 is an extension to Haberfield and the proposed stage 2 is an extension to St Peters. This is a road to a traffic jam. This does not solve the problem. Anyone who drives to Sydney Airport will know that the idea of dumping traffic to the west of Sydney Airport, let alone not taking it to the port, is extraordinary. King Street in Newtown is a car park. This is a road to a car park. It is not dealing with the productivity benefits that would be dealt with, in terms of a freight link from Port Botany—which would see such growth—through to the M5.



In terms of the M4, there is extraordinary uncertainty being created for my constituents and for the people of Western Sydney, who deserve better than this approach. That example has been exemplified by the correspondence to one of my constituents, Vince Crowe of Haberfield, who received advice on 26 June 2014 from the WestConnex Delivery Authority. One said that his property was needed to be purchased and the other said that it was not needed. That is what happens when you make policy up as you go along. That is what happens when you do not have proper planning and proper processes.


What should be occurring is the federal government working with the state government to ensure that those objectives are met. We need to make sure that we get this legislation right. The way to get it right is to do the analysis first and then forward the money second, as the project is going along. That is what we did in government and that is the way that you maximise the productivity benefits of infrastructure investment.


This is one of the key issues that needs to be dealt with in terms of dealing with urban congestion and the other challenges that are there, particularly in our urban communities. The second thing that the government needs to do is to get rid of this bizarre ideological position that it has of not funding public transport and distorting the market. You need to have an integrated transport strategy when you look at issues of how we get better planning in our cities. If you look at just roads funding, you will distort not just what the federal government does but also what the state government does and you will not be able to deal with urban congestion. It is as silly as completely separating looking at how we move people from how we move freight. It is interconnected. People, freight, road and raid are all interconnected. Unless you have a strategy to deal with all of those issues, you will not be successful.


Regardless of their political perspective, I think Australians will be disappointed by this legislation; but there is an opportunity for the government to get it right by adopting Labor's amendments. I indicate that we are perfectly willing, as always, to engage in constructive discussion with the government about these issues. That is because when Australians decide to invest in a house, they make relevant checks on its title, its susceptibility to flooding, its easements and other important issues. They hire people to produce property reports so that they know the house is in good order. They do that before they purchase a house, not afterwards. That is due diligence and that is common sense. That common-sense approach can certainly apply when you discuss what is the best way for the government to deal with the challenge of dealing with our infrastructure deficit.


The fact that in its first year of office the government has failed to begin one new project that it has developed itself should not actually be an excuse for it to engage in a breach of proper policy. We will be voting for our amendments and voting for amended legislation. That is what we want to see happen. The government should reconsider its position and should do nothing more, but also nothing less, than what is consistent with the policy it took to the election.

"Scott, Fiona, MP",LP,2014-09-23,"



Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (13:22):  I rise today in support of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The coalition is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and is ensuring that this nation has the productive infrastructure that it needs to meet the challenges ahead. 


Nowhere is this clearer than in Western Sydney, which has a population of some two million people and is one of the fastest-growing regions in our country. The federal government, under the leadership of the infrastructure Prime Minister, has made considerable investments in the infrastructure across our region. Successive state and federal Labor governments have failed the people of Western Sydney through a lack of vision for the future of our region. We need to unleash our potential and ensure that Western Sydney is the economic powerhouse that it deserves to be. In fact, Western Sydney is our nation's third-largest city. We from Western Sydney believe in our region and, finally, we now have a Prime Minister, a cabinet, a Premier, and state and federal governments that too believe in us.


I support this amendment bill as it will ensure the projects in Western Sydney will be delivered effectively and efficiently under the guidance of Infrastructure Australia. By way of background, Infrastructure Australia is a statutory authority and its role is to plan and coordinate projects across Australia. It was established by the former Rudd government in 2008 and it was designed to take the politics out of infrastructure investment. Infrastructure Australia is regarded as a good policy decision; however—unsurprisingly, like so many of the initiatives of the former government—it has been poorly implemented. 


Under its previous structure, state governments considered Infrastructure Australia to be a political institution because the coordinator was a direct appointment of the federal minister. As a result, state governments disengaged with Infrastructure Australia, which undermined its purpose and overarching goals. To rectify this concern, the government has changed the legislation so Infrastructure Australia has an independent board who appoints a CEO. This is just the first step in meeting our election commitment to create a strong, independent and transparent Infrastructure Australia. I am pleased to note that these new arrangements came into effect on 1 September, and I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for moving so quickly to implement this. In introducing this amendment bill, the Deputy Prime Minister has not only strengthened the independence of Infrastructure Australia but also entrenched its role as a key adviser to the government.


The parliament must reach a consensus. Infrastructure Australia needs to move away from assessing lists based on already announced priorities and focus strategically on Australia's future infrastructure needs. Quite simply, Infrastructure Australia should inform decisions rather than play catch-up. Therefore, upon being elected, the government immediately tasked Infrastructure Australia with three key priorities: firstly, undertake an audit of nationally significant infrastructure; secondly, develop a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities; and, finally, assess projects receiving government funding of $100 million or more.


This bill cements these key priorities. It also goes one step further by ensuring the effective and efficient delivery of infrastructure across Australia by requiring Infrastructure Australia to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on a project before it can appear on a priority list. This move alone will create greater transparency, informing the public of how decisions are being made by government and ensuring that the taxpayer is getting the best value for money.


Further, the cost-benefit analysis will significantly enhance Infrastructure Australia's capability to provide strategic independent advice on the needs of our local communities directly to federal and state government as well as private investors. This means more informed decision making by the government and better outcomes for our local communities. For instance, the government this year ended 40 years of indecision by deciding to build a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. The Prime Minister and cabinet did not just decide to build the airport; they have also put $3.5 billion into an infrastructure plan across Greater Western Sydney. They have worked in a collaborative way with the New South Wales state government to put in place this fully costed plan.


Finally we have a government which understands the challenges that come with growth in our suburban communities and is delivering the infrastructure that will support our growth today but also into the future. The government has also developed a comprehensive infrastructure plan that will include new infrastructure like WestConnex and NorthConnex; the upgrade of existing roads like Northern Road, Bringelly Road and Elizabeth Drive; and, finally, the reservation of corridors where future infrastructure will be required in the long term. This multifaceted approach will unlock economic capacity and potential by creating Sydney road networks. It will slash travel times for motorists and ease congestion.


Like Western Sydney, Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure and transport. Investment in significant infrastructure is central to growing productivity and improving the living standards of Australians now in the future.


In my electorate of Lindsay, two-thirds of the workforce must commute every single day for work—one-third all the way into the city and one-third into Greater Western Sydney. This $3.5 billion of infrastructure will link so many of our business parks, which is sure to create more jobs locally, get more people off our roads and keep more people within our region. 


The Australian and New South Wales governments are also steaming ahead with delivering world-class infrastructure right across Sydney, starting with the geotechnical investigations on the tunnel sections of the WestConnex stage 1 project. The east corridor commenced last week. This is an important milestone in the delivery of WestConnex which will, when it is completed in 2023, provide more than $20 billion in economic benefits to New South Wales, create 10,000 jobs, and help motorists bypass up to 52 sets of traffic lights. 


The reforms to Infrastructure Australia will ensure the Nepean Valley, Western Sydney and communities right across Australia will benefit from investment in high-quality, efficient and cost-effective infrastructure. This will be achieved through Infrastructure Australia conducting rigorous and sound planning to identify quality projects and avoid wasteful investment. Let us be clear: Infrastructure Australia will not—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member for Lindsay will have leave to continue her remarks when the debate is resumed.

That is, not only is the federal government's refusal to fund any public transport project bringing that figure down to zero but, of course, states are responding by also reducing their funding for public transport projects, because they are seeking to prioritise projects that will attract some co-funding from the federal government. Therefore, where they have before them two projects, a road project and a rail project, common sense—as well as the Productivity Commission, Infrastructure Australia and others—tells you that they will fund the road project and not the public transport projects.


We created Infrastructure Australia to take the politics out of infrastructure delivery, to break the nexus between the political cycle, which by definition is three or four years, and the infrastructure investment cycle, which is long-term. We inherited an enormous infrastructure deficit. When we came to office Australia was ranked 20th in the OECD for infrastructure investment as a proportion of the national economy. When we left office we were ranked first. Australia went from 20th to first over those six years. We invested not just in any project; we invested in the right projects. We invested in all 15 projects that were identified by Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia also ensured that there was more rigour in state government processes. Quite frankly, the states had in the past been negligent in doing the proper planning work and getting that up to scratch. For example, when the global financial crisis hit and there was an opportunity for projects to be funded to stimulate the economy and to see us through that crisis, there were very few projects that were actually ready to go, on which the hard work of planning had been done.


One of the things that Infrastructure Australia also did, and I see nothing wrong with the government doing this, was provide seed funding for state governments, such as the $40 million we provided for the Melbourne Metro project, to see if projects could be got up to speed. It was a dynamic process between Infrastructure Australia and the state governments to make sure that projects could truly deliver on maximising productivity benefits. That dynamic process prior to major funding being delivered was exactly what we envisaged Infrastructure Australia would do, not just doing an analysis after. In this case, $3½ billion was already prepaid last financial year to the Victorian and New South Wales governments. The government has ignored that. It has ignored proper advice. It has ensured that we have a process that is deeply flawed.


An example of that is the East West Link project. We asked after the budget, in Senate estimates, where $1½ billion has been allocated—$500 million for stage 1 and $1 billion for stage 2. They cannot even say where the tunnels are coming up. They cannot say precisely what the route of the project is. But $1 billion of taxpayers money was paid, in advance, last financial year. The government says that there is a budget crisis but $1½ billion was paid in advance before a contract has been signed, before plans have been finalised and before a cost-benefit analysis has been published. We have seen only two cost-benefit analyses for the East West Link: one of 0.5—that is, 50c returned for every dollar invested—and one of 0.8, which lifts it up to 80c, if you take into account a whole range of other factors to lift it up as high as possible. After the allocation of that $1½ billion, during the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's estimates hearing held on 26 May, Senator Conroy asked Infrastructure Australia: 


So Infrastructure Australia has not seen the full business case?


Infrastructure Australia:


No.


That is on page 31 of the hearing transcript. Senator Conroy asked a question about East West Link stage 1:


But it does not recover costs?


Infrastructure Australia:


Not for the core benefit-cost ratio.


That was their statement—very clear. Then Senator Conroy asked:


You have not been able, with all the information you have got so far, to classify it as ready to proceed? 


The reply from Mr Roe of Infrastructure Australia was:


That is correct. 


Then, when asked at the same estimates meeting about East West Link stage 2—to which a billion dollars has already been paid—Infrastructure Australia acknowledged that it had only received 'conceptual information'. Mr Fitzgerald from IA said:


There is significantly more information that we would require for it to be a full business case.


So you have the extraordinary situation that money has been forwarded well in advance of any proper analysis being undertaken.


The independence of Infrastructure Australia is central to Labor's approach to infrastructure delivery. Under this government, however, Infrastructure Australia is already moving away from the independent model it was designed to follow. It started when the minister brought legislation to this House proposing to give himself the right to dictate Infrastructure Australia's research agenda. He also proposed giving himself a right of veto over publication of IA research, which would have destroyed the transparency of the current system. I am pleased to say that Labor, backed by the Business Council of Australia, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and several other groups, campaigned against these proposals. That led to the government accepting Labor amendments that preserved IA's independence.


But I do worry about how Infrastructure Australia has been functioning in recent times. We have had a range of new board members appointed, as well as an acting Infrastructure Coordinator—John Fitzgerald. I have asked for information about how the CEO of Infrastructure Australia is going to be chosen. I have asked what advertising is taking place and how the recruitment process for that position is being determined. It is not a position that should be determined politically. Based on what we have seen so far, Mr Fitzgerald can hardly be described as an unbiased analyst. In the budget estimates committee hearing in May, Mr Fitzgerald revealed that he had been with consulting firm KPMG, where he had been a lobbyist for the East West Link project. The job he had prior to that was working on the East West Link project for the Victorian government.


Senator Conroy raised this issue and asked at Senate estimates if there were any potential conflicts involved—because it stood out as an obvious one. Challenged about this at the hearing, Mr Fitzgerald declared himself an advocate for major national projects. Infrastructure Australia is not supposed to be an advocate; it is supposed to be an impartial organisation that deals with facts. That is why I was very concerned that, on 29 April, Mr Fitzgerald produced a media release—on Infrastructure Australia letterhead—in which he said that Infrastructure Australia had consistently held the view that the East West Link was a meritorious project. It was quite extraordinary for him, as a public servant, to put out such a press release. 


Mr Fitzgerald has since then continued to take an increasingly political approach to what is supposed to be a non-political position. In July, TheAge revealed that an Infrastructure Australia report had questioned the amount of money that was being spent on roads around the nation and had asked whether proper analysis was being conducted in order to maximise the benefit of that investment. This report was a contribution to the debate and was consistent with the way Infrastructure Australia works. It was put out for comment from the sector. Mr Fitzgerald intervened to disown the report, a report which had come from the organisation he was the acting Infrastructure Coordinator of. That is quite extraordinary. 


Just a few weeks ago there was some controversy about court action that two local councils were taking over the East West Link project. It is, after all, a very controversial project in Victoria—and it should be noted that Victoria is facing an election in the next few months. On the Friday, Mr Fitzgerald again issued a media release—again on Infrastructure Australia letterhead—this time criticising the position that was being advanced by the Labor opposition on the project, in particular the Labor opposition questioning whether, in the circumstances, signing a contract for the project would be legal. I would find it unbelievable if, say, Mike Mrdak, the secretary of the department, or Dr Watt from PM&C or any other senior public servant were to intervene in such a situation. But Mr Fitzgerald did—by putting out a media release. 


One has to ask the question: who authorised Mr Fitzgerald's intervention? The Infrastructure Australia board had certainly not met. The government—not the minister, to be fair, but his errand boy, the assistant minister—has been quite critical from time to time about the former Infrastructure Coordinator, Michael Deegan, and in the past has talked a lot about having an independent board at arm's length. It is absolutely extraordinary that this occurred. Mr Fitzgerald, as a former public servant, should frankly know better. You can be a political participant or a public servant. If you want to be a political participant, join a political party and run for public office. But do not be an acting public servant in a senior position who behaves in such an extraordinary fashion.


That is my concern with regard to proper processes. Similarly, with the WestConnex project in Sydney, we in government were of the view that there is a real argument to extend the M4 from where it currently finishes through to the city. It is absurd that it ends some considerable distance from the city and then people, after being on the M4, hit a traffic jam. This is just like how the M5, which I have also been critical of, needs to be extended to the port.



Indeed, the current Prime Minister identified this objective in his book Battlelines. He said this:


Sydney, for instance, should fill the gaps between the CBD and the M4 at Strathfield... There should be a link between the northern beaches and the city and between the western suburbs at Port Botany.


If you look at the contribution of Mr Tony Shepherd—and I have raised my concerns with Tony Shepherd, as the head of WestConnex—the problem is at the moment, as they themselves say, the proposed stage 1 is an extension to Haberfield and the proposed stage 2 is an extension to St Peters. This is a road to a traffic jam. This does not solve the problem. Anyone who drives to Sydney Airport will know that the idea of dumping traffic to the west of Sydney Airport, let alone not taking it to the port, is extraordinary. King Street in Newtown is a car park. This is a road to a car park. It is not dealing with the productivity benefits that would be dealt with, in terms of a freight link from Port Botany—which would see such growth—through to the M5.



In terms of the M4, there is extraordinary uncertainty being created for my constituents and for the people of Western Sydney, who deserve better than this approach. That example has been exemplified by the correspondence to one of my constituents, Vince Crowe of Haberfield, who received advice on 26 June 2014 from the WestConnex Delivery Authority. One said that his property was needed to be purchased and the other said that it was not needed. That is what happens when you make policy up as you go along. That is what happens when you do not have proper planning and proper processes.


What should be occurring is the federal government working with the state government to ensure that those objectives are met. We need to make sure that we get this legislation right. The way to get it right is to do the analysis first and then forward the money second, as the project is going along. That is what we did in government and that is the way that you maximise the productivity benefits of infrastructure investment.


This is one of the key issues that needs to be dealt with in terms of dealing with urban congestion and the other challenges that are there, particularly in our urban communities. The second thing that the government needs to do is to get rid of this bizarre ideological position that it has of not funding public transport and distorting the market. You need to have an integrated transport strategy when you look at issues of how we get better planning in our cities. If you look at just roads funding, you will distort not just what the federal government does but also what the state government does and you will not be able to deal with urban congestion. It is as silly as completely separating looking at how we move people from how we move freight. It is interconnected. People, freight, road and raid are all interconnected. Unless you have a strategy to deal with all of those issues, you will not be successful.


Regardless of their political perspective, I think Australians will be disappointed by this legislation; but there is an opportunity for the government to get it right by adopting Labor's amendments. I indicate that we are perfectly willing, as always, to engage in constructive discussion with the government about these issues. That is because when Australians decide to invest in a house, they make relevant checks on its title, its susceptibility to flooding, its easements and other important issues. They hire people to produce property reports so that they know the house is in good order. They do that before they purchase a house, not afterwards. That is due diligence and that is common sense. That common-sense approach can certainly apply when you discuss what is the best way for the government to deal with the challenge of dealing with our infrastructure deficit.


The fact that in its first year of office the government has failed to begin one new project that it has developed itself should not actually be an excuse for it to engage in a breach of proper policy. We will be voting for our amendments and voting for amended legislation. That is what we want to see happen. The government should reconsider its position and should do nothing more, but also nothing less, than what is consistent with the policy it took to the election.

"Scott, Fiona, MP",LP,2014-09-23,"



Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (13:22):  I rise today in support of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The coalition is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and is ensuring that this nation has the productive infrastructure that it needs to meet the challenges ahead. 


Nowhere is this clearer than in Western Sydney, which has a population of some two million people and is one of the fastest-growing regions in our country. The federal government, under the leadership of the infrastructure Prime Minister, has made considerable investments in the infrastructure across our region. Successive state and federal Labor governments have failed the people of Western Sydney through a lack of vision for the future of our region. We need to unleash our potential and ensure that Western Sydney is the economic powerhouse that it deserves to be. In fact, Western Sydney is our nation's third-largest city. We from Western Sydney believe in our region and, finally, we now have a Prime Minister, a cabinet, a Premier, and state and federal governments that too believe in us.


I support this amendment bill as it will ensure the projects in Western Sydney will be delivered effectively and efficiently under the guidance of Infrastructure Australia. By way of background, Infrastructure Australia is a statutory authority and its role is to plan and coordinate projects across Australia. It was established by the former Rudd government in 2008 and it was designed to take the politics out of infrastructure investment. Infrastructure Australia is regarded as a good policy decision; however—unsurprisingly, like so many of the initiatives of the former government—it has been poorly implemented. 


Under its previous structure, state governments considered Infrastructure Australia to be a political institution because the coordinator was a direct appointment of the federal minister. As a result, state governments disengaged with Infrastructure Australia, which undermined its purpose and overarching goals. To rectify this concern, the government has changed the legislation so Infrastructure Australia has an independent board who appoints a CEO. This is just the first step in meeting our election commitment to create a strong, independent and transparent Infrastructure Australia. I am pleased to note that these new arrangements came into effect on 1 September, and I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for moving so quickly to implement this. In introducing this amendment bill, the Deputy Prime Minister has not only strengthened the independence of Infrastructure Australia but also entrenched its role as a key adviser to the government.


The parliament must reach a consensus. Infrastructure Australia needs to move away from assessing lists based on already announced priorities and focus strategically on Australia's future infrastructure needs. Quite simply, Infrastructure Australia should inform decisions rather than play catch-up. Therefore, upon being elected, the government immediately tasked Infrastructure Australia with three key priorities: firstly, undertake an audit of nationally significant infrastructure; secondly, develop a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities; and, finally, assess projects receiving government funding of $100 million or more.


This bill cements these key priorities. It also goes one step further by ensuring the effective and efficient delivery of infrastructure across Australia by requiring Infrastructure Australia to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on a project before it can appear on a priority list. This move alone will create greater transparency, informing the public of how decisions are being made by government and ensuring that the taxpayer is getting the best value for money.


Further, the cost-benefit analysis will significantly enhance Infrastructure Australia's capability to provide strategic independent advice on the needs of our local communities directly to federal and state government as well as private investors. This means more informed decision making by the government and better outcomes for our local communities. For instance, the government this year ended 40 years of indecision by deciding to build a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. The Prime Minister and cabinet did not just decide to build the airport; they have also put $3.5 billion into an infrastructure plan across Greater Western Sydney. They have worked in a collaborative way with the New South Wales state government to put in place this fully costed plan.


Finally we have a government which understands the challenges that come with growth in our suburban communities and is delivering the infrastructure that will support our growth today but also into the future. The government has also developed a comprehensive infrastructure plan that will include new infrastructure like WestConnex and NorthConnex; the upgrade of existing roads like Northern Road, Bringelly Road and Elizabeth Drive; and, finally, the reservation of corridors where future infrastructure will be required in the long term. This multifaceted approach will unlock economic capacity and potential by creating Sydney road networks. It will slash travel times for motorists and ease congestion.


Like Western Sydney, Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure and transport. Investment in significant infrastructure is central to growing productivity and improving the living standards of Australians now in the future.


In my electorate of Lindsay, two-thirds of the workforce must commute every single day for work—one-third all the way into the city and one-third into Greater Western Sydney. This $3.5 billion of infrastructure will link so many of our business parks, which is sure to create more jobs locally, get more people off our roads and keep more people within our region. 


The Australian and New South Wales governments are also steaming ahead with delivering world-class infrastructure right across Sydney, starting with the geotechnical investigations on the tunnel sections of the WestConnex stage 1 project. The east corridor commenced last week. This is an important milestone in the delivery of WestConnex which will, when it is completed in 2023, provide more than $20 billion in economic benefits to New South Wales, create 10,000 jobs, and help motorists bypass up to 52 sets of traffic lights. 


The reforms to Infrastructure Australia will ensure the Nepean Valley, Western Sydney and communities right across Australia will benefit from investment in high-quality, efficient and cost-effective infrastructure. This will be achieved through Infrastructure Australia conducting rigorous and sound planning to identify quality projects and avoid wasteful investment. Let us be clear: Infrastructure Australia will not—

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (13:30):  The people of Newcastle are worried about what the Abbott Liberal government is doing to our national healthcare system. In June and July this year, I conducted a survey of my electorate, asking the community what mattered most to them and what issues most concerned them about this year's budget. The results clearly showed that the issue most important to the people of Newcastle is having access to affordable health care. And the budget issues that concerned responders most were the government's cuts to health and education, coupled with the new tax on visiting the GP and the increased cost of medicines. One responder wrote:


I am a single pensioner as my husband died at 47. I am against extra payments to see the GP. I am constantly at the doctors and I am under 5 specialists. I have had 4 breast cancers and many other problems and have one and a half pages of medications. If Medicare is cut I will not be able to take my medication. It won't affect Tony Abbott as he can afford it. I and lots of pensioners like myself are in the same boat. Save Medicare.


The government's justification for their cruel attack on Medicare and those less well-off just does not stack up. They say our health bill is spiralling out of control, yet the government's own Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has today reported that growth in health spending is actually at the lowest level in decades. The GP tax is bad for patients, bad for health care and bad for the budget, and the government should scrap it.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2014-09-23,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:12):  I rise today to condemn this government's unfair budget, which attacks both current and future Australian university students, condemning them to a debt sentence. This government's proposed changes to Australia's higher education sector is an ideological frolic from this Minister for Education to ensure that only those who can afford to attain a higher education can get one. Allowing universities to charge students whatever fees they like will take Australia down a path of American universities, where degrees cost students $100,000 or more. Going to university should depend on your ability, hard work and qualifications and not on your parents' bank account. Education is absolutely essential for Australia's opportunities and our economic growth and future. Higher university fees will put this at risk. Let me be clear, this government's higher education proposal is nothing more than a collection of broken promises—not just broken promises made before the election but broken promises made after the election.


I want to take the House through some of these broken promises that those opposite made during the lead-up to last year's election. First, we have the coalition's 'real solutions' pamphlet. Many of those on the other side should remember it—they held it up enough times. But they obviously forgot to read it because what it said is:


We will ensure the continuation of current arrangements of university funding.


The government has since slashed $5.8 billion from the higher education sector—a clear broken promise of their election commitment. Of course, we cannot forget the Prime Minister's pledge on election eve: no cuts to education. He promised the Australian people this. I am not sure what a $5.8 billion cut means to the Prime Minister, but it certainly looks like a broken promise to me. Then, of course, there is the famous media release published on pyneonline, the minister's website, saying the coalition will not cap places or raise HECS. This is yet another broken promise as the deregulation of fees and the compounding interest on HECS and HELP student loans will increase the average student debt by tens of thousands of dollars. No matter what the minister tries to spin, and no matter what the minister tries to say, the evidence is in. University fees are going up and they are going up not by a small amount but by a large amount.


Even after the election people were fed blatant mistruths by the government. The minister went on television on 17 November. It is a very interesting read if anyone would like to read that—it is still on Pyne Online. He said on Sky News a number of things. First, when he was asked about raising university fees, he said:


… we promised that we wouldn't and Tony Abbott made it very clear before the election that we would keep our promises.


As I said, I certainly recommend the 17 November interview to anyone who has not read it because he also stated very clearly, absolutely categorically, that they were not going to raise fees. The deregulation of uni fees and the introduction of $100,000 degrees is another broken promise. Then there was this pearler by the minister:


The days when governments get elected or political parties get elected and then junk their policies and promises, I'm hoping it's over for good. 


Of course he forgot that interview. He forgot the assurances he made. He just kept lying to the Australian people. He also said in the same interview:


… the public want a period of stable government where … the government keeps its promises … And there's much I can do in universities and schools while keeping all my promises …


Why then is the minister not doing a whole lot in universities and not doing a whole lot in schools except breaking his promises?


While the government would like to pretend that they are not breaking their commitments and that they are not cutting $5.8 billion out of higher education, this is real. We know that allowing universities to charge what they want will lead to $100,000 degrees. The minister can say all he likes that this is not true, but that is not what the independent modelling has shown. Indeed, the National Tertiary Education Union's modelling has revealed that universities will lose more than $4.7 billion, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has revealed that degrees are likely to double or triple in cost and the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has revealed that lifelong debt and loan defaults will be a reality under the government's changes.


The minister likes to paint these figures as alarmist propaganda put up by the Labor Party and say that all we are doing is running a fear campaign, but they have been confirmed today. The minister said clearly in question time that the government was not increasing fees. I would like to see him answer the question properly because we saw today that the University of Western Australia is introducing a 30 per cent increase in student fees. So while the minister has been in this House today saying that there will be no increase in fees we have seen on the ground today the announcement of a significant increase in fees. That is the reality. This is not based on research and modelling—and I think that modelling has been very credible—this is real.


We hear the minister often saying that $100,000 degrees are not real. If he looked at the details and took time to look at the announcement today, he would see that someone who wants to be a lawyer and go to the University of Western Australia will have $95,000 of debt and students undertaking medicine will be forced to shoulder well over $100,000 worth of debt. This minister is condemning Australian students to a debt sentence well in excess of $100,000. The Americanisation of Australian universities with $100,000 degrees will shut the door on young people.




Mr Tudge:
  Seriously?




Ms RISHWORTH:
  The parliamentary secretary should talk to his constituents. If he talked to his constituents, he would know that it is not just students, teachers and university lecturers who are upset; mums and dads are upset about this. They are angry about this. Grandparents are upset about this. He needs to start talking to his electorate and start paying attention.


Then we have the really important aspect that the minister was bragging about today—that is, indexation of student debt. The proposed changes will lead to indexation of student debt, a compounding rate of student debt. Many on the other side promised that they would lobby the minister and the Prime Minister on this. Unfortunately, their lobbying fell on deaf ears because in the proposal we will see the bond rate applied. This will have a significant impact on so many people.



Mr Nikolic interjecting—




Ms RISHWORTH:
  I hear the member for Bass interjecting. I heard with my own ears him saying: 'I am going to lobby the Prime Minister on this one. I am going to make sure that we do not have real interest rates.' Unfortunately, the member for Bass failed to be heard in his own caucus. What we are talking about is compounding interest not just for new students but for anyone with a HECS debt. In New South Wales over 340,000 Australians with an existing loan will be forced to pay extra. In South Australia 85,000 people with pre-existing student debt will be forced to pay real compounding interest. Queensland members will be asking 345,000 of their constituents to pay more.


This is a broken promise because I could not find in the Real Solutions pamphlet where they said anyone with a student debt will end up paying more for their debt. They will pay more interest on it. It is surprising that we are getting the Treasurer and the Minister for Education beating their chests about how important this is because they indeed protested against any increase in any fees back in their university days. I distinctly remember the Treasurer saying that $250 was a lot of money for students and they should not have to pay that. How times have changed. Now the Treasurer is asking students not to blink an eye at $100,000.


What we see here is a shocking piece of policy. It is an ideological frolic from this government. Most importantly, it is an absolute broken promise that throws out fairness. This is a budget of broken promises and a budget of unfairness.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2014-09-23,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications) (15:22):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on this matter of public importance, which attacks the Abbott government's reform package for higher education. And, as is typical of this opposition, it is strong on complaint but there is no plan of its own. By contrast, the Abbott government does have a plan.


The fundamental problem with this MPI is threefold: firstly, the government's higher education reforms strengthen the system and create more opportunities for students; secondly, this package is consistent with core principles of fairness—that is, if you get substantial private value from a university degree, you should bear a fair share of the cost of providing that degree; and, thirdly, this MPI makes no mention of the key equity safeguards that are built into the package but that are ignored in Labor's dishonest scare campaign.


These reforms strengthen the system and create more opportunities for students. Thanks to these reforms, there will be an additional 80,000 Commonwealth supported places by 2018, there will be 35,000 bachelor degree places and there will be 48,000 places for diploma, advanced diploma and associate degree students. There is an expansion of funding beyond the current players in the system to any registered higher education institution, including TAFES, private colleges and universities. These reforms allow a stronger university system in Australia; they allow Australian universities to maintain and, over time, improve their global ratings, which of course serve the interests of Australian students and gives more of them a globally recognised credential.


But do not just take my word for it. What is it that the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Professor Greg Craven, had to say? He said:


There are three good reasons … universities must be able to set their own fees …otherwise we cannot fund vital national research; the international perception of Australian higher education will decline; and students will get an education that is admittedly cheap but increasingly nasty.


These are the things that Professor Greg Craven says will happen if this Abbott government reform package does not go through.


Professor Sandra Harding, of James Cook University, said:


We shouldn't underestimate the size of these reforms or the need or urgency for these reforms. The status quo is not an option.


These reforms maintain and continue the reform direction laid down by the Bradley review of higher education in 2008. That review recommended opening up universities to everybody with the desire and the requisite ability to attend. The previous Labor government did half the job: they deregulated the number of places, but they rejected the Bradley recommendation that base funding per student going into the system should increase. And so we have an outcome where the number of places has increased, but at the same time the previous Labor government cut funding. And isn't this an absolutely classic Labor approach: great rhetoric, worthy goals, but no performance, no delivery, no plan as to how to make these outcomes actually materialise.


Belinda Robinson, of Universities Australia, said yesterday in the Australian Financial Review:


It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.


So the reforms contained in the package that the Abbott government is putting forward, which education minister, Christopher Pyne, is leading, are reforms designed to strengthen the university system and, in turn, create more opportunities for Australian students.


The second point that goes to the fallacy of this MPI is that the policy approach the Abbott government is pursuing is consistent with a core principle of fairness—that is, if you get substantial private value from a university degree, it is only fair that you bear some of the cost. Again, do not just take my word for it. Former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating in 1995 said:


There is no such thing of course as free education—somebody has to pay.


Or the current shadow Treasurer, in his widely read 2013 book Hearts and Minds, said:


The Hawke Government also introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme as a way of raising more revenue to finance the extension of the number of university places … I supported it because I could see the inherent logic: our incomes would be higher because we had been to university.


Or, indeed, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, interviewed in 1998 for Collective wisdom, said about HECS:


I don't have any problem with the concept of fees … one of the greatest stupidities was the proposition that the Whitlam Labor government introduced of ""free"" education.


Or, of course, there is the man whose thoughts we turn to so often in this chamber, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Andrew Leigh, who had this to say:


… government alone cannot provide all of the additional funding necessary for our universities to become top notch. More money is required from all sources, including students.


It is consistent with these basic principles of fairness, articulated by a series of Labor thinkers who I have quoted in this debate today, which underpins the logic of the approach the Abbott government is taking in its reforms in higher education to shift the proportion of the cost of a university degree, which is met by the student taking the degree from today's 40 per cent on average to 50 per cent on average.


The third point I want to make in the time available today is that we have had a disgraceful scare campaign, a dishonest scare campaign from the Labor Party about the likely outcomes in the education market place as universities go about setting their fees once they are given the freedom to do so. It is a disgraceful scare campaign, which ignores many of the facts and the opinions of key participants in the sector. What did the Vice Chancellor of La Trobe University have to say in the Financial Review on 15 September? He said:


… if given the freedom, universities can be trusted to be sensible on how they will price courses.


He added:


The best way to ensure moderate fee increases is to not set a ceiling on prices.


Indeed, much of the overblown commentary—the dire threats of the kind of fee level we might expect—seems to ignore the operation of a competitive market and the fact that Australian universities will be subject to competitive disciplines. It will not be feasible for them to set prices which are higher than students will be willing to pay and higher than their competitors charge. And, of course, it is not just domestic competitors but international competitors, online competitors and so on.


One of the other disgraceful misrepresentations which are commonly made in this debate by the Labor Party is that there is going to be in some way a removal of the HECS scheme. In fact, on the contrary, there will continue to be no up-front fees. Students will continue to have available to them the HECS scheme—now known as HELP—under which, rather than being required to pay up-front, they can accumulate a debt and pay that over time, and it is income contingent. You are not required to pay a dollar until such time as you reach the threshold, which is presently slightly over $50,000 a year.


What we also fail to hear about from the Labor Party are all of the other equity measures contained in this comprehensive package. There are measures for low-income students—those from a disadvantaged background. There is the proposed new Commonwealth scholarships scheme, which will benefit thousands of students from a disadvantaged background. Indeed, universities will be required to spend one dollar in five of additional revenue on scholarships for disadvantaged students. There are the elements to improve equity for regional students and regional campuses with a regional loading of $274 million over four years. The support is extended to private universities and non-university higher education providers, many of which have a very good record of getting non-traditional students into tertiary education. Again I quote Greg Craven, of the Australian Catholic University:


… Pyne has moved decisively to protect students entering lowly paid but socially vital professions.


… the cut to nurses and teachers, for example, will be noticeably less, recognising their relatively limited earning opportunities …


It is vital that there be reforms made to the higher education system to make it stronger and to give more opportunities for students. The coalition has a plan to do that. Labor has no plan; it just has the usual whingeing.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-09-23,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (15:32):  Just under 30 years ago a member of this chamber took their first tentative steps into the political fray by nominating themselves as a first-year student for election to the august position of student representative of the University of Adelaide's education standing committee. It was a bashful start; the member in question could not manage to include a picture of themselves in their materials. That being said, they did provide an election statement—a formal statement of their raison d'etre for running for election. In their statement the bashful member said:


I feel it my duty to stand for election and do everything possible to forestall the introduction of fees and indeed to end any movement by the federal government to introduce fees.


I happen to support the imposition of income-contingent, reasonable-deferred-repayment university fees for university students, but I do understand that 30 years ago many idealistic young Labor members opposed fees of this kind. The extraordinary thing is that this election statement was not made by a Labor MP. It was not the member for Adelaide. It was not the member for Kingston. It was not the member for Port Adelaide. Who could this be? It was the Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne.


How could this be? Did the education minister undergo an ideological epiphany from student socialist to high tory over the past 30 years, or is there another explanation? The education minister's comments in a recent interview with the ABC's Fran Kelly about another coalition MP's awkward history in student politics might be enlightening in this regard. Minister for Education Christopher Pyne's explanation for the disconnect between the historical comments and the government's current policy was:


You don't get elected as student politician by saying the opposite to what the voters in your university are thinking.


Fast forward 30 years, and this is exactly the contemptuous, cynical, deceptive approach that the minister is taking in his latest elected office. Before the last federal election, the coalition's Real Solutions policy pamphlet—another document that, surprisingly enough, is also missing the face of the education minister—made this promise to the Australian people:


We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.


The education minister made the meaning of this commitment crystal clear when he gave an interview on Sky News in November just last year after the election. Responding when asked whether he would like to raise university fees, he said:


I'm not even considering it because we promised that we wouldn't. Tony Abbott made it very clear before the election that we would keep our promises.


Six months later comes the federal budget, and Australians have found that the word of the federal education minister is worth just as little as the word of the student politician. A cut of $1.9 billion in Commonwealth funding for university places, a broken promise that will force universities to start raising fees—for Australian students this means hikes in the cost of their degrees of at least 30 per cent just to replace what the government's broken promise has taken out. It means engineering students will be paying up to 58 people cent more to make up for the cut. Nursing students will pay 24 per cent more for their nursing degrees. Our environmental studies students will have to pay 110 per cent more to study their courses.


Even more fundamentally, the deregulation of fees means that universities can charge whatever they would like for these degrees. If the market will bear over $100,000 for a law degree, as it is at the University of Melbourne, that is what students will pay. We saw in WA today that we are already seeing more $100,000 degrees. It is a shift in our higher education system towards the rich and away from the smart. It means our bright young students from disadvantaged families will learn that it is money, not merit that determines their future. It means our universities will cater for a narrow elite, not the egalitarian majority needed by the Australian economy and our society.


But this deception did not end with the budget. No, in the second reading speech of the higher education bills the education minister claimed, 'Students will benefit the most.' In an interview on the ABC's Insiders program the education minister claimed, 'Students will always be the winners.' If students will always be the winners, why didn't you tell them before the election? Why keep it a secret? If it is so great, make it a vote winner.


You have to go back to Victor Hugo to find out the education minister's animated political philosophy:


… he does not speak, he lies. This man lies as other men breathe. He announces an honest intention; be on your guard: he makes an assertion, distrust him: he takes an oath, tremble.


The Australian people did not vote for these changes at the last election and they do not want them. The Australian Labor Party will fight these changes every step of the way through this place. We will fight them every step of the way in our community and we will fight them all the way through the next election, when we kick this deceitful government out.




Mr Ewen Jones:

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2014-09-23,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:37):  Whatever happened to the Labor Party of Hawke and Keating? That is what I want to know, because the member for Gellibrand talks about what happened 30 years ago. I can tell you what happened 30 years ago: Australia elected the Hawke-Keating government. On this side of the House, we proudly say that it was a good government. It was perhaps the best Labor government that Labor has had—and that is not a particularly high standard. It introduced some significant reforms, including economic reforms, deregulation of the economy and the reintroduction of tariffs. But one of the most significant reforms that it introduced was the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, known as HECS. This great Hawke-Keating legacy was to introduce a scheme whereby the students themselves would contribute some money towards their higher education degrees, knowing that, by going to university themselves, they were likely to earn so much more money in the future. It just seemed sensible to the Hawke-Keating government that this was a good scheme to introduce and that students themselves should contribute.


In some respects, the reforms that we are introducing now are a logical extension of those Hawke-Keating reforms. They build on the HECS system which is in place. If you listened to Belinda Robinson, who is the head of Universities Australia, you would know that she herself says that these reforms are the logical evolution of higher education policy. What these reforms do, just like the Hawke HECS reforms, is open up opportunities for tens of thousands more students. We estimate that 80,000 more people will be able to access higher education as a result of the reforms that we are introducing, because, for the very first time, sub-degrees will be part of the HECS system. This means that an associate degree, or a diploma, will now not have to be paid for up-front but will be part of the HECS system. This is so good for people from families who have not previously attended higher education, because they can often use those qualifications as a pathway into a higher education degree. This is what we are talking about with these reforms. They will open up opportunities and create more scholarships than have ever been created in the history of Australia.


Those scholarships will not just help with tuition fees but help with living expenses. At the end of the day, the biggest barrier to higher education is not your Higher Education Contribution Scheme fees—which are all deferred and do not have to be paid until you are earning above $50,000—but your living expenses. Rural students particularly know these barriers, as do low-SES students. The package that we are putting forward will put $1 out of every $5 of increase in HECS towards scholarships. Those scholarships will help underprivileged students access university, paying for their living costs so that they can get there, whereas otherwise they may not get there.


I do not know what happened to the Hawke-Keating era of the Labor Party. It seems to have been abandoned. While the member for Kingston raised this particular matter today, you suspect that the people who are actually driving higher education policy are Senator Kim 'il-Carr' over in the Senate, Senator Hanson-Young and perhaps Adam Bandt. It is the left of the party these days that dominates Labor's education policy. There are still a couple of sensible people on that side of the House. We have mentioned Chris Bowen. We have talked about his book, Hearts & Minds, as the member for Bradfield did. The shadow Treasurer himself supports the HECS system and supports such measures, as does, of course, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, who also supports deregulation of fees. He supports a market based HECS scheme to provide greater opportunities for all. But, sadly, you can be the shadow Treasurer, you can be the Assistant Treasurer and you can even be the leader and believe in these things, but no longer do you get to run higher education policy within the Labor Party, because that is run by the left. It is run by Kim 'il-Carr'; it is run by their Green coalition partners Senator Hanson-Young and Adam Bandt. They are the ones who are dominating Labor, who have abandoned the Hawke-Keating legacy.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-09-23,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (15:43):  What a pathetic effort—a pathetic effort to talk about the Hawke and Keating legacy. Over on this side of parliament, we are proud of the Hawke-Keating legacy, and we are the beneficiaries of it. We are the beneficiaries of going to university under an affordable HECS scheme—a HECS scheme that did not bog us down and drag us down with hundred-grand university fees. We are proud of it. On the other side they want to close the door on that generation. They want to close the door on the next generation of working-class kids having a chance to go to university.


That is not a surprise because it comes from the worst education minister we have seen since Senator Amanda Vanstone. It is no coincidence that his mentor was Senator Amanda Vanstone in the other place. At least Amanda got three years in Rome out of her effort. He got three days in Rome for his duplicity—three days at a cost of $30,000. I can imagine him there on the Vespa going down the boulevards, maybe having a pasta and a bit of chianti, proud of his efforts to destroy a fair and equitable education system in this country. What a shadow of a man he is. What a disgrace he is. He has gone a long way from being the Liberal wets' attack dog to being the lap-dog for Prime Minister Abbott. What a disgrace.


The truth is that everyone in this place talks about education. Everyone in this place talks about why education is a great enabler and a great economic tool to improve society. But the key test is not what you say; it is what you do—it is what you do; not what you say. I am proud of Labor's record. I am proud that, between 2007 and 2013, we nearly doubled education funding. Higher education funding went from $8 billion to $14 billion, student admissions to universities increased by a third, funding for regional universities increased by 56 per cent and there was a 30 per cent boost in regional student numbers—all under the last government, a Labor government committed to education, just like the Hawke and Keating governments. 


On the other hand, we have this pale, pathetic government over here that is trying to close the door, a government that has cut funding by $5.8 billion, a government that has cut funding for undergraduate places by 20 per cent, a government that is jacking up interest rates not just on prospective student loans but on current student loans. So people who are paying student debts from 10 years ago will be facing much higher interest rates because of this government. As the member for Gellibrand said, there is no mention of that in Real Solutions. What are the results of this? As we saw with the University of Western Australia today, the result is an increase in fees. They are increasing their fees by 30 per cent. 


We are going to see an explosion in debt. This is not some scare campaign. We are quoting facts and figures from organisations those opposite are quoting. Why is it fine to quote Belinda Robinson from Universities Australia but not mention the modelling they commissioned—modelling that found that a female engineer will have a debt of $203,000 and will take 32 years to pay it off? A female registered nurse will have a debt of $100,000 and will have that debt until the age of 46. They will have to pay it off until then. What a disgrace. Unlike what the Minister for Education says, a registered nurse will not earn $1 million more than an average worker over the life of their career. Look at what NATSEM modelling says. NATSEM, the organisation the Prime Minister said in opposition was the premier modelling organisation in this country, found that the cost of an education degree will be $87,000. This is a disgrace. Those opposite are attacking the classic first degrees for working-class families—teaching and nursing. These are degrees where people do not earn $1 million more than average people. They are closing the door on the next generation of working-class kids to get into uni. This is their legacy. 


It is not a surprise, because we have got an education minister who is more interested in anything but talking about education. We have an education minister who is more interested in flying to Europe than talking about education. We have got an education minister who is more interested in conspiring against the former member for Fisher than talking about education policy. We have an education minister who is more interested in masterminding the loss of the unlosable state election in South Australia than talking about education policy. This guy is as much a campaign mastermind as a political mastermind. This is an absolute disgrace and this government will stand condemned in history.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (15:48):  I think we all enjoyed that puff of hot air from the member for Charlton, who seemed more intent on besmirching people rather than actually debating the points before us today. We are talking about some really significant issues here to do with higher education reforms, reforms that will strengthen our university sector, that will create more opportunities for our students and our young Australians. How many opportunities will there be? Eighty thousand more students each year will be provided with additional university spaces by 2018. That is 35,000 bachelor degrees and 48,000 diploma courses. 


These higher education reforms are about fairness and about opportunity. Let us not forget that no student will need to pay one dollar up front. FEE-HELP will remain. The Commonwealth taxpayer will continue to meet 50 per cent of the cost. The government is proud of these reforms. They are reforms designed to save the university sector. Quite simply, in the words of Belinda Robinson in TheFinancial Review today: 


The short answer is because the existing funding model is not sustainable and a new approach is needed.


…   …   …


If the Government's package is opposed outright, the quality of the things that our great universities do so well - teaching and research - could be jeopardised. It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.


…   …   …


In embracing the rare and privileged opportunity they have to shape this key element of long-term structural reform, crossbenchers can create a higher education legacy of which they can be proud.


That is what Belinda Robinson, the Chief Executive of Universities Australia, said. I am sure the member for Kingston refers to Belinda Robinson as an ideological frolic. Sure—that is an interesting way to look at it. 


What I find most perplexing is that those opposite think the chancellors and vice-chancellors of all our universities are irresponsible. It is all scare and no substance. In fact, the University of Western Sydney was the first university in New South Wales to grandfather their fees to provide certainty for students. That is really irresponsible, isn't it. John Dewar, Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University, wrote on the 15th of this month: 'La Trobe University has on Monday taken the first step to the possible brave new world of fee deregulation by offering students enrolled at La Trobe in 2015 a guarantee that their fees will not increase by more than 10 per cent above the regulated student contribution for each year of their degree.' I am confident universities will set prices responsibly. The alternative consigns the sector to a very difficult future. I guess those opposite want to assign universities to an abysmal future. 


This has been nothing more than a disgraceful scare campaign put forward by those opposite. How about we take somebody else—Vicki Thomson in The Australian. Don't be fooled by $100,000 degrees. Vicki Thomson said, 'I repeat, there is nothing to fear from deregulated  fees for undergraduate degrees.' Those opposite are just full of it. Let us not forget it was the previous government that cut some $6.6 billion out of the higher education sector. 


These higher education reforms introduced by the Minister for Education are all about providing opportunity—opportunity for more Australians to access higher education, opportunity for our local universities to excel and become some of the best institutions in the Asia-Pacific and in the world. On budget night, the Treasurer said:


Fellow Australians, we should have at least one university in the top 20 in the world, but we do not, and we should have more in the top 100.


I think it is time we had universities that were globally competitive, but those opposite just want to stand in the way of the future of our universities.


I ask the Leader of the Opposition: what is so wrong with wanting to see our universities excel on the international stage? Let us not forget that our universities will be offering more scholarships and the extension of FEE-HELP across a broader spectrum of higher education providers. This government is committed to unlocking educational opportunities for even greater numbers of Australians. Nowhere is it more critical than in regions like Western Sydney, where the additional training and educational opportunities these reforms will create can drive the transformation of the region's labour market and our economy.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (15:53):  This is probably a good point in this debate to remind the government of what the Hawke-Keating reforms were actually about. The Hawke-Keating reforms were about fees of $100 or thereabouts or, at most, maybe $2,000 for a university degree. These reforms are about $100,000 degrees. You must be some kind of dodgy used car salesman to suggest that these reforms are a natural extension of the original Hawke-Keating reforms—from a couple of hundred dollars to a couple of hundred thousand dollars. This is what this government is proposing.


This government does not appreciate that the ability to pay off a debt of a couple of hundred dollars may be done in your first couple of pay cheques, whereas the ability to pay off a degree and a debt of a couple of hundred thousand dollars is going to take a lifetime. When I say 'a couple of hundred thousand dollars', I am talking about the cost of a medical degree. What Sydney uni, Melbourne uni and the University of WA are saying is that their medical degree costs could go up to $200,000. It is what we have seen in the up-front fee debate, and it is now what we are now seeing for ordinary domestic university students.


Let's talk about the capacity to pay and about why this is a debt for life. Let's talk about regional areas such as Tasmania, regional Victoria and North Queensland where the average wages of people is lower than for those in the metro cities. These people do not have the same capacity to pay back debt because their wages are less, yet their fees for university will be just as high. In metro Victoria, as an example, the number of people earning over $78,000—which may be the beginning of an income which can pay back this debt—is 18.2 per cent. But in regional Victoria it is 11 per cent. So they do not have the wages to pay back these debts. That is why it is a debt for life, and that is just for students who graduate when they are aged in their 20s


Let's talk about all the mature-age students, particularly women who go back to university later on in life. You are going to saddle them with a debt. What happens to their debt when they retire? Who will pay back that debt? Will it go to their children? What will happen to that debt? This government's plan is about locking out mature-age students from university. This government is about saddling them with a lifetime debt or locking them out. This government's plan is about locking out working class kids, because working class kids will have to make that tough call—will they get a university degree or will they buy a house? When you go for a mortgage, banks are already asking you, 'What is your university debt? How are you going to pay it back?' It is already a factor, even before these reforms come in.


These reforms will mean students choose not to go to university, and that will put pressure on regional campuses. I note that the previous speaker mentioned the university of La Trobe, but what she did not mention in her contribution is that the vice-chancellor of the university of La Trobe is already saying that, if these reforms go through, there is a high chance the Bendigo La Trobe campus will close. It will close because student numbers will drop. This is what is going to happen on regional campuses. We have seen it happen in the TAFE sector. When student numbers drop because the debts are too high, courses close. When courses close, academics are laid off, and then the viability of the campus is at risk. It will be a slow death—job by job, course by course, student by student.


What this government is doing is setting the bar way too high on debt levels. What this government is doing is not the Hawke-Keating Labor plan, which was to make a small contribution towards your university fees. This is about a debt for life that is more significant than a car loan, that can only be matched by a mortgage for a home. That is the choice that the government is putting to regional kids.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (15:58):  It has been interesting listening to the points raised by colleagues across the chamber. I wonder if those comments would have been the same during the Dawkins period, when the major reforms were occurring, because the changes were significant. They were not minimalist. John Dawkins, the Labor education minister from 1987 to 1992, instigated a series of Australian tertiary education reforms which were announced ultimately in a higher education policy statement—the white paper published in July 1988. The Dawkins reforms were targeted at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian universities. That is why I thank the member for Kingston—sometimes it does not hurt to go back and reflect on what education ministers have done. Certainly over time the greatest reforms in education were under Dawkins and many cuts were made of a substantial nature, including AbSec and changes to Abstudy which took away advantages for Indigenous Australians.


The Dawkins reforms were targeted at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian universities as well as addressing the perceived or real brain drain of talented young Australians overseas. I remind those on the other side of the chamber that the Dawkins reforms included income-contingent loans for tuition fees through the HECS, and conversion of all colleges of advanced education into universities, which was opposed by the Group of Eight universities, who argued that by doing that you were dumbing down courses. The expansion into the TAFE sector was a problem from a university perspective. It took a career pathway away from the vocational focus which universities and the TAFE sector were hooked into. Universities were to provide plans, profiles and statistics to justify courses and research. 


Further, it was noted that under the higher education reforms the number of undergraduate students increased substantially. They increased under those reforms, when we went from free education to where you had to take out a HECS loan. Education and tertiary pathways do need reform to put us into a contemporary position. That also allows students to pay back those loans. We have heard comments from my colleagues about the rate at which they will pay them back and when the fee payment kicks in. These increases in students took place in an era when universities were given an economies of scale paradigm. This was in contrast to the Whitlam government's free higher education approach. It would have been interesting to have listened to Labor members in their party and the caucus arguing against what Dawkins was putting in. If they were consistent with what they have been saying today, they would have been saying it then and they would have been defending those students who were affected. But they did not—I was around at the time and there was silence.


Tim Watts, in an article on 14 July entitled 'Future of growth, new progressive thinking', wrote of Joseph Stiglitz's recent visit to Australia:


Dawkins needed to create an education system that could produce a dramatically higher number of skilled graduates to power the Australian economy in a competitive, globalised world, while at the same time curbing the spiralling costs of the sector in a tightening fiscal environment. However, crucially, in tackling this fraught task, Dawkins embedded the values of fairness and equality of opportunity in the policy making process. 


That is no different from what Minister Pyne is doing in the reforms that he has put forward. He is putting forward a proposition that enables students from regional Australia and all around Australia to access universities and for universities to seek out those who are highly competent and highflyers who they would want in their courses. Scholarships will provide those same pathways. Again, I make the point that when I was going through I had a Commonwealth  scholarship. It gave me the opportunity to achieve an outcome.




Ms Ryan:
  Paid for by the Commonwealth?




Mr WYATT:
  It was provided by the Commonwealth. It was a good system because it enabled country kids to get into the university pathway. Dawkins certainly had some detractors but Dean Ashenden, in the Essays & Reportage section of Inside Story of 22 November 2012, wrote an interesting article headed 'Decline and fall?' (Time expired)

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:03):  It is great to have the chance to make another contribution on the toxic and unfair first Abbott government budget and in particular to take part in this very important conversation this afternoon about higher education. All of us in the break in sittings have had plenty of time back in our electorates to talk to our constituents about the things they are concerned about. I know that I have been talking to a lot of people about health concerns they have—about the $7 GP copayment. I have heard issues about pensions and the changes being made by those on the other side of the House. It is interesting that no matter who I talk to, whether it is mums, pensioners, young people or even community organisations, pretty much everyone raises a concern about what this government is trying to do with higher education. Day after day in question time the Minister for Education comes in and talks about this perverse equity argument—what about the tradespeople, what about the casual workers, who do not have higher education degrees? I can tell you that that is not how Australians think. The people we talk to in our electorates who do not have higher education do not resent paying taxes so that young people in this country can have equal opportunities. They are concerned about their kids and whether they will get the chance to go to university. They are concerned about their neighbours and their neighbours' children and whether they will have the chance to go to university.


I was lucky over the sitting break to have a wonderful visit to Monash University, near my electorate —the member for Chisholm welcomed us there and we were accompanied by the member of the Kingston, the shadow assistant minister for education. She was fantastic—what a fantastic advocate this woman is for higher education and for equal opportunities in this country. She has done a wonderful job going around the country. We had a crowd of students and a crowd of teachers, and gee we had some interesting conversations. I want to talk about one student I met, a young man named Nic—a student at Monash University. Nic comes from Horsham, and he has been lucky enough to go to Monash but he raised some concerns for me about the impact on regional students. We know that Universities Australia and other organisations have made lots of formal pronouncements about the impact on regional universities, but I found it particularly emotive talking to Nic because this is a young person who is concerned about the young people in Horsham where he come from. He wrote me an email after the event, saying:


I am also extremely concerned about the impact that deregulation … will have on rural areas like Horsham. Horsham is home to Federation University, with only 3 study areas offered … This is a small rural campus, with very little international student attendance … Under deregulation … I just cannot see how the campus can remain open …


If this campus closes, I fear that many people … in the local area would choose to not undertake higher education at all …


My final question is simple: Where are the Nationals in this debate?


It is a lot of fun for us Labor people to come in and have a red hot go at the Liberals, but you do have to ask where are the Nationals in this debate. He finishes his email by saying in respect of country people:


How can their rights be fought for when none of the Nationals local members are fighting for them in the party room and in the parliament?


I want to make some comments about the impact of these changes on Australian women, because we know that Australian women will pay much more for their degrees than men will under the new system. I do not want to go into too much detail, but we know that a female science graduate will pay about $123,000 for a science degree and still be paying off her degree when she is 40 years old. We know that about 40 per cent of women may never pay off their debts in their lifetime. The truth is that women are going to be less likely to study at prestigious universities as a result of these changes. 


If you do not believe what I am saying, can I just refer you to the basic principle of microeconomics which states that, when the price of something goes up, demand goes down. If you do not understand that, not only should you not be running the country but you should not be running a lemonade stand. We will see fewer women educated at premier universities around the country. It is a good example of where we on this side of the House see education as the great leveller of social disadvantage. This is the way that a young person who was born into a migrant family in Springvale in my electorate of Hotham can go on and become a partner in a law firm or a member of this House. But what we see with a system like the one being proposed is that, instead of it being a leveller of social disadvantage through education, it becomes an entrencher of social disadvantage. Those with the most means go to the best universities and do the best degrees, and that is the way these powers are entrenched. 


There is so much more that I could talk about, but I do want to mention Real Solutions. It is one of my favourite things to look at. When we need a bit of a laugh in this chamber, we like to bring in Real Solutions. On this serious subject, a promise was made, an ironclad commitment, that university funding would not be changed. This has been a spectacular breach of faith by the education minister; it is one of the worst that we have seen in this budget. Labor will continue to fight these changes to the hilt.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:08):  I am going to enjoy talking on this MPI because the whole premise of it seems to be based on dodgy, overblown and exaggerated figures. I think the best way to start the discussion is to quote Vicki Thomson of the Australian Technology Network of Universities:


So let me repeat what has been said a million times: the university sector is not looking to introduce standard $100,000 degrees and deregulation won't deliver them.


Those who have brainwashed some journalists and independent senators to accept that we plan to do just that deserve to be shot down.


It is not only wrong, it is shameful for the fear such myths are creating in the community.


I now turn to the chief brainwashers, who I sometimes think have done so much brainwashing they have brainwashed themselves. The Labor Party have been running a scare campaign on education like the one they ran on pensions. Just the other day we raised pensions again, as we said we would do. And now Labor are doing exactly the same thing with this issue as they did with pensions. 


What are we doing? We are expanding the demand-driven system of providing assistance to tertiary education. It means that students studying for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees will get Commonwealth government support, which equates to $371 million over three years. The people who will benefit from this amount of money are those attending universities in my electorate and at the nearby Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University. It will also help people who are attending TAFE, because we are also removing all FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loan fees. These fees are currently being imposed on people who have undertaken higher education and vocational education training loans and are on average about $1,600 a year. Over 80,000 extra students will be able to get Commonwealth government support to undertake tertiary education, and 35,000 extra students will end up with a degree or bachelor course. This is going to help people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. A lot more people will get help with alternative entry courses, which is a phenomenon we see not infrequently—in fact, we see it quite often at universities in my electorate. People start off with a diploma, move to an advanced diploma and then the next thing you know they are enrolled in a bachelor degree. This system has been designed to benefit those sorts of students. 


The other group who will benefit in is apprentices. We have trade support loans of $20,000. This is a great program and it will mean that apprentices will get assistance as well. Also, if they pay it all back, they will get a 20 per cent bonus. This is much better than the previous system, which was just a $5,000 grant and 'away you go'.


One of the previous speakers mentioned us having an ideological frolic. I would like to go through some of the ideological frolics that the Labor Party undertook in its last period of government. There was $6.6 billion in cuts to higher education. That was a Labor ideological frolic. Talk about a bull in a China shop; it was more like an elephant in a China shop: they cut almost $3 billion in one year alone. Because they were such bad financial managers, they had to cut money from somewhere to fund their ever-expanding debt. Not only that; Labor put a $2,000 cap on teachers, nurses and other professional people attending further education. Regulation and compliance costs for the university system, which they left in chaos, was $280 million a year. Not only that; they attacked the collaborative research infrastructure funding that was about to go off a cliff. We have reintroduced that. 


I would like to finish on the words of the member for Fraser, who put it so well when he said: 


A deregulated or market-based HECS will make the student contribution system fairer because the fees students pay will more closely approximate the value they receive through future earnings.

"Chalmers, Jim, MP",ALP,2014-09-23,"



Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:14):  The opposition will support the passage of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, also known as the KAFTA tariff bill, and the Customs Amendment (Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, or the KAFTA rules of origin bill. I also foreshadow that at the end of my contribution I will be moving some amendments that have been circulated in my name.


Trade reform has been one of the most significant reforms of the modern era. It has contributed to today's dynamic and competitive Australian economy; it has improved the living standards of millions of Australians; it has stimulated the growth of innovative and entrepreneurial Australian businesses; and it has created jobs. It is one of my firmest beliefs that trade, when done right, can be a powerful engine for economic and cultural advancement. There are massive benefits to freer trade when it is done right.


The McKinsey report Global flows in a digital ageshowed that the flow of goods, services and finance internationally reached $26 trillion in 2012, or 36 per cent of global GDP, which is 1½ times the level in 1990. Today, one in three goods crosses national borders, and more than one third of financial investments are international transactions. Last year, two-way trade in Australia reached an all-time high of $628 billion, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimating that one in five Australian jobs are directly linked to trade. So trade is integral to the future prosperity of Australians and to their economy.


In government, Labor pursued trade liberalisation for four decades, from the Whitlam government's across-the-board tariff cut to the Hawke and Keating governments' dismantling of protectionist barriers to the Rudd and Gillard governments' pursuit of trade agreements. We inherit from our predecessors on the Labor side a proud legacy of achievement when it comes to trade liberalisation, whether it is John Dawkins, who founded the Cairns group of agricultural exporting nations; the great, late Peter Cook, who helped conclude negotiations for the GATT Uruguay Round; Simon Crean, a friend of this place and of many people in this chamber, who negotiated free trade agreements with Chile, ASEAN and New Zealand; or Craig Emerson, my predecessor in Rankin, who signed major trade agreements with Malaysia and made progress on ambitious new pathways to progress the WTO's Doha Round. 


Consistently, Labor has championed freer trade because it is consistent with Labor principles. When it is done right, working Australians can be better off. They can access cheaper consumer goods and they have greater access to the global marketplace. Greater investment in Australia means more activity and more jobs, and trade develops stronger cultural and economic ties, and that means a more dynamic and a more resilient economy. In opposition, Labor, I am proud to say, maintains its support for trade liberalisation. 


The ideal when it comes to trade liberalisation is multilateral deals—multilateral deals that address tariff and non-tariff barriers as well as all the other components of the modern global market economy. It is true, unfortunately, that multilateral momentum has stalled in recent years. Apart from some good achievements that began with Craig Emerson and others, it is the case that the world has slowed its momentum towards multilateral agreements. That is a great shame, because the gold standard when it comes to freer trade is agreements that contain more countries rather than fewer. 


We should note that among the other negotiations that are happening right now around the world there are plurilateral trade deals as well—the TPP and others—where there is more than a bilateral arrangement in play, but they still fall short of that gold standard of multilateral deals that we want to see in the world. But we can see bilateral FTAs, like the one with Korea that we are discussing today, as stepping stones. I quote my colleague Penny Wong, who said in a speech in July:


… even if we are in the second best political world of preferential negotiations, we should seek to ensure these are used as stepping stones to multilateral agreements.


That is why Australia has seven of these types of trade agreements in place, eight under negotiation and two signed but not yet in force.


In trade, as in business, not every deal is a good deal, which means that Labor are committed to closely scrutinising the outcome of all the Abbott government's trade negotiations. When we do that, we cast a critical eye over the agreements. It is not about free trade agreements for their own sake. We look at them on a case-by-case basis. We want to give peak industry groups and other concerned actors in our economy the chance to have their say. At the end of all of that, we need to make an on-balance judgement in the national interest. As policymakers we do have the responsibility to be hard-headed and to seek an agreement which is, on balance, in the best interests of Australians, whether that be Australian businesses, Australian workers or both.


While Labor initiated negotiations on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and made really substantial progress in those negotiations during the Gillard and Rudd governments, agreement was not reached until after the 2013 election and the change of government. Labor MPs and senators have closely examined the agreement in the course of inquiries by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. I do want to take the opportunity to thank the members of those committees, one which has reported and one which I understand is about to. I want to thank them for the way they went about their task. People on all sides of politics did their best to get to the bottom of some of the issues that were concerning those who came and gave evidence. I also want to thank those groups who took the time to do that, because our understanding of this deal was greatly enhanced by the effort that people put into those submissions, by the meetings that we had and by the discussions that we had. In particular, I want to thank those who came to see me about this Korea-Australia free trade negotiation because my own understanding of some of these issues was improved by their willingness to spend time with so many of us on both sides of the House, whether in the formal committee process or outside the formal committee process.


Like many of the people who came to see us and like a number of people in some of the key sectors including agriculture, we were disappointed by some aspects of the deal that the government has delivered. Notwithstanding that disappointment, as I said before, we do believe that, on balance, the Korea -Australia Free Trade Agreement is in the national interest. For that reason, in addition to supporting the enabling legislation before the chamber, Labor supports binding treaty action that will bring the agreement into force.


Before I examine some of the concerns that we do have about the agreement, let me outline some of the reasons that we on the Labor side believe that the agreement will be, on balance, beneficial. As members would be aware, the Republic of Korea is Australia's third largest export market, our fourth largest trading partner and a growing investment partner. In agriculture, resources and services, Korea is already a significant market for our world-class exporters. Our two-way trade was valued at $30.5 billion in the last financial year alone. Under the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs will be reduced to zero on 84 per cent of exports from Australia to Korea immediately, rising to 95.7 per cent of Australian exports in 10 years time. The agreement is forecast to boost Australia's exports to Korea by $3½ billion by 2030, to boost Australia's beef exports to Korea by 59 per cent by 2030, to boost Australia's GDP by $650 million by 2030 and to create an additional 1,745 jobs in Australia in 2015.


In agriculture, this agreement covers the beef, sugar, dairy, wheat, wine and horticulture sectors. These sectors combined employ something like 200,000 workers. Another 150,000 Australians are employed in the related red meat supply chain, manufacturing, processing and transport industries. Many of these Australians live and work in rural and regional Australia or on the fringes of our major cities. They pay taxes, they send their kids to local schools, they run local footy clubs and they volunteer in local fire brigades, and we have a responsibility to look after them. These Australians, as well the businesses that employ them and the communities they sustain, deserve the opportunities that trade agreements can deliver through increased market access. Other manufacturers will also benefit.


I want to give one example to the House. Blackmores is one of Australia's leading natural healthcare companies. They will benefit from increased market access to grow their exports. This Australian company employs approximately 800 staff, most of whom are based here in Australia. It manufactures vitamins and other products in this country predominately from Australian ingredients. A Blackmores representative informed the Senate inquiry into this agreement that it would directly benefit from an 8 per cent tariff cut on its products exported to Korea. This tariff cut will have a direct impact on Blackmores' selling price, which should then deliver an increased market share, giving the company the capacity to reinvest in its business to fund further expansion, which means more jobs. Blackmores believes that the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement will translate into at least 10 per cent, and possibly 20 per cent, annual growth for the company in Korea. As a leading brand, this growth will lead the way for other Australian exporters into the Korean market.


In the services sector, Australian law firms will soon establish joint ventures in Korea and hire local lawyers. Australian accountants will soon be able to work in and invest in Korean accounting firms. Australian financial services providers will be able to supply certain financial services and a range of insurance and insurance-related services. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is just one stepping stone to trade liberalisation and more prosperity for Australia in the Asian century and beyond. It is not perfect, but on balance it is a positive step. It will not just facilitate economic exchange, it will also promote cultural exchange, enriching both our nations in the process.


But like a number of other people who have studied this issue, and like a lot of the stakeholder groups that spoke to the formal committees or to members of parliament individually, we do have our concerns about aspects of this deal. That is why I will be moving an amendment at the end of my contribution to put some words around some of those concerns. But let me try and explain them first. The first is around what is known as an investor-state dispute settlement provision. It is commonly referred to as an ISDS. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements. Labor does not support provisions that confer greater rights on foreign businesses than on domestic businesses or provisions that constrain the ability of the government to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters, and Labor will not ask this of its trading partners in future agreements that we take part in.


The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by Prime Minister Howard and his government, did not include an investor-state dispute settlement provision. Having determined in 2011 that Labor governments would not include such provisions in future trade agreements, Labor successfully negotiated our free trade agreement with Malaysia without an ISDS provision. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, finalised by this government, does, unfortunately, include one of these ISDS provisions. It says something about the nature of these provisions that the government felt the need to negotiate some related safeguards, and I will talk about those in a moment, but let me make it clear that Labor does not support the inclusion of an ISDS provision in this or any future agreement. But what we cannot do today or in the consideration of this legislation is vote down an ISDS provision. There is no such provision in the bills before us. And should these bills be defeated, the treaty will not then enter into force.


During the course of two parliamentary inquiries, informed by the written and verbal submissions of many concerned Australians, Labor has examined the impact of the ISDS included in the text of the agreement finalised by the government, as you would expect. In broad terms, the agreement carves out from its investment and ISDS provisions measures to protect human health and the environment and existing measures and space to adopt new measures in sensitive areas, including security, human health and creative arts. The agreement also provides that non-discriminatory actions to protect legitimate public welfare objectives do not constitute expropriation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that these are the most comprehensive carve outs of any trade or investment agreement to which Australia is a party which includes ISDS provisions. Members of this place will be aware that Australia is currently defending an ISDS claim relating to world-leading tobacco plain packaging legislation introduced proudly by the former Labor government. This is the only such claim involving the government of Australia. It has been made by Philip Morris Asia under a 1993 bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that safeguards in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement would prevent a similar challenge by a Korean entity to tobacco plain packaging or similar legislation.


Labor's decision to support these bills and the agreement itself should not be misunderstood as extending support to these ISDS provisions. What we have to weigh up is the cost to workers, exporters and our economy if the parliament does not pass the necessary enabling legislation before us. In blunt terms, a no to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement would cement decades of competitive disadvantage for Australia. Modelling from ABARES shows that without this agreement Australia's share of the Korean beef market would fall to 28 per cent by 2029, with one of our key competitors, the United States, the key beneficiary. But with the agreement in force, our share of the Korean beef market is forecast to rise to 43 per cent. That increase in market share means more national income. It also means, of course, more jobs in that industry. The negotiation of treaties is reserved for executive government. Governments are ultimately accountable to the people through the ballot box for their exercise of executive power. So, today Labor urges the Abbott government to rethink its decision to include an ISDS provision in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and renegotiate the agreement to excise this provision before it enters into force. Should that not happen, a future Shorten Labor government would seek to negotiate with Korea for the ISDS provisions to be removed from the agreement.


In 2010, long before the conclusion of negotiations on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Productivity Commission recommended that:


… any IP provisions that are proposed for a particular agreement should only be included after an economic assessment of the impacts, including on consumers, in Australia and partner countries.


Unfortunately, the government has not followed this sound advice. Accordingly, Labor is concerned about the inclusion of intellectual property provisions in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We share these concerns with academic and industry submitters to the two parliamentary inquiries into the agreement. And I want to take a moment to pay tribute to the work of the member for Gellibrand, a fellow class of 2013 new member on this side of the House who has genuine longstanding knowledge and interest in this area and who has played a substantial role in helping us understand some of the complexities of this part of the agreement.


The national interest analysis tabled by the government in relation to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement says this about this issue:


Consistent with Australia's existing obligations in the Australia-US and Australia-Singapore FTAs, and to fully implement its obligations under KAFTA, the Copyright Act 1968 will require amendment in due course to provide a legal incentive for online service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in preventing infringement due to the High Court's decision in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd, which found that ISPs are not liable for authorising the infringements of subscribers.


The so-called 'requirement' was questioned by witnesses before both parliamentary inquiries, and even the Attorney-General's Department described it as more of a 'risk assessment'. The government is yet to clarify this matter and has not made available exposure draft legislation or presented legislation amending the Copyright Act to the parliament. Labor urges the minister to clarify the government's position when he sums up the second reading debate. And I can confirm that Labor reserves its right to determine its position on any proposed changes to the Copyright Act, once published or introduced to the parliament, based on their policy merit or otherwise.


Labor believes that Australians should have the opportunity to fill job vacancies where they have the capacity to do the job that is required. We are concerned therefore about the government's decision to deny itself the capacity to impose labour market testing on contractual service providers from Korea under the 457 visa program. Section 457 visas allow foreign residents to work temporarily in Australia. In most cases there is a requirement for labour market testing to demonstrate local skills shortages. Many existing free trade agreements provide for movement-of-people arrangements for categories of skilled workers, including executives and senior managers, specialists as intra-corporate transferees, independent contractors, and contractual services providers. I note that in both the ASEAN-New Zealand and Malaysia Free Trade Agreements negotiated by Labor policy space was reserved for labour market testing on contractual service providers.


The government's national interest analysis on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement says:


As this chapter locks in existing arrangements, no significant change is expected in the number of skilled workers entering Australia.


During a hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, senior representatives from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection advised that they did not believe there would be any significant additional movement of people based on the provisions in the Korea agreement. Currently the number of Korean nationals in Australia on 457 visas is 2,495 primary holders and 2,575 secondary holders, and numbers of that scale do not have a significant impact on local jobs. Indeed, if some of those holders are here for business investment purposes, the impact on local jobs could even be positive.


Labor notes the assurances provided by the national interest analysis and testimony from senior officials, and we will hold the government to account on this point. We also urge the government to put in place measures to more accurately track visa entrants based on free trade agreement provisions, including exemptions from labour market testing requirements. Labor also urges the government to take seriously concerns about the non-enforceable nature of the labour standards incorporated in the agreement. I invite the minister to outline to the House how concerns about labour standards in Korea will be addressed in the framework of the agreement finalised by his government.


Recognising the inclusion of tariff reductions in the agreement—and the legislation before us—Labor urges the government to reverse its cuts to automotive industry programs and work with employers and unions to ensure Australia has a sustainable automotive components sector. Having goaded Holden to abandon manufacturing in Australia, the Abbott Government does have a particular obligation to ensure our world-class auto component industry—and the jobs and skills it sustains—does not similarly exit our shores.


Labor shares industry concern about disharmony in the application of rules of origin and the requirements around a certificate of origin versus a declaration of origin. There is serious concern from ACCI, among others, that the provisions in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement will increase, and not diminish, red tape for business. Labor urges the government to listen to business to ensure the potential of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is fully realised. Should the fears of business come to pass, Labor encourages the government to act quickly through established processes under the agreement to sort out the mess and make market access in Korea a reality for Australian exporters—small, medium and large.


As I have already said, Labor supports the bills before the House. We do support the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. For reasons I have just outlined, though, this support is not without reservation. There is a broader point at play as well about globalisation. When we are talking about freer trade and trade liberalisation, it is not just a matter of giving Australian businesses access to opportunities and creating jobs—as important as all of that is—but we do have to contemplate as a parliament, if we care about the future of this country, how we are going to teach and train our people to occupy the best parts of the global value chains in the international trading system that will increasingly characterise the future of this country and the dynamic region we find ourselves in and the global economy as a whole. When we talk about these very specific negotiations and deals, we should also think about what it means for our people—whether we can demonstrate to them the benefits, not only of jobs but opportunities of all kinds; whether we have the right higher-education system to set people up to occupy the best parts of these global value chains into the future. That is how we will make globalisation work for us, and not against us. My personal view is that we cannot be defensive when it comes to some of these sorts of agreements. We do need to think that we are good enough, confident enough, competitive enough and smart enough to grasp the opportunities of the Asian century to make sure that we do not instinctively and reflexively curl ourselves up into a ball and hope that the world does not notice us. There are tremendous opportunities in freer trade. This deal itself is, on balance, a good deal for Australia. It is not without its limitations, and I have run through those today, but, on balance, it is a good deal for Australia and it should be a stepping stone to more ambitious trade agreements—not just bilateral ones, but plurilateral and ideally multilateral—so that Australians get the best access to the best opportunities in the best region of the world. KAFTA a small step towards this, but a step towards it is nonetheless.


We do therefore support this legislation, but we must acknowledge Labor's reservations and community reservations with the final agreement. In that context, I want to conclude my contribution by moving the following motion, which has been seconded by the member for Isaacs:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House urges the Government to:


(1) seek to re-negotiate the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement to omit provisions relating to Investor State Dispute Settlement;


(2) provide clarity on proposed changes to copyright and assurance that any proposed changes as a result of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement do not create adverse impacts for intellectual property owners or users;


(3) protect Australia's right to regulate labour market entry and promote labour standards;


(4) reverse its cuts to automotive industry programs and work with employers and unions to ensure Australia has a sustainable automotive components sector; and


(5) address business concerns about complex rules of origin in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and lack of harmonisation with other preferential trade agreements.""


I thank the House.

While Labor initiated negotiations on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and made really substantial progress in those negotiations during the Gillard and Rudd governments, agreement was not reached until after the 2013 election and the change of government. Labor MPs and senators have closely examined the agreement in the course of inquiries by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. I do want to take the opportunity to thank the members of those committees, one which has reported and one which I understand is about to. I want to thank them for the way they went about their task. People on all sides of politics did their best to get to the bottom of some of the issues that were concerning those who came and gave evidence. I also want to thank those groups who took the time to do that, because our understanding of this deal was greatly enhanced by the effort that people put into those submissions, by the meetings that we had and by the discussions that we had. In particular, I want to thank those who came to see me about this Korea-Australia free trade negotiation because my own understanding of some of these issues was improved by their willingness to spend time with so many of us on both sides of the House, whether in the formal committee process or outside the formal committee process.


Like many of the people who came to see us and like a number of people in some of the key sectors including agriculture, we were disappointed by some aspects of the deal that the government has delivered. Notwithstanding that disappointment, as I said before, we do believe that, on balance, the Korea -Australia Free Trade Agreement is in the national interest. For that reason, in addition to supporting the enabling legislation before the chamber, Labor supports binding treaty action that will bring the agreement into force.


Before I examine some of the concerns that we do have about the agreement, let me outline some of the reasons that we on the Labor side believe that the agreement will be, on balance, beneficial. As members would be aware, the Republic of Korea is Australia's third largest export market, our fourth largest trading partner and a growing investment partner. In agriculture, resources and services, Korea is already a significant market for our world-class exporters. Our two-way trade was valued at $30.5 billion in the last financial year alone. Under the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs will be reduced to zero on 84 per cent of exports from Australia to Korea immediately, rising to 95.7 per cent of Australian exports in 10 years time. The agreement is forecast to boost Australia's exports to Korea by $3½ billion by 2030, to boost Australia's beef exports to Korea by 59 per cent by 2030, to boost Australia's GDP by $650 million by 2030 and to create an additional 1,745 jobs in Australia in 2015.


In agriculture, this agreement covers the beef, sugar, dairy, wheat, wine and horticulture sectors. These sectors combined employ something like 200,000 workers. Another 150,000 Australians are employed in the related red meat supply chain, manufacturing, processing and transport industries. Many of these Australians live and work in rural and regional Australia or on the fringes of our major cities. They pay taxes, they send their kids to local schools, they run local footy clubs and they volunteer in local fire brigades, and we have a responsibility to look after them. These Australians, as well the businesses that employ them and the communities they sustain, deserve the opportunities that trade agreements can deliver through increased market access. Other manufacturers will also benefit.


I want to give one example to the House. Blackmores is one of Australia's leading natural healthcare companies. They will benefit from increased market access to grow their exports. This Australian company employs approximately 800 staff, most of whom are based here in Australia. It manufactures vitamins and other products in this country predominately from Australian ingredients. A Blackmores representative informed the Senate inquiry into this agreement that it would directly benefit from an 8 per cent tariff cut on its products exported to Korea. This tariff cut will have a direct impact on Blackmores' selling price, which should then deliver an increased market share, giving the company the capacity to reinvest in its business to fund further expansion, which means more jobs. Blackmores believes that the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement will translate into at least 10 per cent, and possibly 20 per cent, annual growth for the company in Korea. As a leading brand, this growth will lead the way for other Australian exporters into the Korean market.


In the services sector, Australian law firms will soon establish joint ventures in Korea and hire local lawyers. Australian accountants will soon be able to work in and invest in Korean accounting firms. Australian financial services providers will be able to supply certain financial services and a range of insurance and insurance-related services. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is just one stepping stone to trade liberalisation and more prosperity for Australia in the Asian century and beyond. It is not perfect, but on balance it is a positive step. It will not just facilitate economic exchange, it will also promote cultural exchange, enriching both our nations in the process.


But like a number of other people who have studied this issue, and like a lot of the stakeholder groups that spoke to the formal committees or to members of parliament individually, we do have our concerns about aspects of this deal. That is why I will be moving an amendment at the end of my contribution to put some words around some of those concerns. But let me try and explain them first. The first is around what is known as an investor-state dispute settlement provision. It is commonly referred to as an ISDS. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements. Labor does not support provisions that confer greater rights on foreign businesses than on domestic businesses or provisions that constrain the ability of the government to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters, and Labor will not ask this of its trading partners in future agreements that we take part in.


The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by Prime Minister Howard and his government, did not include an investor-state dispute settlement provision. Having determined in 2011 that Labor governments would not include such provisions in future trade agreements, Labor successfully negotiated our free trade agreement with Malaysia without an ISDS provision. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, finalised by this government, does, unfortunately, include one of these ISDS provisions. It says something about the nature of these provisions that the government felt the need to negotiate some related safeguards, and I will talk about those in a moment, but let me make it clear that Labor does not support the inclusion of an ISDS provision in this or any future agreement. But what we cannot do today or in the consideration of this legislation is vote down an ISDS provision. There is no such provision in the bills before us. And should these bills be defeated, the treaty will not then enter into force.


During the course of two parliamentary inquiries, informed by the written and verbal submissions of many concerned Australians, Labor has examined the impact of the ISDS included in the text of the agreement finalised by the government, as you would expect. In broad terms, the agreement carves out from its investment and ISDS provisions measures to protect human health and the environment and existing measures and space to adopt new measures in sensitive areas, including security, human health and creative arts. The agreement also provides that non-discriminatory actions to protect legitimate public welfare objectives do not constitute expropriation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that these are the most comprehensive carve outs of any trade or investment agreement to which Australia is a party which includes ISDS provisions. Members of this place will be aware that Australia is currently defending an ISDS claim relating to world-leading tobacco plain packaging legislation introduced proudly by the former Labor government. This is the only such claim involving the government of Australia. It has been made by Philip Morris Asia under a 1993 bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that safeguards in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement would prevent a similar challenge by a Korean entity to tobacco plain packaging or similar legislation.


Labor's decision to support these bills and the agreement itself should not be misunderstood as extending support to these ISDS provisions. What we have to weigh up is the cost to workers, exporters and our economy if the parliament does not pass the necessary enabling legislation before us. In blunt terms, a no to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement would cement decades of competitive disadvantage for Australia. Modelling from ABARES shows that without this agreement Australia's share of the Korean beef market would fall to 28 per cent by 2029, with one of our key competitors, the United States, the key beneficiary. But with the agreement in force, our share of the Korean beef market is forecast to rise to 43 per cent. That increase in market share means more national income. It also means, of course, more jobs in that industry. The negotiation of treaties is reserved for executive government. Governments are ultimately accountable to the people through the ballot box for their exercise of executive power. So, today Labor urges the Abbott government to rethink its decision to include an ISDS provision in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and renegotiate the agreement to excise this provision before it enters into force. Should that not happen, a future Shorten Labor government would seek to negotiate with Korea for the ISDS provisions to be removed from the agreement.


In 2010, long before the conclusion of negotiations on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Productivity Commission recommended that:


… any IP provisions that are proposed for a particular agreement should only be included after an economic assessment of the impacts, including on consumers, in Australia and partner countries.


Unfortunately, the government has not followed this sound advice. Accordingly, Labor is concerned about the inclusion of intellectual property provisions in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We share these concerns with academic and industry submitters to the two parliamentary inquiries into the agreement. And I want to take a moment to pay tribute to the work of the member for Gellibrand, a fellow class of 2013 new member on this side of the House who has genuine longstanding knowledge and interest in this area and who has played a substantial role in helping us understand some of the complexities of this part of the agreement.


The national interest analysis tabled by the government in relation to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement says this about this issue:


Consistent with Australia's existing obligations in the Australia-US and Australia-Singapore FTAs, and to fully implement its obligations under KAFTA, the Copyright Act 1968 will require amendment in due course to provide a legal incentive for online service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in preventing infringement due to the High Court's decision in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd, which found that ISPs are not liable for authorising the infringements of subscribers.


The so-called 'requirement' was questioned by witnesses before both parliamentary inquiries, and even the Attorney-General's Department described it as more of a 'risk assessment'. The government is yet to clarify this matter and has not made available exposure draft legislation or presented legislation amending the Copyright Act to the parliament. Labor urges the minister to clarify the government's position when he sums up the second reading debate. And I can confirm that Labor reserves its right to determine its position on any proposed changes to the Copyright Act, once published or introduced to the parliament, based on their policy merit or otherwise.


Labor believes that Australians should have the opportunity to fill job vacancies where they have the capacity to do the job that is required. We are concerned therefore about the government's decision to deny itself the capacity to impose labour market testing on contractual service providers from Korea under the 457 visa program. Section 457 visas allow foreign residents to work temporarily in Australia. In most cases there is a requirement for labour market testing to demonstrate local skills shortages. Many existing free trade agreements provide for movement-of-people arrangements for categories of skilled workers, including executives and senior managers, specialists as intra-corporate transferees, independent contractors, and contractual services providers. I note that in both the ASEAN-New Zealand and Malaysia Free Trade Agreements negotiated by Labor policy space was reserved for labour market testing on contractual service providers.


The government's national interest analysis on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement says:


As this chapter locks in existing arrangements, no significant change is expected in the number of skilled workers entering Australia.


During a hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, senior representatives from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection advised that they did not believe there would be any significant additional movement of people based on the provisions in the Korea agreement. Currently the number of Korean nationals in Australia on 457 visas is 2,495 primary holders and 2,575 secondary holders, and numbers of that scale do not have a significant impact on local jobs. Indeed, if some of those holders are here for business investment purposes, the impact on local jobs could even be positive.


Labor notes the assurances provided by the national interest analysis and testimony from senior officials, and we will hold the government to account on this point. We also urge the government to put in place measures to more accurately track visa entrants based on free trade agreement provisions, including exemptions from labour market testing requirements. Labor also urges the government to take seriously concerns about the non-enforceable nature of the labour standards incorporated in the agreement. I invite the minister to outline to the House how concerns about labour standards in Korea will be addressed in the framework of the agreement finalised by his government.


Recognising the inclusion of tariff reductions in the agreement—and the legislation before us—Labor urges the government to reverse its cuts to automotive industry programs and work with employers and unions to ensure Australia has a sustainable automotive components sector. Having goaded Holden to abandon manufacturing in Australia, the Abbott Government does have a particular obligation to ensure our world-class auto component industry—and the jobs and skills it sustains—does not similarly exit our shores.


Labor shares industry concern about disharmony in the application of rules of origin and the requirements around a certificate of origin versus a declaration of origin. There is serious concern from ACCI, among others, that the provisions in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement will increase, and not diminish, red tape for business. Labor urges the government to listen to business to ensure the potential of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is fully realised. Should the fears of business come to pass, Labor encourages the government to act quickly through established processes under the agreement to sort out the mess and make market access in Korea a reality for Australian exporters—small, medium and large.


As I have already said, Labor supports the bills before the House. We do support the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. For reasons I have just outlined, though, this support is not without reservation. There is a broader point at play as well about globalisation. When we are talking about freer trade and trade liberalisation, it is not just a matter of giving Australian businesses access to opportunities and creating jobs—as important as all of that is—but we do have to contemplate as a parliament, if we care about the future of this country, how we are going to teach and train our people to occupy the best parts of the global value chains in the international trading system that will increasingly characterise the future of this country and the dynamic region we find ourselves in and the global economy as a whole. When we talk about these very specific negotiations and deals, we should also think about what it means for our people—whether we can demonstrate to them the benefits, not only of jobs but opportunities of all kinds; whether we have the right higher-education system to set people up to occupy the best parts of these global value chains into the future. That is how we will make globalisation work for us, and not against us. My personal view is that we cannot be defensive when it comes to some of these sorts of agreements. We do need to think that we are good enough, confident enough, competitive enough and smart enough to grasp the opportunities of the Asian century to make sure that we do not instinctively and reflexively curl ourselves up into a ball and hope that the world does not notice us. There are tremendous opportunities in freer trade. This deal itself is, on balance, a good deal for Australia. It is not without its limitations, and I have run through those today, but, on balance, it is a good deal for Australia and it should be a stepping stone to more ambitious trade agreements—not just bilateral ones, but plurilateral and ideally multilateral—so that Australians get the best access to the best opportunities in the best region of the world. KAFTA a small step towards this, but a step towards it is nonetheless.


We do therefore support this legislation, but we must acknowledge Labor's reservations and community reservations with the final agreement. In that context, I want to conclude my contribution by moving the following motion, which has been seconded by the member for Isaacs:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading the House urges the Government to:


(1) seek to re-negotiate the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement to omit provisions relating to Investor State Dispute Settlement;


(2) provide clarity on proposed changes to copyright and assurance that any proposed changes as a result of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement do not create adverse impacts for intellectual property owners or users;


(3) protect Australia's right to regulate labour market entry and promote labour standards;


(4) reverse its cuts to automotive industry programs and work with employers and unions to ensure Australia has a sustainable automotive components sector; and


(5) address business concerns about complex rules of origin in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and lack of harmonisation with other preferential trade agreements.""


I thank the House.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (21:00):  I rise this evening to speak on a variety of matters in the education and early childhood area. As you may be aware, my electorate of Lalor has over 10,000 families that access early childhood support and out-of-school-hours services. Most of my electorate would be classified as urban growth; however, I also represent small pockets of quite isolated rural areas. One such area is Little River. The population of Little River is around 750 people. It is served by a combined shop and service station, which, like in many small communities, doubles as a post office. It has a hotel, a kindergarten and a small primary school. 


The primary school is aptly named the Little River Primary School. It currently has 114 students from 77 families. It is ably led by Principal Pamela Heane and School Council President Gillian Caldwell. It has only in recent years been rebuilt by the state Labor government. It is a school that is providing a great education and it is a focus of the local community. Two weeks ago the school contacted me, shocked to discover that, due to a change in classification, it is now regarded as an urban city school.


This school has out-of-school-hours care that operates from seven to 8.45 am and from 3.30 to 6.30 pm Monday to Friday. Fifty-seven students from 39 families access before-school or after-school care out of the 77 families that use the school. Imagine their dismay in discovering this reclassification means the service will lose $16,000 in funding, basically making it unviable.


The ramifications for these families are very real. There are no public buses in Little River. The children who use this service would be left to walk home to an empty home in a town that has no footpaths. On one side of Little River children would need to cross a bridge with no room for pedestrians—only just enough room for passing cars. On the other side of the town they would need to cross an unmanned railway line. 


If the school were to lose their out-of-school-hours care program, they would be likely to lose approximately a third of their families. To lose this program would be crippling for Little River Primary School and for the Little River community. The reality is that if parents in this community cannot access out-of-school-hours care, they may be forced to change schools, to have their children attend a school closer to where they work, out of their local area. This could leave the school less viable and the downward cycle of local service access would begin.


This is not a service at the edges. There is no alternative for these families. There is no neighbouring school to combine with. There is no private provider. This is a vital service that has been supported to date by the Commonwealth government. This seems a short-sighted decision. I call on the government to reverse it for Little River Primary School and for other schools similarly affected.


I would also like to speak on other matters around education and early childhood. I mention the impact of the cuts to kindergarten funding, dropping the guaranteed 15 hours of kindergarten and the huge effect this will have on our community. The minister may think this has gone away because of the promised announcement for 2015, but she is very wrong if she believes that. In my community, with high numbers of low-SES households and high numbers of families from non-English-speaking backgrounds, approximately only 80 per cent of children are enrolled in kindergarten. With a potential increase in fees, the number of children not attending kindergarten would only grow. Those children who would benefit the most would be the most likely to not access the important early education programs they need. The minister needs to know that this will not go away in our community, that the community are campaigning and will continue to campaign until that 15 hours is guaranteed beyond 2015. 


Further, my community has the highest number of registered family day care services in Australia. There are 44 services in Lalor that are set to lose funding due to the cuts to family day care funding. I would implore the minister to relook at these two issues and to think of the people of Lalor while she does.
