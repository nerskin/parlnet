Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (10:04):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled Maintaining Australia's national interests in Antarctica: inquiry into Australia's Antarctic Territory together with the minutes of proceedings.


It is with great pleasure that I rise today to speak about the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories inquiry report into Australia's Antarctic territory. Australians were some of the earliest explorers on the Antarctic continent, with our nation's involvement beginning in the late 1800s and continuing to the present day. Some of Australia's earliest Antarctic scientists, including Douglas Mawson, are synonymous with Australia's exploration of the continent.


Mawson station was opened in 1954 and became Australia's first permanent scientific research presence in Antarctica. The Australian Antarctic Program positions our nation amongst the world's most significant contributors on this continent. Australia's Antarctic territory covers 42 per cent of the entire Antarctic continent, with Australia maintaining three permanent research stations, as well as a seasonal aerodrome, to support our extensive research and national interests. Australia is an original signatory to the Antarctic treaty and is recognised as an Antarctic leader. However, Australia's claim is only officially recognised by four nations—the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway.


In recent years, Australia's Antarctic territory has seen growing activity from other nations, including the establishment of Russian, Chinese, French and Italian facilities. These nations continue to invest strongly in their Antarctic infrastructure. Australia is also investing in its Antarctic infrastructure, securing our future contributions to Antarctic research and maintaining our role as a leader in Antarctic affairs. The committee recognises that continued involvement and investment in Antarctica is necessary for supporting Australia's national interests and continued leadership in Antarctica. Failure to invest will have significant negative effects on Australia's standing in Antarctica and our leadership role that we play.


Recently, the government has announced important investments in infrastructure that will significantly enhance Australia's scientific capabilities and capacity. In May, the government announced it would proceed with a paved runway to provide year-round access to the Davis research station. This is consistent with the committee's recommendation and demonstrates Australia's commitment to protect its long-term interests in Antarctica.


Australia is also investing in a new Antarctic ice breaker, which is due to arrive in Hobart in 2020. These investments will provide a more modern and efficient basis upon which Australia's international reputation in Antarctic science can continue to grow. In particular, these investments will provide improved capacity for international engagement and opportunities for Australia's Antarctic scientists to collaborate with their colleagues from other nations.


Another key opportunity identified in this report is the continued development of Hobart as an Antarctic hub, as a well-situated capital to capitalise on Australia's renewed Antarctic focus. A number of initiatives, including enhancements to aviation capability at Hobart airport, a proposed Antarctic science hub and a potential development of Antarctic tourism, are valuable opportunities for Hobart and for Tasmania. The city's expanding Antarctic potential may also see increased engagement with other international Antarctic programs.


The committee's inquiry, launched in June 2017, received well-informed contributions from key stakeholders in Australia's Antarctic sector, including from a number of Commonwealth and Tasmanian government agencies, the Antarctic science community, academics and those developing infrastructure and other support services in Tasmania to meet the needs of the growing Antarctic sector. Members of the committee spent time in both Hobart and in Antarctica inspecting some of the key facilities of Australia's Antarctic operations. These visits provided the opportunity for the committee to better understand future investment and science investment needs.


The committee's report considers four key themes—Australia's leadership in governance with respect to Antarctic; the infrastructure and logistical support required to support the success of the Australian Antarctic Program; Australia's world-class research in Antarctic science; and the economic benefits, particularly for Tasmania, that can result from Australia's engagement in the continent. The report's 22 recommendations provide the government with an opportunity to strengthen its work with respect to Antarctica and build on already impressive foundations. In particular, the committee has recommended that the government consider the appointment of an Antarctic ambassador, that Australia's formal inspections under the Antarctic Treaty System be increased and that the government capitalise on developments in the city of Hobart for the collocation of relevant Antarctic institutions.


I would like to thank the many contributors to the committee's inquiry, including those who made submissions and gave evidence at public hearings. I would like in particular to thank the staff of the Australian Antarctic Division in Hobart for their commitment to the Australian Antarctic Program and express the committee's appreciation for the open and professional manner in which they engaged with this inquiry. Thank you, finally, to my committee colleagues for their engagement with this inquiry and to the secretariat, led by Peggy, Muz and Stephanie. I look forward to Australia's growing contributions to Antarctica over the coming years.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:09):  As deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the report from the inquiry into Australia's Antarctic territory. Australia has a long and proud history of involvement in Antarctica, having significantly contributed to shaping the region both through the Antarctic Treaty System and on the ground. Australia's continued presence on the continent through science and infrastructure has enabled Australia to contribute to world-class research, to shape Antarctic governance and to protect our sovereignty and national interests in the region.


The Australian Antarctic strategy and 20-year action plan, released in 2014, committed Australia to building and maintaining strong and effective relationships with other nations subject to the Antarctic Treaty System. While the plan outlined an ambitious vision for Australia, what it lacked was that it needed to draw a thread between the strategic importance of Antarctica to Australia's foreign policy and who would take the lead on that body of work. As my colleague the member for Tangney has noted, the committee's report recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade appoint an Antarctic ambassador to help further Australia's interest in Antarctica internationally. There is a precedent for appointing an ambassador to policy areas of strategic or international importance, or both. We have had ambassadors for the environment. We have had ambassadors in a range of different areas. Australia has appointed a cyberambassador who works to identify opportunities for practical international cooperation to ensure Australia has a coordinated, consistent and influential voice on international cyberissues. Given these precedents, the Antarctic ambassador's role will be more than symbolic; it will have an important job. It is a strategic appointment, just like the appointment of the cyberambassador, to promote Australia's Antarctic interests and capabilities on the international stage; it is focused entirely on doing that.


The number of nations showing an interest in Antarctica is increasing. This may lead to pressure in the future to change the established norms in the region to allow access to Antarctic mineral resources, which is currently banned under the treaty. As the political and strategic dynamics of Antarctica change over time, Australia will need strong leadership to ensure the treaty remains the best framework in the region. We need to send a strong message through strong leadership, and that can be demonstrated to our international partners by appointing an Antarctic ambassador. The Antarctic ambassador would be based in the Department of Foreign Affairs, in the same way as the cyberambassador, and lead a team whose focus is on the strategic importance of Antarctica to Australia. Another recommendation in the report  is that an office of Antarctic services be created. The Antarctic ambassador, through the office of Antarctic services, would be responsible for promoting Australian scientific research on the international stage and promoting Hobart as Australia's science hub and gateway to Antarctica.


The committee's report also recommended supporting the work of Australia's Antarctic science community by assessing how Australia can retain and further develop its Antarctic science workforce. And they are a phenomenal workforce. Anyone who's had anything to do with the Antarctic Division, or had the wonderful privilege of going down there, has had firsthand experience of the expertise that we have in the science community in Antarctica. Another recommendation of the report was considering how the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre can continue operations beyond June 2019 and implementing a whole-of-government data management strategy.


Throughout the inquiry, and particularly during the visit to Hobart and Antarctica, I was impressed by the dedication and sense of pride that Australia's Antarctic community has for the work they are doing. They are incredibly proud of the work they do in terms of research, particularly on krill, which is absolutely world leading. The work they do on ice cores is also world leading. People come from Europe, America, Africa and Asia to see the work that's being done on krill and ice cores, as well as the other work being done by the Antarctic Division.


I want to thank all the contributors to the committee's inquiry, including those who made submissions, gave evidence at public hearings and provided the committee with private briefings. In particular, I'd like to give my thanks to the staff of the Australian Antarctic Division for their dedication and commitment to the Australian Antarctic Program, and I want to express the committee's appreciation for their assistance with this inquiry.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (10:15):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I indicate to the House that I have allocated 50 per cent of my time to the member for Richmond, who will be supporting and seconding the bill.


Community concern about the live trade sector is not new.


Parliamentary reports responding to real and alleged breaches of animal welfare standards date back at least to the early 1980s.


In recent years the drumbeat has grown louder. In the 21st century, people have so much access to information. Undesirable events have never before been so easy to record and distribute. It is more difficult than ever before for those doing the wrong thing to hide breaches of animal welfare standards.


In 2011, an ABC Four Corners program screened terrible acts of animal cruelty in Indonesian abattoirs. The weight of community reaction left the then government with little choice but to suspend the live cattle trade until practices in those abattoirs could be changed and modernised.


It was an extraordinarily difficult time for producers and exporters alike. But what grew from it was the Export Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS), an internationally recognised animal welfare assurance guarantee.


It is doubtful the industry would ever have accepted ESCAS if it had not been for the suspension of the trade. There were those who argued the regulation and enforcement of animal welfare standards in other countries was not possible.


But ESCAS has been a great success story and a proud Labor achievement.


ESCAS has placed the live cattle trade on a sustainable footing. The sector continues to earn significant export income, create thousands of jobs along the supply chain, create price competition for cattle producers, and provide a market for those northern producers unable to grow cattle to slaughter weight.


The work of the former Labor government persuaded the live export sector of the need to build and maintain a social licence. That is, community support for the industry, its methods and behaviour.


Despite the success of ESCAS and associated efforts, by 2013 it became clear to me that more would need to be done to maintain community support and guarantee compliance with mandated animal welfare standards.


Further incidents in the trade had given weight to claims the regulator was not sufficiently independent and had become captured by the industry.


That's why in July 2013, a Labor government announced the appointment of an independent Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. As minister at the time, I made an interim appointment pending enabling legislation.


Sadly, an election soon followed and the new coalition government chose to let the position lapse. It was a most regrettable decision and one driven entirely by political opportunism.


There can be no doubt the decision to abolish the inspector-general has cost the live export industry dearly. It sent a clear message to the industry that the new government would be more tolerant of animal abuse. That it saw no need for a further strengthening of the regulatory system.


The situation was exacerbated by the antics of then Minister Joyce, who encouraged and nurtured the wrong culture within both the industry and the regulator. A culture which in turn promoted a cavalier approach to animal welfare matters.


If the independent oversight of the regulator had continued, we may never have heard of the Awassi Express, and the live sheep sector may have had a future.


In introducing this private member's bill, I make an appeal to all members to back the re-establishment of an independent statutory officer to watch over the regulation of the live export sector.


His or her role will be to ensure correct animal welfare standards are maintained and when there is an alleged breach, the regulator fully and properly investigates the matter, comes to right conclusions and imposes appropriate sanctions.


There can be no argument against the re-establishment of the Inspector-General for Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports.


Arguments it will result in more red tape for farmers are just silly and mischievous.


The inspector-general will have no reason to interact with producers in the red meat sector.


This proposition now enjoys, it's worth noting, the support of the live export industry. It now just needs the support of this parliament. A sustainably profitable agriculture sector needs a strong and sustainable animal welfare assurance system, and I commend the bill to the House.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (10:20):  I second the motion, and I am pleased to speak on this private member's bill proposed by the shadow minister for agriculture, which will establish an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. The Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports Bill 2018 creates an independent statutory officer who will have oversight of the Commonwealth regulator in animal welfare matters.


In government in 2013, Labor appointed an interim Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. Unfortunately, the then new coalition government did not proceed with the legislation necessary to make the position permanent. That was the wrong decision, which has proven to be devastating for animal protection. The Turnbull government has, shamefully, been consistent in its opposition to the appointment of an inspector-general. Like the Inspector-General of Biosecurity, an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports will deliver the robust regulatory oversight which the community is demanding and that the Productivity Commission has backed. These actions are needed, along with a suite of measures.


We've made it clear that a Shorten Labor government will, at the first opportunity, put an end to the northern summer live sheep trade. The evidence on this is very clear, and the community sentiment is very clear too. The northern summer live sheep trade is just not possible, because it is cruel and it is extremely harmful for those animals.


We've stated that, during the necessary transition period, we'll put regulations in place that will ensure the highest standards, proper oversight and appropriate sanctions for breaches, including the establishment of the inspector-general as an independent statutory position. The inspector-general will be responsible for advising on the protection of animals in all Commonwealth-regulated activities and will report directly to the minister on issues like live animal exports, animal welfare standards and other required guidelines.


The inspector will also work with the states and territories to establish an independent office of animal welfare to oversee animal protection and welfare activities nationally. This re-establishment of state and territory cooperation on animal welfare matters—abolished by the Abbott-Turnbull government—will ensure a consistent national approach and continuous monitoring.


In government, Labor will conduct a thorough review of the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System to ensure that it works as effectively and efficiently as possible. This plays a very critical role in reassuring Australia's agricultural producers, their customers and the broader community that animal welfare is being protected at every stage.


Overall, in government, Labor will provide more transparency and accountability around the live export trade. For a long time, Labor has been calling for these changes—as have many in the community. Like everyone in this House, I have received thousands of items of correspondence over the years about the live export trade. This is an issue that the other side just cannot ignore.


It took the horrifying Awassi Express incident to get any response at all from the Turnbull government—a response that did nothing to fix the systemic issues with the long-haul sheep trade, because this is a government beset by party division, whose own members threaten to cross the floor on this issue. They've now withdrawn even their very small, token measures. It's clear the Prime Minister is not willing to deal with the abuses that have occurred on his watch. This is a truly heartless approach, and it is a stain on Australia's reputation as a world-class food exporter of clean green food of the highest quality.


The long-haul sheep trade has been in decline for two decades. It has been consistently mired in criticism, reviews and suspensions. The Awassi Express incident has made it blatantly clear: the regulation isn't working. The current system is cruel. You simply cannot pack 50,000 or 60,000 sheep onto a boat for four weeks and then sail them through some of the hottest and most humid climates in the world and expect animal welfare expectations to be upheld. That is the reality.


Labor's proposed five-year transition period will give the industry time to adjust to the changes. It'll be a transition to something better. In contrast to all of that, all we see from the Turnbull government is inaction. In fact, they failed to even list their bill to increase penalties for breaches of the animal welfare standards in the live animal sector. The government has withdrawn the Export Legislation Amendment (Live-stock) Bill 2018 in this sitting week, and they did that following our announcement to move amendments to the bill which, if successful, would have put an immediate stop to the Northern Hemisphere summer live sheep trade and phased out the trade within five years. Yet the government has withdrawn that.


Following the McCarthy review, the government did spruik the fact there were going to be increased penalties as a key response to ongoing breaches of animal welfare standards, yet they have done nothing—just those token efforts—and they've now withdrawn the bill. But Labor stands ready. We stand ready to support increased penalties. We have made that very clear. But what is also very clear is that the evidence is clear. The science is clear and the community sentiment is overwhelmingly clear time and time again: the northern summer live sheep trade must end. And Labor has made that very clear.


The community wants action on this matter. It's time the government started listening to the community and the concerns that they have, and I call on them to support this private members' bill. Currently, the system is cruel. It is unfair, and the government members must listen and support this private members' bill.


Debate adjourned.

Mr HART
 (Bass) (10:36):  by leave—On behalf of the member for Franklin, I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) there are almost 300 older Australians who have waited more than two years for their approved home care package, without any care;


(b) a further 636 older Australians have waited more than a year for care and they currently have no care at all and there are thousands more getting less care than they need;


(c) the latest waiting list for home care packages indicates that more than 100,000 older Australians are waiting for the package they have been approved for; and


(d) the latest figures show that the waiting list grew by more than 20,000 between 1 July and December 2017 and it is likely to continue growing without funding for the release of more packages;


(2) recognises the Government's response in its budget of 14,000 home care packages is woefully inadequate;


(3) condemns the Government for the aged care crisis it has made on its watch; and


(4) calls on the Government to immediately invest in fixing the home care package waiting list and properly address this growing crisis.


I rise today to support the motion moved by the member for Franklin, and I join her in condemning the government for the aged-care crisis that it has created on its watch. Older Australians are languishing in limbo, waiting for approved home care packages—packages which should be assessed according to their needs.


The figures are disturbing as to what they reveal. Almost 300 older Australians have waited for more than two years for their approved package. A further 636 older Australians have waited for more than one year for care. More than 100,000 older Australians are waiting for the packages that they have been approved for, even if their needs are greater. The last package of data revealed that almost 105,000 older Australians were waiting for a home care package, with the average wait time for a high-level package blowing out to more than a year. The situation may be worse than this, but the minister's department has delayed releasing important data on the numbers waiting for home care packages.


Each person waiting for a home care package is a person who is not able to receive the support they need or deserve. Not only are thousands left without desperately needed care; they and their families are placed under pressure trying to ensure that their loved ones have acceptable care, whilst simultaneously attempting to navigate a complicated, dysfunctional system. There are other flow-on effects as a result of this crisis. Older Australians who should have otherwise had access to a home care package are instead forced to visit emergency rooms in our public hospitals, having a real impact upon health departments and budgets at a state level. There is also the potential for overburdening residential care with residents that should and could be otherwise managed at home with a home care package under policies which are designed to ensure that people stay longer at home in familiar environments, close to loved ones and with the care that they need.


We've seen in the recent federal budget the government's purported response to the home care crisis. Indeed, whilst heralding a very good budget for health, and for aged care in particular, the Minister for Health and this minister, the Minister for Aged Care, have both misrepresented this government's commitment to solving the aged-care crisis. That commitment is illusory and inadequate. Their commitment of 14,000 home care packages is woefully inadequate in the face of the thousands waiting for approved packages and thousands more on waiting lists. Indeed, this is nothing but a cruel hoax for older Australians—slashing residential care to try and fix the home care crisis whilst making a mess of both residential care and home care packages. This Liberal government is robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it won't even come close to meeting the demand for home care, when the waiting list grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017 alone. The situation can and will get worse without further attention.


Australians who need home care assistance will be forced to look at residential care if they are unable to look after themselves in their home environment. But they will find, because of this government's refusal to provide additional real funding, that residential care will be difficult to find. We are faced with the real prospect of an emerging generation of elderly people who want to remain at home, safe in a familiar environment, but are unable to safely enjoy that home environment without a home care package. There are real risks of accidents, including dangerous falls, and a risk that domestic activities that should be possible with a small amount of home care assistance will be more difficult, leading to greater stress and anxiety—stress and anxiety which should be avoided by providing funding for more home care packages.


I indicated earlier that the system is chronically underfunded, complex and dysfunctional. One constituent of mine despairs at the state of the My Aged Care website, saying that it should be a research tool for older Australians, not an advertising platform for providers. In fact, this constituent pointed out to me that, despite the fact that she lives in a seaside village in north-east Tasmania and finally received an aged-care package after an extended wait, the My Aged Care website reports that she has in excess of 80 service providers available to her, people that purportedly may provide home care services to her—more service providers than are available to a potential consumer in Hobart or indeed Canberra. The reality, however, is that there are few providers available to her, despite what the My Aged Care website reports. (Time expired)

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck—Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (10:42):  I thank the member for Grayndler for seconding the motion. Every year, the coalition government's aged-care funding is up. Home care packages are up and residential places are up. Under Labor's Living Longer Living Better reforms, the ratios set for the release of home care packages were inadequate and severely underestimated the real demand. It's always interesting, when you look at a population pyramid, to look at where the pressure points are within that pyramid. Certainly if Labor had done their work once the Living Longer Living Better legislation had been brought in then we wouldn't have the mess that they've left.


It is not a system of dysfunction, as those on the other side continually claim. Our reforms uncovered the extent of the problem left by the former Labor government, which the Turnbull government is working to fix. We inherited a home care system with ratios that were absolutely inadequate and a supply of packages that was vastly insufficient for real demand. Instead of investing in care for our older Australians, Labor ripped money out of aged care to prop up their budget bottom line. In 2010-11, a Labor government ripped $9 million from residential aged care and failed to reinvest every dollar—a $9 million cut, and the source is the budget papers. In 2011-12, Labor ripped over $200 million out of residential aged care, and, in 2012-13, there was another cut of $135 million. But what's not reflected is the amount that was handed back to consolidated revenue because the packages weren't taken up.


Unlike Labor, this government is making record investments in aged cared, delivering around $5 billion in funding boosts in the forward years. When I look back on the establishment of the Living Longer Living Better legislation, there was bipartisan support but insufficient planning for the level of resourcing needed to meet the needs of older Australians. In delivering better access to care, home care packages will rise from 87,000 to 151,000 with the rollout of an additional 14,000 high-level packages—real packages, real money. There will be $40 million to support aged-care providers in regional, rural and remote Australia for building and maintenance works—real money. There will be $105 million to improve access to culturally safe aged-care services in remote Indigenous communities. There will be 14,000 residential beds and short-term restorative care places made available, and that process is rolling out. Plus, there will be a $60 million capital investment to improve the facilities and provide the infrastructure required. And there will be investment in an additional viability supplement for regional and remote providers.


The second tranche is delivering better quality of care. There will be a new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. There will be $32.6 million for intensified risk profiling and compliance management to reduce the impact on senior Australians within aged care. There will be $50 million for residential aged-care providers to transition to the new quality standards. With Better Ageing, we're providing over $100 million to enhance mental health services for older Australians. There will be $22.9 million in grant programs to encourage increased physical activity in older Australians to enable their bodies to be mobile and resilient, have good muscle tone and also have musculoskeletal support.


When people talk about the list, they forget that it is a range of packages. Previously, people applying for a place within residential care would list their names with a number of providers. That has been the history in the provision of packages and places. Often, people didn't hear back. What we provide is an increase in the number of places that senior Australians will access, but they're supported by the Commonwealth Home Support Program—1.3 million Australians. On that list of 104,000, 51 per cent are in receipt of a range of services that wrap around and meet their needs. What we're not going to do is sit and wait and listen to the criticisms that come from the other side. The $5.5 billion allocated over the forward years is real money for programs that are designed to keep Australians healthy in the first instance and to provide the packages of choice so that people can either live within their home or in a residential aged-care facility—or some have moved into retirement villages, where they live out their years enjoying both the support of the packages and the services that are needed.

Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (10:47):  The hoax perpetrated on older Australians by the Turnbull government in this year's budget is shameful. The 14,000 additional home care packages over three years announced in the budget does not come close to meeting the growing demand. What's worse is that the money taken to fund these home care packages has come from residential care funding as there is no more money in the budget for aged care—not a single dollar. We have over 100,000 older Australians waiting for home care. We have a waiting list that grew by 20,000 in six months. And what was the government's response? It was 14,000 packages to be released over three years.


I was first touched by this as a young pharmacist, when I visited a psychiatric aged-care facility. I walked in, was struck by the misery and had to walk out and walk back in again. Improvements have been made in my 20 years working with residential aged care as a pharmacist, but much more needs to be done. How does the Turnbull government think these families are going to manage while they wait—in some cases for a year and, in 300 cases, more than two years—for the support they urgently need? This leaves vulnerable people at risk. These are people like my late father, who lived with young onset dementia. He was at risk of falls, at risk of poor nutrition, at risk of missed medication—and, as a pharmacist, that particularly bothers me—at risk of missed medical appointments and at risk of loneliness and isolation. These risks are avoidable; if only the government would help families as they juggle the needs of their partner, mother, father, brother, sister or friend while trying to keep up with work or study or family or to just get by.


Then there are those older Australians who have no support at all, and there are many in our community on the Central Coast. On the Central Coast of New South Wales, we are an older population. One in five of us is aged over 65 and one in six of us, or 19,000 people, are employed in health care and social assistance. It's the biggest employer on the coast. It's where I worked for 10 years as a pharmacist in Wyong Hospital. Aged care matters on the Central Coast. I have previously told this House that on the Central Coast we have 750 people waiting for home care packages. That's people and families in urgent need and waiting right now. About two-thirds of those waiting have high needs. Many are living with dementia. Many need palliative care. Older people, people with high needs, people with dementia and their families cannot wait a year or two or more for the help that they need. They need it right now. Where is the urgency from the minister to address this crisis in communities?


Last week I spoke at a forum on the Central Coast organised by the Health Services Union, my union, called 'Our Turn To Care'. About 100 people rallied at the Central Coast Leagues Club to call for proper funding for aged-care services and better pay and conditions for the aged-care workers who care for them. We heard stories from aged-care workers that were just shocking—for example, that they had been told to wait until a person's incontinence pad was 70 per cent wet before it could be changed; that they were only allowed one pair of gloves per shift because a second pair would be too costly; and that the money spent on food per person per day in an aged-care facility is sometimes just $6.


Later in the week I attended an event at the Erina shopping centre called 'Celebrating Ageing Central Coast—valuing your wisdom, experience and knowledge' with the member for Robertson, Lucy Wicks, who is in the chamber. It was organised by the NSW Elder Abuse Helpline & Resource Unit to celebrate ageing but also to put a spotlight on the important issue of elder abuse. I have seen the most severe forms of elder abuse while working in mental health inpatient units. The World Health Organization reports that one in 10 older people experience elder abuse and most of it is perpetrated by family members. Elder abuse is real and, sadly, it happens in our communities. Sometimes it's obvious—a grandparent being pushed into residential care so their family home can be sold—and sometimes it is invisible to others until a bank account dwindles and there's no money left to buy food or pay the electricity bill. As I mentioned, as a pharmacist at Wyong Hospital, I worked in the inpatient mental health units for 10 years and saw the most severe forms of elder abuse against older people living with major mental illness and against the parents of adult children with major mental illness. There are legal protections in place but we must do more.


Older Australians deserve quality care, dignity and respect. They are our mums and our dads. They are our grandmas and our grandpas. The Turnbull government must fix the home care crisis now. It is urgent. Older Australians and their families can't wait any longer. The government must come clean with the Australian people on the hoax it has perpetrated. There is no new money for aged care in this budget. Money for home care will come from residential care and services will inevitably be cut. The Turnbull government stands condemned for the aged-care crisis of its making. It must act now. It must act with urgency. It must act with compassion. It has to help people in need now.

"Wicks, Lucy, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (10:52):  I welcome the opportunity to speak very briefly on this most important issue that the member for Franklin has raised, but I will not be supporting the motion, because the reality is that this government is delivering a record investment in aged care, supporting older Australians with more choice and delivering better access to quality care, particularly in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, where we have a growing ageing population and where aged care is absolutely a priority for this government. Our record on this issue speaks for itself. Since the election of the coalition government, aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year.


Our 2018-19 budget, which was handed down last month, outlined our plan for a stronger economy and it outlined our plan to ensure that older Australians are supported. For the more than 30,000 older Australians in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, we have outlined a strong plan to be able to deliver real support for the older Australians who have given so much to our community and to our nation and who have really helped over their lifetimes, individually and as a group, to help make the Central Coast the very best region in the very best country in the world. We outlined that we're delivering an additional 20,000 home care packages, 13,500 residential places and the largest ever single increase to mental health funding for older Australians. Under the coalition's comprehensive and fully-funded aged-care plan, the number of high-level home care packages will actually rise by 86 per cent to 74,000 over the next five years. Over the last couple of weeks I have been visiting a number of places around the Central Coast and speaking with senior Australians and aged-care service providers. I have heard very comprehensively how these increases, and what we are doing to help our senior Australians, are very much welcomed on the Central Coast. For the more than 30,000 older Australians in my electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, we have outlined our plan and we are delivering real support for them.


The member for Franklin spoke about the wait times for aged-care packages. But let's not forget that under Labor the waiting list was actually hidden from public view. Under Labor, we didn't even know how many older Australians were on the waiting list. In February 2017, it was actually this government that introduced measures to help make the list more transparent and totally visible for the first time. In relation to older Australians who are waiting in the queue, almost half are already receiving interim care, which is good; and a majority of older Australians on this list receive support services through our record investment in the Commonwealth Home Support Program, which includes vital services such as Meals on Wheels.


In closing, I wish to underline an important fact: this government is focused on guaranteeing the essential services for older Australians to ensure they have more choice—whether that be in aged care, in staying home longer or in having access to the support they need.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (10:56):  I rise today to put on record my comments in relation to the member for Franklin's motion. I've said it here before and I'll say it again: we cannot trust the Turnbull government to deliver a pizza, let alone meaningful action for the more than 100,000 older Australians who are waiting for home care packages. You only have to look at this out-of-touch government's budget handed down last month to see that those opposite will never truly understand how to put the best interests of older Australians front and centre. Axing the energy supplement and making Australians work until they're 70 are a couple of the things on their hit list. This government has not allocated a single extra dollar for Australia's aged-care system in this year's budget. More than 14,000 age pensioners live in my electorate of Lindsay, and they deserve better than what this government is serving up. It is an absolute disgrace that the average wait time for high-level home-care packages will soar this year. It is an absolute disgrace that this government wants to take $550 a year from pensioners through their energy supplements. The Turnbull government has legislation coming through that will see older Australians having to work until they are 70 before they can get the age pension. It is an absolute disgrace that this government wants to take $1.3 billion from pensioners through concessions that help them with important things like dealing with the continuously rising costs of living—that will be going—while it gives $80 billion in corporate tax breaks to those who need it least.


This government is waging a war on older Australians. The shambles in access to aged-care home packages is symptomatic of this government's out-of-touch and problematic approach to our most vulnerable Australians. This government thinks that 3½ thousand places a year to deal with the increasing demand is enough. The government thinks that funding just 14,000 aged-care packages is enough to deal with a backlog that has already climbed to 200,000 in just six months. We are facing an aged-care crisis, and the Turnbull government can no longer ignore the problem by looking the other way. Older Australians deserve to be cared for and invested in. We need to do everything we can to ensure they are supported in the later years of their lives. Older Australians are some of the most vulnerable members of our communities and they cannot afford this government's inaction on the matter.


I call on the Minister for Aged Care to release the latest round of data on the wait list for home care packages and to be honest with us all and what we are really dealing with. We have already waited a fortnight, and older Australians have already waited that time as well. Frankly, we are sick of waiting. The government needs to be held to account and answer why there have been billions of dollars in funding cuts to the aged-care instrument and funding cuts to residential aged care. The government needs to be held to account for its blatant dishonesty by claiming to champion aged care and then turning around and defunding it. Not only did the government's budget not add up and underdeliver but it was also extremely dishonest and underhanded. The aged-care minister couldn't even guarantee older Australians that their circumstances would improve or that their voices are heard, stating:


It'll be the status quo for a short period of time and then we'll start to look at a range of other interventions that will reduce that list.


I ask him: when will that occur? The aged-care minister has simply resigned both himself and older Australians who are depending on home care packages to accept the status quo and vague promises of interventions, which the government has refused to outline thus far. The Turnbull-Abbott government, or the Turnbull government, or whoever is running the show on the other side these days, has slashed and has continued to cut billions of dollars from aged care and is responsible for the growing waiting lists for in-home care. How can this government justify funding $80 billion in tax cuts for the big end of town, including $17 billion for the big-bank fat cats, while stripping funding away from some of our most vulnerable Australians?


The aged-care budget—and we've analysed it—will hurt older Australians. The government has created the aged-care crisis, has continued to ignore the aged-care crisis and is putting our oldest Australians at risk. If the government fails to act, we will see not only the material impact on older Australians but also the mental impact on older Australians from the stress and anxiety that the government created with its failure to fix the crisis of its own making. The government has a proven track record of cutting funding and underinvesting in aged care. Only a Labor government will fight to make sure that older Australians get their fair share. Labor will give older Australians a fair go and will make sure they are supported and looked after in their later years. The Turnbull government needs to act and act now. It can no longer stick its head in the sand and ignore the aged-care crisis of their own making.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (11:02):  There is nothing more concrete than the fact that each one of us adds a birthday number on the anniversary of our arrival on this planet. The recent issue of 50 Somethingquoted a point articulated by the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce: 'How we care for our ageing is a reflection of who we are as a nation.' Ageing is changing. Our attitudes to growing older are more about doing it gracefully with friends, with activities and with good-quality support, not just having a system of putting people in an institution and making sure they're comfortable. Aged care in our regions has always been a bit of a problem and we'll be addressing that. I wonder sometimes if some speakers have been to an aged-care facility, because the problems that exist now didn't happen overnight; they've been developing for years and years and years, and we are addressing it.


We're putting in an extra 14,000 new home care packages. Our funding is growing from $18 billion in 2017-18 to $23 billion in 2021-22. That's an additional $86 billion—not less, not reduced but additional. We're delivering an additional 20,000 high-level home care packages—that's in total—plus 13,500 residential places. That is the largest ever single increase to mental health funding for older Australians, which, as we all know, is becoming a much more significant problem. Over the next four years, aged-care funding is up, the number of home care packages is up and the number of residential aged-care places is up, particularly in regional areas.


My concern has been about how we get the priority listing for people to get into an aged-care place. The aged-care approval round announced recently by the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, and our aged-care minister, Ken Wyatt, was really welcome. They're going to get those places and will get an additional 775 respite places. There's an additional $5 billion budget boost for aged care. We'll be getting applications for this special process after 2 July. That is fantastic news for the regions and will help to accelerate the process. We absolutely need to have everybody included in this process.


One of my aged-care facilities recently said that part of the problem for them is that the assessment sometimes needs to be done online, so we need a process—and some of my aged-care providers are already doing this—to assist clients to go online, go through the process and help them work out what their aged-care level and needs are. In the beginning some people might say, 'I can do that,' but in fact it is somebody else who helps them get dressed or prepares their Meals on Wheels food. They need a level of care that's a little higher. But, because we're Aussies, we like to be independent. We don't always say, 'I need this, this and this'. We like to be independent. Our scheme is to try and keep them as independent as possible but make sure we're addressing the fact that there are hidden needs—needs that have been hidden because we've been so strong.


In the past we had 'Mediscare', then 'wages scare', and now we're getting 'bed-care scare'. In Labor's 2010 budget, they ripped $9 million out of aged care and booked the savings. In the 2011-12 budget, they ripped another $211.7 million out of aged care. In 2012-13, Labor cut residential care places. We are now seeing the outcome of all those cuts. We're putting a significant amount of money into long-term reforms and a costed plan to support older Australians. It's costed and funded. It's going through the budget. Thanks to this boost, we're going to have an 86 per cent increase over five years. Some will say there are waiting lists and queues. That's not surprising when we're developing a world-class care system for an increasing demographic sector. Almost half of those in the queue are already receiving interim care. Offering them high-level packages through the release of additional high-level packages will free up their existing package for somebody else.


My office is often approached for assistance in this process, because it is a fairly difficult one to navigate. We've always had a positive outcome. I say to the people of Gilmore: you're still more than welcome to come back to my office at any time and we'll assist you to navigate this system, get the best possible outcome for your care to retain your independence and to make sure you're having the best possible life.

"Collins, Julie, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (11:07):  It's great to be able to speak to this motion, because I've been talking in this place for some time about how the government has mishandled aged care in this country. We are seeing a crisis in aged care on this government's watch. To have the minister come in here this morning, after five years in government, three ministers and billions of dollars ripped out of aged care, trying to blame the Labor Party, when we haven't been in government for five years, is astounding.


There were 100,000 people waiting for home care as at the end of December. I am sure that there are many more, but the government hasn't released the figures to the end of March. Those figures are now well overdue. In estimates we heard that the department thinks they may be with the minister's office. When was estimates? It was at least three weeks ago. I wonder why these figures have been delayed and what they look like? We know that 20,000 people were added to that waiting list in the last six months of last year. The question for the government today is: what is the current figure? How many older Australians are today waiting for care in their own home? We don't know the answer, because several months on from December the government has yet to release the figures. Why hasn't the government released the figures? What is it hiding? How many people is it trying to move off that list? That's exactly what I think's going on here: the minister's office and the minister are sitting there trying to knock off the list people who have been waiting for care and who should be on the list.


We heard the government's own admission that it hadn't done enough in the last budget. We had the government try and pretend that it's got 20,000 new packages and then have to admit it's only 14,000, including the other 6,000 it made available late last year in October. We know that 14,000 over four years isn't going to make a dent. This government came in here on budget night and pretended that it had done something amazing in aged care, but we saw not one extra dollar over the forwards than was already in the budget. Not one extra dollar is being spent in aged care, when we have over 100,000 older Australians waiting for home care in this country.


It is a disgrace, and the government should be ashamed that it's out there trying to pull the wool over the eyes of older Australians, pretending that it's done something when it has not. It is not okay to try and pretend to older Australians and their families, who are very stressed, looking for support for their older parents. These families are ringing my office and other offices every day, saying, 'When can I get a home care package for my mum or my dad?' They are desperate. For the government to pretend that it is doing something is just appalling. It is appalling and it is a cruel hoax on older Australians, their families and their loved ones.


In the February estimates we saw that there are around 300 people on the waiting list who have been waiting for longer than two years—two years with no care, waiting for a home care package! We have people ringing up my office nearly every week who have been on that list for over a year. The government's own website says the current wait time for a level 3 or 4 package is over 12 months. We're not sure what 'over 12 months' means—how long over—but we know people who have been waiting considerable time frames. When you're getting people in their 90s contacting you to say, 'The government's put me on a waiting list, and I have to wait at least 12 months,' that is not good enough. We all know what's going to happen to those older people, particularly those in their 90s, who are at home, waiting for care.


What happens? You have family members who have to pick up that care. They have to come home from work early or not go to work. We've had older people turning up in emergency rooms well before they should because they could not get the care at home. It's having an effect on hospital wait times in emergency departments and it's having an effect on ambulance call-outs. These old people should be receiving the care in their home that they deserve and have been assessed and approved for, but this government will not fund their packages. Over 100,000 older Australians are today still waiting for their package, despite the budget and despite what this government says. It's about time this government did something about it.

"O'Brien, Ted, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mr TED O'BRIEN
 (Fairfax) (11:12):  The Australian Labor Party is morally bankrupt. Those opposite are morally bankrupt. The strategy that they have clearly employed is twofold when it comes to older Australians. No. 1, they lie; No. 2, they tax them. Lie and tax, lie and tax, lie and tax—that's Labor's strategy. I think the two pillars of this strategy go hand in hand, because the trick of the Labor Party is to create crises that don't exist. It's the old look-over-here strategy: generate such concern, such anxiety, in older Australians and put their focus elsewhere, on a problem that does not exist, so that the Labor Party can pick their pockets with higher taxes.


Indeed, this is precisely what we are seeing with the Shorten-led opposition, and it is a disgrace. We saw it last federal election with the 'Mediscare' campaign, which those opposite have laughed at every time it's been mentioned in this House because they know it was based on a lie. I put to them: how many older Australians bought into that lie? How many older Australians with heart problems, age problems and loneliness sat in their living rooms and believed Labor's lies? How many of them felt as though they were under threat? How many people in the seat of Longman, up in Queensland, are believing the outright lies of the Labor Party about less federal government funding for hospitals? It's an outright lie; the facts tell the opposite story. How many people are tuned in to this debate? How many older Australians are listening yet again to Labor's lies and being affected by them?


They do this unashamedly. They enter this House and they communicate to the public and they generate fear and anxiety among older Australians based on nothing—lies and tax. If we look at the facts we see that, in 2010-11, $9 million was cut from aged care under the Labor Party. The next year, 2011-12, the Labor Party cut $200 million from aged care—



Ms Collins interjecting—




Mr TED O'BRIEN:
  And they think it's funny, if you hear the laughter from across the House. In 2012-13, $135 million was cut, and I do not see the humour in it. If you are going to rip the guts out of aged care and then go on the attack and try to create fear campaigns based on nothing, then you shouldn't be entering this House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  I remind the member for Fairfax to direct his remarks through the chair.




Mr TED O'BRIEN:
  I shall indeed. I shall direct my remarks through the chair.


Indeed, those lies and those taxes that are the focus of the Labor Party are in direct contrast with the performance of the Turnbull government, where home care packages are up, residential places are up and every year funding for aged care is up. Since the coalition government was elected, aged-care spending has increased by an average of more than six per cent each year. That is, on average, $1 billion of extra support for older Australians each year. More than 1.3 million older Australians are accessing some form of support in the Commonwealth aged-care sector. The Turnbull government is providing record aged-care funding of $19.8 billion in 2018-19. Did the Labor Party ever provide such funding in government? The heads opposite are down, Deputy Speaker, because the facts tell the truth.


The coalition government respects the dignity and is responding to the needs of older Australians. There is not a crisis. Older Australians need not be suffering anxiety from the fear that the Labor Party is trying to engender. Funding to aged care continues to grow with this government, with ongoing investment. It's for that reason that I'm very happy to reject their lies and their taxes and support the federal government. (Time expired)

The first two projects involve modernisation works at the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct in Darwin. The committee understands the strategic importance of Larrakeyah in supporting Australia's operations in the north.


The first proposal is for the facilities to support naval operations in the north project. This project includes construction of a new wharf and fuel storage facilities at Larrakeyah.


The new wharf will allow for a variety of Navy vessels and visiting foreign warships to berth and refuel in Darwin. The estimated cost for the project is $272.5 million, excluding GST.


The second proposal is the Larrakeyah Barracks redevelopment. This is a $223 million project to update ageing and non-compliant facilities at Larrakeyah Barracks. The redevelopment will provide new buildings, a more secure entry precinct, upgraded roads, water and sewerage infrastructure, and new electrical and ICT infrastructure.


The barracks redevelopment will allow for the future growth of the precinct population and is required to enable and support the new wharf.


The committee has recommended that both of these projects should proceed.


The third proposal is for stage 2 of the Garden Island (East) Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program, in Sydney. The committee considered stage 1 of this program back in 2017. Stage 1 included the demolition of outdated wharves, and the construction of a new wharf.


Stage 2 completes the revitalisation of Garden Island East with the repair or replacement of remaining wharves, and upgrades to base-wide engineering services, including electrical, fuel, water and sewerage, and that is predominantly so that, when ships are at berth, they can hook into what they call 'hotel mode', which allows the boats to not have to run their motors, for the comfort of those residents who now live close to the facility. The estimated cost of that project is $286.5 million, excluding GST.


The committee appreciates the strategic importance of Garden Island to Defence's capability and operations on Australia's east coast.


The committee has recommended that stage 2 of the program should proceed.


I'd like to, in closing, acknowledge some of the newer committee members who have taken their place on this board and also acknowledge some outgoing contributions by committee members. Justine Keay made an invaluable contribution to the committee and, given the by-election, we'd love to have her back on the team if the weather presents itself. There are two new committee members: Senator Amanda Stoker, who replaced Senator Dean Smith, and Andrew Wallace, the member for Fisher, who brings an enormous amount of knowledge as a builder, a lawyer and a barrister specialising in the construction field. That type of knowledge fits hand-in-glove with the many years of service from Senator Gallacher, who is a longstanding member on that committee.


The Australian public see the parliament through a very narrow prism at times, and they witness the conduct of us politicians narrowly through the prism of question time. Question time is filled with theatre and gladiatorial-type behaviour. This committee, of which I'm proud to chair, has truly at heart the taxpayers' best interests. This committee is focused on making sure that we deliver the best return for investment for the Australian tax dollar. And however combative we may be for a certain hour during the day, this committee is exemplary in the way that it shows the nation that this parliament does have an effective role to play.


We will also continue to pursue greater cost savings through prying into and prodding different Defence contracts that come to us across all portfolios, whether or not they be here in Australia or through the remit of this committee where we have oversight of our foreign embassies. I'd like to thank my fellow committee members for their ongoing commitment to the Public Works Committee, which continues to work effectively and cooperatively. This year, 2018, is shaping up to be another busy year for public works. I commend this report to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (12:18):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018, which amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999.


As members would be aware, the parliament has not, with the exception of a brief period under the Fraser government, indexed income tax brackets but we do on a regular basis increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds and the phase-in limit in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. That means that under this bill: the individual income threshold for the Medicare levy will move from $21,655 to $21,980; the family income threshold will move from $36,541 to $37,089; the individual SAPTO threshold will move from $34,244 to $34,758; the SAPTO family threshold will move from $47,670 to $48,345; and the child/student component of the income threshold for families, whether eligible for SAPTO or not, will move from $3,356 to $3,406, with commensurate changes to the phase-in limits. These measures, which will amount to hundreds of dollars, are certainly warranted—they will provide modest relief to low-income households—but should not be oversold. This is a regular process. It ensures the most vulnerable Australians are not disadvantaged. It maintains their access to Medicare, Australia's world-class universal health system.


At the same time as this bill is before the House, there is much more significant debate around tackling inequality through true progressive tax changes. That debate, which is in the public domain—indeed, it was before the House in the last sittings—is over whether to change the income tax scales in a way that would see middle Australia see a significant tax cut. We on this side of the House have a commitment to providing a bigger, better and fairer tax cut. It would go to those earning less than $125,000. Those 10 million Australians would be $400 better off under the Labor proposal than under the coalition proposal. What is extraordinary is that the government refuses to split its bill; it refuses to split tax changes scheduled to take effect on 1 July this year from tax cuts that will not take effect for another two election cycles. The government needs to do the right thing on that. It needs to split the bill. It needs to provide low- and middle-income taxpayers that immediate tax relief.


The difference between the short-term and the long-term tax packages can be seen in the analysis that Danielle Wood has done for the Grattan Institute. This analysis looks at the impact on tax progressivity of the early stage and the late stage of that package. The early stage improves tax progressivity. Indeed, Labor's proposal would be an even greater improvement in tax progressivity. Under Labor's proposal, the tax system would do even more to ameliorate inequality than it currently does. But the late stage makes our tax system more regressive. According to the modelling carried out by the Grattan Institute, Australia's tax system would do less than it currently does to ameliorate inequality under that third stage of the government's tax proposals, which are not due to take effect until the 2024-25 tax year.


Tackling inequality is a huge priority not just for Australia but globally. Last week saw the release of the World Inequality Report 2018 by economists Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That report compiles a series of new studies, including work that has been done for Australia by the late Sir Tony Atkinson and me, and now updated by Roger Wilkins, and work on wealth inequality for Australia, which Pamela Katic and I conducted. The overall picture of global inequality is summed up by Branko Milanovic, of the City University of New York, as being 'an elephant curve'. If you plot the increase in world income distribution, you see sluggish growth at the very bottom, the tail of the elephant; more rapid growth for most of the 20th to 30th percentiles, reflecting the income growth that has occurred in China and India in particular; weak growth for the middle, the downward curve of the trunk, reflecting the squeeze on middle classes in advanced countries; and spectacular growth among the top 10 per cent, being the tip of the trunk.


To enter the top one per cent of the world's wealthiest earners requires wealth of around one million euros. The wealthiest one per cent of the world now have one-third of world wealth, up from one-quarter in the mid-1990s. If you look at the wealth share of the top one in 100 million in the world, the top 75 people or so, those billionaires have seen wealth increases of around three times the global average.


I want to pay tribute to Australia21 and the Australia Institute for their work in drawing attention to the scale of the inequality challenge. In January 2014, Australia21 held an inequality roundtable in Canberra, bringing together 35 senior government officials; five parliamentarians, myself included; non-government organisations; academics; community leaders; and stakeholders. Today, Australia21 is holding another roundtable here in Parliament House on the theme, 'Dealing with economic inequality in Australia'. It is being hosted by Emeritus Professor Bob Douglas and the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, and it is bringing together 40 experts to discuss not only the scale of the inequality challenge but what can be done to address it. The key questions being discussed are: how serious is the inequality issue in Australia? What are the factors contributing to it? What changes will be needed in Australian society to make it highly likely that economic inequality will be declining in the next 10 years? And what changes are now needed to address the problem? I again commend Australia21 and The Australia Institute for this important report.


We face multiple futures when it comes to inequality. As the World inequality report 2018 has made clear, if the world follows a trajectory of 'business as usual' in which inequality rises in each country, as it's done since 1980, then we are going to see the global top one per cent increase its share of world income from 20 per cent to 24 per cent, and we will see the bottom half of the world income distribution decrease their share of world income. If we see the world follow the United States' trajectory, a high-inequality-growth trajectory, then that would mean that the global top one per cent share would go from 20 per cent to 28 per cent by 2050, and the bottom 50 per cent share would fall significantly. However, were inequality to follow the European style low-inequality-growth trajectory, then the global one per cent share would shrink to 19 per cent, and there would be significant growth in the income share of the bottom half of the population. They are the multiple futures facing the world. Do we want to go ahead and see a business-as-usual or an American trajectory in which inequality widens, where the top one per cent have more and the bottom half have less? Or do we want to consider a different path forward in which we crack down on tax havens and ensure that there are strong unions able to check inequality, that we have access to an education and healthcare system for all and that the benefits of growth are fairly shared across the community?


One of the contributions of the world inequality report has been to use the massive data leaks from Panama, Switzerland and Luxembourg to look at tax evasion by the very top. In the Scandinavian countries, where it is possible to match up the data leaks with individual taxpayers, it appears that the richest 0.01 per cent of Scandinavians evade over one-quarter of the personal taxes they owe by using tax havens, suggesting that the use of tax havens may be an even bigger problem in other nations.


And we see, too, multinational corporations up to the same tricks. In research recently released in parallel with the world inequality report, Thomas Torslov, Ludvig Wier and Gabriel Zucman find that there is significant multinational profit-shifting occurring among the world's biggest firms. They give the example of the events in 2016 when Google Alphabet reported revenues of $19 billion in Bermuda. This is a small island in the Atlantic where Google Alphabet barely employs any workers and barely owns any tangible assets but where the corporate tax rate is zero per cent. The estimates from Torslov, Wier and Zucman are that around 40 per cent of the profits of large multinationals are shifted to low-tax jurisdictions. And this doesn't simply mean shifting where the tax is paid; it means shifting from jurisdictions where tax is paid to jurisdictions where very little tax is paid. They estimate that, for every $1 of corporate tax paid in a tax haven, $5 of corporate tax is avoided in countries with regular corporate tax rates. So we must crack down on the abuse of tax havens if we are to see more egalitarianism across the world.


Egalitarianism is a fundamentally Australian value. We know that when people like Mark Twain, Anthony Trollope and DH Lawrence visited Australia they remarked on Australian egalitarianism. Australian egalitarianism isn't just a Labor story, though it certainly is that. It is an Australian story, one of a nation in which we're proud not to have private areas on our beaches and not to stand up when the Prime Minister enters the room. We're proud to use the word 'mate' rather than the word 'sir'.


But all of that is at threat from the rise in inequality that we've seen across the globe and in Australia over the past generation. We also see this in the area of health care. We are debating today a bill relating to Medicare, and we know that the cost of seeing both GPs and specialists has hit a new record under the Turnbull government. We know that Australians are paying more for their health. They are paying an average of $38 out of their pocket to see a GP, and it is up to $47 in some jurisdictions. That's almost a $4 increase since Prime Minister Turnbull promised that no-one would pay more to see a GP. Out-of-pocket fees to see specialists have soared even higher. They are up to almost $88 on average, an increase of about $12 since the election, and there are jurisdictions in Australia where the average out-of-pocket cost of seeing a specialist has now soared above $90.


The Australian people realise that, when you have higher out-of-pocket costs, that means that people don't go to see their doctor for those essential check-ups. We have figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that a million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GPs every year due to cost, and another 1.7 million Australians skip specialist appointments. We're yet to see the government lifting any part of its damaging Medicare rebate freeze. Rebates for GPs, specialists and allied health services all remain fully frozen until 2020. All remain fully frozen and the freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020. As a result of this freeze, the Turnbull government is cutting more than $3 billion out of Medicare.


Medicare is a fundamental part of Australian egalitarianism. Australian egalitarianism is built on the notion that we pay our fair share of tax, we make sure that multinational firms aren't able to shift their profits to tax havens and we ensure that any child who has the smarts to go to university gets a place there. But, under this government, we're seeing $17 billion being ripped out of schools and $17 billion being given to the big banks. Every dollar that is going to the big banks under Prime Minister Turnbull's corporate tax cut is coming out of Australian schools. At a time when we've got Australian test scores going backwards, according to the PISA study, and we have our banks facing an unprecedented royal commission, is it really right to take money from schools and give it to banks? The government's priorities are completely wrong. If they care about egalitarianism, as every Australian should, we need fairer tax policies, fairer education policies and fairer health policies.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (12:33):  Labor has no difficulty in rising to welcome the indexation of the income thresholds below which Australians do not pay the Medicare levy or Medicare levy surcharge. This is a very standard and regular process that ensures that the most vulnerable Australians are not disadvantaged, while maintaining their access to Medicare, our world-class universal health system. It is, though, an opportunity to address the parliament about the key issue that is facing people in using Medicare, and that is that the cost of going to the GP or going to the specialist has risen. I'm talking here about the out-of-pocket costs that Australians face every day when they have to take their kids or themselves off to the GP.


The Liberals' claim that Medicare has never been stronger is false; it is wrong. The out-of-pocket costs of seeing both GPs and specialists have hit new records under the current Prime Minister, with Australians now paying around $47 for a GP appointment and around $90 for a specialist appointment, or at least up to those figures in some areas. Unfortunately, what this increase in out-of-pocket costs means is that there are Australians who are not going to the doctor. They are holding off from going to see a doctor, even when they're sick, because they're worried about what might happen in terms of the cost of seeing the GP. If they're making a choice between taking their kids to the doctor or taking themselves to the doctor, they are making sure that they hold off to make sure that their kids can go. In fact, the ABS figures show that 1 million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GP each year due to cost, with another 1.7 million Australians skipping specialist appointments. This should be incredibly alarming for everyone here.


It is a terrible indictment on this government that there are Australians skipping medical appointments, not going to the GP and not going to the specialist because of the cost. The Turnbull government really needs to lift its game when it comes to Medicare. The Prime Minister himself went to the last election promising that no-one would pay more to see a GP, but the out-of-pocket costs are higher than they have ever been, and this trend will only get worse because of this government's obstinate refusal to properly address the Medicare freeze problem that they created. The freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020, and that's really shameful. The government really needs to take a good, hard look at itself and take action in respect of making sure people can afford to go to the doctor.


The cost in my electorate is very high. In fact, my electorate of Griffith has the highest out-of-pocket costs for seeing a GP of any electorate in Queensland. It's almost $40 in out-of-pocket costs in my electorate of Griffith, on the south side of Brisbane. For our state of Queensland there was a recent increase of nearly 7½ per cent in GP out-of-pocket costs, year on year. The situation is even worse when it comes to specialist appointments. In fact, in Queensland, the year-on-year increase is 21.56 per cent. That's how much out-of-pocket costs have increased—by more than a fifth—to go to a specialist in Queensland, and it's a disgrace.


The fact that the government has been out in the media trying to trumpet a static GP bulk-billing rate shows just how out of touch they are. If you're a parent, if you've got young kids, you don't want to have to worry about the cost of going to the doctor if they're sick. You don't want to have to make choices between pharmaceuticals for yourself and taking your kids to the doctor. Yet that's what skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs do to people and to families. People in my electorate should not be put in a situation where the out-of-pocket costs for visiting a GP or a specialist are skyrocketing. This government needs to address this because the Commonwealth should be providing a universal healthcare system, and a healthcare system where people have to pay high out-of-pocket costs to see a doctor is not a truly universal one.


The Australian people are too smart to fall for the spin that somehow Medicare is strong under this government, because they know from their own firsthand experience that the cost of going to the doctor is very high. It's laughable to claim that Medicare has never been stronger. It's laughable for this government to claim that their commitment to Medicare is rock solid. Australians know the truth. The government can get up and complain all they like about Labor campaigning in respect of their plans for Medicare at the last election. The reason we were campaigning about what this government was going to do to Medicare is because the Liberals cannot be trusted when it comes to Medicare. The Liberals can't be trusted not to Americanise our healthcare system. The Liberals can't be trusted to protect and defend Medicare. The Liberals cannot be trusted to address out-of-pocket costs for GPs and out-of-pocket costs for specialists, just like they can't be trusted on private health insurance. They have refused to meet our commitments to cap premium rate rises when it comes to private health insurance. They're not interested in this crucial cost-of-living issue for Australian families.


Australian families deserve better. Australian families deserve a Commonwealth government that will speak up and, more importantly, will pay up to make sure that we have a universal healthcare system so that everyone can see a doctor, no matter their personal circumstances, and so that your access to health care is determined by your Medicare card, not by your credit card. That's what a Labor government would do. I know that Australians are thinking very carefully about the future of this country after the next federal election, and they're thinking a lot about health care. I say to the Australian people: Labor created Medicare and only Labor will ensure that Australians can access the health care they deserve. It's time for a government that will stand up for people's ability to go to the doctor without having to reach so deeply into their pockets, without having to make those terrible choices between medicine and GP visits, without having to worry about the impact that going to the doctor will have on their family budget and without having to worry.


This is Australia. In Australia you don't have to worry about whether you can afford to go to the doctor. That's the Australia that I want to live in. That's the Australia that I grew up in. But this Liberal government don't care. If they cared they would have done something about it a long time ago. We've had a Liberal government in this country for five years now, and we're seeing the consequences of that when you look at the out-of-pocket cost increases for Australian families. They haven't done enough, and that's because they can't be trusted when it comes to health care.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (12:40):  The words I present today are to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018. Every government since 1996-97 has generally decided to increase the low-income thresholds in line with the positive movements of the CPI each year. We all know what CPI means, but, just as a reminder, the consumer price index is a formal way of buying a whole range of items that could be part of household costs, averaging it out and comparing it with the last time the task was done. The increase, through a range of calculations, results in the CPI. The CPI figure is used by many different government departments to calculate a range of changes that apply to pensions and other income support mechanisms. We know that age pensions go up in March and September every year in line with CPI. More importantly, if we don't change the taxable threshold in line with that rise in CPI then people who currently don't pay extra, including the Medicare levy, will have to pay.


Essentially, this bill is about changing the threshold of low-income families before they have to start paying the fees or levies. It's about reducing the impact on low-income families. The Medicare levy low-income threshold makes sure that people who pay no personal income tax because of the tax-free threshold and structural offsets, like the low-income tax offset or the seniors and pensioners tax offset, generally don't pay the Medicare levy yet are able to get into the Medicare system. This is an essential part of ensuring that everyone who does not currently pay continues to not have to pay. It is part of our government guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on. 


A stronger economy has enabled the government to deliver record investment in Medicare, hospitals, schools and disability services. Australians have guaranteed access to high-quality hospitals and schools, not because we have the lion's share of direct funding to either hospitals or schools but because we have strong agreements with the state governments about investment in these two essential parts of our daily lives that affect all our families. In addition, we have the revenue for the delivery of a strong Medicare system, which is vital and needs to be there to provide the services to those with permanent and significant disabilities as well as those who get ill or who need to go to the doctor or a specialist. One of the problems is that we don't have enough doctors or specialists out there who bulk-bill. That is an issue. But if we've got a good Medicare system then we've got choices. 


Talking about choice, we're providing more choice for older Australians to live healthier, more independent and safer lives so that they can take advantage of the opportunities that a longer life brings. It's not just about house cleaning, daily nurses visiting or carers coming to help with daily walks for someone recovering from a knee replacement. Each and every activity like these helps our older people have a better time, a quality time, while they remain in their own homes. A government cannot invest in such services unless there is a very strong economy to back that up—and we are doing exactly that. 


Our record investment in schools will give teachers the tools to lift the performance of their students and prepare them for the jobs of the future. As a former science teacher, I'm proud that we have delivered these reforms. I've seen fantastic changes in my local schools where the additional investment has been allocated to teacher training and student courses that have never been offered before. We're looking at recommendations from the review to achieve educational excellence in Australian schools.


From July 2018, the government will ease the cost-of-living pressures for nearly a million Australian families by implementing the new childcare package. And I take this opportunity to remind families in my electorate to register: there are about 5,000 families in Gilmore who will absolutely be better off, but they do need to register.


We have record levels of funding going to hospital services, the Medicare Benefits Schedule and pharmaceutical benefits. Just recently, I had Stan come in. He has lung cancer, and we've put his drug on the PBS. So, instead of it costing him 350 bucks a pop, it's the cost of a script. I then had Richard, who has trouble breathing. A new drug has come through the PBS, so that instead of $204 a hit it's the cost of a script.


If you don't have a strong economy you simply can't deliver these changes, and we're doing it. We're trying to get rural health stronger and I know that all the people who I have seen in my local area want to make this better as well. We're working hard with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In fact, our revenue is so good that we don't have to change the Medicare levy; we've actually got the funding there to support this scheme for all our people.


The Medicare Guarantee Fund is going to be increased. An additional $34.4 billion has gone to this fund, and a further credit of $35.3 billion will be made to meet the estimated MBS and PBS expenditure in 2018-19. We've got cystic fibrosis testing, 3D breast cancer screening and MRI tests for prostate cancer. You can't do any of that unless you've got the revenue to support that, and we're doing that. I think it's fantastic we've got solar coming into the local regions and community groups. Again, these are grants and subsidies that can only come out through a strong economy. There are a whole stack of things that have been brought through for people with diabetes. There is the insulin pump for young children—an investment of $6.2 million, and I would like to give a shout out to the DENNY Foundation, who were great advocates for that, with Pieta Newport and Marg Smith involved locally. They really got me involved in it and made me understand how important that was.


Medicare is not at risk. With an additional one million jobs, that's a huge increase in revenue for the Medicare levy, not to mention the huge investment by the government. This is an outstanding investment from a strong government with strong revenue streams. I commend the bill.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (12:47):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018. I particularly thank the member for Gilmore, who I think has set the matter out incredibly well. A stronger economy means the government no longer needs to proceed with the change in the Medicare levy as we advised before the budget this year. It also means the government is able to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold as set out in this bill.


Through our plan for a stronger economy, the Turnbull government is guaranteeing essential services that Australians rely on. Funding for Medicare has been guaranteed in legislation by this government, as we promised we would—another commitment kept. But there's a much stronger guarantee that this government provides for Medicare, for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for social security payments, for childcare support, for schools funding, for hospitals funding and for any area of essential service and support that the government provides. And that is that this government has a plan for a stronger economy that's delivering. The Labor Party can make whatever claim they like about what they think they're going to spend, but if they don't have a plan for a stronger economy they can't pay for it. And, when they hear 'revenue', all they hear is the need to increase taxes. When we hear that, we know the need to create a stronger economy that generates the revenue—not to tax the economy out of existence.


A stronger economy is what guarantees Medicare. A stronger economy is what guarantees schools funding. A stronger economy guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on. Essential services aren't guaranteed by politicians making promises, like the Labor Party does. They're guaranteed by governments that know how to support and grow an economy—as this government has overseen, with more than a million people getting jobs over the last five years. A million people have got jobs over the last five years. That's a simple fact, and they've been created by Australian businesses. Australian businesses have created those jobs—Australian businesses that have been benefitting from the pro-business, pro-economic policies that enable them to grow.


The Labor Party has a proposal for business and the economy, and that's to tax them out of business. If you tax businesses out of business, what happens is you don't have the money to guarantee Medicare and you don't have the money to list important life-saving drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If you don't have policies for a stronger economy, you don't have a policy for Medicare. If you don't have a policy for a stronger economy and a plan, you don't have a policy for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. All you have are glib promises that you can't back up.


This bill ensures—and demonstrates once again—that, through the strong economic and financial management of the Turnbull government, we are in a position to be able to move forward on this measure. The bill will assist Australians on low incomes by continuing to exempt them from paying the Medicare levy. These changes will ensure that low-income households who did not pay the Medicare levy in the 2016-17 income year will generally continue to be exempt in the 2017-18 income year if their incomes have risen in line with or less than the consumer price index. For individual taxpayers, no Medicare levy will be payable for those with a taxable income that does not exceed $21,980 in 2017-18, which has increased from $21,655. Single senior pensioners with no dependants who are eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset will not incur a Medicare levy liability if their taxable income does not exceed $34,758 in 2017-18, which has increased from $34,244. As well as these individual thresholds, further relief is available for low-income couples and families. The amendments to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds apply to the 2017-18 year of income and future income years.


Again, the government's plan for a stronger economy is delivering more jobs and it's guaranteeing essential services that Australians rely on—and it is making sure that we do all of that while ensuring that the government continues to live within its means. That is at the heart of the government's approach to guaranteeing those essential services. It's something you can take to the bank—because, if you have a stronger economy, you can take it to the bank. Otherwise, it's just a promise that you have to take back to the Labor Party—a promise that they can never deliver on because they cannot run a stronger economy. But I welcome Labor's support for this bill. They are just fortunate that there's a Turnbull government in place that can run a strong budget and a strong economy that can pay for it. I commend the bill to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (12:18):  Labor supports the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018, which amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999.


As members would be aware, the parliament has not, with the exception of a brief period under the Fraser government, indexed income tax brackets but we do on a regular basis increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds and the phase-in limit in accordance with movements in the consumer price index. That means that under this bill: the individual income threshold for the Medicare levy will move from $21,655 to $21,980; the family income threshold will move from $36,541 to $37,089; the individual SAPTO threshold will move from $34,244 to $34,758; the SAPTO family threshold will move from $47,670 to $48,345; and the child/student component of the income threshold for families, whether eligible for SAPTO or not, will move from $3,356 to $3,406, with commensurate changes to the phase-in limits. These measures, which will amount to hundreds of dollars, are certainly warranted—they will provide modest relief to low-income households—but should not be oversold. This is a regular process. It ensures the most vulnerable Australians are not disadvantaged. It maintains their access to Medicare, Australia's world-class universal health system.


At the same time as this bill is before the House, there is much more significant debate around tackling inequality through true progressive tax changes. That debate, which is in the public domain—indeed, it was before the House in the last sittings—is over whether to change the income tax scales in a way that would see middle Australia see a significant tax cut. We on this side of the House have a commitment to providing a bigger, better and fairer tax cut. It would go to those earning less than $125,000. Those 10 million Australians would be $400 better off under the Labor proposal than under the coalition proposal. What is extraordinary is that the government refuses to split its bill; it refuses to split tax changes scheduled to take effect on 1 July this year from tax cuts that will not take effect for another two election cycles. The government needs to do the right thing on that. It needs to split the bill. It needs to provide low- and middle-income taxpayers that immediate tax relief.


The difference between the short-term and the long-term tax packages can be seen in the analysis that Danielle Wood has done for the Grattan Institute. This analysis looks at the impact on tax progressivity of the early stage and the late stage of that package. The early stage improves tax progressivity. Indeed, Labor's proposal would be an even greater improvement in tax progressivity. Under Labor's proposal, the tax system would do even more to ameliorate inequality than it currently does. But the late stage makes our tax system more regressive. According to the modelling carried out by the Grattan Institute, Australia's tax system would do less than it currently does to ameliorate inequality under that third stage of the government's tax proposals, which are not due to take effect until the 2024-25 tax year.


Tackling inequality is a huge priority not just for Australia but globally. Last week saw the release of the World Inequality Report 2018 by economists Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That report compiles a series of new studies, including work that has been done for Australia by the late Sir Tony Atkinson and me, and now updated by Roger Wilkins, and work on wealth inequality for Australia, which Pamela Katic and I conducted. The overall picture of global inequality is summed up by Branko Milanovic, of the City University of New York, as being 'an elephant curve'. If you plot the increase in world income distribution, you see sluggish growth at the very bottom, the tail of the elephant; more rapid growth for most of the 20th to 30th percentiles, reflecting the income growth that has occurred in China and India in particular; weak growth for the middle, the downward curve of the trunk, reflecting the squeeze on middle classes in advanced countries; and spectacular growth among the top 10 per cent, being the tip of the trunk.


To enter the top one per cent of the world's wealthiest earners requires wealth of around one million euros. The wealthiest one per cent of the world now have one-third of world wealth, up from one-quarter in the mid-1990s. If you look at the wealth share of the top one in 100 million in the world, the top 75 people or so, those billionaires have seen wealth increases of around three times the global average.


I want to pay tribute to Australia21 and the Australia Institute for their work in drawing attention to the scale of the inequality challenge. In January 2014, Australia21 held an inequality roundtable in Canberra, bringing together 35 senior government officials; five parliamentarians, myself included; non-government organisations; academics; community leaders; and stakeholders. Today, Australia21 is holding another roundtable here in Parliament House on the theme, 'Dealing with economic inequality in Australia'. It is being hosted by Emeritus Professor Bob Douglas and the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan, and it is bringing together 40 experts to discuss not only the scale of the inequality challenge but what can be done to address it. The key questions being discussed are: how serious is the inequality issue in Australia? What are the factors contributing to it? What changes will be needed in Australian society to make it highly likely that economic inequality will be declining in the next 10 years? And what changes are now needed to address the problem? I again commend Australia21 and The Australia Institute for this important report.


We face multiple futures when it comes to inequality. As the World inequality report 2018 has made clear, if the world follows a trajectory of 'business as usual' in which inequality rises in each country, as it's done since 1980, then we are going to see the global top one per cent increase its share of world income from 20 per cent to 24 per cent, and we will see the bottom half of the world income distribution decrease their share of world income. If we see the world follow the United States' trajectory, a high-inequality-growth trajectory, then that would mean that the global top one per cent share would go from 20 per cent to 28 per cent by 2050, and the bottom 50 per cent share would fall significantly. However, were inequality to follow the European style low-inequality-growth trajectory, then the global one per cent share would shrink to 19 per cent, and there would be significant growth in the income share of the bottom half of the population. They are the multiple futures facing the world. Do we want to go ahead and see a business-as-usual or an American trajectory in which inequality widens, where the top one per cent have more and the bottom half have less? Or do we want to consider a different path forward in which we crack down on tax havens and ensure that there are strong unions able to check inequality, that we have access to an education and healthcare system for all and that the benefits of growth are fairly shared across the community?


One of the contributions of the world inequality report has been to use the massive data leaks from Panama, Switzerland and Luxembourg to look at tax evasion by the very top. In the Scandinavian countries, where it is possible to match up the data leaks with individual taxpayers, it appears that the richest 0.01 per cent of Scandinavians evade over one-quarter of the personal taxes they owe by using tax havens, suggesting that the use of tax havens may be an even bigger problem in other nations.


And we see, too, multinational corporations up to the same tricks. In research recently released in parallel with the world inequality report, Thomas Torslov, Ludvig Wier and Gabriel Zucman find that there is significant multinational profit-shifting occurring among the world's biggest firms. They give the example of the events in 2016 when Google Alphabet reported revenues of $19 billion in Bermuda. This is a small island in the Atlantic where Google Alphabet barely employs any workers and barely owns any tangible assets but where the corporate tax rate is zero per cent. The estimates from Torslov, Wier and Zucman are that around 40 per cent of the profits of large multinationals are shifted to low-tax jurisdictions. And this doesn't simply mean shifting where the tax is paid; it means shifting from jurisdictions where tax is paid to jurisdictions where very little tax is paid. They estimate that, for every $1 of corporate tax paid in a tax haven, $5 of corporate tax is avoided in countries with regular corporate tax rates. So we must crack down on the abuse of tax havens if we are to see more egalitarianism across the world.


Egalitarianism is a fundamentally Australian value. We know that when people like Mark Twain, Anthony Trollope and DH Lawrence visited Australia they remarked on Australian egalitarianism. Australian egalitarianism isn't just a Labor story, though it certainly is that. It is an Australian story, one of a nation in which we're proud not to have private areas on our beaches and not to stand up when the Prime Minister enters the room. We're proud to use the word 'mate' rather than the word 'sir'.


But all of that is at threat from the rise in inequality that we've seen across the globe and in Australia over the past generation. We also see this in the area of health care. We are debating today a bill relating to Medicare, and we know that the cost of seeing both GPs and specialists has hit a new record under the Turnbull government. We know that Australians are paying more for their health. They are paying an average of $38 out of their pocket to see a GP, and it is up to $47 in some jurisdictions. That's almost a $4 increase since Prime Minister Turnbull promised that no-one would pay more to see a GP. Out-of-pocket fees to see specialists have soared even higher. They are up to almost $88 on average, an increase of about $12 since the election, and there are jurisdictions in Australia where the average out-of-pocket cost of seeing a specialist has now soared above $90.


The Australian people realise that, when you have higher out-of-pocket costs, that means that people don't go to see their doctor for those essential check-ups. We have figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that a million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GPs every year due to cost, and another 1.7 million Australians skip specialist appointments. We're yet to see the government lifting any part of its damaging Medicare rebate freeze. Rebates for GPs, specialists and allied health services all remain fully frozen until 2020. All remain fully frozen and the freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020. As a result of this freeze, the Turnbull government is cutting more than $3 billion out of Medicare.


Medicare is a fundamental part of Australian egalitarianism. Australian egalitarianism is built on the notion that we pay our fair share of tax, we make sure that multinational firms aren't able to shift their profits to tax havens and we ensure that any child who has the smarts to go to university gets a place there. But, under this government, we're seeing $17 billion being ripped out of schools and $17 billion being given to the big banks. Every dollar that is going to the big banks under Prime Minister Turnbull's corporate tax cut is coming out of Australian schools. At a time when we've got Australian test scores going backwards, according to the PISA study, and we have our banks facing an unprecedented royal commission, is it really right to take money from schools and give it to banks? The government's priorities are completely wrong. If they care about egalitarianism, as every Australian should, we need fairer tax policies, fairer education policies and fairer health policies.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (12:33):  Labor has no difficulty in rising to welcome the indexation of the income thresholds below which Australians do not pay the Medicare levy or Medicare levy surcharge. This is a very standard and regular process that ensures that the most vulnerable Australians are not disadvantaged, while maintaining their access to Medicare, our world-class universal health system. It is, though, an opportunity to address the parliament about the key issue that is facing people in using Medicare, and that is that the cost of going to the GP or going to the specialist has risen. I'm talking here about the out-of-pocket costs that Australians face every day when they have to take their kids or themselves off to the GP.


The Liberals' claim that Medicare has never been stronger is false; it is wrong. The out-of-pocket costs of seeing both GPs and specialists have hit new records under the current Prime Minister, with Australians now paying around $47 for a GP appointment and around $90 for a specialist appointment, or at least up to those figures in some areas. Unfortunately, what this increase in out-of-pocket costs means is that there are Australians who are not going to the doctor. They are holding off from going to see a doctor, even when they're sick, because they're worried about what might happen in terms of the cost of seeing the GP. If they're making a choice between taking their kids to the doctor or taking themselves to the doctor, they are making sure that they hold off to make sure that their kids can go. In fact, the ABS figures show that 1 million Australians delay or avoid seeing their GP each year due to cost, with another 1.7 million Australians skipping specialist appointments. This should be incredibly alarming for everyone here.


It is a terrible indictment on this government that there are Australians skipping medical appointments, not going to the GP and not going to the specialist because of the cost. The Turnbull government really needs to lift its game when it comes to Medicare. The Prime Minister himself went to the last election promising that no-one would pay more to see a GP, but the out-of-pocket costs are higher than they have ever been, and this trend will only get worse because of this government's obstinate refusal to properly address the Medicare freeze problem that they created. The freeze won't be fully lifted until 2020, and that's really shameful. The government really needs to take a good, hard look at itself and take action in respect of making sure people can afford to go to the doctor.


The cost in my electorate is very high. In fact, my electorate of Griffith has the highest out-of-pocket costs for seeing a GP of any electorate in Queensland. It's almost $40 in out-of-pocket costs in my electorate of Griffith, on the south side of Brisbane. For our state of Queensland there was a recent increase of nearly 7½ per cent in GP out-of-pocket costs, year on year. The situation is even worse when it comes to specialist appointments. In fact, in Queensland, the year-on-year increase is 21.56 per cent. That's how much out-of-pocket costs have increased—by more than a fifth—to go to a specialist in Queensland, and it's a disgrace.


The fact that the government has been out in the media trying to trumpet a static GP bulk-billing rate shows just how out of touch they are. If you're a parent, if you've got young kids, you don't want to have to worry about the cost of going to the doctor if they're sick. You don't want to have to make choices between pharmaceuticals for yourself and taking your kids to the doctor. Yet that's what skyrocketing out-of-pocket costs do to people and to families. People in my electorate should not be put in a situation where the out-of-pocket costs for visiting a GP or a specialist are skyrocketing. This government needs to address this because the Commonwealth should be providing a universal healthcare system, and a healthcare system where people have to pay high out-of-pocket costs to see a doctor is not a truly universal one.


The Australian people are too smart to fall for the spin that somehow Medicare is strong under this government, because they know from their own firsthand experience that the cost of going to the doctor is very high. It's laughable to claim that Medicare has never been stronger. It's laughable for this government to claim that their commitment to Medicare is rock solid. Australians know the truth. The government can get up and complain all they like about Labor campaigning in respect of their plans for Medicare at the last election. The reason we were campaigning about what this government was going to do to Medicare is because the Liberals cannot be trusted when it comes to Medicare. The Liberals can't be trusted not to Americanise our healthcare system. The Liberals can't be trusted to protect and defend Medicare. The Liberals cannot be trusted to address out-of-pocket costs for GPs and out-of-pocket costs for specialists, just like they can't be trusted on private health insurance. They have refused to meet our commitments to cap premium rate rises when it comes to private health insurance. They're not interested in this crucial cost-of-living issue for Australian families.


Australian families deserve better. Australian families deserve a Commonwealth government that will speak up and, more importantly, will pay up to make sure that we have a universal healthcare system so that everyone can see a doctor, no matter their personal circumstances, and so that your access to health care is determined by your Medicare card, not by your credit card. That's what a Labor government would do. I know that Australians are thinking very carefully about the future of this country after the next federal election, and they're thinking a lot about health care. I say to the Australian people: Labor created Medicare and only Labor will ensure that Australians can access the health care they deserve. It's time for a government that will stand up for people's ability to go to the doctor without having to reach so deeply into their pockets, without having to make those terrible choices between medicine and GP visits, without having to worry about the impact that going to the doctor will have on their family budget and without having to worry.


This is Australia. In Australia you don't have to worry about whether you can afford to go to the doctor. That's the Australia that I want to live in. That's the Australia that I grew up in. But this Liberal government don't care. If they cared they would have done something about it a long time ago. We've had a Liberal government in this country for five years now, and we're seeing the consequences of that when you look at the out-of-pocket cost increases for Australian families. They haven't done enough, and that's because they can't be trusted when it comes to health care.

"Sudmalis, Ann, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (12:40):  The words I present today are to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018. Every government since 1996-97 has generally decided to increase the low-income thresholds in line with the positive movements of the CPI each year. We all know what CPI means, but, just as a reminder, the consumer price index is a formal way of buying a whole range of items that could be part of household costs, averaging it out and comparing it with the last time the task was done. The increase, through a range of calculations, results in the CPI. The CPI figure is used by many different government departments to calculate a range of changes that apply to pensions and other income support mechanisms. We know that age pensions go up in March and September every year in line with CPI. More importantly, if we don't change the taxable threshold in line with that rise in CPI then people who currently don't pay extra, including the Medicare levy, will have to pay.


Essentially, this bill is about changing the threshold of low-income families before they have to start paying the fees or levies. It's about reducing the impact on low-income families. The Medicare levy low-income threshold makes sure that people who pay no personal income tax because of the tax-free threshold and structural offsets, like the low-income tax offset or the seniors and pensioners tax offset, generally don't pay the Medicare levy yet are able to get into the Medicare system. This is an essential part of ensuring that everyone who does not currently pay continues to not have to pay. It is part of our government guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on. 


A stronger economy has enabled the government to deliver record investment in Medicare, hospitals, schools and disability services. Australians have guaranteed access to high-quality hospitals and schools, not because we have the lion's share of direct funding to either hospitals or schools but because we have strong agreements with the state governments about investment in these two essential parts of our daily lives that affect all our families. In addition, we have the revenue for the delivery of a strong Medicare system, which is vital and needs to be there to provide the services to those with permanent and significant disabilities as well as those who get ill or who need to go to the doctor or a specialist. One of the problems is that we don't have enough doctors or specialists out there who bulk-bill. That is an issue. But if we've got a good Medicare system then we've got choices. 


Talking about choice, we're providing more choice for older Australians to live healthier, more independent and safer lives so that they can take advantage of the opportunities that a longer life brings. It's not just about house cleaning, daily nurses visiting or carers coming to help with daily walks for someone recovering from a knee replacement. Each and every activity like these helps our older people have a better time, a quality time, while they remain in their own homes. A government cannot invest in such services unless there is a very strong economy to back that up—and we are doing exactly that. 


Our record investment in schools will give teachers the tools to lift the performance of their students and prepare them for the jobs of the future. As a former science teacher, I'm proud that we have delivered these reforms. I've seen fantastic changes in my local schools where the additional investment has been allocated to teacher training and student courses that have never been offered before. We're looking at recommendations from the review to achieve educational excellence in Australian schools.


From July 2018, the government will ease the cost-of-living pressures for nearly a million Australian families by implementing the new childcare package. And I take this opportunity to remind families in my electorate to register: there are about 5,000 families in Gilmore who will absolutely be better off, but they do need to register.


We have record levels of funding going to hospital services, the Medicare Benefits Schedule and pharmaceutical benefits. Just recently, I had Stan come in. He has lung cancer, and we've put his drug on the PBS. So, instead of it costing him 350 bucks a pop, it's the cost of a script. I then had Richard, who has trouble breathing. A new drug has come through the PBS, so that instead of $204 a hit it's the cost of a script.


If you don't have a strong economy you simply can't deliver these changes, and we're doing it. We're trying to get rural health stronger and I know that all the people who I have seen in my local area want to make this better as well. We're working hard with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. In fact, our revenue is so good that we don't have to change the Medicare levy; we've actually got the funding there to support this scheme for all our people.


The Medicare Guarantee Fund is going to be increased. An additional $34.4 billion has gone to this fund, and a further credit of $35.3 billion will be made to meet the estimated MBS and PBS expenditure in 2018-19. We've got cystic fibrosis testing, 3D breast cancer screening and MRI tests for prostate cancer. You can't do any of that unless you've got the revenue to support that, and we're doing that. I think it's fantastic we've got solar coming into the local regions and community groups. Again, these are grants and subsidies that can only come out through a strong economy. There are a whole stack of things that have been brought through for people with diabetes. There is the insulin pump for young children—an investment of $6.2 million, and I would like to give a shout out to the DENNY Foundation, who were great advocates for that, with Pieta Newport and Marg Smith involved locally. They really got me involved in it and made me understand how important that was.


Medicare is not at risk. With an additional one million jobs, that's a huge increase in revenue for the Medicare levy, not to mention the huge investment by the government. This is an outstanding investment from a strong government with strong revenue streams. I commend the bill.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Treasurer) (12:47):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those members who contributed to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2018. I particularly thank the member for Gilmore, who I think has set the matter out incredibly well. A stronger economy means the government no longer needs to proceed with the change in the Medicare levy as we advised before the budget this year. It also means the government is able to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold as set out in this bill.


Through our plan for a stronger economy, the Turnbull government is guaranteeing essential services that Australians rely on. Funding for Medicare has been guaranteed in legislation by this government, as we promised we would—another commitment kept. But there's a much stronger guarantee that this government provides for Medicare, for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for social security payments, for childcare support, for schools funding, for hospitals funding and for any area of essential service and support that the government provides. And that is that this government has a plan for a stronger economy that's delivering. The Labor Party can make whatever claim they like about what they think they're going to spend, but if they don't have a plan for a stronger economy they can't pay for it. And, when they hear 'revenue', all they hear is the need to increase taxes. When we hear that, we know the need to create a stronger economy that generates the revenue—not to tax the economy out of existence.


A stronger economy is what guarantees Medicare. A stronger economy is what guarantees schools funding. A stronger economy guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on. Essential services aren't guaranteed by politicians making promises, like the Labor Party does. They're guaranteed by governments that know how to support and grow an economy—as this government has overseen, with more than a million people getting jobs over the last five years. A million people have got jobs over the last five years. That's a simple fact, and they've been created by Australian businesses. Australian businesses have created those jobs—Australian businesses that have been benefitting from the pro-business, pro-economic policies that enable them to grow.


The Labor Party has a proposal for business and the economy, and that's to tax them out of business. If you tax businesses out of business, what happens is you don't have the money to guarantee Medicare and you don't have the money to list important life-saving drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If you don't have policies for a stronger economy, you don't have a policy for Medicare. If you don't have a policy for a stronger economy and a plan, you don't have a policy for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. All you have are glib promises that you can't back up.


This bill ensures—and demonstrates once again—that, through the strong economic and financial management of the Turnbull government, we are in a position to be able to move forward on this measure. The bill will assist Australians on low incomes by continuing to exempt them from paying the Medicare levy. These changes will ensure that low-income households who did not pay the Medicare levy in the 2016-17 income year will generally continue to be exempt in the 2017-18 income year if their incomes have risen in line with or less than the consumer price index. For individual taxpayers, no Medicare levy will be payable for those with a taxable income that does not exceed $21,980 in 2017-18, which has increased from $21,655. Single senior pensioners with no dependants who are eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset will not incur a Medicare levy liability if their taxable income does not exceed $34,758 in 2017-18, which has increased from $34,244. As well as these individual thresholds, further relief is available for low-income couples and families. The amendments to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds apply to the 2017-18 year of income and future income years.


Again, the government's plan for a stronger economy is delivering more jobs and it's guaranteeing essential services that Australians rely on—and it is making sure that we do all of that while ensuring that the government continues to live within its means. That is at the heart of the government's approach to guaranteeing those essential services. It's something you can take to the bank—because, if you have a stronger economy, you can take it to the bank. Otherwise, it's just a promise that you have to take back to the Labor Party—a promise that they can never deliver on because they cannot run a stronger economy. But I welcome Labor's support for this bill. They are just fortunate that there's a Turnbull government in place that can run a strong budget and a strong economy that can pay for it. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (13:29):  Continuing my Youth Voices in Parliament campaign, I'd like to introduce Karthik, a 16-year-old student passionate about the NBN. These are his words:


Australia must invest generously towards maintaining and upgrading our technological capabilities to ensure that, as an economy, we have the best chance of competing with the rest of the world. As a result of it's handling, the NBN has simply not turned out the way that I and many other young people will have wanted. Many of us are still stuck behind slow download speeds, especially during peak usage hours. I speak for many in asking for an improvement in our current situation. As a Twenty-First Century child, I have grown up in a world surrounded by technology and the internet, and it has shaped my life greatly, and will continue to impact my life and the lives of those in my generation. I use modern technology in both work and play. We can make use of it to talk with friends and family, or entertain ourselves. But we must be aware that it is impacting the way we work now, and will work in the future. New jobs and fields are being created because of technology.


While I cannot say for certain what exactly the future holds, I can say for sure that technology will play a very large part. Modern advances in technology have greatly improved efficiency by making a lot of things easier and it has vastly aided in spreading the wealth of human knowledge …


… I want to use my rare opportunity to talk, to advocate for more investment in technology. Whatever form it takes, whether it be helping start-ups or upgrading infrastructure, Australia must do something to make sure it is not left behind.


Thanks, Karthik!

Mr HASTIE
 (Canning) (15:13):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present advisory reports on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018 and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017.


Reports made parliamentary papers in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr HASTIE:
  by leave—I am pleased to present the committee's report for its review of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017.


The Prime Minister introduced the bill into the House on 7 December 2017 and referred it to the committee for inquiry and report.


The bill repeals existing criminal offences and introduces a range of new offences into the Criminal Code in relation to espionage, foreign interference, theft of trade secrets, sabotage of public infrastructure, and secrecy of Commonwealth information.


The bill also amends a range of existing offences, including those in relation to treason, treachery, and other threats to security.


The significant and unprecedented new measures in the bill required careful consideration, and the committee was pleased to undertake the inquiry.


During its inquiry, the committee received compelling evidence that Australia is facing an unprecedented threat from espionage and foreign interference, and that current laws are not adequate to deal with this threat.


The Director-General of Security, in strongly supporting the bill, advised the committee that, 'the current criminal offences are inadequate to deal with the foreign intelligence threat that we now face' and described existing offences as 'outdated and deficient' and 'inadequate or unworkable'.


As a result, ASIO assessed that the 'net effect is that our nation's freedom of decision-making and core interests are not adequately protected by the rule of law'.


Unchecked, espionage has the potential to significantly reduce Australia's long-term security, and foreign interference could undermine our democracy and threaten the rights and freedoms of our people.


Economic espionage also has the potential to substantially diminish Australia's economic wellbeing and international competitiveness. At stake is our sovereignty, security and prosperity.


The committee has therefore accepted that there is a pressing need to strengthen and modernise current espionage and foreign interference laws.


In conducting its review, the committee received 51 written submissions and 20 supplementary submissions from a range of organisations and individuals.


The committee held five public and two private hearings, and received two classified briefings.


Many participants in the inquiry supported strengthened measures to deal with the threat posed by increased espionage and foreign interference activities in Australia.


Submitters also called for caution to ensure that innocuous or beneficial conduct is not caught up in the proposed new offences, and that sections of the Australian community are not adversely affected.


The committee considers that laws need to be effective at achieving their stated aims, at the same time as minimising any limitations on the personal liberty of Australians and a flourishing civil society.


Taking into account evidence received from participants in the inquiry, the committee has made a range of recommendations aimed at ensuring the bill is:


clear and unambiguous in its terms,


proportional and appropriately targeted to the threat, and


enforceable.


The committee has made 60 recommendations in total—the most important being that the bill be passed through both the House and the Senate.


On 5 March 2018, the Attorney-General provided the committee with a number of proposed government amendments, primarily to narrow the scope of the secrecy offences in the bill.


These proposed amendments have been taken into account—and supported—by the committee.


Following implementation of the recommendations in the report, the committee has recommended that the bill be passed. I'd like to personally thank the opposition members of the PJCIS, particularly the deputy chair, the member for Holt, and also the member for Isaacs, who worked in the national interest to deliver a bipartisan report. When we have such strong collaboration, it makes the passage of these bills all the more sweeter, so I acknowledge the work that they did on the committee.


The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (No. 1) 2018 was introduced on 24 May this year.


In reviewing the bill, the committee considered the proposed amendments to be consistent with recommendations made by the committee earlier this year following its review of police stop, search and seizure powers, the control order regime, the preventative detention order regime and the declared area provisions.


The committee welcomed the acceptance of its recommendations that the counterterrorism powers be extended by a further three years, with reviews by this committee prior to the new sunset date.


These future reviews will be an opportunity to examine the impact of amendments to the control order regime and declared area provisions.


They will also provide an opportunity to assess the efficacy of the regimes and, accordingly, the continued need for these powers in the context of the security environment at that time.


The committee noted that, while the bill implements one recommendation from the committee's report into ASIO's questioning and detention powers, the remainder of that report—including the committee's recommendation for repeal of the questioning and detention warrant power—is still being considered by the government.


The committee supports the amendments as proposed and recommends that the bill be passed.


I commend both reports to the House.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (15:19):  by leave—I thank the chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for those short statements in tabling the committee's report on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and also the committee's report on a range of powers—namely, the control order power; the declared areas power; the stop, search and seizure power; and the preventative detention order power—which is the subject of the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2018; that is the title of the report.


There are two matters I wish to draw to the attention of the House. The first is that, in relation to this second bill, the government has accepted the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is that these extraordinary powers—the control order power; the declared areas power; the stop, search and seizure power; and the preventative detention order power—should all be treated as just that: extraordinary powers that should not be regarded as at any point going permanently into the Australian statute book. To that end, the committee recommended that a further sunset period of three years be extended to them. The government has accepted that recommendation.


There's one other matter of particular significance in this bill, which the committee has commented on and the chair has already mentioned in his remarks, and that is that two other powers, which are only peripherally the subject of this bill—namely, the questioning and detention warrant power and the questioning warrant power—are to be extended for one year. That's because the government has yet to respond in a formal sense to the committee's separate report on the questioning and detention warrant power and the questioning warrant power. That report recommended that the questioning and detention warrant power be repealed and that the questioning warrant power be retained but substantially amended. While it is considering its response to that report the government has decided that, because both those provisions sunset in September this year, it's appropriate that they be extended for a period of one year.


In particular, I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that, as has been noted, this recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for repeal of the questioning and detention warrant power marks the first time since 2002, when this parliament legislated a whole range of extraordinary powers being given to our police and our security agencies, that a power would be repealed. As the committee has noted, because this bill does not provide a complete response, the committee and this parliament are awaiting the government's response to that recommendation. I have every confidence that the government will accept the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for repeal, for the first time, of an extraordinary power granted to, in this case, ASIO. It's a recommendation that follows an identical recommendation made by two reports of two separate independent national security legislation monitors. I thank the House.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (19:30):  The Australian Cyber Security Centre 2017 threat report noted that CERT Australia responded to 734 incidents affecting private-sector systems of national critical infrastructure within the 2016-17 financial year. This equates to a significant cyberincident occurring on these networks more than twice a day. In October 2017, the US-CERT released a report that stated:


Since at least May 2017, threat actors have targeted government entities and the energy, water, aviation, nuclear, and critical manufacturing sectors, and, in some cases, have leveraged their capabilities to compromise victims' networks.


According to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation 2017 annual report, Australia continues to be a target of espionage through cyber means. The cyberthreat is persistent, it's sophisticated and it is not limited by geography. The report also notes that the clandestine acquisition of intellectual property, science and technology and commercially sensitive information is increasing. This highlights the need for a greater focus on the security of the cybersystems underpinning our critical infrastructure.


If we are to effectively safeguard our critical infrastructure, we need to think about more than the issue of who owns what and the issue of physical assets such as ports, poles and wires. We need to think beyond just the protection of critical infrastructure from a physical perspective and we need to start thinking about the protection of critical infrastructure from a cybersecurity perspective. As more and more essential services are managed electronically, interdependence between the physical systems and cybernetworks needs to be clearly understood to ensure services continue to be provided and our national interest continues to be protected. We also need to broaden our thinking on what is classified as critical infrastructure.


Australia's Trusted Information Sharing Network, the primary national mechanism for business-to-government information sharing and resilience-building initiatives on critical infrastructure, describes critical infrastructure as the physical facilities, supply chains, information technologies and communication networks which, if destroyed, degraded or rendered unavailable for an extended period, would significantly impact on the social or economic wellbeing of the nation or affect Australia's ability to conduct national defence and ensure national security. It states that each of these critical infrastructure sectors are vital to Australia's social cohesion, economic prosperity and public safety.


Why did the government's recent Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 only address four sectors as being at the highest risk? We actually have eight critical infrastructure sectors in this country. These are the sectors that have been deemed as vital to Australia's social cohesion, economic prosperity and public safety. We have eight, so why did the act only include four sectors that are deemed as highest risk? I'll read out our eight. They are banking and finance, communication, energy, food and grocery, health, transport, water services and Commonwealth government. Each of these identified critical infrastructure sectors have experienced some form of cyberthreat in the past 12 month. It is great that we have eight—though, unfortunately, all eight weren't included in the government's critical infrastructure act—but, compared to other nations, we are very, very underdone. Eight is a conservative number. The United States critical infrastructure security and resilience strategy identifies 16 sectors, the United Kingdom identifies 13 sectors, Canada identifies 10 sectors and Singapore identifies 11 sectors. The sectors that are recognised by these nations include emergency services, information technology, infrastructure, chemicals, manufacturing and electoral systems. At the very least, electoral systems in Australia should be treated as critical infrastructure, particularly given what we've seen in the US and France.


We have got to start taking this seriously. We have got to start taking our critical infrastructure seriously. It's not enough only to protect the physical safety of our critical infrastructure; to partially list those services and facilities that are vital to our cohesion, economic prosperity or public safety; to ignore international cybersecurity standards; or to pretend that threats end where the supply chain starts. There is so much more to do in this space. I just wish the government were listening.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (10:29):  I want to congratulate the Riding for the Disabled Association of Western Australia South-West Centre. They are based in Gelorup, and recently they celebrated their 40th birthday. From very humble beginnings in 1978, they have now grown to servicing over 2,000 clients in the region. The work of founding members Maud Stanley, Olga Green and Jean Lishman has been vital in ensuring that countless people with disabilities have experienced the organisation's amazing services. All three women were instrumental in setting up the association and have volunteered thousands of hours over its 40 years, as you can imagine. Deservedly, they've all received life membership. 


During Maud Stanley's long association with the organisation, she became a coach for both therapeutic riding and hippotherapy. Nowadays, Maud still coaches the hippotherapy group and is on the WA hippo committee. Olga was a coach until retiring just a few years ago. Jean also retired recently. She started in the therapeutic riding sessions before moving to hippotherapy, and she became involved in the WA hippo central committee.


I acknowledge the tireless work of the centre's other life members: Robert Warwick, Stanley Buck, Lorraine Monahan, Patricia Thompson, Dorothy Orloff, Geoff Brown, Terry Guiness and Ken Wood. I thank all the local sponsors and donors, who have made sure that Riding for the Disabled has been able to continue its work. I have seen firsthand as a patron in Harvey the freedom that someone with severe disability has on the back of a horse. It's amazing how the horses adjust to the movements and the needs of the individual on their backs. It's just extraordinary. 


Medical professionals recognise there are significant therapeutic benefits for people across the board from connecting with horses. The three-dimensional movement of horses transferred through the rider's body relaxes people and strengthens core stability, reducing spasms and improving balance, posture and coordination. The joy on the faces of people who are on the backs of those horses has to be seen to be believed. For some of them, it is their first independent movement ever. 


Across the state, Riding for the Disabled provide more than horseriding. Vaulting, carriage driving, dressage and, as you heard before, hippotherapy are also services they provide. For many people with a disability, the organisation gives them the opportunity to get out of the house and participate in an activity that they otherwise wouldn't have the chance to.


I commend the great work that Riding for the Disabled do in Gelorup and right across Australia, particularly that of the hardworking volunteers in the south-west, in my electorate.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (11:01):  I commend the member for Farrer on the introduction of this important bill, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018. I also commend her and her co-sponsors for the courage they have shown in difficult circumstances. It is never easy to rally against your party's own policy position, and it is even more courageous to pursue the issue down the path of a private member's bill.


The reality is that the morality the live sheep trade relies upon is fundamentally broken. It has three basic flaws. First, it is reliant on the dreaded Northern Hemisphere summer trade—a trade which is completely incompatible with reasonable animal welfare standards. The science leaves us in no doubt about that. Second, the trade externalises animal welfare cruelty. The premiums earned by exporters as a result of cruel conditions, like excessive stocking densities, are externalised in the form of higher than normal payments to sheepmeat producers. This, of course, has the added disadvantage of putting at a disadvantage domestic processors here in Australia. Third, consumer preferences and community tolerance for the poor treatment of animals are both turning away from the live sheep model. The writing is on the wall, in any case.


It is a statement of fact to say that members and senators from a majority of parties represented in this parliament have now expressed support for the provisions within this bill, and they are important provisions. What this bill would do, first of all, is put an immediate stop to that northern summer trade: that practice of jamming tens of thousands of live sheep onto a vessel for a three- or four-week voyage in the hottest and most humid climatic conditions in the world. That has to stop. Second, it would phase out the balance of the trade over a five-year period, providing the sector with sufficient time to make the transition. When I say 'the sector', I'm talking mainly about those sheepmeat producers who have become dependent on the live-export trade for—in part at least—their livelihood.


I am very strongly of the view that, with the right strategic red meat industry plan, we can assist sheepmeat producers in making that transition, to take them to a better place both in animal welfare terms and in terms of sustainable profitability. And, at the same time, we can create a structure in this country which allows us to do more value-adding here in Australia, creating more jobs in Australia. So this strategic red meat plan will be good for sheepmeat producers, it will be good for the Australian economy, it will be good for Australian jobs, and, of course, it will produce better animal welfare standards.


We all know the reality of the difficulty in getting the member for Farrer's bill through this parliament. The Senate—not so difficult, in my view. I'm very confident about its prospects there. In fact, today, a bill pretty much replicating the member for Farrer's bill is being introduced into the Senate, so we'll give the parliament plenty of opportunities. But it will be difficult because the government will not give preference to either of these bills in the House, and, of course, to have them voted upon in the House will require an absolute majority. I was going to provide the parliament with yet another opportunity, and I've foreshadowed my intention of moving amendments to the bill proposed by the government which increases penalties in the live export trade. To secure support in the House for that amendment will only require, of course, a simple majority. 


What has happened to that bill now? The government has pulled the bill from the legislative program to save the risk of losing those amendments in the House. If the government is confident of my amendment being defeated, it should just bring the bill on. We can only assume, as it withholds the bill, that it's not confident of defeating my amendments in the House. In other words, it's pushing against the will of the House of Representatives. It's clear this is the will of the House of Representatives. It's clear a number of members of the Liberal Party want to support me and the member for Farrer, and they should be allowed to do so.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:06):  I'd like to thank the member for Farrer for bringing forward the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018 and this important debate. Astute listeners will note that the area of Bennelong is quite ovinely challenged. In fact, to my knowledge, there is not one sheep domiciled in the corner of Sydney that I represent, but that doesn't mean people in my electorate don't care deeply about this issue. In the last few years, I've had hundreds of locals contact me to express their concerns with this ongoing trade. They demand their concerns be addressed. On the other side of this argument are the farmers who depend on live sheep exports for their ongoing livelihood. To stop the exports tonight would bring devastation to their families. Maintaining this policy may hurt some sheep but will save farmers. Stopping it helps sheep but hurts farmers. We need to move to a policy where both are safe, but, in this matter, as in many, the art of transition is key.


Politics is often a battle of heads against hearts. It's easy and tempting to take an emotive line on many issues, but government must always be led by facts. Governing should involve an information led, rational compromise that allows everybody to get ahead. For this reason, I am opposed to the policy put forward by the Labor Party. Stopping exports without a clear, thought-through time frame would devastate the industry and leave farmers destitute. This is a bad policy that will hurt families across our regions. At the same time, this is why I feel, if properly implemented, a policy like the member for Farrer's is sensible. A five-year transition period would allow time for the market to prepare for the impact of this policy while alleviating the most extreme of the shipboard conditions. The last Labor government almost destroyed the cattle industry with its overnight shutdown, and we can't make the same mistakes they did. I'll defer to the member for Farrer on the finer points of agricultural policy, but I would hope that five years would be enough time to make the relevant changes for farmers across the country. If this time is not economically viable, it can be amended, but it would seem a fair period of time.


This phasing-out process would need to echo many of the policies already implemented by the government, and it is pleasing to note that the government has accepted all recommendations from the McCarthy review of sheep exports to the Middle East during the northern summer, which was released on 17 May 2018. Facts show us that live sheep exports are now safer than they have ever been before. More sheep actually die on road transports than at sea. The government can be congratulated for the great improvements made to the trade by making it safer.


We also know that the value of live sheep exports has decreased dramatically over the past few years, which has been confirmed by the department of agriculture. Live exports are now only six per cent of the total sheep turn-off. The other 94 per cent is processed, packaged and frozen domestically before being exported. The extra processing employs more Australians and makes economic sense. In 2016-17, the total global value of Australian lamb was $1.9 billion, and mutton was worth $719 million. Both lamb and mutton value have increased dramatically from 2010-11 figures, reflecting growing demand and the opening up of new markets such as China. Most of this growth is in the frozen product. So there is a market here that we can expand into and capitalise on.


The art of transition is the most important skill in politics and one we need to get much better at. Knee-jerk responses to crises are never sustainable and usually hurt more people than they help. This seems like a sensible policy of transition and, so long as it stacks up economically, the government should consider it further. The countering views have been expressed. It is now time to settle on common sense.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:11):  At the outset, I commend the member for Farrer for having the courage to introduce this bill, and those of her colleagues who have supported her. In my understanding of my community, I would summarise the community attitude to this as being: 'enough is enough'. After all the outrage, the numerous reviews, the years of hand-wringing, and the stalling, it's time that the parliament acted decisively and passed this private member's bill, to end the live sheep export trade once and for all. It is an issue that crosses the political divide. It matters in the cities, it matters in the towns, it matters in the bush. No Australian who has seen the latest footage could be anything but appalled and horrified. We cannot unsee this. We cannot just turn away. We should not be cramming live sheep into boiling metal ships and casting them out in the Indian Ocean for weeks on end, in the hopes of propping up an already failing industry. The reality is that there is no way to regulate this trade that will prevent animals dying cruelly at sea. As the member for Farrer said when she introduced this bill: 'Regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs.'


The government's weak response just makes things a little bit less awful. At best, the government's policy will give the sheep a bit more space: an extra A3 sheet of paper—a better class of cruelty, if you like. It's a tacit admission by the government that they're going to keep letting sheep be slowly cooked alive. That may sound shocking. It's appalling language, if you think about the reality of what that means. But in listening to those opposite who continue in tortuous bits of flawed logic to defend the indefensible, it wouldn't surprise me if one of them jumped up and said: 'Look, I think we need to innovate this industry. We'll export them with some tomatoes and rosemary and garlic and they can be pre-cooked meals on arrival.' The state of those sheep is nothing short of disgusting when they arrive.


Should this bill pass, it will end the live-export trade in the hot Northern Hemisphere summer months and then phase out the trade altogether over the subsequent five years. For years now, the government has used the issue of live sheep exports as an electoral wedge, so that anyone speaking up on this and expressing a view somehow means they are antifarmers or antitrade. The tenure of the former Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for New England and minister for agriculture, was disgraceful. He didn't just do nothing—he actually took pride in weakening and undermining the existing protections for animal welfare. The initial reaction from the current minister to the latest footage was positive and strong, but it was a short-lived breath of fresh air, in my opinion. Sadly, he has gone back to normal programming. The government's lack of moral compass is seen in its crab walk away from any real action.


The review was headed by a veterinarian who works for the industry, and it is a profound disappointment. With respect to my colleague the member for Bennelong, the government haven't adopted all of the review's weak recommendations. They've said they accept them, but they won't implement them. It's tricky words. You say you accept, but won't do. Nothing changes. This is particularly so with recommendation 4, which would have practically ended the live sheep export trade in the sweltering Northern Hemisphere summer. So it's unclear to anyone outside the cabinet whether the minister has caved to the industry, was rolled in cabinet or just lost his spine, which seems to be a fairly common thing for those opposite when they enter the Turnbull cabinet. But, whatever happened, he has precious little to be proud of—he's certainly no misnomer. 


The overwhelming scientific and economic evidence supports ending this trade. The Australian Veterinary Association, the RSPCA and countless animal welfare groups have told us that there is simply no way that the northern summer sheep trade can continue if animal welfare considerations are to be adequately met. And the economists have told us there's simply no long-term future for this failing industry. It's been in decline for over two decades. So, as legislators, we should act now to ensure the welfare of Australian animals and to provide transitional support, in a timetable, for farmers who currently rely on the industry for their livelihood. There've been some people in animal welfare groups who've said five years is too long; others have said it's long enough. In reality, the five-year period probably strikes a reasonable and correct balance in allowing farmers and exporters time to transition. 


So, in summary, we can stop this cruel trade. We must stop this cruel trade. The moral, scientific and economic case is clear. The evidence requires us as legislators to act. The community have had enough, and Australia's international reputation will be damaged if we don't act. Allowing this to continue is not who we are as a people.

Mr RICK WILSON
 (O'Connor) (11:16):  I rise to oppose this private member's bill, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, on four grounds: firstly, the effect it will have on the hardworking farmers, truck drivers, stock agents and ancillary industries such as pellet manufacturers, who rely heavily on the live export trade for their livelihoods; secondly, the loss of the positive impact the ESCAS has had on animal welfare outcomes for not only Australian animals but all animals in destination countries; thirdly, the wider trade implications with the Middle East; and, finally, the live sheep trade in the Middle East is much larger than Australian supply, so our animals will be substituted with animals from sub-Saharan Africa, the Black Sea and South America.


The live export trade is worth around $250 million to the Australian economy, with over 85 per cent of this income generated from WA, largely from my electorate. After the closure of the live export trade in 2011, prices for shipping wethers fell from the $80 to $100 per head range to $5 per head, recovering to the $20 to $30 a head range in the months following. This of course dragged the entire sheep market down by over 50 per cent and sent many businesses to the wall. 


I have received hundreds of emails from constituents who have been suffering great uncertainty and anxiety over the future of their businesses following the introduction of this private member's bill. Many farmers, like me, were shocked to see the animals they had raised and nurtured suffer due to the extreme weather event on the Awassi Express. But it's worth noting that live export mortalities currently average 0.7 per cent per voyage, compared to 1.9 per cent in the 1990s. So this is a massive improvement over the last 15 years. This can be compared to Australian annual grazing losses of up to five per cent. One farmer reminded me: 'Mother Nature imposes things on us that can cause livestock losses, despite our best intentions.' Livestock transporter Andy Jacobs sits on the committee of the Livestock and Rural Transport Association of WA. He states that over 25 per cent of their members will be adversely affected by any industry closure, and many are only just recovering from the 2011 shutdown. Andy also provided this sobering reminder: 'Human life is important too. In 2011 we lost good people to suicide as a direct result of the loss of this trade, let alone the animals that needed to be destroyed.'


Our ESCAS has actually lifted animal welfare standards across export destination nations for all sheep, not only Australian sheep.




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  You should give the Labor Party credit for it.




Mr RICK WILSON:
  I give the Labor Party credit for that, Joel. What will happen to the sheep from countries with less stringent welfare requirements? Middle Eastern countries import around 10 million sheep per annum, of which Australia contributes only 1.6 to 1.8 million. Contrary to assertions that this market is shrinking, global food company GIRA forecasts that demand will increase by 2.5 per cent per annum between now and 2022.


The Saudi market accounts for around 56 per cent of the world live sheep market and sits outside the ESCAS. Prior to 2009, these sheep came largely from Australia, but the bulk of these sheep are now sourced primarily from Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan. The assumption that ceasing live exports will simply drive substitution to chilled Australian meat is incorrect. We only have to look to Bahrain to see that in 2015, when the live export market became unviable due to changes to government subsidies, MLA figures showed that our chilled meat exports have shrunk from 11,987 tonnes in 2014 to 7,423 tonnes in 2017.


The fact is that live export is actually increasing. Comparisons have been made between New Zealand and Australia, but New Zealand has always been a prime lamb producer and has never had a substantial live export industry. Australia, on the other hand, is primarily a wool-producing nation with mutton meat a lower valued by-product for domestic consumption. Chilled mutton is worth roughly half of what chilled lamb is. Livestock Shipping Services exports both live and chilled meat from WA to the Middle East. LSS recently purchased export shippers from WA farmers for over $100 a head, but managing director Paul Keenan informed me that, if these shippers were slaughtered at their Hillside abattoir in Narrogin, they would have only returned around $70 per head. General manager Ahmad Ghosheh added that the current capacity to move chilled product to the Middle East is full and that it will continue to diminish with the withdrawal of Etihad Airways daily flight from Perth to the Middle East.


Meanwhile, last month Al Mawashi, the Kuwaiti livestock transport and trading company that buys most of the 1.8 million live sheep exported from Australia, warned of wider ramifications for Australian agricultural commodities. CEO Usama Boodai stated:


… doubts about Australian sheep means Al Mawashi is already looking to find other secure sources of livestock—


in countries such as Somalia and Romania. He also said:


This could also bring into question the significant volumes of fodder we import for feeding Australian sheep in our feedlots, as well as the chilled and frozen sheep meat we also import.



In closing, I commend the minister for the strong stand he has taken with the imposition of stricter stocking density rates, independent observers on all voyages and significantly increased financial and criminal penalties. (Time expired)

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (11:01):  I commend the member for Farrer on the introduction of this important bill, the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018. I also commend her and her co-sponsors for the courage they have shown in difficult circumstances. It is never easy to rally against your party's own policy position, and it is even more courageous to pursue the issue down the path of a private member's bill.


The reality is that the morality the live sheep trade relies upon is fundamentally broken. It has three basic flaws. First, it is reliant on the dreaded Northern Hemisphere summer trade—a trade which is completely incompatible with reasonable animal welfare standards. The science leaves us in no doubt about that. Second, the trade externalises animal welfare cruelty. The premiums earned by exporters as a result of cruel conditions, like excessive stocking densities, are externalised in the form of higher than normal payments to sheepmeat producers. This, of course, has the added disadvantage of putting at a disadvantage domestic processors here in Australia. Third, consumer preferences and community tolerance for the poor treatment of animals are both turning away from the live sheep model. The writing is on the wall, in any case.


It is a statement of fact to say that members and senators from a majority of parties represented in this parliament have now expressed support for the provisions within this bill, and they are important provisions. What this bill would do, first of all, is put an immediate stop to that northern summer trade: that practice of jamming tens of thousands of live sheep onto a vessel for a three- or four-week voyage in the hottest and most humid climatic conditions in the world. That has to stop. Second, it would phase out the balance of the trade over a five-year period, providing the sector with sufficient time to make the transition. When I say 'the sector', I'm talking mainly about those sheepmeat producers who have become dependent on the live-export trade for—in part at least—their livelihood.


I am very strongly of the view that, with the right strategic red meat industry plan, we can assist sheepmeat producers in making that transition, to take them to a better place both in animal welfare terms and in terms of sustainable profitability. And, at the same time, we can create a structure in this country which allows us to do more value-adding here in Australia, creating more jobs in Australia. So this strategic red meat plan will be good for sheepmeat producers, it will be good for the Australian economy, it will be good for Australian jobs, and, of course, it will produce better animal welfare standards.


We all know the reality of the difficulty in getting the member for Farrer's bill through this parliament. The Senate—not so difficult, in my view. I'm very confident about its prospects there. In fact, today, a bill pretty much replicating the member for Farrer's bill is being introduced into the Senate, so we'll give the parliament plenty of opportunities. But it will be difficult because the government will not give preference to either of these bills in the House, and, of course, to have them voted upon in the House will require an absolute majority. I was going to provide the parliament with yet another opportunity, and I've foreshadowed my intention of moving amendments to the bill proposed by the government which increases penalties in the live export trade. To secure support in the House for that amendment will only require, of course, a simple majority. 


What has happened to that bill now? The government has pulled the bill from the legislative program to save the risk of losing those amendments in the House. If the government is confident of my amendment being defeated, it should just bring the bill on. We can only assume, as it withholds the bill, that it's not confident of defeating my amendments in the House. In other words, it's pushing against the will of the House of Representatives. It's clear this is the will of the House of Representatives. It's clear a number of members of the Liberal Party want to support me and the member for Farrer, and they should be allowed to do so.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:06):  I'd like to thank the member for Farrer for bringing forward the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018 and this important debate. Astute listeners will note that the area of Bennelong is quite ovinely challenged. In fact, to my knowledge, there is not one sheep domiciled in the corner of Sydney that I represent, but that doesn't mean people in my electorate don't care deeply about this issue. In the last few years, I've had hundreds of locals contact me to express their concerns with this ongoing trade. They demand their concerns be addressed. On the other side of this argument are the farmers who depend on live sheep exports for their ongoing livelihood. To stop the exports tonight would bring devastation to their families. Maintaining this policy may hurt some sheep but will save farmers. Stopping it helps sheep but hurts farmers. We need to move to a policy where both are safe, but, in this matter, as in many, the art of transition is key.


Politics is often a battle of heads against hearts. It's easy and tempting to take an emotive line on many issues, but government must always be led by facts. Governing should involve an information led, rational compromise that allows everybody to get ahead. For this reason, I am opposed to the policy put forward by the Labor Party. Stopping exports without a clear, thought-through time frame would devastate the industry and leave farmers destitute. This is a bad policy that will hurt families across our regions. At the same time, this is why I feel, if properly implemented, a policy like the member for Farrer's is sensible. A five-year transition period would allow time for the market to prepare for the impact of this policy while alleviating the most extreme of the shipboard conditions. The last Labor government almost destroyed the cattle industry with its overnight shutdown, and we can't make the same mistakes they did. I'll defer to the member for Farrer on the finer points of agricultural policy, but I would hope that five years would be enough time to make the relevant changes for farmers across the country. If this time is not economically viable, it can be amended, but it would seem a fair period of time.


This phasing-out process would need to echo many of the policies already implemented by the government, and it is pleasing to note that the government has accepted all recommendations from the McCarthy review of sheep exports to the Middle East during the northern summer, which was released on 17 May 2018. Facts show us that live sheep exports are now safer than they have ever been before. More sheep actually die on road transports than at sea. The government can be congratulated for the great improvements made to the trade by making it safer.


We also know that the value of live sheep exports has decreased dramatically over the past few years, which has been confirmed by the department of agriculture. Live exports are now only six per cent of the total sheep turn-off. The other 94 per cent is processed, packaged and frozen domestically before being exported. The extra processing employs more Australians and makes economic sense. In 2016-17, the total global value of Australian lamb was $1.9 billion, and mutton was worth $719 million. Both lamb and mutton value have increased dramatically from 2010-11 figures, reflecting growing demand and the opening up of new markets such as China. Most of this growth is in the frozen product. So there is a market here that we can expand into and capitalise on.


The art of transition is the most important skill in politics and one we need to get much better at. Knee-jerk responses to crises are never sustainable and usually hurt more people than they help. This seems like a sensible policy of transition and, so long as it stacks up economically, the government should consider it further. The countering views have been expressed. It is now time to settle on common sense.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (11:11):  At the outset, I commend the member for Farrer for having the courage to introduce this bill, and those of her colleagues who have supported her. In my understanding of my community, I would summarise the community attitude to this as being: 'enough is enough'. After all the outrage, the numerous reviews, the years of hand-wringing, and the stalling, it's time that the parliament acted decisively and passed this private member's bill, to end the live sheep export trade once and for all. It is an issue that crosses the political divide. It matters in the cities, it matters in the towns, it matters in the bush. No Australian who has seen the latest footage could be anything but appalled and horrified. We cannot unsee this. We cannot just turn away. We should not be cramming live sheep into boiling metal ships and casting them out in the Indian Ocean for weeks on end, in the hopes of propping up an already failing industry. The reality is that there is no way to regulate this trade that will prevent animals dying cruelly at sea. As the member for Farrer said when she introduced this bill: 'Regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs.'


The government's weak response just makes things a little bit less awful. At best, the government's policy will give the sheep a bit more space: an extra A3 sheet of paper—a better class of cruelty, if you like. It's a tacit admission by the government that they're going to keep letting sheep be slowly cooked alive. That may sound shocking. It's appalling language, if you think about the reality of what that means. But in listening to those opposite who continue in tortuous bits of flawed logic to defend the indefensible, it wouldn't surprise me if one of them jumped up and said: 'Look, I think we need to innovate this industry. We'll export them with some tomatoes and rosemary and garlic and they can be pre-cooked meals on arrival.' The state of those sheep is nothing short of disgusting when they arrive.


Should this bill pass, it will end the live-export trade in the hot Northern Hemisphere summer months and then phase out the trade altogether over the subsequent five years. For years now, the government has used the issue of live sheep exports as an electoral wedge, so that anyone speaking up on this and expressing a view somehow means they are antifarmers or antitrade. The tenure of the former Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for New England and minister for agriculture, was disgraceful. He didn't just do nothing—he actually took pride in weakening and undermining the existing protections for animal welfare. The initial reaction from the current minister to the latest footage was positive and strong, but it was a short-lived breath of fresh air, in my opinion. Sadly, he has gone back to normal programming. The government's lack of moral compass is seen in its crab walk away from any real action.

Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Chief Nationals Whip) (11:22):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is the planet's greatest living wonder;


(2) further notes that it supports 64,000 jobs and contributes an estimated $6 billion to our economy; and


(3) welcomes the Government's record $500 million boost for Reef protection which will:


(a) invest in a $444 million partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation;


(b) spark new and innovative investment in Reef protection measures;


(c) deliver on projects which are proven to boost the health of the Reef;


(d) improve water quality;


(e) tackle the crown-of-thorns starfish; and


(f) work with traditional owners on this vital project.


When one thinks about what makes this planet so special, it's the thought of the great natural wonders spread across its surface. From the Grand Canyon in the United States to Mount Everest in Nepal, humans are in constant awe of the power, beauty and spectacle of the truly incredible things Mother Nature is capable of.


In 1997, American news service CNN compiled its list of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world—there are just seven examples around the globe that stand alone as magnificent examples of nature, offering both beauty and power. The list followed in the footsteps of previous well-known lists such as the Seven Wonders of the World which featured the most significant examples of man-made magnificence—structures such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Great Pyramids of Giza.


Each time any person or organisation creates a list of the most important, unique natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef is always sure to factor. Stretching some 2,300 kilometres along the tropical east coast of the great state of Queensland, the reef, as we affectionately know it, is the size of a mountain range and as vibrant as a carnival. It is the world's largest coral reef, home to thousands of species of coral, and fish, birds, whales, dugongs and plankton. It is an integral resource for not only Capricornia and Queensland but also the national economy.


While I'm proud to represent the fishers, tour operators and moteliers et cetera of my electorate who rely so directly on the Great Barrier Reef, the story is a much broader and compelling one across the reef's whole footprint. For thousands of years Australians have relied on the bounty provided by the reef. Modern Australia is no different. A 2017 report conducted by Deloitte Australia placed the value of the Great Barrier Reef as a not-to-be-sneezed-at $6.4 billion and estimated its effect on the workforce to be in the value of 64,000 direct and indirect jobs. These are huge figures, figures that must not be ignored. I'm pleased to know that they are not being ignored by this coalition government.


This is a government that, unlike that of those opposite when they were in power, identifies issues and deals with them in a pragmatic manner. We don't just get sad and signal our virtue. We get in and address the real issues. Among the reef's greatest identified threats are run-off pollution and the crown-of-thorns starfish. The recent announcement of $500 million towards addressing these threats was met with open arms recently by two groups in my local community—tourism operators and farmers. The latter may surprise you, but it is our farmers and graziers who have made huge inroads into addressing run-off. Since the Howard government's reef package of well over a decade ago natural resource organisation and landholders have been working together to lighten their impact on the reef. Simple projects like putting in extra water points, fencing off creeks and utilising more-sophisticated spraying techniques make a big difference to what and how much makes its way downstream and onto the reef. 


We know that managing run-off is key to keeping water quality high and the crown-of-thorns numbers low. These projects also have the added benefit of helping landholders better manage their land, in turn driving further economic benefit. Increasing ground cover means not only less dirt runs away but more moisture is held within the soil—grass can grow more quickly and more stock can feed from the same area. Using more-sophisticated techniques for herbicides or fertilisers not only means less chance of these chemicals running off onto the reef but also means landholders are able to use less to do more, saving more money while increasing output.


This means that while these policies are addressing the real factors for the reef's health they are also improving the productivity and resilience of our rural communities. It is an approach very different to those opposite, who have effectively shut down our rural communities for the sake of the reef, placing ideology ahead of a pragmatic solution. The greatest threats to the reef are being addressed by this government, and with $500 million on the table I am confident we can continue to see improvements. I wholeheartedly endorse the government's strategy to address the perils facing one of the world's seven natural wonders and look forward to getting home to enjoy its tropical waters.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (11:27):  Our magnificent Great Barrier Reef, the only living thing on the planet visible from the moon, is a living natural resource that should be cherished and protected, but this coalition government is failing to protect the reef from every angle. We know that the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef is climate change, but what have we seen from that side of the House? We have seen not only that they have undone what Labor did when it was in government but inaction since then, and we've seen emissions rise by 1.4 per cent in the last year. The government's own emissions projections show that Australia will not even come close to meeting our obligations under the Paris agreement.


Under this government's weak emissions reduction target of the National Energy Guarantee there will be very little large-scale investment in renewable energy for the entire decade of the 2020s. Carbon pollution data confirms pollution is rising and will continue to rise under this government's policies all the way to 2030. This government's budget saw not one measure to tackle climate change, not a single cent spent on new climate change policy. You can't be serious about saving the reef without a serious plan to tackle climate change, but Prime Minister Turnbull is too busy pandering to the conservative climate change deniers to take action.


The reef is also an economic issue. Tourism employs around 225,000 Queenslanders, both directly and indirectly. The Great Barrier Reef alone supports 64,000 full-time jobs, and these people rely on a healthy, thriving reef. Deloitte Access Economics estimates the value of our greatest natural treasure, the Barrier Reef, is $56 billion. In addition, the report estimates the reef contributed $6.4 billion to the Australian economy in 2015-16. For communities that rely on tourism for local jobs there will be immense economic consequences if the reef deteriorates. In fact, we've already seen a drop-off in tourism numbers.


One way to protect the reef is through marine parks, but Australia's network of marine parks has been gutted by this government. No matter which way you look at it, the government has now spent four years engaging in the largest removal of area from conservation protection in Australia's history. The Coral Sea has gone from being the jewel in the crown of the Commonwealth marine parks, protecting the eastern side of the Great Barrier Reef, to now being a haven for long-lining and trawling, the same method used by the supertrawler. 


People in my electorate are very concerned about the environment, marine parks and the reef. More than 350 people have emailed me about marine parks in the past few months alone, and Labor have serious concerns about the Great Barrier Reef funding announcement in the budget. The government wants to give itself a pat on the back for that $500 million in the budget, but $444 million of that is in a grant to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and that process has been chaotic at best. The extent to which the Great Barrier Reef Foundation was properly consulted and prepared for an increase in funding of this scale is not clear. After all, it hasn't turned over more than $10 million per year in the last two years, and going from $10 million to $444 million is a massive increase in scale.


The minister repeatedly confirmed during Senate estimates that the foundation did not submit an application, and a competitive process tender was not followed. How is this possible for one of Australia's greatest natural assets? It is not clear that the foundation is even able to cope with a grant of this size, and there is no plan—and there was no plan when the $440 million grant was announced. That is why Labor are making a freedom-of-information request about the funding provided for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. We want to protect the Barrier Reef. It's globally significant, it's a natural wonder, and we should put in our best efforts. 


When Labor were in government, we introduced a carbon trading scheme and we also set up the marine parks—the largest marine park network in the world, and it's something that I was very proud of. It's quite tragic to see this government rip that progress apart and then sit on its hands for so long. We have seen serious bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef over the last couple of years. The reef itself is in danger from climate change. It's just tragic for the entire world, really, that this government isn't taking more action. I strongly urge the members on that side to rethink their position on this and take real action on climate change.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt) (11:32):  There's no doubt about it; the Great Barrier Reef is the greatest living natural wonder on our planet, and I'm fortunate enough to represent a very large portion of that natural wonder, a very significant amount of which the previous speaker was talking about in relation to the impacts of bleaching. 


Rather than just having read some of the stuff that you see being released by the nay-sayers, I actually have a lot of experience on the ground. A lot of my businesses are heavily reliant on the health of the Barrier Reef. It doesn't do anybody any favours, neither us as managers nor businesses that rely on it, when you get this nonsense that's being continually perpetuated by groups that are out there pushing their own agendas. They're creating very, very colourful videos about the fact that the reef is dying, when nothing could be further from the truth. But they're doing it, playing to their own audiences. I tell you now, they would never, ever play those videos up in my electorate, because we know the facts. 


You've got the likes of the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Wilderness Society, the WWF and others pushing these things. The whole thing looks more like a fundraising campaign, because they're playing to very gullible audiences in metropolitan areas, most of whom have never, ever seen and do not understand the facts relating to the reef. But they do it as a very effective fundraiser, as they race out there with their underpants on the outside and capes on, saying, 'We're going to save the reef.' The reef does not require saving. It requires very good management. We are seen already as the best reef managers in the world, and it's important that we continue to be the best reef managers in the world. I say that because I have a real strong interest in the reef, as does my electorate. More than 64,000 jobs and about $6.4 billion of our economy—a very significant part of our economy—are reliant on a healthy reef. It's the biggest economic driver in my electorate; it's one of the biggest employers in my electorate. 


I have to say I get very, very angry when I see these groups out there constantly talking the reef down. They can be talking about the challenges that we have, certainly. We talk about coral bleaching—it's not something we do here in Australia that causes the coral bleaching. It comes from hot currents that come across the waters from South America. It's what happens in China, in India, in the US, in the Northern Hemisphere, that impacts on that. We should be making noises about it, but we're doing a hell of a lot of good work here in Australia mitigating those challenges. We're not able to stop it, until they start dealing with climate change issues in the Northern Hemisphere, where our large polluters are, but we certainly can help to manage it and show others. We're doing that by getting heat-resistant corals. This is some of the work that's been done from the $444 billion—close to half a billion—that's been recently announced. 


I also noticed that there was some criticism regarding the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. The foundation is a very credible organisation. It's highly respected and has had an outstanding history in relation to the handling of government funds. It's not going to be spending the $444 million; that money will be disbursed out to those wonderful people that are doing the crown-of-thorns starfish work and a whole range of other credible organisations. The foundation is basically just holding that money and dispensing it out to others, and it's certainly more capable to do that than most. It's very unfair and unreasonable that it should be criticised—it's a highly reputable not-for-profit organisation. I think it makes a lot of sense that it's able to do that.


I just want to say again that we have to be very, very careful when criticising. Every time we start criticising, we're talking it down, and we are then allowing others to make assumptions that what is being published is true; it is not. We are great reef managers. People come looking to us for advice from around the world. A lot of the campaigns out there against the reef are actually campaigns against fossil fuel, and they see the reef as collateral damage. I applaud the work that we've done, and let's continue to make sure that we do so.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:37):  Sir David Attenborough has travelled to every corner of the globe, but if you ask him to name the most magical place on earth, he responds: the Great Barrier Reef. The reef is an extraordinary ecosystem that contains largest collection of coral reefs—400 types of coral and 1,500 species of fish exist in the reef. There is no other World Heritage property which contains this level of biodiversity. The environmental significance of the reef simply cannot be overstated. But the reef is also an economic asset for the nation. Deloitte have placed the value of the reef at some $56 billion. They measured its contribution to the Australian economy at $6.4 billion in 2015-16, supporting some 64,000 jobs that are a direct result of the Great Barrier Reef, particularly in the tourism sector. The reef is a cornerstone of our tourism economy, and not just in Far North Queensland. It also plays an important role in our national economy, because people who visit Australia visit it, in part, because of the Great Barrier Reef, but they also spend money in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and other parts of the nation. 


This motion is almost ironic, given the government's record on the Great Barrier Reef, because it is this government that wants to lock in the largest removal of conservation areas anywhere in the world, in history. The Labor government instituted Australia's marine park network, comprising the largest network of marine protected areas in the world. This government has plans to strip away swathes of protected areas from these marine parks, making Australia the only country anywhere on the globe that's actually reducing the protection of its oceans.


While the government awarded a $444 million donation to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, it must be said that no application was received and no competitive tender process was undertaken. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation is a reputable organisation, but its previous revenues, going back to 2015 of $9.6 million, and in 2016 $8 million, indicate that it is far from clear if the organisation simply has the capacity to cope with an investment of this size. It's symbolic of the government's chaotic management of this World Heritage listed ecosystem. The fact is this mismanagement hasn't just been bad for the environment; it is also letting down the communities that rely on the Great Barrier Reef for their income. We need a real plan to protect the reef and to protect our oceans. Of course, part of that has to be taking action on climate change, because that is the biggest threat to the ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. That's why Labor's committed to taking real action on climate change, with a commitment, for example, to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030, with a commitment to actually reduce our emissions. That was happening up to 2013, but now, of course, under this government's farcical version of energy policy, where they can't even agree with themselves after more than five years, we don't have an energy policy in this country, and emissions are rising again on this government's watch. The fact is that the budget in May didn't deliver a single dollar on new climate change policy. 


So I want to conclude by echoing again the words of Sir David Attenborough, 'Do we really care so little about the earth upon which we live that we don't wish to protect one of its greatest wonders from the consequences of our behaviours?' This much is clear: our reef does need protection, and this government simply isn't up to the job of providing it. That requires a comprehensive plan on climate change. It requires a comprehensive plan to reduce run-off into the reef. It requires a comprehensive plan to support the tourism sector in Far North and North Queensland.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2018-06-18,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (11:42):  It's interesting that the previous speaker, the honourable member, highlighted the government's half-a-billion-dollar investment in the reef, which we've just made to actually reduce run-off and fund further research into the reef. Contrary to reports from GetUp! and the Greens, the reef isn't dead and it's not covered in toxic sludge. It is very much alive, and it's being enjoyed by thousands of Australians and thousands of international tourists, who haven't been driven away by the extreme Greens' attacks on the reef's reputation. According to a Deloitte report, the Great Barrier Reef is credited with supporting 64,000 jobs directly and indirectly. In all the regions bordering the Great Barrier Reef the reef creates more than 19,000 tourism jobs. That's locally. As a comparison, the resource sector also creates about 19,000 jobs, but that's just in the Mackay region alone, with a further 12,000 created in the Fitzroy or Central Queensland region. The coal industry in Queensland generates thousands upon thousands of jobs. The reef is also responsible for some of those jobs, because workers move to our part of the world to take up jobs that flow from mining dollars, but they also come because of lifestyle, having fishing, diving and island-hopping opportunities. The reef also creates 680 local jobs in the fishing industry, a further 2,889 in recreational industries and 895 in scientific research. 


I had the great pleasure of visiting the Australian Institute of Marine Science in the north of my electorate last week. It's Australia's tropical marine research agency, heavily involved in research based around the reef. The CEO there, Dr Paul Hardisty, showed me some of the projects they were working on, including research to find and breed hardier, more resilient corals that can stand different environmental conditions. The ultimate goal would then be to seed the reef with new and hardier coral after an impact causes coral loss. As we've seen through the history of the reef, the most destructive forces that affect the coral come from cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. As I said at the start, the Liberal-National government recently provided half a billion dollars for reef protection, including a $444 million investment through the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a very reputable organisation that has been slandered a little bit in this place—it's bizarre, actually. The foundation has worked very closely with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.


Successive governments, both state and national, have invested billions of dollars in reef protection, because management of the reef is important—it's a national icon. However, its iconic status is the very reason why you get these extremists out there, using it as a weapon to fight an ideological agenda. GetUp! and the extreme green groups, for instance, make claims about water run-off from the Carmichael mine. Apparently, that is water run-off that's going to kill the reef—even though the mine is hundreds of kilometres and a mountain range away from the coastline, and even further away from the nearest reef. We do things differently up in North Queensland, I'll admit that, but we can't actually run water uphill—not naturally, anyway. The same extremists, supported by Labor and the Greens in this place, and supported by the taxpayer-funded ABC, use the reef to beat up the mining industry and also our farmers, particularly cane farmers, at every opportunity. They accuse miners of dumping toxic sludge on and digging up the reef, and they accuse farmers of covering the reef with chemicals and sediment—none of which is actually true. The extreme green groups use fake news to link farming with outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish on the reef. They don't mention the outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish over in WA, where there is no sugar cane farming, apart from a small section up in the top end. The truth is that mining and the GBR have existed for a very long time, and will exist for a long time to come. Farming and the GBR have existed for a long time, fishing and the GBR have existed for a long time—thousands of years—since the Indigenous people were doing it. It's easy for inner-city socialists to lecture people in north Queensland and tell them to shut down their industries that put food on the table. But the royalties and taxes go into the pockets of government, who actually build the stuff in the capital cities that those inner-city socialists want.


Under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, we had the extreme greens calling the shots, locking up a million square kilometres of some of the most under-fished waters in the world. On the one hand they're telling us they need to stop the GBR and the Coral Sea from being overfished; on the other hand they're telling us that the lock-out won't have a big impact because no-one goes fishing there. You can't have it both ways. If Labor and the Greens supported tourism on the reef, they'd support a tax change to open up superyacht industries. I look forward to them showing support for that, given they're going to be given an opportunity very soon.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (11:47):  Queenslanders are lucky to have almost on our doorstep one of the seven wonders of the natural world, the Great Barrier Reef. While we know how precious the reef is, we also know how fragile it is. 2018 has been named the International Year of the Reef. This is a campaign to raise awareness of how each of us can choose to reduce the impacts of warming ocean temperatures and of the broader climate change effects on reef ecosystems worldwide. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will be hosting and facilitating events for this campaign throughout the year, and I'm sure the member for Herbert will be involved with that.


The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is an important body, established by the Whitlam Labor government in 1975. Its purpose was and continues to be to properly manage the marine park area and protect its biodiversity for future generations. For the last 40 years, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has done just that, and I thank the authority for its skilled and strategic service. It has been recognised internationally for its management of the marine park—so I was completely flummoxed when the Turnbull-Morrison budget announced that a $444 million grant to boost reef protection would be awarded to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and not to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Of course, I'm supportive of endeavours to protect our Great Barrier Reef. The reef's importance is beyond doubt, for our natural heritage, and for our tourism sector and the jobs associated with that, but any allocation of federal money should only be made with due diligence and full transparency, and with the national interest in mind, especially when this is the largest donation the Australian government has ever provided.


During Senate estimates, it was revealed that the Great Barrier Reef Foundation did not submit an application for the funding. A competitive tender process was not followed, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority may not have even been aware of the funding boost as recently as a week before the announcement. The government still has some questions to answer about this $444 million funding allocation. The Great Barrier Reef Foundation employs six full-time members and five part-time members. The revenue of the foundation for the previous two financial years was a mere $9.6 million and $8 million. The foundation itself has described this grant of $444 million as like winning the lotto. 


In defence of the government's decision to make this grant, the environment minister reportedly said, 'The foundation has a strong board with a cross-section of eminent individuals from the academic, business and science community.' The board is chaired by a former chairman of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Dr John Schubert AO. Other board members include a former chairman of Goldman Sachs, a former president of the Business Council of Australia, a former CEO and managing director of Suncorp, other members with banking and corporation experience, as well as some scientists. However, in the past few weeks one member of the board of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Stephen Roberts, has stepped down while a criminal investigation is underway over a suspicious capital raising for ANZ in 2015. Mr Roberts was a former director of the Australian Bankers' Association. 


So we have more questions for this government and we're not getting the answers. An FOI request has been lodged to find out what discussions the government had regarding the funding to the Great Barrier Reef foundation, and why work of this scale, which would ordinarily be overseen by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, has been outsourced to this foundation. 


The Turnbull government has been disappointing in almost every respect, but their lack of action on climate change is arguably the most disappointing and will create the most long-lasting damage for our children and grandchildren. Prime Minister Turnbull famously said in 2009, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.' We know that climate change is the biggest threat to the Great Barrier Reef. Fragile coral reefs have been described as the canaries of the sea. They're the first to signal an impending larger problem. Coral bleaching can be the first sign of wider destructive global warming. Yet there is not a single cent in the 2018 budget committed to tackling climate change. 


The Turnbull government is a disgrace when it comes to looking after the environment. Since they took office in 2013, carbon emissions have risen six per cent. Compare that to six years under Labor, where emissions dropped 10 per cent. This Turnbull government stands for nothing. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to look after our precious environment. As President Macron of France said, 'There is no planet B.' 


A Shorten Labor government will prioritise tackling climate change. We'll encourage investment in renewable energy. We'll cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. We'll have zero emissions by 2050. We'll commit to 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030. In this motion before the chamber we have a long list of speakers from those opposite saying the reef is not in danger; however, aren't we great for giving half a billion to a small organisation.

"Evans, Trevor, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (11:52):  The Great Barrier Reef is a remarkable natural wonder. It's breathtaking and spectacular. I've been very privileged to visit it before. It makes up in total about 10 per cent of the world's coral reef ecosystems. It stretches almost 3,000 kilometres, almost the distance from Brisbane to Melbourne and back again. It's one of Queensland's greatest landmarks and one of Australia's most beautiful natural environmental treasures. 


The long-term protection and conservation of the Great Barrier Reef is critically important, and it is essential that it be preserved for future generations. That's why I and so many people in Brisbane were delighted that this year's federal budget made an additional investment, Australia's largest ever investment in the reef, of more than $500 million. This new funding is on top of the $2 billion that's already been allocated under this government to protect the reef. 


In areas like conservation actions speak louder than words, so I'm proud that this government is doing more, investing more, funding more programs, than any other government in Australia's history. This record extends a long track record of support and protection of the Great Barrier Reef by former federal Liberal governments. It was, after all, the Fraser Liberal government that proclaimed the first section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 1979, and it was the Fraser Liberal government again that nominated the Great Barrier Reef for World Heritage listing, leading to the World Heritage Committee placing it on the World Heritage List in 1981. The Howard government brought in the Great Barrier Reef Region (Prohibition of Mining) Regulations 1999 to prohibit mining in areas just outside the Great Barrier Reef region, falling outside the marine park. And it was also the Howard Liberal government that extended the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 2000 to include six new sections right along the coastline of Queensland that were previously missing out on the park's protection status. That added almost 1,300 square kilometres to the park. 


When this coalition government took office in 2013, we inherited a situation where, sadly, the Great Barrier Reef was on the UN World Heritage Committee's watch list, basically because Labor was proposing four sites there for the dumping of dredge spoils. The coalition put a stop to the dredge sites, and, happily, the Great Barrier Reef was then taken off the UN's watch list. That's the environmental record of action of which this government is rightly proud.


Of course I'm pleased that this government is bringing in the next generation of marine parks, including new marine parks in the Coral Sea adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef. Once this government has finished this work, Australia will have one of the largest networks of marine sanctuaries around the world. I noted the comments of the earlier speaker the member for Grayndler. Where he is wrong in his assessment is that Labor never could bring the different stakeholders together. They didn't adequately base their initial proposals on the science. It was mostly politics and talk, rather than action—no results. This government is actually getting that job done. We've actually brought the stakeholders together and based it on the science, and therefore we will have these new marine parks very proudly as part of our environmental heritage when it comes to the Great Barrier Reef and marine parks.


I spoke in my maiden speech about my love for and connection with Australia's landscapes and environments. The Great Barrier Reef includes more than 2,900 coral reefs of different shapes and sizes, 600 islands, 300 coral cays and about 150 inshore mangrove islands. These sorts of landscapes and seascapes right around Australia, including the Great Barrier Reef, provide some of the most spectacular scenery and marine ecosystems on the planet.


I want to draw out the fact that over $100 million of the new funding announced in the budget will go specifically to scientific research, to invest in cutting-edge scientific technologies that will build more resilient coral, to adapt and deal with some of the global pressures, including the heat and light stress that the Great Barrier Reef is currently subject to. Like reefs all around the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure. That's why it's important that our good work in Australia in reef restoration is shared internationally, to help some of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region to tackle this global challenge.


This federal budget contained very welcome news for those of us who want to see our natural environment protected for future generations, as only a Liberal government has proven it can do. Conservation is inherently a conservative thing. Hopefully this record investment in the reef by the federal government will inspire even more Australians, including philanthropists and groups, to work together and build on the united efforts being made to protect and conserve the reef for generations to come.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (11:57):  I stand here proudly as the member whose electorate is situated right on the Great Barrier Reef. The jobs, the tourism, the economy and the wonders that the Great Barrier Reef provides to my community clearly demonstrate that there is arguably no other entity that creates such diverse economies whilst being incredibly spectacular. I am immensely proud that one of the greatest wonders of the world is located, as I said, on my doorstep. So I must stand in this place and fight to protect the Barrier Reef from the Turnbull government.


I note the member for Capricornia's first sentence in this motion reads 'that the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef is the planet's greatest living wonder'. The question then must be asked: why are the member and her government determined to undermine and kill this great natural wonder? The Turnbull government is responsible for the largest removal of heritage listing in the entire world, and this is happening on our Great Barrier Reef. This government is responsible for removing and unwinding protections for the Great Barrier Reef, and it is putting at risk more than 70,000 jobs and billions upon billions of dollars that flow into the North Queensland economy.


Labor is the party that protects the reef, and Labor will always be the party that fights for the reef. On top of removing vital protections, the Turnbull government have also given almost half a billion dollars to an organisation without any tenders, without knowing how many staff work at the organisation and without the organisation itself even asking for the funds. In Senate estimates, the Department of the Environment and Energy could not explain how or why $444 million is being allocated to one organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.


The budget for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation will be increased by 45 times. Their revenue for 2015 and 2016 was $9.6 million and $8 million respectively. The foundation has only six full-time members and five part-time members, who have described this grant as 'like winning the lotto'. Almost half a billion in taxpayers' money should not be likened to winning the lotto for grant recipients. They should have prior knowledge, they should be invited to compete for that funding and it should be done in a transparent way. It is rare and surprising funding for one organisation with only six full-time staff. It begs the question: how will they manage such an influx in funding? Yet the Turnbull government is proposing to give that funding in one payment. This brings a whole new meaning to 'a fish out of water'. The cavalier attitude to the granting of $444 million taxpayer dollars without a public grant process, an open and transparent process, a competitive process or consideration of whether the authority, rather than the foundation, could have carried out this work shows arrogance and a complete lack of understanding of the importance of the Great Barrier Reef by the Turnbull government.


I think everybody can, and will, agree: something certainly smells fishy. And that is why federal Labor is making freedom of information requests into the Turnbull government's discussions regarding the funding to be provided to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. Senate estimates have—

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:01):  Thank you to members of the government and the assistant minister for the opportunity to speak a little bit this afternoon about the 2018 budget, handed down about a month ago in this building. I think one of the defining features of the budget was that, for the first time in four prime ministers and four treasurers, we had the global economy making a big positive contribution to the budget, rather than a big negative contribution to the budget—something that we had, unfortunately, become accustomed to for much of the last decade or so. It really was welcome news that, with the global economy in such good condition, the best condition for a decade, we are seeing some of the revenue return to the budget. Obviously, it's a good thing that we have those conditions improving around the world, and that is helping the Australian economy and the Australian budget as well.


In the economic sense, we're seeing those global conditions feeding some good national accounts outcomes when it comes to investment and exports, in particular, which made a big positive contribution to the most national accounts. You can see the transmission from a stronger global economy, where we've got something like 120 different countries growing simultaneously for the first time in a long time, making a contribution to our export numbers and some of our other, broader numbers and measures of GDP as well.


But, despite those relatively welcome headline figures—in particular the GDP in that last quarter—there are some troubling undercurrents. Here, we're thinking about wages at historic lows; we're thinking about living standards being quite weak in historical terms; and we're thinking, of course, about low household consumption—soft household consumption—in those most recent numbers, as well as a lack of saving, and high household debt. So at the household level, below that headline rate of GDP, we've really got some quite soft conditions. We've got a lot of families experiencing a triple whammy of spending less, saving less, but still racking up more debt, and that's obviously a very troubling situation.


In the budget we also had something like $40 billion of additional revenue—taxes and charges—show up at the front door of the Treasury. There's $40 billion in this budget, yet we still have record net debt in this budget, twice what this government inherited. It went from $175 billion in September 2013 to $350 billion now. We've got record gross debt. Gross debt has only been over half a trillion dollars under one government in the history of the country—under this government. In these budget papers it's expected to be over half a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years, and higher at the end of that decade than it is today. So despite the global economy helping the budget, $40 billion in extra revenue showing up at the door, we still have a budget in substantially worse condition than it was in September 2013. Probably most remarkably, despite this substantial new revenue showing up at the door, we've got a 2019-20 surplus which relies exclusively, entirely, more than entirely, on the bring-forward of a tobacco tax. We have a skinny surplus which relies on a timing change in tobacco tax, without which there would be no surplus in 2019-20. 


Those are just the facts of the matter. No doubt we'll get into a bit of back-and-forth here, but I'm just establishing that the facts of the budget are good global conditions, soft conditions at the household level in the economy. We still have record net and gross debt. Debt is being accumulated per month at a faster clip now, on average, under this government than under the previous government. So despite having everything that you would ask from the global economy helping the economy, helping the budget, we still have very poor fiscal outcomes in the budget. With net debt doubled, with gross debt more than half a trillion dollars and with debt accumulating faster now than it did under the previous Labor government, what we really need to hear from the government representatives here today is, why we don't hear anything anymore about a budget emergency?

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:06):  I have several questions for the minister today regarding our investment in defence infrastructure and capability and what this means for jobs in my home state of South Australia and the nation more broadly. I'm keen to ask questions of the minister because investing in defence infrastructure and capability is one of the many ways the Turnbull government is creating a strong economy and supporting jobs in my home state of South Australia and in my electorate of Boothby. Our investments are also creating education and training opportunities which our university sector in SA, for example, is very excited about. Just last Thursday I heard direct from Professor Colin Stirling, the Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, which is in the heart of my electorate of Boothby, of the range of benefits the naval shipbuilding program will deliver to my local area. These exciting opportunities are a direct result of the Turnbull government's investment in defence infrastructure and capability. The Turnbull government's shipbuilding plan will give Australian businesses opportunities to take part in delivering defence contracts and transfer the knowledge, technology and skills they develop into other areas of the economy. This will assist in the expansion of businesses into new markets, allowing them to competitively pursue lucrative export opportunities. Through our initial investment we will be enabling local businesses to build their capabilities and practices so they can compete globally and build our defence export capability. With nine future frigates, 12 submarines and also offshore patrol vessels, the defence industry will soon be booming. 


This $90 billion investment in our nation's defence and defence industry will benefit all Australians. It will create a total of 2,800 jobs in my home state of South Australia alone and opportunities for local businesses in my electorate of Boothby—businesses like Cornell Design and Plasteel in Melrose Park and SAGE Automation at Tonsley have previously worked on major defence contracts. They know the value of defence projects to local businesses and manufacturers and the jobs they support. It's not just the direct defence work that supports jobs; it is also the technology, learning and innovation these companies can then apply to other problems or issues in the private sector and the civilian world that deliver additional value to our economy and additional jobs as well. This is to my mind the true value of defence work. It is not just the actual defence capability, which is absolutely necessary for the nation, but the skills and the technology that companies can then apply to non-defence projects. 


Our investment in defence could not be more different to that of the Labor Party. The former Labor government failed to commission a single vessel from an Australian shipyard during their time in office. This impacted the stability of shipbuilding jobs, particularly in my home state of South Australia, as well as the capability of our Navy and Defence Force personnel. In stark contrast, the Turnbull government has committed to building 54 new naval vessels in total. We've taken action to ensure workers at the Australian Submarine Corporation remain employed and have opportunities to upskill, with scholarships available to support roles in operations, management, computer aided design, engineering and supply chain fields. We've launched the Naval Shipbuilding College, the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and the Defence Innovation Hub—based in Adelaide—so that South Australia has the workforce and capabilities it needs to support the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that will be created by the naval shipbuilding program.


In March 2017, the Turnbull government established Australian Naval Infrastructure Pty Ltd to facilitate the development and construction of new infrastructure at the Osborne shipbuilding facility, as outlined in the naval shipbuilding plan. In August we saw the first sod turned for the new surface shipbuilding yard, which is arguably the most significant infrastructure supporting the delivery of a continuous naval shipbuilding program in Australia. When completed, thanks to the Turnbull government, we will have one of the most modern and busiest platform shipbuilding businesses in the world at Osborne south. At Osborne north we will have one of the most modern and busiest submarine businesses in the world.


The work at the Osborne shipyard commissioned by our government with the current infrastructure build, and later with the construction, sustainment and maintenance of naval vessels, is a game changer for South Australia. So I ask, will the minister update the chamber as to how the works are progressing at Australian Naval Infrastructure's new naval shipyard development at Osborne? Minister, how many jobs do you expect to be created as a result of the shipyard construction through the managing contractor? And, Minister, how has the coalition government's investment in Osborne and elsewhere helped to ensure the ongoing stability of Australia's domestic shipbuilding industry?

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:11):  I want to raise an issue and pose a few questions to the minister, which I think warrant serious consideration and response, regarding the government's so-called innovative financing—I think they call it 'innovative financing' themselves—colloquially known as off-budget investments, which in the worst case scenario is becoming an $84 billion ticking fiscal time bomb for the nation. I say at the outset I do understand there's no formal accounting definition of 'off budget', but entities or investments outside the general government sector as presented in the budget papers are commonly referred to as being off budget because they get excluded from the calculation of the government's budget deficit or surplus. The kinds of things this covers, Minister, are by way of equity investments, concessional loans, contingent liabilities, guarantees and so on. Of course, assets acquired or funded through equity investments must generate a commercial rate of return, cover their cost of borrowing and a bit more and repay their capital investment in a reasonable time frame. There are of course legitimate ways to use this kind of financing. For example, the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal under the previous Labor government or the government's decision around the Western Sydney Airport strike me as quite legitimate uses of off-budget funding.


But there are serious risks. If things do go wrong they pose a fiscal time bomb in that if the equity investment doesn't get the commercial return which is projected or if something happens to impair the valuation—or indeed if the government of the day is cooking the books—then at some point that loss comes straight back to the budget, blows out the deficit and, if sizable, can impact our AAA credit rating and blow out net debt. There is a worrying temptation for any government to overstate the benefits or inflate asset values, and the problem then becomes one for future governments and taxpayers.


So it's critical that taxpayers, through the parliament, are absolutely confident that the government isn't cheating or fiddling the books at any point in time. I believe, having looked at the budget papers, there are worrying signs. The growth has been remarkable. Over the last five budgets, there is now a total of $84 billion of easily identifiable off-budget investments. There is about $55 billion worth of equity investments and about $29 billion of concessional loans. It's a little unclear how you count WestConnex—the government still can't tell us where that tunnel is actually going in Sydney, but that's a minor detail: just keep digging and it will pop up somewhere; give it a few billion. I do acknowledge you can identify most of the investments sitting underneath that total, but the budget documents don't provide sufficient detail for anyone to assess how much of the commitments have been drawn down across the portfolio of investments. The government has flagged in the budget papers explicitly and in all the pre-budget waffle—we hear in question time from the Prime Minister about this mythical $75 billion pipeline of infrastructure and the rail lines he can build with no money that he keeps announcing—that it's preparing to use these methods more extensively. So I would ask you, Minister, can you outline precisely for the $84 billion: which projects, what are the risks, where can we find this information and how much of these commitments for each instrument are drawn down and will be drawn down? And where is this information publicly available? The reason I'd also say alarm bells are ringing is—I will give a couple of examples. With the Inland Rail project, the government's now put in nearly $9 billion of funny money. You can only describe it as that because former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson's review found that it would not repay its capital, even in 50 years. This is a serious issue.


Let's be clear what you're doing, Minister, with this set of budget documents and this investment. You're borrowing $9 billion for an Inland Rail project. You're pretending that it's going to make a commercial return above the cost of borrowing and repay its capital in a reasonable time frame. That's what is required. And yet your own independent review by the former Deputy Prime Minister, National Party doyen, John Anderson, said, 'That's not going to happen. It won't repay it, even in 50 years.'


The former CEO of the Australian Rail Track Corporation told the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—I was stunned that he actually admitted it; it was an outbreak of honesty. I noticed he's not there anymore. I don't know what went on there—he probably just retired. But the revenues that flow to ARTC won't cover the full capital cost and provide a return. So that's the CEO of the ARTC saying, 'This $9 billion we've just hidden over there isn't actually going to be repaid. It doesn't provide a commercial cost of return.' On the face of it, if that was true, you'd say, 'You're fiddling the books.' So can you explain to the parliament, then, how this is classified as an equity investment—you can build infrastructure with grants, give somebody some money and build it; that's the traditional way—and what the consequences are if some is written off, and what impact that will have on the deficit?

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (16:16):  I thank the members for Rankin and Boothby and the other member for their comments and questions. In relation to the member for Boothby's question, she raised a very important issue. What she did highlight, with great specificity, was the sad failure of the previous government to support the building of even one naval vessel during six years in office. So after six years—it's a long time—there's not one ship. Those opposite stand condemned for their failure to invest in the Australian shipbuilding industry.


The member for Rankin held a very important and prestigious role as chief of staff to the then Treasurer. He did not use that lofty perch from where he sat to argue for the commissioning of a single naval vessel, and that's a failure. But, in contrast, I can explain to the member for Boothby that this government is very committed to the future of the naval shipbuilding industry in Australia. We have avoided the valley of death that those opposite so cruelly would have imposed on the naval shipbuilding industry, and we are investing very significantly in the shipbuilding industry in Australia.


So, in this budget, we provided an additional equity injection to Australian naval infrastructure to enable the development of the required infrastructure at the Osborne precinct in Adelaide—$535 million, a substantial sum towards the surface shipbuilding yard in Osborne. It will support the purchase of additional land at Osborne, and I'm sure that all members would support this very important investment. It's required for the Future Submarine construction yard, of course, and, thanks to this investment, the redevelopment of the Osborne yard is in full swing.


Only eight months after Australian Naval Infrastructure engaged Lendlease as the managing contractor for the redevelopment project, the development is progressing well. That's good news for the industry, and that's good news for South Australia. Let me go into that in a little bit more detail. It's estimated that this Osborne South redevelopment will create up to 600 jobs. Currently, there are about 100 construction staff working onsite—good news for Adelaide—and ANI advise that this will peak at up to 400 employees in 2019. That doesn't include all of the knock-on benefits to all of the related industries adjacent to the Osborne shipyard. The earthworks subcontractor, McMahon Services Australia, completed the site preparation works in April this year. The majority Indigenous-owned subcontractor Intract Australia formed a joint venture with McMahon to construct these early earthworks. We are seeing 100 per cent of the square-section structural steel for this project ordered from Australian steelmakers BlueScope, in Port Kembla, and Liberty OneSteel, in Whyalla. Again, it is all about supporting Australian industry and supporting Australian jobs and it is another reason why 2017 was the greatest year of job creation in Australian history, with some 415,000 jobs created in that year, a very strong record. This important naval shipbuilding program is a key part of that. In contrast, those opposite failed to build a single ship or, indeed, to even commission or contemplate the building of a single ship in that time.


I want to address the member's question in relation to equity financing. As he's pointed out, those opposite made use of these funding mechanisms for programs like the Moorebank intermodal, a very important project in Western Sydney, and the NBN. Each of these projects, in addition to all the projects that are accounted for in this way, is subject to a rigorous process through the Department of Finance. The principles in relation to equity accounting have been consistent over the years. That process hasn't changed. This process enables investment in important job-creating projects.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:21):  I quite like the member for Banks. We did a bit of work together before he got elevated to deputy chief Treasury Muppet or whatever. But that's not an answer. I actually used my serious voice. I used numbers. I pointed to real facts and figures that are in the budget papers. And you completely didn't address the question. You responded to the member for Boothby's government waffle, when she wasn't even interested enough to stay around and hear your response. I feel slighted. I feel a little upset by this. So let me continue.


On the Inland Rail—and I would welcome your answer to a pretty specific and clear question, Minister—what is the basis on which you can classify this $9 billion of 'funny money' as an off-budget investment? What is the basis? Tell us how that accords with your accounting rules, which require you to make a commercial return and repay the cost of capital in a reasonable time frame. That would be a good question to answer. If you could answer that, that would actually be helpful and make this part of the legislative process perhaps just a little bit meaningful for all of us.


But I draw your attention to another and very significant off-budget investment, if you like—the National Broadband Network. That was started by Labor—and I thank you for your acknowledgement of that, Minister—as a good nation-building project. Of course, it was based on a set of assumptions—it was based on a business case at the time—that have now changed. The Prime Minister, when he was communications minister, bastardised, as we know, Labor's visionary NBN. I challenge him to come to Glen Waverley in my electorate and have a chat to anyone there who keeps getting stupid letters from the NBN saying, 'The rollout's off,' 'The rollout's on,' 'The rollout's off,' 'The rollout's on.' The only thing worse than not getting the NBN is getting the NBN, as it turns out for people who do. 


The NBN is currently valued at replacement value on the books, but industry experts are saying louder and louder that the NBN is not worth what the government claims, with the changing business model. If that's true, then the loss in value at some point will come back to budget and blow out the deficit. We're not talking about small numbers here. We're talking about $29.5 billion now of equity that the government has tipped in and another $19.5 billion of loans. Minister, can you explain the basis of the valuation and can you state unequivocally to the parliament, hand on heart—pinkie promise, invisible ink, swear in blood, whatever you like, whatever's your thing—that the NBN is worth what you claim it is, that the cost of capital will be repaid and that this is not a fiscal time bomb for future governments or taxpayers to bear? It would be very good if we could hear that unequivocal assurance that the NBN is worth what you say it is and that your reputation will hang on that.


The other point I would make is about the $75 billion sham package for infrastructure. I said to the Parliamentary Library: 'We hear about this $75 billion. What's the list of projects?' The Parliamentary Library said they couldn't find the full list of projects—and they're pretty good at finding stuff; they're much cleverer than me. I don't have a PhD, of course, unlike my learned friend, here—he's pretty good at finding stuff. But the Parliamentary Library can find no full list of the projects. In fact, when you look at the budget papers, Minister, there's only $24.3 billion of this mythical $75 billion in the forward estimates—real money. The rest is not budgeted. It appears it will be a mysterious, opaque mix of things, including contingent liabilities, like the East West Link in Melbourne—a joke—so we think you're counting that in the $75 billion. There would also be concessional loans, such as for the WestConnex tunnel in Sydney, the road to nowhere; the Auditor-General has identified a lot of problems with how that's gone. It would also include indemnities, guarantees, equity investments. There is the Melbourne rail link—the rail line the Prime Minister thinks you can build with no actual money, because apparently it's going to make a profit. I think it would be the only rail line in the world, outside Hong Kong or Singapore, that you could make a profit on building. There's a form of magic going on. As the chief executive of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said, you can't finance your way out of a funding problem. It doesn't matter how much you cook the books or spin it, you can't. On the airport rail scam, the Grattan Institute said:


So there's a real risk that these equity investments will end up not even making a positive rate of return, never mind a commercial rate.


So can the minister please tell me where I can get a full list of exactly what is in this $75 billion package. I want a full list—I think the Australian people deserve a list—project by project, outlining how they're funded, what the mix of innovative financing mechanisms is, and what the finance department's advice and scrutiny has been, project by project, of the fiscal risks posed by these mythical investments.

Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (16:26):  I wanted to start by welcoming the members of the Inter-Parliamentary Study Program who have joined us for this riveting session this afternoon. I have to say it's that time of the day when the circadian cycle means that you may be feeling a bit drowsy and wanting a nap, but nothing in the Federation Chamber will ever disrupt that natural course of events, I'm afraid to tell you. 


I wanted to ask the assistant minister about payment growths in the federal budget, but I want to put a bit of context around the question I pose to him. Like many members of this House, in the lead-up to the budget, we get a number of competing demands from our communities about what their expectations of the budget are, and I have to say that my electorate is no different to what the common trend is in that regard. Over the last six months, during the course of my work in the electorate, I have met many people who have spoken to me about their concerns for essential services and those important items of infrastructure which they expect government to deliver, and I know that those concerns have included funding for education and health care and what we're going to do to support the transport needs of a growing city like Sydney. Therefore, I think this budget has met a lot of the expectations that those residents have posed to me. 


I particularly highlight the incredible commitment that we're giving to school education, with an extra $23½ billion over the next decade; the commitment to health which is reflected in the $30 billion extra that will flow to our public hospital system; all that we're doing to support drugs becoming cheaply available to those who need them through the PBS and the like; and of course what we're doing in the area of infrastructure. Unlike the member for Bruce, I'm delighted that we actually have a 10-year plan for infrastructure, which was reflected in the pipeline that was released in the lead-up to the budget by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Deputy Prime Minister. Having that type of 10-year funding pipeline is just so important for projects which obviously run over multiple years. It allows those developing the projects to plan properly and accordingly. 


The commitment to that type of infrastructure is reflected in my own electorate, where I'm really pleased that this government has been able to deliver funds for important infrastructure projects like creating a major new public foreshore park on the former submarine base Platypus, in Neutral Bay, which opened a couple of weeks ago for the first time. We provided $20 million to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust for that, and it followed the $50 million that Defence spent on remediating the site. Similarly, we're investing almost $10 million in new sporting facilities at Gore Hill, which is a commitment to the sport and recreation needs of my community. I also know that, in relation to transport, through the Asset Recycling Initiative, we're continuing to provide something like $1.6 billion to help the New South Wales government build the Sydney Metro project, which is really great news. 


The other area that my constituents raised with me is the need for tax relief. That's why I think this budget is so important, because not only are we delivering the company tax reductions that small and medium-size businesses so desperately need, company tax reductions which will maintain our international competitiveness, but also that personal income tax package which offers relief in the short term to low- and middle-income earners and in the long term will guarantee that 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers aren't paying any more than 32.5 per cent. 


Another area that people do raise with me is obviously the issue of government debt and how the government is going in relation to coming back into surplus. What is pleasing about the budget, of course, is the commitment to bring the budget back into surplus a year earlier, to reduce debt by $30 billion over the current four years and to constrain the debt blowout that was created by the last Labor government when it went on its reckless spending program. That's a great achievement of this government. In part we've been able to do that because revenues are increasing, but I'm conscious of the fact that the success of the government's fiscal strategy has not just been about relying on revenue; it's also been about relying on spending restraint. Therefore I wanted to ask the assistant minister whether he might be able to provide the House with an update on how we're going in our efforts to balance the budget by reining in spending and making sure it's sustainable, and particularly how that compares with the efforts of previous governments.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:31):  It's getting harder and harder not to laugh when you hear those opposite talk about debt under Labor, when in fact the government's own budget papers, these budget papers which were released by the government in May this year, show there in black and white that net debt has doubled during the five years of those opposite. It has actually doubled. Gross debt is also at record levels and debt is accumulating at a faster rate now under this mob than it did under its Labor predecessors. 


Leaving that aside, I want to pick up on something else that the member for North Sydney said in his contribution, if you could call it that. He talked about what the people in his community wanted to see in the budget. He talked about education spending. I think he should write to the members of his electorate and say that in this budget this government pulled another $270 million out of TAFE. I think that says it all about their approach to education. If we genuinely care about teaching and training our people for the next generation, for the jobs of the future, we can't continue to hollow out TAFE as this government has been doing. It is a new $270 million cut to TAFE in this budget. 


That's one thing that shows how spectacularly out of touch they are when it comes to communities around Australia. Another one is when it comes to wages. One of the defining features of the economy in the last few years has been that we have had wages growth which is at historic lows. They are really quite poor wage outcomes, despite the fact that the economy has started growing and global conditions are terrific. We have all these sorts of things going for us. There's been a decoupling between the prospects of the national economy and the prospects of ordinary workers like those that the member for Moreton and I represent in the best part of Australia to the south of Brisbane. 


We've got a story there from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, in a quite remarkable contribution, which I congratulate him on. In the last week or two he gave a speech about wages. What he said about wages was that unfortunately in this country we've come to expect that what used to be normal wages growth of maybe three or four per cent has become more like two per cent. The new normal for wages growth, for a whole range of reasons relating to technology, bargaining power in the workforce and all of those sorts of things—what we're seeing is wages growth stuck at two per cent, which is a really poor outcome. That's why we're seeing less consumption, less saving and more debt, because people aren't getting the wages outcome they need and deserve to look after their families in suburbs of this country. 


So when you examine the budget in any detail, something that really jumps out at you, a big red flashing light in the forecast that the government is relying on, is that it has got remarkably optimistic—many of the independent commentators have said overly optimistic—expectations for wages growth. Remember, as I said before, and as the Governor of the Reserve Bank and others have said, we've had wages growth of around two per cent. It's been under two per cent, which is shocking. It's now around two per cent, or just over. Remember that the Reserve Bank governor said that that might be the new normal. Yet when you look at the budget—even at the summary table in statement 1—and if you look at their forecast for wages, the wage price index forecast is at two per cent now. By the end of the coming financial year they're expecting it to be 2¾ per cent—a pretty big jump. Then, in 2019-20, they expect it to jump to 3¼ per cent. The projections after that are 3½ per cent for 2020-21 and 2021-22. What that really tells us is that with wages growth at two per cent, all of a sudden, the government is expecting that, miraculously, we're going to get to 3½ per cent wages growth in just a few years time.


As the assistant minister would know, and as anyone who follows budgets would know, budgets are very sensitive to little tweaks in the forecasts, and what we've got here is really quite a substantial forecast change in wages. I've done my best not to make this a partisan question, because I think it's an important thing for us to understand when we look at the budget, even in an objective way. What I'd like to know from the assistant minister is: what would be the impact on the underlying balance if the government included in its budget wage forecasts which were more realistic, more in line with what the RBA governor is describing as the new normal of two per cent?

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (16:36):  It's good to be able to respond to the questions from the member for North Sydney. I also want to pick up on some of the comments from the member for Rankin. The member for North Sydney rightly points to the importance of fiscal constraint. He asks about that because he knows that the Australian people want their government to live within its means and he knows that the Australian people expect their governments to take a prudent and cautious approach to spending the money of the people. And there is a tremendous contrast between the prudent observations of the member for North Sydney and those opposite, because, when the member for Rankin was the chief of staff to the Treasurer of Australia, the real growth in spending under the previous government was some four per cent on average per year. It was very, very high—four per cent every year. Under this government—and this really goes to the heart of the query from the member for North Sydney—the average growth in real spending has been just 1.9 per cent per year, and, when you're talking about a budget of literally hundreds of billions of dollars, that difference between four per cent on average and 1.9 per cent is immense. And the good news is that, in this budget, the forecast rate of growth of spending declines even further to 1.6 per cent, and that comes through the hard work of going through each program carefully and of thinking, when one is going to spend the people's money, that it is just that—the people's money. It's not the government's money. It is money that has been generated by the hard work and enterprise of the Australian people, and we need to be very judicious and careful in how we spend it.


We also know that government net debt is expected to peak in this financial year—the financial year that ends in less than two weeks. And we expect that net debt will be reduced by some $30 billion over the next four years. So it is very important: we are turning the corner from that appalling legacy of debt and deficit that those opposite left us. We know they haven't passed a surplus budget since 1989, and the member knows that 1989 was a very long time ago. There have been no surpluses under those opposite since that period, some 29 years ago. And so, Member for North Sydney, it is pleasing that we are in a position of turning the corner on net debt and of paying an estimated $30 billion over the forward estimates, and it is an extraordinary contrast with those opposite, because what we saw under those opposite was the requirement for more and more spending to be addressed to interest payments. Of course, when they came into office there was no net debt. There was some $16 billion of cash in the bank, and they turned that around to a net debt of close to $200 billion—a very, very poor result indeed. 


I want to also address a number of the comments of the member for Bruce and the member for Rankin. The member for Bruce should be assured that the process in relation to equity accounting is as it has always been—the Auditor-General is required to sign off on the government's financial statements, including the treatment of any equity-accounted investments. That's as it should be. That's a very sensible and prudent approach. There are specific rules in relation to the classification of an investment as equity: it must be outside the government sector, there must be an expectation that the investment will be recovered in real terms and the government must exercise reasonable control over its investment. These are all the sorts of questions to which the Auditor-General turns their mind. 


In relation to jobs and wages, it is also important to note the record jobs growth in 2017—the greatest in history. One in eight manufacturing jobs were lost under those opposite. So we certainly will not be taking lectures from those opposite in relation to the jobs market.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:41):  Wages policy is such a huge priority on that side of the parliament that in a five-minute answer, the Assistant Minister for Finance said 'wages' with 17 seconds to go but then didn't say anything actually about wages. He just said 'wages', because the member for Moreton was within his rights to say, 'Don't you care at all about how people are being paid in this country?' It says it all about how out of touch those opposite are, that we can't even hear a peep about wages. In a serious non-political question about the sensitivity of the budget forecast to a more realistic forecast on wages in line with what the Governor of the RBA said, those opposite can't even bring themselves to utter a full sentence about wages in this country. I think that does say it all.


If the member for North Sydney and the member for Banks were out listening to their community or indeed any community, they would know one of the main reasons people aren't in a big rush to give the Treasurer a big pat on the back for the economy is that the economy that people feel—the economy that people experience—is dictated largely by whether or not they're able to work hard and provide for their families. Wages are a big part of that. It's disappointing but not especially surprising that those opposite don't realise that. It's disappointing but not especially surprising that we don't get any concession or recognition when those opposite talk about debt. They always say that debt was disastrous under the Labor Party. Net debt is literally twice as big now after five years of those opposite in government. 


The member for Banks bangs on and on about how Labor didn't deliver a surplus during the global financial crisis. That's a matter of historical record. But what is also a matter of historical record is this mob under rosy global conditions—quite good global conditions—is yet to deliver a surplus. Spare us the dusted-off Tony Abbott talking points of 2013; they really should be beneath someone who walks around this place and pretends to be a serious contributor to the economic debate. 


The reality is that this budget is built on three dodgy elements. The forecast surplus in 2019-20, and the forecasts generally, are based on three dodgy sets of assumptions. The first one is wages, as I mentioned. The second one I dealt with very briefly in the beginning. It is that the entire 2019-20 surplus is based on assuming that we can pull forward $3.3 billion in tobacco tax revenue. I hope we can; we do want to crack down on illegal tobacco, but the people of Australia need to know there's $3.3 billion claimed there and it's only a $2.2 billion surplus. You don't need to be a genius to work out—even the member for Banks can probably work it out—that the surplus in 2019-20 is entirely reliant on that tobacco tax bring forward. The third set of dodgy assumptions—the cooking of the books in its most partisan and political form—is that the budget continues to claim billions of dollars in savings which have no chance of passing the Senate. In this place, the political commentators call them the zombie savings because they just won't die. The parliament keeps voting against them, and those opposite, just because they want to deliver a rosier set of numbers than they are entitled to do, continue to claim a whole bunch of zombie measures.


The worst one is the pensioner energy supplement, which has been defeated in the parliament. It takes money off seniors who need it, particularly in the winter but also in the hot summers, to pay their electricity bill. Those opposite want to take it away from them. The parliament, to its eternal credit, crossbenchers included, has continued to knock that back. Yet, in the budget, there it was again. The budget is claiming a billion dollars in savings from the energy supplement which won't pass this place, so there's a billion dollar black hole right there. Those opposite like to talk about budget black holes—there's a billion dollar hole right there.


The same is true of the family tax benefits, the maximum liquid assets waiting period, the pension supplement for people overseas, the pension residency requirement and the pensioner education supplement. There's a theme emerging. These are all attacks on pensioners. They say to the pensioners of Australia, 'We can't find $14 a fortnight for your energy supplement, but we can find almost $5 billion for the Commonwealth Bank,' the biggest single beneficiary of the company tax cuts that those opposite pretend to be so proud of, which give $17 billion to the big four banks and $80 billion to big business, which will largely spray around overseas for multinationals. 


So my question to the assistant minister—I'm not expecting an answer given he hasn't even engaged on a simple nonpartisan thing like wages policy—is: when will the government be pulling the zombie measures out of the budget so the people of Australia can get a serious fair dinkum sense of the budget position without the government cooking the books with savings that won't pass this parliament?

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (16:46):  I want to thank the Assistant Minister for Finance for the fantastic job that he and the finance minister are continuing to do in working to reverse the damage done to Australia's financial situation by six years of Labor. It has been a long process and a difficult balancing act. While we have a responsibility to the Australian people to support necessary services, we also have a responsibility to appropriately manage what is really the Australian people's money. It is disappointing that not all in this place have the same respect for taxpayers' money, including funds that come from my own electorate of Dunkley. We have introduced a number of budget repair measures totalling over $41 billion. So my first question to the minister is: can the minister advise the chamber on the progress of the government's budget repair measures through the parliament? How much progress has the government made in passing unlegislated budget repair measures since the 2016 PFO?


Australians expect us to live within our means, and we have not done this in a long time. The past few years have been spent working towards getting the budget and the underlying cash deficit back on track. We're approaching the end of the financial year, and it is widely expected that the underlying cash deficit will have been lowered to $18.2 billion. This is a huge figure; however, this is expected to be the best budget outcome since the Howard government's last budget a decade ago. The size of government debt is not to be underestimated or dismissed; however, my constituents and I are delighted that progress is being made. My second question to the minister is: what is the estimated impact of measures that the government has implemented since the 2013 election, and can the minister please speak to some of the key measures that have contributed to this figure?


We cannot continue to borrow money to fund services that should be funded by the government as a matter of routine. That is why we are delivering a surplus in 2019-20, the first since we came to government in 2013—over a six-year period we have worked to undo six years of Labor—and the first since the last year of the Howard government in 2007, just before Labor came into government and brought the difficult financial circumstances they left for us in 2013. Compare our results to those opposite. I was five years old when Labor last delivered a surplus in government. The Berlin Wall was still standing. It was a difficult situation at the time around the world, but it was even more difficult being led by Labor, who have not delivered a surplus since that time.


It is our job to ensure that essential services like health and education can be funded through strong economic management and not by using borrowed money, so we can reduce our deficit to bring us back into a surplus and, therefore, reduce our debt. That means we're reducing our interest payments, and we will have more to spend on health and education. We cannot continue to borrow money forever. This is why it is crucial that we make sure that our spending is sustainable. This is exactly what the government's approach towards funding services has been. We have now reached the point where we no longer have to borrow to pay for routine government expenses, which was a situation Labor brought us to after the 2007 election, when you continued to put us into deficit, therefore increasing debt and therefore increasing the interest on our credit card payments.


In contrast, we have responsible economic management. That, unfortunately, is not something that could be guaranteed if those opposite were again in government. The strong economic management of the Howard era was torn to shreds by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Had their spending not been reined in, Australia would have been at risk of losing its AAA credit rating from the major ratings agencies. The Treasurer, the assistant minister, the Minister for Finance and our government, led by the Prime Minister, have been responsible in managing the economy to ensure that we continue to retain that AAA credit rating. Even now, those opposite will try to write off the coalition government's successes since 2013, promising bigger, better tax cuts while pledging funding increases for every potential recipient that they can think of.


Minister, I am concerned that the only foreseeable way that Labor could do so would be to plunge us back into further debt, undoing all the hard work of the coalition and recklessly putting us back into a vulnerable position should we find ourselves facing the global difficulties of just over a decade ago. Considering what I have said, could the minister please also tell us more about the budget repair measures presented by the coalition and how these will get Australia back on track? Finally, can the minister outline the government's fiscal strategy and how the government is planning to achieve a sustainable budget position over the medium term?

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:51):  It's hard to imagine a less intelligent, less informed contribution to this otherwise important conversation about the budget. You can come in here with your opinions. You can't just make it up as you go along. The only reason we have a AAA credit rating from all three agencies is that it was won, for the first time, under the same government that the previous speaker was criticising. Can someone please, before he speaks, check his notes for him or write some notes for him? That was embarrassing. We have three AAAs because they were won under the government that he was criticising. Surely you can at least check a fact as basic as that. Or maybe, before you talk about interest repayments, check the fact that they are higher now than under any other government. If you want to talk about debt, maybe at least be a little bit ashamed of the fact that net debt has doubled and that gross debt is over half a trillion dollars, and both measures have accumulated faster under this government than under the Labor predecessor. It is so tempting to go through all of the ways that that was really just an appalling, fact-free contribution to what should be a conversation based on facts—really quite disappointing, unbelievable.


I will move on to other matters, given the lateness of the hour. One of the noticeable features of changes in government spending in the last little while has been the quite extraordinary increase in spending on contractors. If you go to the government's AusTender website, you can run a whole bunch of searches to show that, since the government changed hands in 2013, a lot of the categories have just exploded in terms of spending—billions and billions of dollars in extra spending on a lot of things that used to be done by the Public Service. The reason that we have that is that an arbitrary cap has been placed on public servants, in this town and right around Australia. Federal public servants have had an arbitrary cap imposed. That says to agencies: 'If you want to get this work done, you need to get it done externally.' There will always be a role for external expert advice, but we shouldn't be wasting billions of dollars in marked-up work—labour hire, contractors, consultants—when that work could and should be done by the Public Service. I think one of the things that sticks in the public's craw is that they get lectured all the time—'We couldn't possibly find that money for the pensioner energy supplement; we couldn't find that $270 million for TAFE'—but we can spend billions and billions more every year on contractors and consultants in the Public Service because there is an ideological commitment to a Public Service cap.


So what's happening in Australia on the government's side is that we're paying more and more for poorer outcomes. We're paying more than we were before, and we're getting inferior outcomes. That's because those opposite cling to this ideological Public Service cap, which is not actually delivering the policy outcome that they want. The purpose of the Public Service cap was to keep down costs in the Public Service. Instead we have costs blowing out madly. Anyone who spends even 10 minutes on the AusTender site can see the quite remarkable multiples of growth in certain categories, particularly of management services in the Public Service. Agencies need to get the work done but they've got the cap, so they have to go outside. So we're seeing all of this public money wasted on what is an IPA ideological frolic, which is the cap on the APS headcount.


This was put to the finance minister, Senator Cormann. Over the summer there were a number of well-informed stories in our broadsheet press, which had done what the public expects it to do, which is to examine the spending by the government on contractors and consultants, and uncover this extraordinary blowout that the government would rather Australians didn't know about. The government's response, quite remarkably, was to say you can't rely on those figures. They're the government's figures on the AusTender site. What we need, very clearly, is more transparency and more accuracy. If those numbers are wrong then other numbers need to be provided, because this scandalous waste of billions, if not tens of billions, of dollars to satisfy this ideological obsession is a matter of public interest. My question to the minister is: why have you made it not transparent enough for the Australian people to understand just how much money you're wasting on consultants and contractors?

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (16:56):  I thank the member for Dunkley, in particular, for his very strong contribution to this debate. He again hits on the important point about restraining government spending. It's a very important contrast with those opposite. I will talk to the member's question about some specific savings measures that have been passed through the parliament in recent times, but we also need to understand the alternative.


One way of improving the budget position is to make savings. That is the better way. That is the preferable way. Those opposite are all about tax increases. They propose more than $200 billion of tax increases. The member for Rankin wanted to talk about older Australians in his contribution. He and his colleagues are proposing to smash older Australians with a massive retiree tax that will devastate hundreds of thousands of older Australians. Those opposite also want to smash the housing market by abolishing negative gearing for all except new homes. In an environment where the housing markets around Australia are already under pressure, that is going to lead to tremendous problems, and it's going to hit the most important asset of the vast majority of Australian households, their home. It is an appalling policy. They also want to put up capital gains tax by 50 per cent on everything, not just on housing and not just on investment property. They voted against tax relief for any business that has a turnover of just $2 million, which is a very, very small business. Those opposite said, 'No, this is some sort of big business, and it is not entitled to any form of relief.'


Those are bad policies. They are in contrast to the priorities of this government and of the member for Dunkley. He knows that getting the budget back on track is about sensible budget repair. He knows that since MYEFO we've implemented and delivered savings worth some $4.6 billion. We are doing the hard work of actually passing budget repair measures. Since the 2017-18 budget there has been some $16 billion worth of budget repair measures. Since the 2016 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the value of budget repair measures implemented by this government has been some $41 billion. That is a massive improvement in the fiscal position of this nation, and that is why in this financial year we turn the corner on net debt and begin paying down that legacy of debt, with some $30 billion of net debt reduction expected over the forward estimates. That is being driven by the strong results of this government.


I note that the member for Rankin has left us, but I do want to address a number of his comments. In relation to the forecast on wages and other matters, here are some comments. Saul Eslake says that the economic growth forecasts in the budget are reasonable and the commodity price assumptions are conservative. Stephen Koukoulas, not known as a raving fan of the government, says:


It is important to note, in this context, that the budget is framed on a series of realistic and reasonably conservative economic forecasts for economic growth, wages and company profits …


That is a very sensible contribution by Mr Koukoulas. This sort of assertion from those opposite is just wrong. We note that in an environment where we are constraining government spending growth to just 1.9 per cent in real terms, that means that public-sector spending is under control. That is the right thing for this nation.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (17:01):  The 2018-19 budget is designed to ensure Australia is well positioned to achieve the objectives set out in the 2017 Foreign Policy white paper. This is the first comprehensive review of Australia's international engagement in 14 years. It sets out our priorities and interests, underpinned by values, and reaffirms the government's commitment to delivering more global opportunities for Australian businesses. As my friend and colleague the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment knows, Australian business has to be internationally competitive. The budget includes a $15 million business engagement package to continue tackling non-tariff barriers faced by Australian exporters and to increase the competitiveness of our service exports in particular. 


The Turnbull government is pursuing the most ambitious trade agenda in Australia's history, having concluded or upgraded seven trade agreements since we were elected in 2013, including the historic Trans-Pacific Partnership 11. This morning Minister Ciobo launched formal free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. We are pursuing these job-creating deals because we know they drive economic growth, they open doors for Australian businesses in growing markets around the world and they create jobs. Our thriving tourism industry is supporting 600,000 jobs. In fact, under the Turnbull government 16 times as many tourism jobs have been created as under the previous Labor government. The Turnbull government is continuing to provide record funding for Tourism Australia, and is supporting $45 million in grants through the Building Better Regions Fund to help move even more tourists into our regional areas. The budget will also fund work to identify solutions to grow our cruise sector, which contributes $2.7 billion to the economy each year, and to create many jobs through our creative industries through the $140 million Location Incentive Funding Program. We're very excited about this because it's going to encourage more international productions to film in Australia, underpinning our creative sector. 


The budget also further delivers on the government's largest diplomatic expansion in over 40 years and the white paper's commitment to open more overseas missions over the next 10 years. We are providing $10.8 million for a new consulate-general in Kolkata, India—that brings to four the number of diplomatic missions in India—and $8.4 million to open a high commission in Tuvalu. The new consulate-general in India will help Australian businesses access opportunities in India's growing mining sector. We're also protecting our interests in the ever-changing Indo-Pacific region. Tuvalu is a key member of the Pacific Islands Forum and an important partner in the Pacific, and this will bring to 14 the number of missions that we have in the Pacific. 


We're stepping up our efforts to create a more resilient and prosperous region, and the Pacific will benefit from over $1.3 billion in aid in 2018-19. This is Australia's largest-ever contribution to the Pacific, and it represents over a quarter of Australia's total aid program. It includes funding for undersea telecommunications cables for Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, and this is all about delivering more reliable communications infrastructure and providing economic development benefits for our partners in the Pacific.


We'll also invest an estimated $4.2 billion in total eligible official development assistance in 2018-19, including $410 million for humanitarian funding and, in this increasingly dynamic and volatile world, we need to have funding to help those in need after a crisis. The aid budget is responsible, it's affordable, it's targeted and it's delivering sustainable outcomes in health, education and gender equality.


We're also providing $10 million over three years for the new Australian Aid: Friendship Grants scheme—I think this will be welcomed by all sides of the parliament—which will enable Australian community groups like service clubs, diaspora groups and civil society entities that are not currently registered with DFAT to deliver aid in conjunction with funding from the Australian government.


Finally, the white paper also seeks to promote and protect the international rules based order, and I'll just mention one area where this is of concern: the Turnbull government continues to seek justice for the victims of the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH17. We're providing $50.3 million over four years to support the Dutch prosecution of those responsible and assist the next of kin to participate in court proceedings. The coalition government will continue to advance Australia's security and prosperity in a highly competitive world.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (17:06):  I rise to contribute to the consideration in detail debate for the budget, particularly with regard to tourism, because there is no doubt that this budget is a missed opportunity when it comes to tourism with the coalition failing to restore the $35 million funding cut from Tourism Australia last year. 


Investing in Tourism Australia is a no-brainer. The fact is that every dollar spent on tourism advertising and marketing generates a return on investment of some $16. What's more, we know that tourism has been identified as one of five supergrowth sectors by Deloitte. It employs more than one million Australians and, given where we're located—in the fastest growing region of the world—there is enormous opportunity for us to grow the economy and grow jobs, particularly in our regions, if the government provides appropriate support.


Upon coming to office, the coalition cut two of federal Labor's successful programs: the T-QUAL Grants Program and the Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund. Both of those programs supported industry development by providing grants for projects that would not only attract both interstate and international visitors but also encourage them to lengthen their stays. Communities across the nation benefited immensely from these programs. While the tourism sector is performing well in Australia, the fact is a number of challenges remain around regional dispersal and extending the average stay.


The continued success of tourism relies on a government that supports it, and the coalition should prove it does by restoring funding to Tourism Australia. It's not just Labor saying this; the TTF, the peak organisation, said, 'It's dismissed as a joke by Minister Ciobo'—and I note that his attitude towards the sector is now on the record. They describe the 2018 budget as bittersweet saying:


… the Government has missed a golden opportunity to reap the benefits from substantially increasing its funding for Tourism Australia.


This follows the disastrous 2017 budget, which saw not just the cuts to Tourism Australia but the increase in visa application charges. Of course who can forget the minister's performance in question time speaking about any increase in the Passenger Movement Charge as 'killing the goose that lays the golden egg'? He made a goose of himself, because immediately after that the government introduced a budget that in fact increased the passenger movement charge, in spite of the fact that there was very clearly an election commitment from both sides of politics that that would not happen. 


Of course, we know that tourism does matter. When the government were elected in 2013, they forgot to appoint a tourism minister; so they have improved somewhat—they at least have someone as tourism minister now. We know that tourism generates more than $97 billion in economic activity. It's got to be regarded that investment in tourism is just that—it's an investment that produces a return; it's not simply a cost. We know that there are enormous opportunities. At the last election, we were the only political party that produced a tourism policy. When we're in government, we certainly won't forget to appoint a tourism minister; indeed, we will make sure that tourism is very much linked in with infrastructure and transport. We know that all the great cities of the world that rely on tourism—New York, Paris, London—have very effective public transport networks, and we know that that linkage with provision of infrastructure is so important. We know also that tourism infrastructure matters in our regions. There is incredible opportunity for us to grow tourism in the regions around Australia, not just at the Reef and the Rock. More importantly, there is an opportunity to grow jobs in regional centres. So we regard tourism as a priority and we regard this budget as a lost opportunity. Indeed, the feedback from the sector is that it is a lost opportunity. Tourism is critical to Australia's future, and it's about time the government gave it due support. (Time expired)

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (17:12):  Well, there you go—that's the full commitment of the shadow tourism minister. He comes in, rambles for five minutes, making all sorts of false allegations, and walks back out. That is the summation of Labor's approach to tourism. When it comes to the Australian tourism industry, the Australian Labor Party is nothing other than a complete and utter fraud. This guy opposite, the shadow tourism minister, gets up, rattles off a few platitudes and then not only walks out he has next to nil investment in Australia's tourism industry. This is from the Australian Labor Party, who just took five minutes lecturing the coalition about tourism funding, yet when they were in government they actually cut funding to Tourism Australia. 


When the shadow minister makes the false allegation that there's been a $35 million cut to Tourism Australia's funding, he fails to mention two things. The first is that that reduction in TA funding was a consequence of the operation of the Department of Finance's foreign exchange financing of the tourism agency. That's what that was: Department of Finance foreign exchange fluctuations. That's what drove that reduction. But what we know now and what the actual facts are now is that Tourism Australia is receiving record funding under the coalition. When Labor was elected, the federal coalition had left Tourism Australia with a substantial amount of funding. In the 2007-08 budget, there was $136.3 million. What did Labor do in 2013-14? Funding was down to $130.4 million. So, when the shadow tourism minister walks into this chamber and starts rattling on about reductions in Tourism Australia funding, well, Labor would know, because Labor delivered reductions in funding for Tourism Australia. That is in complete and total contrast to the coalition, which has increased funding for Tourism Australia to record amounts. When there was a change in the forward estimates, it was as a consequence of the Department of Finance's foreign exchange dealings. 


The second thing to note about Australia's tourism industry is we have a record number of tourists staying for a record length of time and spending a record amount of money. Lo and behold, there has been record funding from the coalition. So there are four records for Australia's tourism industry: record numbers, record spend, record length of stay and record funding from the coalition. So I frankly reject entirely this fraud of a shadow tourism minister when he comes in here and starts telling the coalition how we're getting tourism policy wrong, because the fact is that the results tell a very different story to what we're hearing from the shadow tourism minister.


The other example that we saw was when he tried to verbal me in relation to TTF. What I did was question the authenticity of the shadow tourism minister, which he tried to manipulate and twist into somehow being a criticism of the industry. Do you know what? I have been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Australia's tourism industry for decades with operators on the Gold Coast, operators in regional markets like Cairns and operators in our major cities, all of them driving this magnificent industry from strength to strength, notwithstanding that, for the two terms that they were in, the Australian Labor Party slashed Tourism Australia's funding, massively increased the passenger movement charge and levied a host of new taxes on Australia's tourism industry. It was the men and women of Australia's tourism industry—including my very own family—that continued to make sure that Australia went from strength to strength.


I'm so pleased that the foreign minister and I work hand in glove in promoting Australia globally. Take, for example, the bold new campaign in the North American market. It's a terrific campaign, which is, in fact, up for a number of awards at the forthcoming global television advertising industry awards in Cannes—a testament to the bold vision of the MD of Tourism Australia, John O'Sullivan, and of the board of Tourism Australia and to the fact that the foreign minister and I can work together as a team to maximise the opportunity for Tourism Australia to continue to put its best foot forward. We will remain invested in giving the tools that Australia's tourism industry needs to make sure they go from strength to strength, to continue to provide record exports, to continue to see record numbers of tourists, to continue to see record spending in the tourism industry, and to continue to drive investment in the tourism industry so that we can, most fundamentally, continue to create so many jobs for those hardworking men and women and the next generation of young Aussies coming through.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:17):  I want to ask the trade minister about non-tariff barriers. The foreign minister mentioned in her introductory remarks the allocation in this budget to tackle non-tariff barriers, and the Foreign policy white paper released in November last year made the point that the government will implement new non-tariff measures to respond to business concerns. As the minister knows, this is a big problem and a serious problem. It's arguably the biggest problem confronting a lot of Australian exporters and potential exporters. As tariffs have gone down around the world over the last few decades, a lot of non-tariff barriers have gone up, and I think the minister made the point in his remarks at the Press Club two weeks ago that G20 countries have implemented more than 7,400 non-tariff measures in the last 10 years. In the budget, as I mentioned, there's funding allocated in the DFAT portfolio. There's also funding allocated in the department of agriculture's portfolio. That's for ag councillors, I understand, to be posted to the UK, Mexico, Japan, India, Chile and Russia, but not China, which I thought was interesting. But I didn't want to press that point.


I was interested in learning more today, if we can, about the DFAT allocation of $15 million over four years for a package of initiatives to support the Australian business community. In estimates, a couple of weeks ago, we were advised that $6.6 million of that $15 million would be allocated towards tackling these non-tariff barriers. Can the minister provide us with some more details on what that funding will be allocated to do and, specifically, whether this is the funding allocated to tackle that issue identified in the white paper or whether there are other things that the minister is intending to do here? And, while the minister's on his feet and thinking about this, I'm interested in the minister's views on a proposal by the former National government in New Zealand to establish a cross-agency team of their equivalent of DFAT and agriculture to coordinate the work that government does on non-tariff barriers in key export markets. It's something that I understand the new Labour government in New Zealand has continued with, so that, now, there's a single point of information and contact for exporters when dealing with government, whether they're dealing with an ag issue or some other issue, that can address their concerns and help to make sure there's better coordination when industry needs the support of government. So my first question is: what does the minister think of this as potentially a way to tackle this big and important problem?


While I've got the chance, I might ask also the minister for his thoughts on the value of internship programs for young Australian professionals and how they might be inserted into trade agreements. The minister would be aware that the French government recently negotiated an agreement with the Chinese government—a reciprocal program that allows young professionals to gain commercial experience in China, undertaking an internship for I think up to six months. In their submission to the foreign policy white paper, the Australian Chamber of Commerce Shanghai, who met with both the minister and me today, recommended that such a program should be replicated for young Australian professionals.


It is an idea that wasn't picked up in the white paper, but it's an idea that I think is a good one. Not enough Australians have experience working in Asia. I'm conscious—and I'm sure the foreign minister will make this point—that the New Colombo Plan facilitates that. This is something that could operate over and above that. Knowing as we do, from work that Asialink and PwC have done over the last 12 months, that we have a serious deficit in terms of the number of Australian professionals with experience working in Asia, I wonder whether there's some thought being given to trying to implement a similar program to this to make sure that the next generation of Australian businesspeople have these sorts of skills.


I've said that, if my party wins the next election, we'd seek to establish a similar program to the one that the French have recently negotiated with the Chinese. If it works, it's the sort of thing that I think we could do with other countries in Asia. So my question to the minister is: does he support this approach of increasing the amount of Asian business skills that young Australian professionals have by setting up internship programs with our Asian neighbours?

I was disappointed in the member for Grayndler's very emotional beat-up against the government, again unnecessarily. If I go back to the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era, I was then based in Asia and I was doing deals, and I had my head in spreadsheets. When you're doing very large deals, often there is a cell on a spreadsheet for sovereign risk, and that usually impacts a discounted cash flow, in one way or another. At that time, Australia's sovereign risk was far higher than it was previously and certainly far higher than it is now, and that is because the Australian economy was being managed so poorly by the previous Labor administrations, which had a detrimental impact on investment coming into Australia but also on Australia's reputation internationally. If there has been something in particular that this Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and his predecessor has done so well, it is executing those free trade agreements. Indeed, the Korea, Japan and China agreements all stalled under the previous Labor government. We saw the impact ultimately residing in the state of the national economy. 


Look at our national economy now. Our national accounts came out only a couple of weeks ago. What we see is unemployment at 5.4 per cent. What we see in the first quarter of 2018 is a growth rate of one per cent, making annual growth 3.1 per cent. Business confidence is up and investment is up. This is an extraordinary set of figures for Australia's national economy. When you break down that last quarter of growth, the No. 1 one thing that drove Australia's growth for the first quarter, the biggest contribution to our GDP growth, was exports. We saw even in the last financial year $374 billion in exports. Now that is a record for our country. In Queensland alone: Queensland's total exports of goods were valued at $70 billion in 2017—that's an increase of 25 per cent. Of course, the biggest export good for us in Queensland is coal, followed by beef. There are nearly 25,000 people employed in the coal industry in Queensland and nearly 20,000 in beef—both enormous producers of jobs and growth to our economy. 


Looking at the track record of this government, as somebody who has worked in trade most of his life, I cannot tell you how proud I am to be part of a government that has concluded seven FTAs, and to think of the FTAs that have impacted us, particularly in Queensland, such as the Japan, Korea and China FTAs and, more recently, Peru and the TPP-11—a negotiation, by the way, that the Leader of the Opposition thought we should fold on—all being delivered by this coalition government. That is what, ultimately, is opening up opportunities for us. 


Negotiations are now to start with the European Union. This is a marketplace of half a billion consumers. This is a marketplace with a US$17.3 trillion GDP economy. Again we see opportunities opening up, because we have the single most comprehensive, ambitious trade agenda that this country has ever seen—which leads me, of course, to ask a question of our Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Could the minister expand on how the Turnbull government is delivering on our ambitious trade agenda? And how will that agenda continue to drive opportunities here in Australia, particularly opportunities that will drive growth?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:27):  I would like to ask the foreign minister about foreign aid and the cuts to overseas development assistance in the budget, particularly given the comments that she made in Sydney last week, when she made the point that she thinks that overseas development assistance should absolutely be increased in the budget—she said that, I think, at the British Chamber of Commerce event in a Q&A with Ticky Fullerton. Is that right, Minister?

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2018-06-18,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:27):  Let me put it in context as well, by saying that it seems that this budget is yet another cut to Australia's overseas development assistance, having already cut this budget by $11 billion under this foreign minister's watch over the last four or five years with cuts to outlays in the next four years of $140 million. This year's budget delivers the weakest levels of Australian development assistance in history, now spending just 22c in every $100 of our national income on foreign aid in 2018-19. On the current trajectory, by the end of the forward estimates this will be just 19c in every $100. The aid budget has now been cut in every single budget since this government came to power. 


Australia has a deep interest in contributing to global poverty alleviation, and our international development program supports security and stability in our region. The minister's own DFAT white paper that was released late last year said that Australia's overseas aid program aims to:


… assist developing countries reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development in line with Australia's national interest. 


However, in London a few months ago, the Minister for International Development, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, cited opinion polls to justify Australia's poor aid budget. She said:


In Australia we had some research done where it showed that about 80 per cent of Australians believe that we should not be spending more on foreign aid or that what we spend is about right.


So it seems that the government thinks an opinion poll is the best way to determine how much we should spend on overseas development assistance. 


Unlike the Turnbull government, the New Zealand government gets it. They've described their decision to boost aid funding in this year's budget as a clear demonstration to the international community that New Zealand is serious about addressing global and regional challenges, and their decision to lift overseas development assistance to 0.28 per cent of gross national income over the next four years is a demonstration of that.


A Shorten Labor government will contribute more to international development assistance than this current government. We've repeatedly urged the Turnbull government to return to a proper bipartisan approach to international development assistance, so I was heartened to hear the foreign minister last week say that she believes that foreign development assistance should absolutely be increased. My question to the minister is: at a time when Australia's influence in the region is under stress and you yourself believe that we should be spending more, why haven't you been able to prevent $11 billion worth of aid cuts in the Australian budget?

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Chief Government Whip) (17:30):  My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The unprecedented growth in the Indo-Pacific region will provide job-creating opportunities for my electorate of Forrest, particularly while Australia's economy, one managed by the Turnbull government, remains resilient, competitive and agile. I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which is planning a delegation to India and Indonesia to meet Australian businesspeople in both countries to discuss the challenges they face in day-to-day operations, the scale of opportunities both markets provide, and the obstacles to expanded trade such as language, cultural traditions and infrastructure. The delegation will also meet with committee counterparts in the respective parliaments. Can the foreign minister outline how a new consulate-general in Kolkata, India, will further help businesses in Forrest access opportunities in India's growing economy and advance our interests in a changing Indo-Pacific? 


In addition to supporting small to medium businesses in Forrest, the coalition government is creating a new generation of outward-looking young Australians with an abiding interest in our region through its flagship foreign policy initiative, the New Colombo Plan. I'm delighted that former Busselton Senior High School student and 2018 New Colombo Plan scholarship recipient, Ms Hayley Winchcombe, was earlier this year named the inaugural New Colombo Plan ASEAN Fellow at a special reception with the leaders of the 10 ASEAN countries, co-hosted by the foreign minister and the Prime Minister. How does this type of educational exchange help guide Australia through a period of profound change in our region, boost employability and drive economic growth? 


Since February, I've been supporting another form of educational exchange. As part of the Australia Awards Women's Leadership Initiative I've been mentoring Nirose Silas from Vanuatu. Nirose recently completed a Master of Business (Management) at Queensland University of Technology. An auditor by profession, she is returning to her native Vanuatu, where she hopes to continue to work with the Public Accounts Committee supporting the Vanuatu parliament. Nirose's future goal is to become the Auditor-General of Vanuatu. I wish her the best in this. She's absolutely committed to improving the leadership skills of women in Vanuatu and supporting them to take on senior government and public sector roles. How is the coalition government's aid and humanitarian budget supporting girls and women like Nirose in our region to reach their full economic, social and political potential? And how will this budget allow generous community organisations in Forrest to tackle poverty and inequality in our region through the government's new Australian Aid: Friendship Grants? 


Finally, in order for us to benefit from the immense opportunities in our region, Australia must be well placed to meet a diverse range of security threats—from Islamic terrorism to threats to open sea lanes which enable trade in goods and energy that fuel the region's growth. Countries continue to disrespect, challenge and undermine international law. North Korea's long-range missile and nuclear programs are one such example. We, and I in particular, remain deeply concerned by the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17. No members of my electorate were lost on that fateful day, but the grandparents of the three young Maslin children live in Dunsborough, in my electorate. This was beyond a dreadful day, and it was a tragic day in the life of that family, and every day since, for them and their whole family. Minister, how does this budget seek justice for the victims of the downing of MH17?

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (17:34):  I have another question, this time to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. He might—



Mr Ciobo interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  Well, it's back and forth. If you want to, you can jump in at the next opportunity and answer the question.



Mr Ciobo interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  I tell you what; I'm a good guy—I'll be brief. And I hope in return you'll answer the questions that I've asked.




Mr Ciobo:
  Comprehensively.




Mr CLARE:
  Okay. This question is about beef exports to China. In March last year, the Prime Minister signed an agreement with the Chinese Premier, here in Canberra, that will increase the number of meat processors in Australia that can export chilled beef to China. It's an important agreement. The minister issued a statement at the time—I think with the former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce—saying it was worth, potentially, about $400 million to Australian industry. Unfortunately, now, 15 months later, no additional Australian meat processors have been able to export chilled beef to China. When asked about this at estimates a couple of weeks ago, it was made clear that the agreement that was reached last year in March to expand access is still being worked on by the department. 


I understand that representatives from the Australian beef industry have been in China in the last few weeks, that China has accepted the relevant protocols necessary to import Australian chilled beef and that the agreement could be implemented in a staged and graduated way, but there are political issues between the countries that the Australian government has to resolve. Minister, I know that the beef companies have written to you about this, and they've told you this, and they've also written to the Prime Minister, so my question is: what action is the minister taking to resolve this issue?

Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (17:36):  I'll answer the questions from the member for Forrest and also address the questions from the member for Blaxland in reverse order. 


Thank you, Member for Forrest, for raising the issue of MH17. I know the grandparents of the Maslin children are in your electorate. I have met with them and I remain in contact with the Maslin family and the other families throughout Australia of the 38 people who were aboard flight MH17 from Amsterdam. The Australian government's commitment of $50 million is to assist the families of the victims to take part in the Dutch proceedings. There will be a state prosecution led by the Netherlands, and we want to ensure that the families can take part. The funding will also go to support those proceedings. The Ukraine government has entered into the necessary treaty arrangements and extradition arrangements with the Netherlands, so we believe a very full prosecution will be able to take place. But the member for Forrest would also be aware that, on 25 May, after receiving further details from the joint investigation team, Australia and the Netherlands called upon Russia to accept state responsibility for its role in the downing of MH17. We share the grief of the families around the world of the 298 people who were killed, and we'll continue to do what we can to get justice for the families here in Australia.


Your point, Member for Forrest, about the work in the Pacific is very positive because I know that you have joined this mentoring scheme and you have been connected to a bright, young woman from Vanuatu, who was a recipient of an Australia Award. Under this women's leadership initiative, the female recipients of Australia Awards who have studied in Australia will be mentored by an Australian businesswoman or parliamentarian, or a woman from civil society, so that they can maintain that connection through the Australia Awards alumni, but it is also about supporting women in the Pacific, who do face many challenges. 


The Australian aid budget is very heavily focused on three elements of support and empowerment for women and girls. First, we're providing women with the skills, the capabilities and the capacity to take leadership roles in their families; in governments, both provincial and national; in business; in communities; and in civil society. Second, we're supporting the financial empowerment, the economic empowerment, of women by giving them the necessary skills and access to microfinance, and ensuring they can join the formal labour market. Third, we're dealing with the scourge of domestic or gender based violence in the Pacific. No country is immune, but it is particularly prevalent in the Pacific. This alumni program is part of our efforts to support women in the Pacific.


You also raised the New Colombo Plan. I'm particularly proud of that, because from a standing start in 2014 to the end of this year over 30,000 young Australian undergraduates will have been overseas, pursuant to funding under the New Colombo Plan. The member for Blaxland says, 'Why don't we have an intern program?' That's precisely what the New Colombo Plan is. Australian undergraduates have the opportunity not only to live and study in one of 40 locations in the Indo-Pacific but to undertake practicums and work experience. We have had some amazing levels of cooperation from businesses and governments and civil society, who are supporting young Australians undertake these practical experiences, working experiences, as part of the New Colombo Plan.


In relation to Kolkata, I point out that it is the centre of India's mining and resources sector. I'm pleased that the member for Forrest asked a question about her constituents. The new consulate general will enhance two-way cultural, education, research and tourism connections and provide consular opportunities, but for the member for Forrest's electorate I think the tourism and the mining opportunities will be enormous.


On the question of aid, the member for Blaxland asks why there isn't a bipartisan approach to increasing the aid budget. I say: why isn't there a bipartisan approach to maintaining a budget surplus and maintaining an affordable aid program? He talks about $11 million in cuts. The trajectory that Labor had embraced was utterly unaffordable and was never going to happen. The aid budget has increased—2.1 per cent per year. (Time expired)

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (17:41):  Before I get to the questions from the member for Blaxland I will speak to the questions asked by the member for Fairfax and the member for Forrest. Both of them are outstanding local members, outstanding for their consistent advocacy on behalf of their constituents—in particular their small to medium sized enterprises. I had the privilege of being with the member for Fairfax and going to Yandina, where I had the chance to meet with a macadamia nut processor and farmer. I note that one of Australia's premier macadamia nut processing plants, Nutworks, is in the electorate of the member for Fairfax. It employs more than 60 people and is now exporting its products worldwide. In fact, Kylie Watson, the CEO of Nutworks, at an FTA seminar recently explained how an increase in inquiries from China, spurred as a consequence of the introduction of the FTA, prompted Nutworks to start exporting its macadamias. She said:


It was the timing of the reduction in tariffs. We really started to see an increase in enquiries, particularly coming out of China.


That's a consequence of the member for Fairfax's strong work and understanding of his local community and his being a strong advocate for them in the government's party room.


Likewise, I've had the privilege of being with the member for Forrest and speaking to not only local tourism exports but small and medium sized exporters. They are the people who are creating employment in Australia and giving opportunities for new young Aussies to be able to participate in the labour force by getting jobs in the small to medium sized enterprises that are now exporting their products and services to the world. That's a direct consequence of this, the most ambitious trade agenda that Australia ever had and—as we have seen in relation to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—their advocacy and their level headedness with the Australian public about the opportunities.


I know there is good spirit shown by the shadow minister opposite, but we should never forget it was the Australian Labor Party who described the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—they came in here asking in an anguished tone what was happening bilaterally and why wasn't the Australian government doing more—as a dud deal. This deal, which has underwritten a third of Australia's economic growth, was described by Labor as a dud deal. In fact, they turned the other way when the Australian trade union movement ran the most disgraceful, dishonest, multimillion-dollar campaign against China and Chinese workers and said the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement was going to wreak devastation across the Australian economy. So you can understand why I might take a minute to reflect on Labor's track record. Again, you don't look at what Labor say; you have to look at what Labor do. And their track record on the bilateral relationship with China on trade and on investment is absolutely disgraceful! 


In the short time that I have remaining, I'll speak more directly on non-tariff measures; the government have put money on the table. We've put money on the table to deal with non-tariff measures in a comprehensive way, because when I talk to industry I hear concerns about non-tariff measures, in the same way as I get strong advocacy from the member for Forrest and the member for Fairfax as well as so many coalition members, who raise with me the concerns of their constituents on NTMs, or non-tariff measures. We're working to break down those barriers. Under the coalition, we've seen some of the most expeditious outcomes around protocols to get Australian goods into markets like China than by any government in Australia's history. We're also putting more money down. I'm sure the shadow minister would like to know that I'm looking very closely at what New Zealand has done in relation to opportunities for an interdepartmental committee. I don't want to use IDC loosely, but I'm looking for opportunities for coordination between the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources and the Department of Trade and Investment, and I'm happy to speak to him directly about other concerns that he has.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:01):  Thank you to members of the government and the assistant minister for the opportunity to speak a little bit this afternoon about the 2018 budget, handed down about a month ago in this building. I think one of the defining features of the budget was that, for the first time in four prime ministers and four treasurers, we had the global economy making a big positive contribution to the budget, rather than a big negative contribution to the budget—something that we had, unfortunately, become accustomed to for much of the last decade or so. It really was welcome news that, with the global economy in such good condition, the best condition for a decade, we are seeing some of the revenue return to the budget. Obviously, it's a good thing that we have those conditions improving around the world, and that is helping the Australian economy and the Australian budget as well.


In the economic sense, we're seeing those global conditions feeding some good national accounts outcomes when it comes to investment and exports, in particular, which made a big positive contribution to the most national accounts. You can see the transmission from a stronger global economy, where we've got something like 120 different countries growing simultaneously for the first time in a long time, making a contribution to our export numbers and some of our other, broader numbers and measures of GDP as well.


But, despite those relatively welcome headline figures—in particular the GDP in that last quarter—there are some troubling undercurrents. Here, we're thinking about wages at historic lows; we're thinking about living standards being quite weak in historical terms; and we're thinking, of course, about low household consumption—soft household consumption—in those most recent numbers, as well as a lack of saving, and high household debt. So at the household level, below that headline rate of GDP, we've really got some quite soft conditions. We've got a lot of families experiencing a triple whammy of spending less, saving less, but still racking up more debt, and that's obviously a very troubling situation.


In the budget we also had something like $40 billion of additional revenue—taxes and charges—show up at the front door of the Treasury. There's $40 billion in this budget, yet we still have record net debt in this budget, twice what this government inherited. It went from $175 billion in September 2013 to $350 billion now. We've got record gross debt. Gross debt has only been over half a trillion dollars under one government in the history of the country—under this government. In these budget papers it's expected to be over half a trillion dollars every year for the next 10 years, and higher at the end of that decade than it is today. So despite the global economy helping the budget, $40 billion in extra revenue showing up at the door, we still have a budget in substantially worse condition than it was in September 2013. Probably most remarkably, despite this substantial new revenue showing up at the door, we've got a 2019-20 surplus which relies exclusively, entirely, more than entirely, on the bring-forward of a tobacco tax. We have a skinny surplus which relies on a timing change in tobacco tax, without which there would be no surplus in 2019-20. 


Those are just the facts of the matter. No doubt we'll get into a bit of back-and-forth here, but I'm just establishing that the facts of the budget are good global conditions, soft conditions at the household level in the economy. We still have record net and gross debt. Debt is being accumulated per month at a faster clip now, on average, under this government than under the previous government. So despite having everything that you would ask from the global economy helping the economy, helping the budget, we still have very poor fiscal outcomes in the budget. With net debt doubled, with gross debt more than half a trillion dollars and with debt accumulating faster now than it did under the previous Labor government, what we really need to hear from the government representatives here today is, why we don't hear anything anymore about a budget emergency?

Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (16:06):  I have several questions for the minister today regarding our investment in defence infrastructure and capability and what this means for jobs in my home state of South Australia and the nation more broadly. I'm keen to ask questions of the minister because investing in defence infrastructure and capability is one of the many ways the Turnbull government is creating a strong economy and supporting jobs in my home state of South Australia and in my electorate of Boothby. Our investments are also creating education and training opportunities which our university sector in SA, for example, is very excited about. Just last Thursday I heard direct from Professor Colin Stirling, the Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, which is in the heart of my electorate of Boothby, of the range of benefits the naval shipbuilding program will deliver to my local area. These exciting opportunities are a direct result of the Turnbull government's investment in defence infrastructure and capability. The Turnbull government's shipbuilding plan will give Australian businesses opportunities to take part in delivering defence contracts and transfer the knowledge, technology and skills they develop into other areas of the economy. This will assist in the expansion of businesses into new markets, allowing them to competitively pursue lucrative export opportunities. Through our initial investment we will be enabling local businesses to build their capabilities and practices so they can compete globally and build our defence export capability. With nine future frigates, 12 submarines and also offshore patrol vessels, the defence industry will soon be booming. 


This $90 billion investment in our nation's defence and defence industry will benefit all Australians. It will create a total of 2,800 jobs in my home state of South Australia alone and opportunities for local businesses in my electorate of Boothby—businesses like Cornell Design and Plasteel in Melrose Park and SAGE Automation at Tonsley have previously worked on major defence contracts. They know the value of defence projects to local businesses and manufacturers and the jobs they support. It's not just the direct defence work that supports jobs; it is also the technology, learning and innovation these companies can then apply to other problems or issues in the private sector and the civilian world that deliver additional value to our economy and additional jobs as well. This is to my mind the true value of defence work. It is not just the actual defence capability, which is absolutely necessary for the nation, but the skills and the technology that companies can then apply to non-defence projects. 


Our investment in defence could not be more different to that of the Labor Party. The former Labor government failed to commission a single vessel from an Australian shipyard during their time in office. This impacted the stability of shipbuilding jobs, particularly in my home state of South Australia, as well as the capability of our Navy and Defence Force personnel. In stark contrast, the Turnbull government has committed to building 54 new naval vessels in total. We've taken action to ensure workers at the Australian Submarine Corporation remain employed and have opportunities to upskill, with scholarships available to support roles in operations, management, computer aided design, engineering and supply chain fields. We've launched the Naval Shipbuilding College, the Centre for Defence Industry Capability and the Defence Innovation Hub—based in Adelaide—so that South Australia has the workforce and capabilities it needs to support the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that will be created by the naval shipbuilding program.


In March 2017, the Turnbull government established Australian Naval Infrastructure Pty Ltd to facilitate the development and construction of new infrastructure at the Osborne shipbuilding facility, as outlined in the naval shipbuilding plan. In August we saw the first sod turned for the new surface shipbuilding yard, which is arguably the most significant infrastructure supporting the delivery of a continuous naval shipbuilding program in Australia. When completed, thanks to the Turnbull government, we will have one of the most modern and busiest platform shipbuilding businesses in the world at Osborne south. At Osborne north we will have one of the most modern and busiest submarine businesses in the world.


The work at the Osborne shipyard commissioned by our government with the current infrastructure build, and later with the construction, sustainment and maintenance of naval vessels, is a game changer for South Australia. So I ask, will the minister update the chamber as to how the works are progressing at Australian Naval Infrastructure's new naval shipyard development at Osborne? Minister, how many jobs do you expect to be created as a result of the shipyard construction through the managing contractor? And, Minister, how has the coalition government's investment in Osborne and elsewhere helped to ensure the ongoing stability of Australia's domestic shipbuilding industry?

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:11):  I want to raise an issue and pose a few questions to the minister, which I think warrant serious consideration and response, regarding the government's so-called innovative financing—I think they call it 'innovative financing' themselves—colloquially known as off-budget investments, which in the worst case scenario is becoming an $84 billion ticking fiscal time bomb for the nation. I say at the outset I do understand there's no formal accounting definition of 'off budget', but entities or investments outside the general government sector as presented in the budget papers are commonly referred to as being off budget because they get excluded from the calculation of the government's budget deficit or surplus. The kinds of things this covers, Minister, are by way of equity investments, concessional loans, contingent liabilities, guarantees and so on. Of course, assets acquired or funded through equity investments must generate a commercial rate of return, cover their cost of borrowing and a bit more and repay their capital investment in a reasonable time frame. There are of course legitimate ways to use this kind of financing. For example, the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal under the previous Labor government or the government's decision around the Western Sydney Airport strike me as quite legitimate uses of off-budget funding.


But there are serious risks. If things do go wrong they pose a fiscal time bomb in that if the equity investment doesn't get the commercial return which is projected or if something happens to impair the valuation—or indeed if the government of the day is cooking the books—then at some point that loss comes straight back to the budget, blows out the deficit and, if sizable, can impact our AAA credit rating and blow out net debt. There is a worrying temptation for any government to overstate the benefits or inflate asset values, and the problem then becomes one for future governments and taxpayers.


So it's critical that taxpayers, through the parliament, are absolutely confident that the government isn't cheating or fiddling the books at any point in time. I believe, having looked at the budget papers, there are worrying signs. The growth has been remarkable. Over the last five budgets, there is now a total of $84 billion of easily identifiable off-budget investments. There is about $55 billion worth of equity investments and about $29 billion of concessional loans. It's a little unclear how you count WestConnex—the government still can't tell us where that tunnel is actually going in Sydney, but that's a minor detail: just keep digging and it will pop up somewhere; give it a few billion. I do acknowledge you can identify most of the investments sitting underneath that total, but the budget documents don't provide sufficient detail for anyone to assess how much of the commitments have been drawn down across the portfolio of investments. The government has flagged in the budget papers explicitly and in all the pre-budget waffle—we hear in question time from the Prime Minister about this mythical $75 billion pipeline of infrastructure and the rail lines he can build with no money that he keeps announcing—that it's preparing to use these methods more extensively. So I would ask you, Minister, can you outline precisely for the $84 billion: which projects, what are the risks, where can we find this information and how much of these commitments for each instrument are drawn down and will be drawn down? And where is this information publicly available? The reason I'd also say alarm bells are ringing is—I will give a couple of examples. With the Inland Rail project, the government's now put in nearly $9 billion of funny money. You can only describe it as that because former Deputy Prime Minister Anderson's review found that it would not repay its capital, even in 50 years. This is a serious issue.


Let's be clear what you're doing, Minister, with this set of budget documents and this investment. You're borrowing $9 billion for an Inland Rail project. You're pretending that it's going to make a commercial return above the cost of borrowing and repay its capital in a reasonable time frame. That's what is required. And yet your own independent review by the former Deputy Prime Minister, National Party doyen, John Anderson, said, 'That's not going to happen. It won't repay it, even in 50 years.'


The former CEO of the Australian Rail Track Corporation told the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—I was stunned that he actually admitted it; it was an outbreak of honesty. I noticed he's not there anymore. I don't know what went on there—he probably just retired. But the revenues that flow to ARTC won't cover the full capital cost and provide a return. So that's the CEO of the ARTC saying, 'This $9 billion we've just hidden over there isn't actually going to be repaid. It doesn't provide a commercial cost of return.' On the face of it, if that was true, you'd say, 'You're fiddling the books.' So can you explain to the parliament, then, how this is classified as an equity investment—you can build infrastructure with grants, give somebody some money and build it; that's the traditional way—and what the consequences are if some is written off, and what impact that will have on the deficit?

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (16:16):  I thank the members for Rankin and Boothby and the other member for their comments and questions. In relation to the member for Boothby's question, she raised a very important issue. What she did highlight, with great specificity, was the sad failure of the previous government to support the building of even one naval vessel during six years in office. So after six years—it's a long time—there's not one ship. Those opposite stand condemned for their failure to invest in the Australian shipbuilding industry.


The member for Rankin held a very important and prestigious role as chief of staff to the then Treasurer. He did not use that lofty perch from where he sat to argue for the commissioning of a single naval vessel, and that's a failure. But, in contrast, I can explain to the member for Boothby that this government is very committed to the future of the naval shipbuilding industry in Australia. We have avoided the valley of death that those opposite so cruelly would have imposed on the naval shipbuilding industry, and we are investing very significantly in the shipbuilding industry in Australia.


So, in this budget, we provided an additional equity injection to Australian naval infrastructure to enable the development of the required infrastructure at the Osborne precinct in Adelaide—$535 million, a substantial sum towards the surface shipbuilding yard in Osborne. It will support the purchase of additional land at Osborne, and I'm sure that all members would support this very important investment. It's required for the Future Submarine construction yard, of course, and, thanks to this investment, the redevelopment of the Osborne yard is in full swing.


Only eight months after Australian Naval Infrastructure engaged Lendlease as the managing contractor for the redevelopment project, the development is progressing well. That's good news for the industry, and that's good news for South Australia. Let me go into that in a little bit more detail. It's estimated that this Osborne South redevelopment will create up to 600 jobs. Currently, there are about 100 construction staff working onsite—good news for Adelaide—and ANI advise that this will peak at up to 400 employees in 2019. That doesn't include all of the knock-on benefits to all of the related industries adjacent to the Osborne shipyard. The earthworks subcontractor, McMahon Services Australia, completed the site preparation works in April this year. The majority Indigenous-owned subcontractor Intract Australia formed a joint venture with McMahon to construct these early earthworks. We are seeing 100 per cent of the square-section structural steel for this project ordered from Australian steelmakers BlueScope, in Port Kembla, and Liberty OneSteel, in Whyalla. Again, it is all about supporting Australian industry and supporting Australian jobs and it is another reason why 2017 was the greatest year of job creation in Australian history, with some 415,000 jobs created in that year, a very strong record. This important naval shipbuilding program is a key part of that. In contrast, those opposite failed to build a single ship or, indeed, to even commission or contemplate the building of a single ship in that time.


I want to address the member's question in relation to equity financing. As he's pointed out, those opposite made use of these funding mechanisms for programs like the Moorebank intermodal, a very important project in Western Sydney, and the NBN. Each of these projects, in addition to all the projects that are accounted for in this way, is subject to a rigorous process through the Department of Finance. The principles in relation to equity accounting have been consistent over the years. That process hasn't changed. This process enables investment in important job-creating projects.

Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (16:21):  I quite like the member for Banks. We did a bit of work together before he got elevated to deputy chief Treasury Muppet or whatever. But that's not an answer. I actually used my serious voice. I used numbers. I pointed to real facts and figures that are in the budget papers. And you completely didn't address the question. You responded to the member for Boothby's government waffle, when she wasn't even interested enough to stay around and hear your response. I feel slighted. I feel a little upset by this. So let me continue.


On the Inland Rail—and I would welcome your answer to a pretty specific and clear question, Minister—what is the basis on which you can classify this $9 billion of 'funny money' as an off-budget investment? What is the basis? Tell us how that accords with your accounting rules, which require you to make a commercial return and repay the cost of capital in a reasonable time frame. That would be a good question to answer. If you could answer that, that would actually be helpful and make this part of the legislative process perhaps just a little bit meaningful for all of us.


But I draw your attention to another and very significant off-budget investment, if you like—the National Broadband Network. That was started by Labor—and I thank you for your acknowledgement of that, Minister—as a good nation-building project. Of course, it was based on a set of assumptions—it was based on a business case at the time—that have now changed. The Prime Minister, when he was communications minister, bastardised, as we know, Labor's visionary NBN. I challenge him to come to Glen Waverley in my electorate and have a chat to anyone there who keeps getting stupid letters from the NBN saying, 'The rollout's off,' 'The rollout's on,' 'The rollout's off,' 'The rollout's on.' The only thing worse than not getting the NBN is getting the NBN, as it turns out for people who do. 


The NBN is currently valued at replacement value on the books, but industry experts are saying louder and louder that the NBN is not worth what the government claims, with the changing business model. If that's true, then the loss in value at some point will come back to budget and blow out the deficit. We're not talking about small numbers here. We're talking about $29.5 billion now of equity that the government has tipped in and another $19.5 billion of loans. Minister, can you explain the basis of the valuation and can you state unequivocally to the parliament, hand on heart—pinkie promise, invisible ink, swear in blood, whatever you like, whatever's your thing—that the NBN is worth what you claim it is, that the cost of capital will be repaid and that this is not a fiscal time bomb for future governments or taxpayers to bear? It would be very good if we could hear that unequivocal assurance that the NBN is worth what you say it is and that your reputation will hang on that.


The other point I would make is about the $75 billion sham package for infrastructure. I said to the Parliamentary Library: 'We hear about this $75 billion. What's the list of projects?' The Parliamentary Library said they couldn't find the full list of projects—and they're pretty good at finding stuff; they're much cleverer than me. I don't have a PhD, of course, unlike my learned friend, here—he's pretty good at finding stuff. But the Parliamentary Library can find no full list of the projects. In fact, when you look at the budget papers, Minister, there's only $24.3 billion of this mythical $75 billion in the forward estimates—real money. The rest is not budgeted. It appears it will be a mysterious, opaque mix of things, including contingent liabilities, like the East West Link in Melbourne—a joke—so we think you're counting that in the $75 billion. There would also be concessional loans, such as for the WestConnex tunnel in Sydney, the road to nowhere; the Auditor-General has identified a lot of problems with how that's gone. It would also include indemnities, guarantees, equity investments. There is the Melbourne rail link—the rail line the Prime Minister thinks you can build with no actual money, because apparently it's going to make a profit. I think it would be the only rail line in the world, outside Hong Kong or Singapore, that you could make a profit on building. There's a form of magic going on. As the chief executive of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia said, you can't finance your way out of a funding problem. It doesn't matter how much you cook the books or spin it, you can't. On the airport rail scam, the Grattan Institute said:


So there's a real risk that these equity investments will end up not even making a positive rate of return, never mind a commercial rate.


So can the minister please tell me where I can get a full list of exactly what is in this $75 billion package. I want a full list—I think the Australian people deserve a list—project by project, outlining how they're funded, what the mix of innovative financing mechanisms is, and what the finance department's advice and scrutiny has been, project by project, of the fiscal risks posed by these mythical investments.

"Zimmerman, Trent, MP",LP,2018-06-18,"



Mr ZIMMERMAN
 (North Sydney) (16:26):  I wanted to start by welcoming the members of the Inter-Parliamentary Study Program who have joined us for this riveting session this afternoon. I have to say it's that time of the day when the circadian cycle means that you may be feeling a bit drowsy and wanting a nap, but nothing in the Federation Chamber will ever disrupt that natural course of events, I'm afraid to tell you. 


I wanted to ask the assistant minister about payment growths in the federal budget, but I want to put a bit of context around the question I pose to him. Like many members of this House, in the lead-up to the budget, we get a number of competing demands from our communities about what their expectations of the budget are, and I have to say that my electorate is no different to what the common trend is in that regard. Over the last six months, during the course of my work in the electorate, I have met many people who have spoken to me about their concerns for essential services and those important items of infrastructure which they expect government to deliver, and I know that those concerns have included funding for education and health care and what we're going to do to support the transport needs of a growing city like Sydney. Therefore, I think this budget has met a lot of the expectations that those residents have posed to me. 


I particularly highlight the incredible commitment that we're giving to school education, with an extra $23½ billion over the next decade; the commitment to health which is reflected in the $30 billion extra that will flow to our public hospital system; all that we're doing to support drugs becoming cheaply available to those who need them through the PBS and the like; and of course what we're doing in the area of infrastructure. Unlike the member for Bruce, I'm delighted that we actually have a 10-year plan for infrastructure, which was reflected in the pipeline that was released in the lead-up to the budget by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Deputy Prime Minister. Having that type of 10-year funding pipeline is just so important for projects which obviously run over multiple years. It allows those developing the projects to plan properly and accordingly. 


The commitment to that type of infrastructure is reflected in my own electorate, where I'm really pleased that this government has been able to deliver funds for important infrastructure projects like creating a major new public foreshore park on the former submarine base Platypus, in Neutral Bay, which opened a couple of weeks ago for the first time. We provided $20 million to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust for that, and it followed the $50 million that Defence spent on remediating the site. Similarly, we're investing almost $10 million in new sporting facilities at Gore Hill, which is a commitment to the sport and recreation needs of my community. I also know that, in relation to transport, through the Asset Recycling Initiative, we're continuing to provide something like $1.6 billion to help the New South Wales government build the Sydney Metro project, which is really great news. 


The other area that my constituents raised with me is the need for tax relief. That's why I think this budget is so important, because not only are we delivering the company tax reductions that small and medium-size businesses so desperately need, company tax reductions which will maintain our international competitiveness, but also that personal income tax package which offers relief in the short term to low- and middle-income earners and in the long term will guarantee that 94 per cent of Australian taxpayers aren't paying any more than 32.5 per cent. 


Another area that people do raise with me is obviously the issue of government debt and how the government is going in relation to coming back into surplus. What is pleasing about the budget, of course, is the commitment to bring the budget back into surplus a year earlier, to reduce debt by $30 billion over the current four years and to constrain the debt blowout that was created by the last Labor government when it went on its reckless spending program. That's a great achievement of this government. In part we've been able to do that because revenues are increasing, but I'm conscious of the fact that the success of the government's fiscal strategy has not just been about relying on revenue; it's also been about relying on spending restraint. Therefore I wanted to ask the assistant minister whether he might be able to provide the House with an update on how we're going in our efforts to balance the budget by reining in spending and making sure it's sustainable, and particularly how that compares with the efforts of previous governments.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:31):  It's getting harder and harder not to laugh when you hear those opposite talk about debt under Labor, when in fact the government's own budget papers, these budget papers which were released by the government in May this year, show there in black and white that net debt has doubled during the five years of those opposite. It has actually doubled. Gross debt is also at record levels and debt is accumulating at a faster rate now under this mob than it did under its Labor predecessors. 


Leaving that aside, I want to pick up on something else that the member for North Sydney said in his contribution, if you could call it that. He talked about what the people in his community wanted to see in the budget. He talked about education spending. I think he should write to the members of his electorate and say that in this budget this government pulled another $270 million out of TAFE. I think that says it all about their approach to education. If we genuinely care about teaching and training our people for the next generation, for the jobs of the future, we can't continue to hollow out TAFE as this government has been doing. It is a new $270 million cut to TAFE in this budget. 


That's one thing that shows how spectacularly out of touch they are when it comes to communities around Australia. Another one is when it comes to wages. One of the defining features of the economy in the last few years has been that we have had wages growth which is at historic lows. They are really quite poor wage outcomes, despite the fact that the economy has started growing and global conditions are terrific. We have all these sorts of things going for us. There's been a decoupling between the prospects of the national economy and the prospects of ordinary workers like those that the member for Moreton and I represent in the best part of Australia to the south of Brisbane. 


We've got a story there from the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, in a quite remarkable contribution, which I congratulate him on. In the last week or two he gave a speech about wages. What he said about wages was that unfortunately in this country we've come to expect that what used to be normal wages growth of maybe three or four per cent has become more like two per cent. The new normal for wages growth, for a whole range of reasons relating to technology, bargaining power in the workforce and all of those sorts of things—what we're seeing is wages growth stuck at two per cent, which is a really poor outcome. That's why we're seeing less consumption, less saving and more debt, because people aren't getting the wages outcome they need and deserve to look after their families in suburbs of this country. 


So when you examine the budget in any detail, something that really jumps out at you, a big red flashing light in the forecast that the government is relying on, is that it has got remarkably optimistic—many of the independent commentators have said overly optimistic—expectations for wages growth. Remember, as I said before, and as the Governor of the Reserve Bank and others have said, we've had wages growth of around two per cent. It's been under two per cent, which is shocking. It's now around two per cent, or just over. Remember that the Reserve Bank governor said that that might be the new normal. Yet when you look at the budget—even at the summary table in statement 1—and if you look at their forecast for wages, the wage price index forecast is at two per cent now. By the end of the coming financial year they're expecting it to be 2¾ per cent—a pretty big jump. Then, in 2019-20, they expect it to jump to 3¼ per cent. The projections after that are 3½ per cent for 2020-21 and 2021-22. What that really tells us is that with wages growth at two per cent, all of a sudden, the government is expecting that, miraculously, we're going to get to 3½ per cent wages growth in just a few years time.


As the assistant minister would know, and as anyone who follows budgets would know, budgets are very sensitive to little tweaks in the forecasts, and what we've got here is really quite a substantial forecast change in wages. I've done my best not to make this a partisan question, because I think it's an important thing for us to understand when we look at the budget, even in an objective way. What I'd like to know from the assistant minister is: what would be the impact on the underlying balance if the government included in its budget wage forecasts which were more realistic, more in line with what the RBA governor is describing as the new normal of two per cent?

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (16:36):  It's good to be able to respond to the questions from the member for North Sydney. I also want to pick up on some of the comments from the member for Rankin. The member for North Sydney rightly points to the importance of fiscal constraint. He asks about that because he knows that the Australian people want their government to live within its means and he knows that the Australian people expect their governments to take a prudent and cautious approach to spending the money of the people. And there is a tremendous contrast between the prudent observations of the member for North Sydney and those opposite, because, when the member for Rankin was the chief of staff to the Treasurer of Australia, the real growth in spending under the previous government was some four per cent on average per year. It was very, very high—four per cent every year. Under this government—and this really goes to the heart of the query from the member for North Sydney—the average growth in real spending has been just 1.9 per cent per year, and, when you're talking about a budget of literally hundreds of billions of dollars, that difference between four per cent on average and 1.9 per cent is immense. And the good news is that, in this budget, the forecast rate of growth of spending declines even further to 1.6 per cent, and that comes through the hard work of going through each program carefully and of thinking, when one is going to spend the people's money, that it is just that—the people's money. It's not the government's money. It is money that has been generated by the hard work and enterprise of the Australian people, and we need to be very judicious and careful in how we spend it.


We also know that government net debt is expected to peak in this financial year—the financial year that ends in less than two weeks. And we expect that net debt will be reduced by some $30 billion over the next four years. So it is very important: we are turning the corner from that appalling legacy of debt and deficit that those opposite left us. We know they haven't passed a surplus budget since 1989, and the member knows that 1989 was a very long time ago. There have been no surpluses under those opposite since that period, some 29 years ago. And so, Member for North Sydney, it is pleasing that we are in a position of turning the corner on net debt and of paying an estimated $30 billion over the forward estimates, and it is an extraordinary contrast with those opposite, because what we saw under those opposite was the requirement for more and more spending to be addressed to interest payments. Of course, when they came into office there was no net debt. There was some $16 billion of cash in the bank, and they turned that around to a net debt of close to $200 billion—a very, very poor result indeed. 


I want to also address a number of the comments of the member for Bruce and the member for Rankin. The member for Bruce should be assured that the process in relation to equity accounting is as it has always been—the Auditor-General is required to sign off on the government's financial statements, including the treatment of any equity-accounted investments. That's as it should be. That's a very sensible and prudent approach. There are specific rules in relation to the classification of an investment as equity: it must be outside the government sector, there must be an expectation that the investment will be recovered in real terms and the government must exercise reasonable control over its investment. These are all the sorts of questions to which the Auditor-General turns their mind. 


In relation to jobs and wages, it is also important to note the record jobs growth in 2017—the greatest in history. One in eight manufacturing jobs were lost under those opposite. So we certainly will not be taking lectures from those opposite in relation to the jobs market.

Dr CHALMERS
 (Rankin) (16:41):  Wages policy is such a huge priority on that side of the parliament that in a five-minute answer, the Assistant Minister for Finance said 'wages' with 17 seconds to go but then didn't say anything actually about wages. He just said 'wages', because the member for Moreton was within his rights to say, 'Don't you care at all about how people are being paid in this country?' It says it all about how out of touch those opposite are, that we can't even hear a peep about wages. In a serious non-political question about the sensitivity of the budget forecast to a more realistic forecast on wages in line with what the Governor of the RBA said, those opposite can't even bring themselves to utter a full sentence about wages in this country. I think that does say it all.


If the member for North Sydney and the member for Banks were out listening to their community or indeed any community, they would know one of the main reasons people aren't in a big rush to give the Treasurer a big pat on the back for the economy is that the economy that people feel—the economy that people experience—is dictated largely by whether or not they're able to work hard and provide for their families. Wages are a big part of that. It's disappointing but not especially surprising that those opposite don't realise that. It's disappointing but not especially surprising that we don't get any concession or recognition when those opposite talk about debt. They always say that debt was disastrous under the Labor Party. Net debt is literally twice as big now after five years of those opposite in government. 


The member for Banks bangs on and on about how Labor didn't deliver a surplus during the global financial crisis. That's a matter of historical record. But what is also a matter of historical record is this mob under rosy global conditions—quite good global conditions—is yet to deliver a surplus. Spare us the dusted-off Tony Abbott talking points of 2013; they really should be beneath someone who walks around this place and pretends to be a serious contributor to the economic debate. 


The reality is that this budget is built on three dodgy elements. The forecast surplus in 2019-20, and the forecasts generally, are based on three dodgy sets of assumptions. The first one is wages, as I mentioned. The second one I dealt with very briefly in the beginning. It is that the entire 2019-20 surplus is based on assuming that we can pull forward $3.3 billion in tobacco tax revenue. I hope we can; we do want to crack down on illegal tobacco, but the people of Australia need to know there's $3.3 billion claimed there and it's only a $2.2 billion surplus. You don't need to be a genius to work out—even the member for Banks can probably work it out—that the surplus in 2019-20 is entirely reliant on that tobacco tax bring forward. The third set of dodgy assumptions—the cooking of the books in its most partisan and political form—is that the budget continues to claim billions of dollars in savings which have no chance of passing the Senate. In this place, the political commentators call them the zombie savings because they just won't die. The parliament keeps voting against them, and those opposite, just because they want to deliver a rosier set of numbers than they are entitled to do, continue to claim a whole bunch of zombie measures.


The worst one is the pensioner energy supplement, which has been defeated in the parliament. It takes money off seniors who need it, particularly in the winter but also in the hot summers, to pay their electricity bill. Those opposite want to take it away from them. The parliament, to its eternal credit, crossbenchers included, has continued to knock that back. Yet, in the budget, there it was again. The budget is claiming a billion dollars in savings from the energy supplement which won't pass this place, so there's a billion dollar black hole right there. Those opposite like to talk about budget black holes—there's a billion dollar hole right there.


The same is true of the family tax benefits, the maximum liquid assets waiting period, the pension supplement for people overseas, the pension residency requirement and the pensioner education supplement. There's a theme emerging. These are all attacks on pensioners. They say to the pensioners of Australia, 'We can't find $14 a fortnight for your energy supplement, but we can find almost $5 billion for the Commonwealth Bank,' the biggest single beneficiary of the company tax cuts that those opposite pretend to be so proud of, which give $17 billion to the big four banks and $80 billion to big business, which will largely spray around overseas for multinationals. 


So my question to the assistant minister—I'm not expecting an answer given he hasn't even engaged on a simple nonpartisan thing like wages policy—is: when will the government be pulling the zombie measures out of the budget so the people of Australia can get a serious fair dinkum sense of the budget position without the government cooking the books with savings that won't pass this parliament?

Mr CREWTHER
 (Dunkley) (16:46):  I want to thank the Assistant Minister for Finance for the fantastic job that he and the finance minister are continuing to do in working to reverse the damage done to Australia's financial situation by six years of Labor. It has been a long process and a difficult balancing act. While we have a responsibility to the Australian people to support necessary services, we also have a responsibility to appropriately manage what is really the Australian people's money. It is disappointing that not all in this place have the same respect for taxpayers' money, including funds that come from my own electorate of Dunkley. We have introduced a number of budget repair measures totalling over $41 billion. So my first question to the minister is: can the minister advise the chamber on the progress of the government's budget repair measures through the parliament? How much progress has the government made in passing unlegislated budget repair measures since the 2016 PFO?


Australians expect us to live within our means, and we have not done this in a long time. The past few years have been spent working towards getting the budget and the underlying cash deficit back on track. We're approaching the end of the financial year, and it is widely expected that the underlying cash deficit will have been lowered to $18.2 billion. This is a huge figure; however, this is expected to be the best budget outcome since the Howard government's last budget a decade ago. The size of government debt is not to be underestimated or dismissed; however, my constituents and I are delighted that progress is being made. My second question to the minister is: what is the estimated impact of measures that the government has implemented since the 2013 election, and can the minister please speak to some of the key measures that have contributed to this figure?


We cannot continue to borrow money to fund services that should be funded by the government as a matter of routine. That is why we are delivering a surplus in 2019-20, the first since we came to government in 2013—over a six-year period we have worked to undo six years of Labor—and the first since the last year of the Howard government in 2007, just before Labor came into government and brought the difficult financial circumstances they left for us in 2013. Compare our results to those opposite. I was five years old when Labor last delivered a surplus in government. The Berlin Wall was still standing. It was a difficult situation at the time around the world, but it was even more difficult being led by Labor, who have not delivered a surplus since that time.


It is our job to ensure that essential services like health and education can be funded through strong economic management and not by using borrowed money, so we can reduce our deficit to bring us back into a surplus and, therefore, reduce our debt. That means we're reducing our interest payments, and we will have more to spend on health and education. We cannot continue to borrow money forever. This is why it is crucial that we make sure that our spending is sustainable. This is exactly what the government's approach towards funding services has been. We have now reached the point where we no longer have to borrow to pay for routine government expenses, which was a situation Labor brought us to after the 2007 election, when you continued to put us into deficit, therefore increasing debt and therefore increasing the interest on our credit card payments.


In contrast, we have responsible economic management. That, unfortunately, is not something that could be guaranteed if those opposite were again in government. The strong economic management of the Howard era was torn to shreds by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Had their spending not been reined in, Australia would have been at risk of losing its AAA credit rating from the major ratings agencies. The Treasurer, the assistant minister, the Minister for Finance and our government, led by the Prime Minister, have been responsible in managing the economy to ensure that we continue to retain that AAA credit rating. Even now, those opposite will try to write off the coalition government's successes since 2013, promising bigger, better tax cuts while pledging funding increases for every potential recipient that they can think of.


Minister, I am concerned that the only foreseeable way that Labor could do so would be to plunge us back into further debt, undoing all the hard work of the coalition and recklessly putting us back into a vulnerable position should we find ourselves facing the global difficulties of just over a decade ago. Considering what I have said, could the minister please also tell us more about the budget repair measures presented by the coalition and how these will get Australia back on track? Finally, can the minister outline the government's fiscal strategy and how the government is planning to achieve a sustainable budget position over the medium term?

 (Rankin) (16:51):  It's hard to imagine a less intelligent, less informed contribution to this otherwise important conversation about the budget. You can come in here with your opinions. You can't just make it up as you go along. The only reason we have a AAA credit rating from all three agencies is that it was won, for the first time, under the same government that the previous speaker was criticising. Can someone please, before he speaks, check his notes for him or write some notes for him? That was embarrassing. We have three AAAs because they were won under the government that he was criticising. Surely you can at least check a fact as basic as that. Or maybe, before you talk about interest repayments, check the fact that they are higher now than under any other government. If you want to talk about debt, maybe at least be a little bit ashamed of the fact that net debt has doubled and that gross debt is over half a trillion dollars, and both measures have accumulated faster under this government than under the Labor predecessor. It is so tempting to go through all of the ways that that was really just an appalling, fact-free contribution to what should be a conversation based on facts—really quite disappointing, unbelievable.


I will move on to other matters, given the lateness of the hour. One of the noticeable features of changes in government spending in the last little while has been the quite extraordinary increase in spending on contractors. If you go to the government's AusTender website, you can run a whole bunch of searches to show that, since the government changed hands in 2013, a lot of the categories have just exploded in terms of spending—billions and billions of dollars in extra spending on a lot of things that used to be done by the Public Service. The reason that we have that is that an arbitrary cap has been placed on public servants, in this town and right around Australia. Federal public servants have had an arbitrary cap imposed. That says to agencies: 'If you want to get this work done, you need to get it done externally.' There will always be a role for external expert advice, but we shouldn't be wasting billions of dollars in marked-up work—labour hire, contractors, consultants—when that work could and should be done by the Public Service. I think one of the things that sticks in the public's craw is that they get lectured all the time—'We couldn't possibly find that money for the pensioner energy supplement; we couldn't find that $270 million for TAFE'—but we can spend billions and billions more every year on contractors and consultants in the Public Service because there is an ideological commitment to a Public Service cap.


So what's happening in Australia on the government's side is that we're paying more and more for poorer outcomes. We're paying more than we were before, and we're getting inferior outcomes. That's because those opposite cling to this ideological Public Service cap, which is not actually delivering the policy outcome that they want. The purpose of the Public Service cap was to keep down costs in the Public Service. Instead we have costs blowing out madly. Anyone who spends even 10 minutes on the AusTender site can see the quite remarkable multiples of growth in certain categories, particularly of management services in the Public Service. Agencies need to get the work done but they've got the cap, so they have to go outside. So we're seeing all of this public money wasted on what is an IPA ideological frolic, which is the cap on the APS headcount.


This was put to the finance minister, Senator Cormann. Over the summer there were a number of well-informed stories in our broadsheet press, which had done what the public expects it to do, which is to examine the spending by the government on contractors and consultants, and uncover this extraordinary blowout that the government would rather Australians didn't know about. The government's response, quite remarkably, was to say you can't rely on those figures. They're the government's figures on the AusTender site. What we need, very clearly, is more transparency and more accuracy. If those numbers are wrong then other numbers need to be provided, because this scandalous waste of billions, if not tens of billions, of dollars to satisfy this ideological obsession is a matter of public interest. My question to the minister is: why have you made it not transparent enough for the Australian people to understand just how much money you're wasting on consultants and contractors?

Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks—Assistant Minister for Finance) (16:56):  I thank the member for Dunkley, in particular, for his very strong contribution to this debate. He again hits on the important point about restraining government spending. It's a very important contrast with those opposite. I will talk to the member's question about some specific savings measures that have been passed through the parliament in recent times, but we also need to understand the alternative.


One way of improving the budget position is to make savings. That is the better way. That is the preferable way. Those opposite are all about tax increases. They propose more than $200 billion of tax increases. The member for Rankin wanted to talk about older Australians in his contribution. He and his colleagues are proposing to smash older Australians with a massive retiree tax that will devastate hundreds of thousands of older Australians. Those opposite also want to smash the housing market by abolishing negative gearing for all except new homes. In an environment where the housing markets around Australia are already under pressure, that is going to lead to tremendous problems, and it's going to hit the most important asset of the vast majority of Australian households, their home. It is an appalling policy. They also want to put up capital gains tax by 50 per cent on everything, not just on housing and not just on investment property. They voted against tax relief for any business that has a turnover of just $2 million, which is a very, very small business. Those opposite said, 'No, this is some sort of big business, and it is not entitled to any form of relief.'


Those are bad policies. They are in contrast to the priorities of this government and of the member for Dunkley. He knows that getting the budget back on track is about sensible budget repair. He knows that since MYEFO we've implemented and delivered savings worth some $4.6 billion. We are doing the hard work of actually passing budget repair measures. Since the 2017-18 budget there has been some $16 billion worth of budget repair measures. Since the 2016 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the value of budget repair measures implemented by this government has been some $41 billion. That is a massive improvement in the fiscal position of this nation, and that is why in this financial year we turn the corner on net debt and begin paying down that legacy of debt, with some $30 billion of net debt reduction expected over the forward estimates. That is being driven by the strong results of this government.


I note that the member for Rankin has left us, but I do want to address a number of his comments. In relation to the forecast on wages and other matters, here are some comments. Saul Eslake says that the economic growth forecasts in the budget are reasonable and the commodity price assumptions are conservative. Stephen Koukoulas, not known as a raving fan of the government, says:


It is important to note, in this context, that the budget is framed on a series of realistic and reasonably conservative economic forecasts for economic growth, wages and company profits …


That is a very sensible contribution by Mr Koukoulas. This sort of assertion from those opposite is just wrong. We note that in an environment where we are constraining government spending growth to just 1.9 per cent in real terms, that means that public-sector spending is under control. That is the right thing for this nation.


Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (17:46):  Australia continues to refuse to sign the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, even though over 50 nations have signed so far and close to 100 more are expected to. Australia, along with the US, has even tried to derail the treaty's progress. This is an historic treaty—one that's being led by countries without nuclear weapons and that bans the production, stockpiling, testing, possession, hosting, use and threat of such weapons. It recognises that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences for our planet. 


When we see the posturing by the leaders of the US and North Korea in recent months, it's easy to see why so many Australians care about this. That's why I was proud to sign the ICAN Parliamentary Pledge, which is a commitment of parliamentarians around the world to support the treaty and urge their governments to sign up. 


Australia needs a more independent foreign and security policy and shouldn't keep blindly following the US. If we were more independent, we'd realise that this treaty is essential, because nuclear weapons, regardless of whose hands they're in, are a threat to everyone. The government must listen to the community and sign up to this treaty, because a complete abolition of nuclear weapons is the only option for us.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (18:33):  I move:


That this House:


(1) acknowledges that for nearly two decades a 10 per cent GST has been applied to women's sanitary products;


(2) notes that:


(a) this is an unfair and discriminatory tax on women;


(b) tampons and pads are not luxury items but rather essential items;


(c) Australian women are fed up with paying extra for items that they need to live and work;


(d) Labor has announced a concrete plan to scrap the GST on sanitary products; and


(e) Labor's plan:


   (i) would restore equity but also save a woman up to $1,000 over her lifetime; and


   (ii) has already attracted the support of a number of state and territories, putting progress within reach; and


(3) calls on the Government to:


(a) immediately adopt Labor's plan to abolish the tax on women's sanitary products; and


(b) work with the states and territories to end this tax once and for all.


A tax on tampons and sanitary products is a tax on women, plain and simple. The tampon tax costs Australian women around $30 million a year, with individual women forced to pay $1,000 over their lifetime. As time has passed, this tax has become more and more conspicuous for its hypocrisy and blatant discrimination. It's a relic from another era that simply doesn't belong in today's world.


I'm very pleased to be bringing this motion before the House this evening on the very same day that our colleagues in the Senate agreed to axe this unfair and discriminatory impost on women. But it's appalling and embarrassing that the Turnbull government is doubling down on its commitment to this preposterous throwback policy. At the very same time that Mr Turnbull is running a relentless crusade to hand back billions of dollars to big business, multinationals and the banks, he's pushing back on removing this ridiculous tax on Australian women. Let's be clear, tampons are not a luxury. They are a necessity, just like other GST-exempt health and hygiene products such as sunscreen or incontinence pads. Anyone who tells you otherwise has clearly never menstruated.


This issue is one that shows how deeply removed this government is from the modern world—how absolutely and utterly out of touch so many of its members are with basic community standards of fairness and equality. They're going in to bat against the GST on superyachts, but won't lift a finger to remove the tax on women. They think it's fine for a tax to be levied on tampons, but not Viagra. Devoid of any sort of sensible argument, to protect the tax the government has reverted to childish name calling, with the Treasurer declaring that calls to remove the tampon tax are 'silly'. 


On this side of the House, we see things very differently. I think it's very fitting to note tonight that there is not a single government member who is prepared to rise and speak on this motion. I do want to pay special tribute to the member for Ballarat, who will be speaking later, for her lifelong commitment to ensuring that this tax on tampons and sanitary products is removed. We on this side of the House have a concrete plan to axe this unfair tax. We'll work with the states and territories to scrap it urgently upon coming to office. Any financial impact will be offset by adding GST to 12 therapies which the Chief Medical Officer has said have no scientific basis or any evidence based proof of efficacy. People will of course still be able to access these services, but they will have to pay GST on them. It's a fully funded plan that we have: it won't hurt the states, and it has already secured the support of the premiers of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia and the chief ministers of the ACT and the Northern Territory. The Turnbull government has no excuse not to act. 


Of course, from the outside, it's all blindingly obvious that the tax needs to go, but it illustrates a much deeper and more impactful problem: what happens when you develop policy that affects women without having women at the table? One thing is for certain: if women had had a deciding say when the final details of the GST inclusions and exclusions were being nutted out by the Howard government, this tampon tax would not have made it out of the starting gate. But back in 1999 these laws were drafted by a largely male cohort of public servants, reporting to a largely male cabinet in an overwhelming male parliament. Is it any wonder that this is what they came up with? The reality is that until we have equal representation of women in this place and the other place, until women have equal access to the policy development table, until Australian women have equal representation in cabinet, this parliament will continue to develop policy that disadvantages women. 


Labor has a plan to fix the tampon tax. It's fully costed and it's a no-brainer. More importantly, Labor has a plan to make sure this sort of discriminatory policy never sees the light of day again—at least, not under a Labor government. We'll restore the women's budget statement so we know what the gender impacts of budget decisions are. We'll subject every single piece of legislation to a gender analysis to identify any potentially adverse gender impacts. With 48 per cent of our federal representatives now being women, we'll have the right people at the table to make the right decisions for Australian women. It's time for the government to follow suit on axing the tampon tax and bringing these important initiatives forward.

Ms TEMPLEMAN
 (Macquarie) (18:38):  I second the motion. I'm very pleased to support this motion. There are significant financial and social obstacles that still face women in Australia. In our society too often women are treated with disdain and complete disregard. The statistics of rape, domestic violence and sexual abuse point to just that. The death of 22-year-old Eurydice Dixon in Melbourne is a tragic reminder of just how quickly women's lives can be taken. It was because she chose to walk home, which should be a right, not a death sentence. Thirty-eight per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 24 report that they have been sexually harassed in the past year, according to the Bureau of Statistics. Our economy and tax system too often treat women with total disdain and disregard. Women retire with 53 per cent of the superannuation that men do. Women earn about 17 per cent less than men do. That data is one of the reasons why women are more likely than men to experience poverty and homelessness. 


This government has done little to improve the lot of women. Since being in government, the Liberals have tried to cut paid parental leave, calling working mums rorters and double dippers. Their childcare policy creates losers at either end of the financial spectrum. They've cut penalty rates and cut community legal centres, all of which disproportionately impacts women. They've cut almost $2 billion worth of pay rises and support for workers in feminised industries such as early childhood education and disability care. They failed to reinstate the women's budget impact statement, which was canned by self-proclaimed feminist and former Minister for Women Tony Abbott. And now we have them unwilling to budge on the simplest of measures to bring a modicum of equity to every menstruating woman.


Women are now in the unenviable position of having to rely on the benevolence of a Liberal government still, unsurprisingly, predominantly filled with men to change the rules. Really, I should say 'increasingly' filled by men, as they allow men to push women out of held positions. We rely on these men to decide whether our pads and our tampons are necessary items or not. A classification of 'necessary' is already bestowed upon condoms and things like Viagra. Only a bunch of blokes would let it get to this point. You really have to wonder what their definition of 'necessary' is if it doesn't apply to tampons or pads.


I'd like to remind everyone in the room that we have to buy these items every month for as long as we have our periods. Menstruation is not a choice. It's part of a woman's reproductive health. While there is a policy in place that deems Viagra more necessary than pads and tampons, the message being sent to women and men is that man's ability to have sex is more important than a women's access to basic hygiene.


To those who believe that removing the tax is tokenistic and won't make a real economic difference to the lives of women, I want to share with you what I was told recently by a young woman who had to count every penny while she was at university. She told me that she and a group of friends worked out that it was slightly cheaper to go on the pill and skip periods as often as they could than buying sanitary items on a monthly basis. This is the sort of calculation that young women trying to make ends meet have done. So, on economic grounds, for women who are students, who are among the working poor, who are unemployed, who are homeless, who are carers—for any woman who is doing it tough financially—the cost can be a factor in the decisions they make about their reproductive health. 


I say to all the gentlemen in the room, and I note that there are but a few on the other side: these things aren't cheap; they definitely aren't a choice; and the women of Australia would be better served by you as their representatives if you were to stand aside for once, stop the garbage arguments, axe the tax and let us get on with it—and support this motion. 


Those opposite should not continue to treat this matter with disdain and disregard. These are important issues not just to women but to people who care about women. This government, despite the lack of women in its cabinet and even in the house at large, has an opportunity to take one simple step in the right direction for women. We say, 'Take the glory—we don't care. Just do it: axe the tax.'

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (18:43):  I too rise to support the member for Newcastle's motion to axe the tampon tax, and I join the member for Macquarie in doing so. I do think it's absolutely extraordinary that not a single government member has been prepared to speak on this motion at all. Either they're for it or they're not. Clearly, they're not, or they're too embarrassed by their complete lack of action to have the courage of their convictions and get up and talk on this motion. It is extraordinary, frankly. 


This tax, this tampon tax, is the perfect example of what happens when you have a political process that is overwhelmingly dominated by men. The GST was designed by men in the senior ranks of the Public Service, approved by the Howard government cabinet that boasted just one woman and, in 1999, ultimately passed by a parliament that was made up of 169 men and 55 women. 


Nearly 20 years later, we are doing little better. We've still never had a female head of Treasury, but there are five women in cabinet now—a long way short of equal, but an improvement nonetheless. In Labor's shadow cabinet, we have seven women. We have a parliament that is now one-third women, thanks in no small part to the work done by the Australian Labor Party. We have quotas to ensure we preselect women in winnable seats, and those quotas are working. Labor is inching even closer to a true fifty-fifty equal representation of men and women. Right now, it's at 46.7 per cent. 


If the other side of politics took gender equity as seriously as we do, we'd be much closer to equal representation in this place. Sadly, there is no sign that the conservatives really care about gender equity at all, with only 23 per cent of Liberal MPs being women. That's actually down from 25 per cent when the GST passed. If you add in the National Party, the coalition's overall number drops to 21 per cent women. Not only do the Liberals stubbornly refuse to introduce even modest gender quotas so that talented women can overcome the structural barriers that keep them out, they're now busy tearing down the women who are already here. Is it any wonder that they don't have any plan to get rid of the tampon tax?


Labor's come a long way since the 1990s on gender equity. The coalition, by any measure, has gone absolutely backwards. Be in no doubt that this tax is discriminatory. It is unfair, and it is a tax on women. Women's sanitary items are essential health products. They are not a luxury item. It is quite simply unfair that women should have to pay extra for such items, while reproductive products for men, from condoms to Viagra, don't attract the GST. It's time to axe this tax once and for all, and that's exactly what a Labor government will do. Getting rid of the tampon tax would save the average Australian woman $1,000 over her lifetime. 


In an age where the gender pay gap remains stubbornly wide, it's only fair that we find ways to give women some cost-of-living relief. That's not just about the hip pocket. It's about sending a message to Australian women that the tampon tax is wrong as a matter of principle. It is not that this is just a pie in the sky opposition promise—we have come up with an alternative means of funding for the states and territories to replace the revenue lost by GST, and it is a fully costed proposal. Whilst there's been talk, in fact, even on the government side, with former Treasurer Hockey saying they were going to axe this tax, and there have been proposals before, part of the difficulty is finding a GST offset that all of the states and territories can agree on. 


We've done that by consistently applying the GST to a range of natural therapies that are not supported by clinical evidence. We will collect enough revenue to cover the cost of scrapping the tampon tax. It's a sensible solution, consistent with the government's own policies when it comes to the rebate on private health insurance. Most of the states are already onboard, and I note the three that are not are all Liberal states and I encourage the Prime Minister to act on that. If we're lucky enough to form government at the next election, I am confident that we will be able to get unanimous support for this proposal. 


This morning, we saw the Senate vote in favour of scrapping this tax. There is no excuse. This tax absolutely has to go, and yet the Turnbull government is doing nothing constructive about this. Their only response is to try and pass the buck to the states or say that the proposals we put forward are silly. The Liberals could have adopted our policy in the May budget. They didn't. They could adopt it today. They have shown absolutely no interest in axing this tax at all. That's what you get from a government that does not take gender equality, or, indeed, basic fairness seriously at all.
