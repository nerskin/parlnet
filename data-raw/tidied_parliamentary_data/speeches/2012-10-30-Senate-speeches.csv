Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:31):  In continuation, at the time we adjourned last night I was talking about the importance of the NGO sector and the fact that we need legislation to protect the independence of the not-for-profit sector, both for the right of an organisation to exist and to ensure that government does not use its position, often of sole-funder status, to stop not-for-profit advocacy. If you remember—I am sure everybody does—I was talking about the important role of NGOs in advocacy and their leadership in policy development.


Government is often the sole provider of funds for many of the social, cultural and environmental services that not-for-profits provide. Government, therefore, is clearly in a powerful position compared to the not-for-profit sector and service providers when they are negotiating. The threat of loss of DGR status or a grant is a very powerful one because it means that not-for-profit organisations are unable to carry out their functions effectively and to the full extent possible. Given that not-for-profits and charities are dependent on these funds for their survival, it is very important that we ensure that there is guaranteed independence for these organisations.


It is fair to say that, in the past, governments have taken advantage of this power to try to silence the not-for-profit sector into silent dissent. We saw in the past, during the Howard era, gag clauses imposed on not-for-profit organisations. The present government, to its credit, removed most of those onerous aspects of such clauses. However, we are seeing a return to this approach with gag clauses. During the Senate committee's inquiry we heard about gag clauses being imposed on the not-for-profit sector by the Queensland government. In other words, they are going back to the bad old days when they expect not-for-profit organisations to sit there, be quiet, provide services but not advocate for their clients, both individually and-or for systemic change.


Even with government grants, it can be rather oblique when governments say to organisations, 'You need to run your media comments past us before you release them.' Again, that limits the independence of not-for-profits. We need to ensure, therefore, that the independence of the not-for-profit organisations is protected.


For all these reasons, it is absolutely critical that the individual components of this bill reflect the commitment to an independent vibrant sector. We felt it was very important that this was outlined in the objectives of this particular legislation. However, although it was included in the objectives, there were some components of the bill that did not properly support this outcome without amendments. That is why we are particularly pleased that the government has amended this bill to include the process of articulating upfront that governance standards cannot impinge on the independence nor the advocacy role of not-for-profit organisations. We are also pleased that the government has announced the process of bringing in a separate piece of legislation that means gag clauses cannot be imposed.


This bill allows for governance standards to be established by regulation. I recognise that this has come about because of the difficulties and the time frame both the sector and the government encountered in attempting to draft these standards. This is particularly because we have such a diverse range of strong and vibrant charities and not-for-profit organisations in this country that do totally different things. It is very hard to come up with a set of governance standards that covers all of them, therefore more time was needed.


Given that the governance standards trigger very significant powers for the commissioner and can lead to a charity having its registration revoked, we simply cannot leave these standards to the manner by which the government proposed the regulations would operate. We need to increase the safeguards to ensure that they  have better certainty in place and cannot be easily revised to the detriment of the sector in the future. These issues were raised in the committee's inquiry and I am pleased that the government will move amendments that deal with them.


The Australian Greens recommended that the governance standards should be only a minimum standard of contact and be principle based, specifying the outcome to be achieved rather than detailing an entity would meet the standards. We also recommended clarifying and limiting some of the currently unfettered powers of enforcement that had been provided to the commissioner—such as the 'more likely than not' clause which gives the commissioner the power to act pre-emptively to prevent a breach of the standards.


Similarly, section 15-10 of the ACNC bill outlines matters that the commissioner must have regard to when exercising powers and functions, which includes the maintenance, protection and enhancement of public trust and confidence in the not-for-profit sector. We were concerned that, as they stood, these provisions gave the commissioner too much power to take pre-emptive enforcement action when an organisation had not as yet breached the conduct standards and could be used to look beyond specific breaches of legal liability and responsibility towards subjective judgements about how the not-for-profit sector should operate. 


All of these recommendations reflect the comments that were provided by the charities and not-for-profit sector, who submitted evidence to the committee process. The amendments that have been circulated have finally resolved the biggest problems associated with these bills—that is, the governance standards. I hope that with these amendments we will get a more satisfactory process around the commission. Many organisations participated in this process looking at this legislation and I thank them very much, because the not-for-profit sector are often so busy delivering their vital community services that they have little time to participate in these sorts of overarching discussions.


Currently, the not-for-profits have to report across a number of government departments as well as state and territory regulations, depending on the size of the organisation. Issues around red tape are absolutely critical for the sector and they came up extensively during the committee process. As it stood, we thought the process did not articulate enough how the government intended to deal with issues around red tape. This matter came up repeatedly and there was much criticism that this bill could drive more red tape. That is why the government has also circulated some amendments to deal with issues of red tape. One of these is that the commissioner will be required to report to parliament specifically against red tape reduction. Also, the charity passport will be developed, and I think that will also assist.


It is very important that we have the commissioner driving the process of red tape reduction. If the commissioner does not have that specific mandate, I am concerned that red tape reduction will fall off the agenda and that there will be no-one driving specific government departments to work across and within government departments. I think we have made some significant progress there. This brings me to the point about the commission and the commission's role in consultation on governance standards. That is another particularly important amendment that has been circulated: that the commissioner will be involved intimately in the consultation process to set up the governance standards.


In conclusion, these amendments that have been circulated by the government include some extensive amendments, but they also reflect the outcomes of the committee consultation process. The Greens will be supporting these bills, although in the Committee of the Whole I will be asking the government some particular points around mechanisms and the way the legislation will operate. We will be supporting this legislation with these amendments.

Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (12:40):  I am very pleased to see us debating the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and related bill at last. From my perspective, they breathe life into the reforms that have been so long in coming for Australia's not-for-profit sector. The government's commitment to establish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, the ACNC, also reflects the sector's advocacy for the establishment of an independent, one-stop shop, specialist regulator. This regulator will provide the framework to support the vital contribution that not-for-profit organisations make to Australia's civil society. Rather than reflect any lack of trust in the sector, as the Senator Cormann said last night, in fact the ACNC supports public and government trust and confidence in the sector, which in turn helps charities and not-for-profits achieve their mission. 


The government, working with the sector, is delivering an ambitious not-for-profit reform agenda. This reflects two very exciting though challenging phenomena: the impressive growth of and the wide-ranging changes taking place in the sector in Australia today. Australia's not-for-profit sector comprises around 600,000 entities. About 400,000 of those have access to Commonwealth tax concessions and about 56,000 of them are endorsed as charities. The sector contributes about four per cent of Australia's GDP and it is growing rapidly, with one million Australians employed in the sector and about five million volunteers involved. The sector turns over about $100 billion every year and has a 10-year annual growth rate of about five per cent a year—that is second only to the mining sector in Australia. The sector is at the heart of our education, our health, our arts, our culture, our sport, our environment and our welfare services. 


Thanks to much hard work for a decade, during which I have been proud to be a strong advocate, the sector is finding its voice. It has grown its voice and its presence in Australian society because it has taken on many new responsibilities in areas of service coordination and delivery, and it has contributed to good policy development, shaping Australia's future. This is a good thing because a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative not-for-profit sector is vital in every modern democracy, and Australia is no different. I say 'robust' and 'independent' because, as Senator Siewert reminded us, who will ever forget the insidious, creeping, gagging clauses of the previous coalition government's contracts and funding agreements and the overt threat to cancel contracts, and the cuts to funding for organisations deemed to be advocating for policy change and not compliant with the government's agenda. 


After a decade of hollowing out capacity and stifling innovation, it was a privilege for me to lead the work which led to the national compact with the sector. It was signed in 2010 and gave life to a new, robust and respectful relationship with the sector. So much work, so much time and so much commitment have gone into the development of this reform agenda, which includes the establishment of the ACNC, whose purpose is to deliver smarter and more effective regulation of the not-for-profit sector. The ACNC is future focused, its structural reform recommended by six reviews, including the comprehensive Report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations conducted under the previous coalition government and, of course, the 2010 Productivity Commission report.


Under the current arrangements, the Australian Taxation Office has the dual and potentially conflicting duties of determining an entity's charitable status as well as having responsibility for enforcing the taxation law. It acts as gatekeeper and enforcer. At the Commonwealth level, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission also plays a role in terms of its oversight of companies limited by guarantee. But the not-for-profit sector does not want to be regulated by the ATO or ASIC. Organisations have made it clear over the years, time and time again, that they want an independent regulator, one that understands the sector, one that understands not-for-profit organisations. The ACNC will be that independent and dedicated regulator, enabling the sector to consolidate its standing in the community through improved transparency and accountability.


The not-for-profit sector has the confidence of Australian society, but the opposition, in opposing this bill, say that the current arrangements are just fine. Last night Senator Cormann said that the ACNC is a solution in search of a problem. That is patently unfair and it is absolutely untrue. The not-for-profit sector is burdened by the complicated and duplicated regulatory obligations that are imposed on the sector. I have to say that the coalition are great champions of business, campaigning for harmonising regulation and reducing red tape for businesses—for the finance industry, for mining, for agriculture—but not the not-for-profit sector, which is larger than all of these except, as I said, mining. They believe the sector should be in the service of government. We believe the sector should be serving the Australian people, especially those who have little voice or representation.


Senator Siewert outlined the detailed history of the bills in the amendments before the Senate, and we will get a chance to debate them. Those amendments include providing additional parliamentary scrutiny of governance and external conduct standards to be made under the ACNC legislation and to codify the process for public consultation in the development of the standards. The objects of the bill are to cut red tape and reduce the regulatory burden, not to impose greater stresses on the sector. The ACNC will administer a 'charities passport' and work to implement a 'report-once, use-often' reporting framework. This charity passport is the data that charities will report to meet the baseline corporate and financial reporting requirements of Australian government agencies. This will be supported by changes to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines which will benefit the organisations that register with the ACNC.


The changes build on the introduction of the standard chart of accounts framework—another great piece of the government's not-for-profit reform agenda. Information will be in one place and, if an entity provides an annual audited financial statement to the ACNC, then a grant acquittal should not generally be required. It is light touch regulation commensurate with the risk involved in the funding agreement. The ACNC will report to the parliament and the sector by developing and publishing a red-tape reduction timeline and plan and reporting against that timeline. The ACNC taskforce is already hard at work, implementing these arrangements until the ACNC itself is established. An example of that is the work that is currently going on between AusAID, ACFID and the government, with AusAID staff working with the ACNC taskforce to improve the process of NGO accreditation and entry into the AusAID-NGO Cooperation Program, reducing the reporting burden on ACNC registered charities and increasing the focus of AusAID assessments on the effectiveness of Australian aid funds.


AusAID and the ACNC will also work together to educate and support overseas aid charities to understand their obligations. This partnership with the sector will free up significant resources for frontline services and is a great example of what the ACNC will be able to deliver. The ACNC will provide a platform for delivering a national approach to not-for-profit regulation. With no national regulator, there is no opportunity for that to happen—and that is why a harmonised, national approach to regulation has not been achieved to date.


Senator Cormann would like us to believe that the sector does not support this legislation. This is simply not true. Last night, he deliberately misquoted out of context evidence from UnitingCare Australia. The first quote addressed a proposed definition of 'basic religious charity'. At the time, the definition excluded religious charities that received government grants. UnitingCare Australia argued that receipt of a government grant should not be a trigger for additional reporting, an argument accepted by government. The second quote was actually preceded by this statement: 'The church is supportive of one-stop reporting and a regulation concept.' I warn coalition senators: every time that you misquote or misrepresent the views of people like Reverend Tim Costello, Patrick McClure, Martin Laverty, Anne Robinson, Father Brian Lucas, David Crosbie, Lin Hatfield Dodds, Ken Henry, Professor Myles McGregor-Lowndes and Productivity Commissioner Robert Fitzgerald, you are traducing the intellect and reputation of prominent Australians who have contributed to shaping this agenda over the past decade. It is you who are undermining trust and confidence in the sector.


Let me reiterate: this reform has been led by the sector itself. ACOSS, Volunteering Australia, Mission Australia, Anglicare, World Vision, UnitingCare, Catholic Social Services and Philanthropy Australia are some of the many not-for-profit charities and organisations that have helped shape the bill and support it publically and consistently. ACOSS said just recently:


The creation of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission is the culmination of a long process and has broad support from the community and social services sector.


Chartered Secretaries Australia, in the Financial Review, contributed this view:


If we really want to support the NFP sector, the best way is to establish the ACNC, fulfilling the promise of all those inquiries and the desires of NFPs.


The Community Council for Australia said it:


… strongly supports the ACNC Bills on the basis that they provide for the establishment of an independent and responsive regulator for the charities and not-for-profit sector.


And Philanthropy Australia are supporting 'the principles of the ACNC being an independent regulator to deliver smarter regulation, reduce red tape and improve transparency and accountability within the sector'.


Last night Senator Cormann outlined the opposition's position, and I wondered, as I listened to him, whether he is not aware of or whether he is completely uninterested in the fact that the 2008 Senate inquiry brought down a unanimous report, the first recommendation of which was the introduction of an independent regulator.


So what has changed? I certainly hope Senator Mason's view has not changed. He was adamant when he spoke here in 2006, saying:


I have little doubt that the vast majority of organisations are doing the right thing and are doing great work. The problem is that we cannot sort out the many good not-for-profit groups from the handful of bad ones or those who are underperforming. It is my belief that this threatens the donor-charity trust relationship within the sector at large.


It is here that government needs to step in and provide clarity where confusion prevails. After all, the government does have a legitimate interest in the not-for-profit sector, as the sector is the beneficiary of a raft of taxpayer funded subsidies handed out by government.


…   …   …


Charities have a good reputation but trust can very easily be lost. It is vitally important that the sector makes itself more efficient and transparent, lest the sector experiences a decline in trust. There is a role here for government to step in and promote high standards within the sector and to establish a clear, transparent regulatory regime that will allow Australian charities to thrive in the 21st century.


Now we hear that the coalition not only is opposing the ACNC legislation but also will repeal the legislation and abolish the ACNC at the first opportunity.


The establishment of the ACNC is structural reform. It is about designing a regulatory framework which is suited to the not-for-profit sector and which addresses flaws in the current approach to not-for-profit regulation. The coalition's alternative charities commission is nothing more than an information and advice body, but that is not the key challenge confronting the sector in Australia. The key challenge is the need to address the deficiencies which currently exist when it comes to not-for-profit regulation—namely, the fragmented, inconsistent and uncoordinated approach to regulation of the sector.


If the coalition had their way there would be no ACNC and no regulatory reform. We would be back to the bad old days of gag clauses to silence dissent, as Senator Siewert said. We have already seen this occurring in Queensland. The National Compact would disappear. The work that has been done to develop a respectful relationship would be discounted and would disappear. Fundraising legislation would continue to be a nightmare for charities trying to raise money across borders or online. Volunteers would be subject to nonsensical cross-border rules that currently exist and which are part of the not-for-profit reform agenda negotiations. The sector would continue to be underpaid, underresourced and undervalued.


These bills before us today are about getting the balance right—promoting transparency and good governance while reducing red tape and supporting the capacity of the sector organisations. I congratulate the sector for its leadership and its persistence over more than a decade, and the Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury for his attention to this important agenda. He is someone with experience and connection with the sector who understands the importance of these reforms and who has championed them in cabinet. Senator Siewert made some important points about the role of the commissioner.


I commend to everyone the work of the interim commissioner, Susan Pascoe, who has done an amazing job in driving these reforms and in dealing with the consultation that has been part of the development of these bills. Starting with the original 2001 charities bill, the draft of which was rejected so soundly under the previous government, she has brought the sector and government to the place that we are today. It has been an amazing effort and she is to be commended for her leadership of her team and for the work she has done with the ACNC task force. All of this is a big-picture vision. It is about not-for-profit reform. It is about positioning our organisations for Australia in the future.


We need to come to a definition of charity. We are still working with the Queen Elizabeth statute common law provisions. We need to consider how all of this plays out in terms of workforce planning. We know the demands that are being placed on the sector. We know the challenges. We know where the compact is taking us, and the codes of conduct and of consultation that are being developed there. We know how much work is being done to understand the sector through funding the work of organisations like the Centre for Social Impact, another big commitment from this government to understand the sector and provide some intellectual framework around it. We know the work that has been invested in the Social Investment Fund, and the kinds of models that are being developed for enterprise opportunities. We know the work that is being done by organisations on capacity building for the sector.


All of those things were in a hiatus for a decade, and all of those things now need to be invested in and supported. They come quite clearly out of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report, which outlined, quite succinctly and quite transparently, the agenda of five key pillars for this sector that are going to sustain them into the future. It is a seminal piece of work, and I recommend that it be on everyone's bookshelf. If you really need to understand what is going on in the sector that is a really good place to start.


I place on the record my thanks to Senator Claire Moore and Senator Siewert for their work in bringing this latest round of amendments to the Senate. It reflects good consultation and the way committees work best in this place. It is about improving legislation that is in the national interest. It puts party politics out of reach and that allows people to honour the commitment we have made to the sector through the national compact that we would develop and support a thriving, robust, independent sector into the future. These things which are now part of the COAG reform agenda in health, in ageing, in community services are things that we need to invest in now for the long term. I am quite sure that these bills before the Senate today will be part of underpinning good policy and good practice to carry us through into the 21st century.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (13:00):  I also rise to speak on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012. As the title of the bill suggests, the bill seeks to establish a new statutory office, a Commonwealth-level regulator for the not-for-profit sector called the Australian charities and not-for-profits commission.


Let me be clear up front: the coalition does oppose this bill. We do so on the basis that despite the intent, the new regulator would hinder not help civil society. I want to acknowledge the previous contributor to this debate, Senator Stephens, who has a genuine interest in the not-for-profit sector and has had that interest for many years. But on this occasion I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that she has reached.


A robust civil society is a reflection of the sort of country that we are. It is built through people who choose to freely associate with organisations and causes that are important to them. Australia has a strong and diverse not-for-profit sector that thrives on community spirit and goodwill. We all know of local carer groups in the cities and towns we live in, the sporting clubs which as members of parliament we have associations with and we know that these networks, associations and clubs are sustained by people who volunteer their time and energy to causes that matter to them and to organisations that they see as important. 


It is the view of the coalition that the state should be at the service of civil society to make life easier for civil society. We on this side of the chamber start with the principle that the government should do no harm to the efforts and endeavours of the not-for-profit sector. Government should be a facilitator but it should not intrude upon the operation of the not-for-profit sector. The government's proposal enshrined in this bill for a new regulatory body is what you might call a typical Labor 'reform'. The intent is fine, worthy and noble, but the reality in the text of the legislation we think would lead to an altogether different outcome.


When the new regulator was proposed, the primary objective was to reduce administrative compliance and reporting duplication for the not-for-profit sector. The intent of that was to allow these organisations to direct more of their limited resources and time to their core business. We do not believe that the bill in its current form does justice to the original objective. One of the key aims of the legislation is supposedly to reduce red tape for the not-for-profit sector. We do not think that it will do that. Also unless the states and territories agree to hand over their powers to the Commonwealth and agree to harmonise their laws, these bills would add a layer of red tape which the sector would have to meet. Susan Pascoe, the head of the commission implementation task force, has stated that:


You are only going to achieve full red-tape reduction with the involvement of the states and territories. 


The states and territories to date have declined to hand over any of their powers with respect to charities and not-for-profits. In fact, they are highly critical of the proposed commission. The Commonwealth have not had a terrific track record, it must be said, of negotiating with the other jurisdictions. Instead they tend to try and seek to blame and scapegoat the states at every opportunity.


The proposed commission treats Australian not-for-profits as though they are not entirely to be trusted. The legislation has a range of powers to interfere with the internal workings of an organisation which has the potential to jeopardise the independence of civil society. The bill gives the commission the power to deregister an organisation if it is deemed to be conducting its affairs in a way that might cause harm or threaten the public trust or confidence in the not-for-profit sector. While that is a noble sentiment, it is a very strong power for a government to be able to deregister a not-for-profit. The phrase 'public trust and confidence' in the legislation is ambiguous and creates uncertainty as to the definition of that phrase. No doubt if this legislation is passed it would ultimately be the courts that would determine what the phrase means.


The bill provides the ACNC commissioner with a range of enforcement powers that go far beyond what is necessary. The commission would have the authority to issue warning notices, issue directions, enter into enforceable undertakings, apply to the courts for injunctions, suspend or remove responsible entities and appoint acting responsible entities.


These sorts of provisions are, I think, disproportionate for the potential risk that there is in the sector. We think that, when it comes to the not-for-profit sector, you should not be adopting not so much a risk minimisation policy but rather a risk management policy. Where the risk is low, government should have a light touch. We think that the powers proposed here are not commensurate with the level of risk and that they are excessive.


As I have said, the powers and penalties contained in the legislation are pretty heavy-handed. But also of concern is the commissioner's ability to remove the director of a not-for-profit. In his submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into the legislation, Mr David Gonski, of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, raised the issue that Australia may be the first country in the world to make being a director of a not-for-profit more onerous than being a director of a for-profit organisation.


In short, the legislation is a bad piece of legislation. What was supposed to create a one-stop shop for charities has created an environment that in effect undermines confidence in the not-for-profit sector. There is no agreement with the states to harmonise powers. There would be duplication of reporting requirements, and the onerous compliance obligations would have the potential to discourage community involvement and volunteers from being involved in local organisations. There are approximately 600,000 entities in Australia's not-for-profit sector. They are made up on people who give their time and their energy to many Australians who greatly need it.


The coalition have a different approach. We reject the legislation. We will not be supporting the creation of a heavy-handed regulatory body that would only add to red tape and compliance burdens for the not-for-profit sector. The government should seek to work with the sector rather than treating it as an arm of the state. I think that the level of intervention that this legislation seeks to give government the capacity exercise is a reflection of the Labor Party's philosophical approach. We should make sure that government is of service to Australia's civil society, that it should not hinder it. That is what the coalition will endeavour to achieve.


We oppose the legislation and, as my colleagues have indicated already, if we have the opportunity, we shall repeal it. As I said at the commencement of my remarks—and now that Senator Stephens is in the chamber I will repeat my remarks—I do respect Senator Stephens' interest in and contribution to the not-for-profit sector and the charitable sector over a long period of time. I listened to her contribution but, on this occasion, I respectfully have reached a different conclusion to her.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:10): I rise today to speak to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012. There have been many reviews of the not-for-profit sector over the past 17 years, including the 2001 Report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations, the 2009 review into Australia's future tax system and the 2010 Productivity Commission report, The contribution of the not-for-profit sector. Each of these reviews has recommended the establishment of a national regulator, which would simplify regulation for the not-for-profit sector, which is why the Gillard Labor government made it an election commitment to do exactly this.


As the not-for-profit sector grows, we must help it consolidate its standing in the community. The reform of the not-for-profit sector is ambitious, and the government has undertaken extensive consultation to ensure that these bills address the issues facing not-for-profit organisations. Through both a public consultation process—to which 47 written submissions were received—and a public hearing held in Canberra in September, organisations such as the Smith Family, the Salvation Army, World Vision, Mission Australia, the Fundraising Institute of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia, to name a few, have contributed their views on the proposed reform of the sector.


From the beginning, effective and close consultation with the not-for-profit sector has been of vital importance to the Gillard Labor government. Issues raised during the public consultation period and through the committee hearing have been considered and the bills revised to ensure that they deliver the most effective outcome in light of the feedback that has been received. The sector has made it clear they want an independent regulator which can focus entirely on their needs, which is what these bills in fact deliver.


Australia's not-for-profit sector is very much diverse. It is made up of charities, charitable trusts, churches, religious groups, sporting organisations and clubs, advocacy groups, community organisations, cooperatives, trade unions, trade and professional organisations, chambers of commerce, welfare organisations and service providers. It is incredibly diverse. The sector currently consists of some 600,000 organisations, of which nearly 60,000 are economically significant, in that they employ roughly eight per cent of the nation's total workforce—some 890,000 people—and they contribute $43 billion to the nation's gross domestic product. The remaining 440,000 organisations are small, unincorporated organisations which have been traditionally exempt from reporting obligations. They do not have an ABN, and cannot be endorsed as charities or receive deductible gift recipient status. They can, however, self-assess income tax exemptions.


The not-for-profit sector performs a valuable role in our society as it very much endeavours to provide services that meet the needs and betterment of the Australian community. It is for these reasons that the government provides assistance to such organisations, both directly through the funding of programs and services as well as through tax exemptions and concessions. In seeing the immense value of the sector, everyday Australians also lend their support by volunteering their time and through financial and in-kind donations. 


In the 2006-07 financial year, donations of more than $7.2 billion were made to the sector, and over 4.6 million Australians donated their valuable time. Increasingly, not-for-profits and their donors are influencing where community and government resources are directed. Regulation of the not-for-profit sector has traditionally fallen to the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO has been responsible for determining charitable status and for determining whether not-for-profit organisations are eligible for tax exemptions and concessions such as fringe benefits tax, deductible gift recipient status, refundable franking credits and goods and services tax concessions. This can potentially be seen as conflict of interest, as the ATO is ultimately responsible for revenue raising while also being charged with making decisions on whether not-for-profit organisations should be granted charitable status.


Regulation of not-for-profit organisations limited by guarantee has fallen to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Some not-for-profit organisations can also receive state or territory tax concessions or exemptions and therefore need to be registered with their own state or territory government. This means that, depending on their status and location, not-for-profit organisations have found themselves subject to a number of reporting requirements at both Commonwealth and state or territory level. Many of the reporting requirements have been designed with for-profit organisations in mind and are therefore unsuited to the not-for-profit sector, as they quickly become both time consuming and costly.


This is why the Gillard Labor government has committed to reforming the NFP sector. We want to ensure this sector is transparent and accountable while also ensuring that resources are directed to the most valuable outcomes rather than being swallowed up by excessive regulatory requirements. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 will: establish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission, charge the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission with registering not-for-profit entities and maintaining a register, provide powers for the commissioner in relation to the regulation of registered entities, establish a single national regulatory framework for not-for-profit entities, and set out the obligations and duties of registered entities.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission will be a one-stop-shop regulator for the not-for-profit sector—something that the not-for-profit sector have been asking for and have been wanting for some time, to clear out the hodgepodge nature in which not-for-profits have been able to become regulated and receive those levels of status and recognition that they deserve and should have access to in a timely fashion. I note Senator Fifield's earlier comments, and I also note the opposition's position to not vote for this bill. In doing so, the opposition is not supporting the not-for-profit sector, because this bill very much reflects what the not-for-profit sector have been calling for. I noticed that Senator Fifield talked about the fact of this regulatory environment and his opposition to the new regulatory environment which will be created through this new commission. But already we have South Australia agreeing to align its own regulatory environment with the new commission that is being created. I congratulate the South Australian government for having the foresight to do so and I hope that other states follow suit fairly soon. Again, that shows that states also want to have a simplified, one-stop-shop process to this issue of regulating the not-for-profit sector. Senator Fifield fails to understand—or at least omitted, in his contribution in the debate on this bill—the fact that South Australia is already agreeing to align its regulatory environment with the new commission. 


The new commission will act as an independent statutory agency, separate from the ATO. It comprises a commissioner, an advisory board and officers who are engaged under the Public Service Act 1999. The commission will report through the Treasurer to the parliament each year and will be held accountable for its work in delivering reductions in the regulatory burden. While registration is voluntary, it will be a prerequisite for those charities wishing to access certain Commonwealth tax concessions. The commissioner will be required to maintain the register and will be able to revoke the registration of those not-for-profits who, after being given written notice and the opportunity to contest, fail to meet the necessary conditions.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission provides a framework for record keeping and reporting, requiring all entities to keep records which correctly record and explain the financial position and performance of each entity. In order to gain and maintain registration, not-for-profit organisations will be required to meet governance and external conduct standards set out in the regulations, keep financial and written records and, in the case of small not-for-profit organisations, provide information statements. In the case of large and medium organisations, they will be required to provide financial reports, audits or review reports, and of course they must notify the commissioner of relevant changes in circumstances.


While all registered not-for-profit organisations will be required to provide an annual information statement, the Gillard Labor government recognises that a one-size-fits all approach is not appropriate. That is why entities with revenue less than $250,000 will not have to provide financial reports. Entities with revenue between $250,000 and $1 million will be required to provide financial reports which will be reviewed, and large entities with revenue of $1 million or more will be required to provide audited financial reports.


The key purpose of these bills is to reduce the red tape requirements associated with running a not-for-profit organisation and enable those valuable organisations to focus on their true purpose, on their mission, on their values, and on the objectives that define what that community organisation is supposed to be doing and what it is all about. The evidence has long shown that regulatory reform of the not-for-profit sector is necessary and there is agreement that the establishment of a national regulatory authority and a national regulatory framework is an essential component of such reform.


I have long been involved with the not-for-profit sector—through my work in the past, as Director of the Working Women's Centre in Tasmania and, more recently, as a founding CEO of the Asbestos Free Tasmania Foundation, both not-for-profit community organisations, as well as being on committees and boards, having involvement in various other community organisations and seeing the work that they do. They often run on the smell of an oily rag. They have limited funding, staff, time and resources. They need to direct all of those resources as much as possible into their mission, into the values and objectives that define what that organisation is all about. For most, that is through supporting people at the grassroots level. They are not into overly burdensome regulatory reporting and all the red tape that has gone with seeking deductible-gift-recipient status through the ATO, which for some has taken many months, if not years, to finally receive, because it is such a cumbersome and difficult process.


Unless some of those not-for-profit organisations have accountants or people with a legal background or the necessary skills and expertise on their boards or on their committees, they simply find it very cumbersome and difficult to meet the necessary ATO requirements for them to receive that status, even though their mission statement and their objectives often fit very much in line with being able to receive that status. That is why these bills are so important to that sector. The bills very much allow them to ensure that the mainstay of their work and their workforce is focused on the things that matter, and that is delivering on their objectives, delivering on supporting people in our community, delivering on their lobbying, delivering on supporting workers, and whatever else that organisation may represent. I can see considerable benefits through this new regulatory body.


Of course, as we heard from Senator Fifield, unfortunately those opposite do not share the view of the government or the sector. By opposing the establishment of the commission, the coalition is very much ignoring the views of those who would be affected by these bills, they are ignoring the views of the thousands of workers in the not-for-profit sector and they are ignoring the evidence base, preferring instead to ground their policies in the negativity which we continue hear. As Senator Fifield shared with us, if, lo and behold, they do ever get into government, it is another example of good policy, good legislation, which they intend to repeal.


What I want the not-for-profit sector to hear loud and clear today is that an Abbott-led government would repeal this legislation. An Abbott-led government would ensure that the status quo of the burden of trying to apply for deductible-gift-recipient status, for example, would remain and this new regulatory regime, this new body, this new commission, would no longer exist. Organisations would no longer have a one-stop shop available to them to be able to ensure that they are being listened to and responded to in a timely fashion. They would no longer have their workforce able to focus on the things that matter, their objectives, because they would instead be going back to the dark ages, like other positions of the opposition, such as climate change and the like. They would be going back to the dark ages of a very cumbersome and awkward regulatory method for ensuring that an organisation is able to gain the necessary charitable status that they should be able to gain in a more timely fashion. That is incredibly disappointing.


One strong message that needs to be heard today as we debate these bills and as we vote on these bills is the fact that the Abbott opposition is not supporting these bills and, in doing so, is not supporting the not-for-profit sector in Australia. As I said, the sector currently consists of some 600,000 organisations across this country, of which nearly 60,000 are economically significant to this country, and they employ some eight per cent of our nation's total workforce. That works out to be nearly 900,000 people across this country who are contributing some $43 billion to the nation's gross domestic product. They are the workers, the charitable organisations and the community organisations that I listed earlier, and the opposition is not supporting them. Let's make it very clear: we know that the opposition supports the profit-raising of the biggest miners in this country, but, when it comes to the 900,000 community workers in this country, it decides to not support them at all and stays in the position of going back to the dark ages. Why? Because it is a sector that the opposition simply does not care about. The community sector does not even warrant any kind of presence on the opposition's agenda. It shows absolute disrespect for the community sector. With his lack of support for these bills, Senator Fifield should be ashamed to be in this place and not supporting the community sector. The Gillard Labor government very much believes in a strong, innovative and independent community sector. That is why we have brought these bills to the Senate—they deliver that aim. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (13:30):  This is an important debate about a very important aspect of Australian civil society—the voluntary sector. It contributes so much in addition to, or perhaps even instead of, government in so many different areas in dealing with the challenges of health, education and underprivilege. Indeed, it often does a better job than government.


As we debate these bills and argue about the levels of regulation and compliance in the charities and not-for-profits sector, and the best ways to balance accountability and, of course, flexibility, one issue remains largely unaddressed, and it has not really been addressed in the debate thus far today. It is a problem that has been with us for some years now, and I remember raising it in this chamber some eight years ago, but little has changed since then. If anything, the problem is even more pronounced today. It is simply this: increasingly, some charities are moving into political advocacy, not just in addition to their other work but, in many cases, almost as their sole work. We live in a democracy and everyone is entitled to voice their opinions, advocate for certain positions and lobby for any outcomes they desire. That is all fine; none of us would object to that. This right applies to individuals as well as groups of people, businesses and, indeed, charities and not-for-profits—of course it does. But the right to free political expression does not entail an ancillary right to have that free political expression subsidised by the taxpayers. That is the issue. This, however, is what some charities now expect.


Charities and not-for-profits enjoy numerous tax benefits. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, they are exempted from income tax, they can get refunds on imputation credits, they can reduce their fringe benefits tax and they can obtain all sorts of various GST concessions. They are entitled to all that. Last but not least, the gifts and donations they receive from the public tend to be tax deductible. They are all benefits the charities and not-for-profits receive. This has been a longstanding practice which recognises the public benefit—the public good—that derives from the work of charities, which we all accept. In return for these benefits, we as a society and a government agree that we should make life and work easier for charities so they can better compete for staff with the public and private sectors as well as help them raise funds to finance their work. In a sense, that is the give and the take of what they do.


This has been a pretty straightforward proposition for hundreds of years now—indeed, since Elizabethan times—generating a strong consensus and little debate, because the public benefit from the work of charities was pretty clear. People could see it everywhere: education charities would provide education, health charities would provide medical care, social charities would care for those in need, and, more recently, environmental charities would roll up their sleeves and plant trees, clean up pollution or shelter animals. That is what they would do.


But the last few decades have seen the emergence of a new phenomenon: some charities and some not-for-profits are now simply involved in political advocacy and campaigning. No longer would community donations go to help charities do something; they would go to help charities lobby the government to do something. There is a big difference. It is a sort of philanthropy by proxy or compulsory philanthropy. It is no longer really philanthropy because when the government does something we all pay for it whether we want it or not.


This is of course always a matter of degree—I accept that. Many, if not most, charities and not-for-profits from time to time find themselves trying to influence public debate. That happens all the time and I accept that. The law has always recognised this as an entirely legitimate activity if carried in an ancillary way to the main charitable purpose. So the Salvation Army or St Vincent de Paul may talk about poverty, but their main purpose is providing for the poor. They are quite able, of course, to lobby government in certain areas and in certain sectors. There has never been a problem with that. The problem is when influencing public debate becomes a dominant, or even the sole, purpose for the charity's existence. That is when the problem emerges. For such charities, their work becomes less tangible. It is no longer underprivileged kids getting a better education or the homeless getting a roof over their heads or a koala habitat being protected and preserved—it is about affecting the direction of government policy and government spending, or even affecting those who are elected to government.


Such charities are no longer charities per se; let's face it: they are in effect not-for-profit lobbying and PR outfits, enjoying a sizeable subsidy from the taxpayers and the public purse. That is what they become. The question is: should they? If the aim is to effect policy or political change, shouldn't the charity workers join political parties, which have their own and relatively low tax deductible thresholds? Or, conversely, if political lobbying or campaigning should have tax benefits for charities, then why not for everyone else as well? If it is okay for koalas and the homeless, why isn't it okay for sugar farmers or small business men?


An even more ambiguous case than merely lobbying is campaigning at election time. This seems to be particularly common in my home state of Queensland, where charities and other groups enjoying favourable tax status, such as the Wilderness Society, have on many occasions in recent years produced and distributed election material, including how-to-vote cards, aiming to boost the Australian Greens or the Labor Party or at least diminish the coalition vote. That is what they have done with the tax benefits that they receive. This is not what a majority of people imagine charities do or should be doing. The courts and the bureaucracies, however, have been quite liberal in reinterpreting the definition of charitable purpose, as well as expanding the scope of other activities that charities can engage in without losing those particular tax benefits. We might ask, however, is it good public policy? We might want to ask ourselves that question. Should the taxpayers really be subsidising political lobbying and political campaigning? What makes charities so special that they should enjoy this privilege and benefit, which is not available to anyone else in our society except, to some extent, to political parties? Are some charities in reality merely associated entities of political parties? Are not the tax benefits granted to charities in recognition of the value of services and actual tangible support delivered to those actually in need? Should then these tax benefits be available to self-proclaimed charities which do not actually do anything directly to help, but merely write press releases and lobby politicians? Is that appropriate? We need these sorts of questions debated, and sooner rather than later actually answered—one day soon. 


As any questioning of the status quo invariably attracts a howl of indignation about the evil Liberals trying to stifle debate and silence dissent, let me repeat that the debate is not whether charities have the right to express their opinion or to lobby. Yes, they do. I make that very clear. Of course they do. The debate is whether some of them should enjoy a special tax status, not available to anyone else, if their supposedly charitable work consists mainly in expressing opinion or lobbying. That is the question. 


The coalition opposes the current bill because it ends up burying civil society in red tape. I do hope, however, that future governments will find time to address the problem of politicised charities. Way back in 2004 I made a few comments and they are still relevant today. I said that the taxpayers of Australia are owed some answers regarding the activities of organisations such as the Wilderness Society. But also, just as importantly, we owe it to other charities and groups enjoying tax deductible status, who quietly go about their work of helping others without involving themselves in the rough and tumble of politics, to ensure that charities, which as a general rule do so much good in our society, are not tarnished in the public's eye by the misdeeds of a few political wolves in charity sheep's clothing. If the coalition wins the next election, I do hope we address this issue, which gnaws at the credibility and public acceptance of the status and benefits which we bestow very willingly on our charities.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:41):  I too rise today to make a contribution to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012. The not-for-profit sector plays a vital role in the Australian community by providing support and assistance of some of the most vulnerable people whilst also supporting a number of issues-based causes that might not otherwise receive advocacy. The government values the important work provided by the not-for-profit sector in building social capital and helping to make stronger communities. That is why we want to ensure that we provide appropriate support to allow the sector to grow and flourish into the future.


Our commitment to reform of the not-for-profit sector began at the 2010 federal election when we announced that we would introduce the most extensive national reforms the sector has ever seen. The introduction of this bill is the culmination of delivering these reforms. They will support the sector and build upon the announcement that we made in the 2011-12 budget that the government would deliver these series of reforms to strengthen and support the sector, to ensure its sustainability into the future. We are doing this because over the past 17 years there have been a number of reviews looking into the not-for-profit sector. These include a comprehensive 2001 report of the Inquiry into the Definition of Charities and Related Organisations, the 2009 review into Australia's Future Tax System and the 2010 Productivity Commission report into the contribution of the not-for-profit sector. There has also been a number of parliamentary inquiries which have encompassed this issue. Together, these reviews and inquiries have identified the need to establish a single national regulator to simplify and reduce regulation for the not-for-profit sector.


The not-for-profit sector is made up of a wide range of organisations which range from small sports clubs right up to multinational charitable organisations. Due to the important role all these different charitable entities play in Australian society, the not-for-profit sector receives a wide range of support, including funding, donations from members of the public and tax concessions, grants and other support from local, state and federal governments. So the government wants to ensure that there is a strong regulatory system that helps deliver good governance, accountability and transparency in the not-for-profit sector.


Which brings us to the government's introduction of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012, which delivers on the outcomes raised by the reviews I mentioned earlier by establishing a national regulator and a national regulatory framework for the not-for-profit sector. The Assistant Treasurer, David Bradbury, is on record outlining the aims of the ACNC bills. There are three objectives. The first is to maintain, protect and enhance public trust and confidence in the not-for-profit sector. The second objective is to support and sustain a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative not-for-profit sector. The third objective underlines the important role that the ACNC will have to promote the reduction of unnecessary regulatory obligations on the not-for-profit sector.


A number of features of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 will establish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission which, as I have said, is the ACNC; it will give authority for the ACNC to register not-for-profit entities; and it will maintain a register of these organisations. It will provide the powers for the commissioner in relation to the regulation of these registered entities. It also sets out the obligations and duties of these registered entities.


I will just take a moment to examine in a little more detail some of these aspects of the bill. From the beginning of the bill, only tax endorsed charities will be regulated by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission; however, the bill establishes a regulatory framework to ensure that it can be extended to all not-for-profit entities in the future.


To register with the ACNC, and maintain registration, charities will apply directly to the commission and operate consistently with the definition of a charity, whilst also complying with prescribed registration conditions and requirements. The ACNC will also have the role to work with the not-for-profit sector to help provide education and guidance on their participation in the national regulatory framework.


The bill will establish an online, publically-available information register containing the details of the charities registered with the ACNC which, of course, is a very important reform. This register will be able to be accessed easily by the public to ensure that donors and volunteers will be able to rely on the information provided to help them make decisions as to whether to volunteer or donate to a registered charity. I know that is something that will ensure that life is much easier for those who are operating in this sector; there will be a one-stop shop so people will be able to access information about their organisation publicly and make an informed decision.


The bill will create the Office of the Commissioner of the ACNC. The commissioner will have the role to maintain general administration of the ACNC legislation and will have the power to register not-for-profit entities, and the legislation will provide the commissioner with the processes and grounds for revocation of the registration of a charitable organisational. Through this legislation the ACNC will also be required to report annually to parliament on its progress on red tape reduction. That is one of the issues that was raised by many of the submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this piece of legislation—the need for a reduction of red tape. The fact is that through this legislation, the commissioner, through the office of the commissioner will have to report its progress on reducing red tape for the not-for-profit sector.


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee held an inquiry into this bill, and arising from the report the government has made a number of amendments to the bill. At our hearing, and through submissions, the committee heard that many in the sector wanted the government to ensure that this bill did not restrict the independence of charitable organisations. As outlined in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report:


The committee believes the fostering of an independent not-for-profit sector is essential, and supports this as an object of the Bill. Gag clauses are an objectionable feature of contracts with not-for-profit entities. They are particularly inappropriate in those contexts where a monopsony exists: where the government offering the contract is the only purchaser of services. The committee believes such clauses should not be introduced.


I am pleased to say that through ongoing consultations the government has been conducting with the not-for-profit-sector, and after receiving the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report, the government has made amendments to this bill to ensure the independence of the not-for-profit-sector.


The government has also announced that the legislation will be reviewed after five years to ensure that the ACNC is operating as expected and to see how the objects of the bill have been achieved—in particular the elements designed to reduce the unnecessary regulation on the not-for-profit sector. As I have said previously, this is a very important aspect for the not-for-profit sector.


The federal government will also be negotiating with the states and territories on national regulation for the not-for-profit sector because we recognise that the greatest reduction in red tape for the sector can only be achieved with national coordination. On 17 October 2012 the government announced further changes to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission that will see further reductions in red tape for the not-for-profit sector after the changes to grant guidelines. The government will be amending the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines to support the implementation of a 'report once, use often' reporting framework for the not-for-profit sector—again, another important measure. Once established, the ACNC will help reduce the regulatory burden, which can be quite onerous, imposed on the not-for-profit sector. The introduction of the 'report once, use often' reporting framework will essentially mean that Australian charities will not have to provide the same information repeatedly to the government. This is an important step to help reduce the regulatory burden on the sector and allows them to get on with the job of helping those who are most vulnerable in our community. If we can put in place measures that deliver good accountability, transparency and oversight of the not-for-profit sector whilst also reducing the regulatory compliance of charitable organisations, allowing them to improve the effectiveness of the services they deliver, then this can only be a good thing for the sector.


In closing, I am pleased that the government is enacting a commitment made at the last federal election and then built upon in the 2011-12 budget to simplify the regulatory burden of the not-for-profit sector by introducing a one-stop shop. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission has been a long time coming. The need for this commission has been long identified through a number of reports over the past 17 years, so this bill, I believe, is a step in the right direction.


I also think it is important that we acknowledge Senator Ursula Stephens's role and the huge amount of work she has done in this area. I would also like to acknowledge the Assistant Treasurer, David Bradbury, who, through consultation with the sector and after receiving the Senate Community Affairs Committee report into this legislation, has made a number of amendments. These amendments address a number of concerns raised by the sector and the Community Affairs Committee, and ultimately help strengthen the bill. This bill will go a long way to supporting the not-for-profit sector now and ensuring that it is sustainable into the future and I commend the bills to the chamber.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (13:55):  The coalition will be opposing these two bills, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012. When the legislation was first mooted, I went looking for the examples of charity fraud that would require legislation of this depth and breadth. Where were the cases involving billions of dollars being scammed and defrauded out of charities? Where were the cases of the boards and governance in charity groups deliberately siphoning off funds to terrorist organisations or to tax havens? There must be of course billions of dollars going into this area in the same way as we have seen fraud and poor governance in organisations like Trio Capital, Storm Financial and dozens of others that have required the strengthening of our governance rules with regards to corporations and investment funds. So there must be millions of dollars being scammed off all over the place in terms of charities or there would be no need for legislation of this magnitude and at this cost.


Of course there is not. There is the odd case of a problem gambler who has defrauded the organisation they work for. There certainly have been some interesting investigations undertaken by ASIO and others into how some groups are functioning. But we do not have an endemic problem within the functioning and the governance of their charity organisations.


Once again we have the ridiculous situation of this government announcing its reform, which will involve all the states and territories agreeing to hand over their power of course, and then telling us after the bills have passed that that is when they will go and check if the states and territories think they would like to hand over the legislation. Many, many small charities are more than ably governed by the current state and territory bodies and should remain so, except for the empire-building delusions of the government. 


For example, let us look at one of the proposed amendments to this bill being put by Senator Xenophon. The bill of course is called the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill and it will set up an Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Yet one of the amendments being proposed is that we actually come up with a definition of charities. Wouldn't that be nice? No, no, let us set up the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and then decide what the definition of charities is and what the definition of not-for-profit is, and then we will go and ask the states and territories whether they agree to it. We will do all of that later, having invested millions of dollars in the establishment of the commission and in getting staff involved in the commission. It is another complete bungle of empire building by this government, which will achieve nothing except extra red tape and extra cost. We are not in any way persuaded by the government's argument that this is true reform. It is not. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that what this government is proposing to do will improve in any way the governance of charities in Australia. As I said, there is no overwhelming evidence to suggest that there is overall poor governance in this sector. Certainly, there are lots of volunteers doing their very best, and there may be some ignorance of governance, but in no way is it dishonest, fraudulent behaviour.


Debate interrupted.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-10-30,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:31):  In continuation, at the time we adjourned last night I was talking about the importance of the NGO sector and the fact that we need legislation to protect the independence of the not-for-profit sector, both for the right of an organisation to exist and to ensure that government does not use its position, often of sole-funder status, to stop not-for-profit advocacy. If you remember—I am sure everybody does—I was talking about the important role of NGOs in advocacy and their leadership in policy development.


Government is often the sole provider of funds for many of the social, cultural and environmental services that not-for-profits provide. Government, therefore, is clearly in a powerful position compared to the not-for-profit sector and service providers when they are negotiating. The threat of loss of DGR status or a grant is a very powerful one because it means that not-for-profit organisations are unable to carry out their functions effectively and to the full extent possible. Given that not-for-profits and charities are dependent on these funds for their survival, it is very important that we ensure that there is guaranteed independence for these organisations.


It is fair to say that, in the past, governments have taken advantage of this power to try to silence the not-for-profit sector into silent dissent. We saw in the past, during the Howard era, gag clauses imposed on not-for-profit organisations. The present government, to its credit, removed most of those onerous aspects of such clauses. However, we are seeing a return to this approach with gag clauses. During the Senate committee's inquiry we heard about gag clauses being imposed on the not-for-profit sector by the Queensland government. In other words, they are going back to the bad old days when they expect not-for-profit organisations to sit there, be quiet, provide services but not advocate for their clients, both individually and-or for systemic change.


Even with government grants, it can be rather oblique when governments say to organisations, 'You need to run your media comments past us before you release them.' Again, that limits the independence of not-for-profits. We need to ensure, therefore, that the independence of the not-for-profit organisations is protected.


For all these reasons, it is absolutely critical that the individual components of this bill reflect the commitment to an independent vibrant sector. We felt it was very important that this was outlined in the objectives of this particular legislation. However, although it was included in the objectives, there were some components of the bill that did not properly support this outcome without amendments. That is why we are particularly pleased that the government has amended this bill to include the process of articulating upfront that governance standards cannot impinge on the independence nor the advocacy role of not-for-profit organisations. We are also pleased that the government has announced the process of bringing in a separate piece of legislation that means gag clauses cannot be imposed.


This bill allows for governance standards to be established by regulation. I recognise that this has come about because of the difficulties and the time frame both the sector and the government encountered in attempting to draft these standards. This is particularly because we have such a diverse range of strong and vibrant charities and not-for-profit organisations in this country that do totally different things. It is very hard to come up with a set of governance standards that covers all of them, therefore more time was needed.


Given that the governance standards trigger very significant powers for the commissioner and can lead to a charity having its registration revoked, we simply cannot leave these standards to the manner by which the government proposed the regulations would operate. We need to increase the safeguards to ensure that they  have better certainty in place and cannot be easily revised to the detriment of the sector in the future. These issues were raised in the committee's inquiry and I am pleased that the government will move amendments that deal with them.


The Australian Greens recommended that the governance standards should be only a minimum standard of contact and be principle based, specifying the outcome to be achieved rather than detailing an entity would meet the standards. We also recommended clarifying and limiting some of the currently unfettered powers of enforcement that had been provided to the commissioner—such as the 'more likely than not' clause which gives the commissioner the power to act pre-emptively to prevent a breach of the standards.


Similarly, section 15-10 of the ACNC bill outlines matters that the commissioner must have regard to when exercising powers and functions, which includes the maintenance, protection and enhancement of public trust and confidence in the not-for-profit sector. We were concerned that, as they stood, these provisions gave the commissioner too much power to take pre-emptive enforcement action when an organisation had not as yet breached the conduct standards and could be used to look beyond specific breaches of legal liability and responsibility towards subjective judgements about how the not-for-profit sector should operate. 


All of these recommendations reflect the comments that were provided by the charities and not-for-profit sector, who submitted evidence to the committee process. The amendments that have been circulated have finally resolved the biggest problems associated with these bills—that is, the governance standards. I hope that with these amendments we will get a more satisfactory process around the commission. Many organisations participated in this process looking at this legislation and I thank them very much, because the not-for-profit sector are often so busy delivering their vital community services that they have little time to participate in these sorts of overarching discussions.


Currently, the not-for-profits have to report across a number of government departments as well as state and territory regulations, depending on the size of the organisation. Issues around red tape are absolutely critical for the sector and they came up extensively during the committee process. As it stood, we thought the process did not articulate enough how the government intended to deal with issues around red tape. This matter came up repeatedly and there was much criticism that this bill could drive more red tape. That is why the government has also circulated some amendments to deal with issues of red tape. One of these is that the commissioner will be required to report to parliament specifically against red tape reduction. Also, the charity passport will be developed, and I think that will also assist.


It is very important that we have the commissioner driving the process of red tape reduction. If the commissioner does not have that specific mandate, I am concerned that red tape reduction will fall off the agenda and that there will be no-one driving specific government departments to work across and within government departments. I think we have made some significant progress there. This brings me to the point about the commission and the commission's role in consultation on governance standards. That is another particularly important amendment that has been circulated: that the commissioner will be involved intimately in the consultation process to set up the governance standards.


In conclusion, these amendments that have been circulated by the government include some extensive amendments, but they also reflect the outcomes of the committee consultation process. The Greens will be supporting these bills, although in the Committee of the Whole I will be asking the government some particular points around mechanisms and the way the legislation will operate. We will be supporting this legislation with these amendments.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (12:40):  I am very pleased to see us debating the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and related bill at last. From my perspective, they breathe life into the reforms that have been so long in coming for Australia's not-for-profit sector. The government's commitment to establish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission, the ACNC, also reflects the sector's advocacy for the establishment of an independent, one-stop shop, specialist regulator. This regulator will provide the framework to support the vital contribution that not-for-profit organisations make to Australia's civil society. Rather than reflect any lack of trust in the sector, as the Senator Cormann said last night, in fact the ACNC supports public and government trust and confidence in the sector, which in turn helps charities and not-for-profits achieve their mission. 


The government, working with the sector, is delivering an ambitious not-for-profit reform agenda. This reflects two very exciting though challenging phenomena: the impressive growth of and the wide-ranging changes taking place in the sector in Australia today. Australia's not-for-profit sector comprises around 600,000 entities. About 400,000 of those have access to Commonwealth tax concessions and about 56,000 of them are endorsed as charities. The sector contributes about four per cent of Australia's GDP and it is growing rapidly, with one million Australians employed in the sector and about five million volunteers involved. The sector turns over about $100 billion every year and has a 10-year annual growth rate of about five per cent a year—that is second only to the mining sector in Australia. The sector is at the heart of our education, our health, our arts, our culture, our sport, our environment and our welfare services. 


Thanks to much hard work for a decade, during which I have been proud to be a strong advocate, the sector is finding its voice. It has grown its voice and its presence in Australian society because it has taken on many new responsibilities in areas of service coordination and delivery, and it has contributed to good policy development, shaping Australia's future. This is a good thing because a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative not-for-profit sector is vital in every modern democracy, and Australia is no different. I say 'robust' and 'independent' because, as Senator Siewert reminded us, who will ever forget the insidious, creeping, gagging clauses of the previous coalition government's contracts and funding agreements and the overt threat to cancel contracts, and the cuts to funding for organisations deemed to be advocating for policy change and not compliant with the government's agenda. 


After a decade of hollowing out capacity and stifling innovation, it was a privilege for me to lead the work which led to the national compact with the sector. It was signed in 2010 and gave life to a new, robust and respectful relationship with the sector. So much work, so much time and so much commitment have gone into the development of this reform agenda, which includes the establishment of the ACNC, whose purpose is to deliver smarter and more effective regulation of the not-for-profit sector. The ACNC is future focused, its structural reform recommended by six reviews, including the comprehensive Report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations conducted under the previous coalition government and, of course, the 2010 Productivity Commission report.


Under the current arrangements, the Australian Taxation Office has the dual and potentially conflicting duties of determining an entity's charitable status as well as having responsibility for enforcing the taxation law. It acts as gatekeeper and enforcer. At the Commonwealth level, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission also plays a role in terms of its oversight of companies limited by guarantee. But the not-for-profit sector does not want to be regulated by the ATO or ASIC. Organisations have made it clear over the years, time and time again, that they want an independent regulator, one that understands the sector, one that understands not-for-profit organisations. The ACNC will be that independent and dedicated regulator, enabling the sector to consolidate its standing in the community through improved transparency and accountability.


The not-for-profit sector has the confidence of Australian society, but the opposition, in opposing this bill, say that the current arrangements are just fine. Last night Senator Cormann said that the ACNC is a solution in search of a problem. That is patently unfair and it is absolutely untrue. The not-for-profit sector is burdened by the complicated and duplicated regulatory obligations that are imposed on the sector. I have to say that the coalition are great champions of business, campaigning for harmonising regulation and reducing red tape for businesses—for the finance industry, for mining, for agriculture—but not the not-for-profit sector, which is larger than all of these except, as I said, mining. They believe the sector should be in the service of government. We believe the sector should be serving the Australian people, especially those who have little voice or representation.


Senator Siewert outlined the detailed history of the bills in the amendments before the Senate, and we will get a chance to debate them. Those amendments include providing additional parliamentary scrutiny of governance and external conduct standards to be made under the ACNC legislation and to codify the process for public consultation in the development of the standards. The objects of the bill are to cut red tape and reduce the regulatory burden, not to impose greater stresses on the sector. The ACNC will administer a 'charities passport' and work to implement a 'report-once, use-often' reporting framework. This charity passport is the data that charities will report to meet the baseline corporate and financial reporting requirements of Australian government agencies. This will be supported by changes to the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines which will benefit the organisations that register with the ACNC.


The changes build on the introduction of the standard chart of accounts framework—another great piece of the government's not-for-profit reform agenda. Information will be in one place and, if an entity provides an annual audited financial statement to the ACNC, then a grant acquittal should not generally be required. It is light touch regulation commensurate with the risk involved in the funding agreement. The ACNC will report to the parliament and the sector by developing and publishing a red-tape reduction timeline and plan and reporting against that timeline. The ACNC taskforce is already hard at work, implementing these arrangements until the ACNC itself is established. An example of that is the work that is currently going on between AusAID, ACFID and the government, with AusAID staff working with the ACNC taskforce to improve the process of NGO accreditation and entry into the AusAID-NGO Cooperation Program, reducing the reporting burden on ACNC registered charities and increasing the focus of AusAID assessments on the effectiveness of Australian aid funds.


AusAID and the ACNC will also work together to educate and support overseas aid charities to understand their obligations. This partnership with the sector will free up significant resources for frontline services and is a great example of what the ACNC will be able to deliver. The ACNC will provide a platform for delivering a national approach to not-for-profit regulation. With no national regulator, there is no opportunity for that to happen—and that is why a harmonised, national approach to regulation has not been achieved to date.


Senator Cormann would like us to believe that the sector does not support this legislation. This is simply not true. Last night, he deliberately misquoted out of context evidence from UnitingCare Australia. The first quote addressed a proposed definition of 'basic religious charity'. At the time, the definition excluded religious charities that received government grants. UnitingCare Australia argued that receipt of a government grant should not be a trigger for additional reporting, an argument accepted by government. The second quote was actually preceded by this statement: 'The church is supportive of one-stop reporting and a regulation concept.' I warn coalition senators: every time that you misquote or misrepresent the views of people like Reverend Tim Costello, Patrick McClure, Martin Laverty, Anne Robinson, Father Brian Lucas, David Crosbie, Lin Hatfield Dodds, Ken Henry, Professor Myles McGregor-Lowndes and Productivity Commissioner Robert Fitzgerald, you are traducing the intellect and reputation of prominent Australians who have contributed to shaping this agenda over the past decade. It is you who are undermining trust and confidence in the sector.


Let me reiterate: this reform has been led by the sector itself. ACOSS, Volunteering Australia, Mission Australia, Anglicare, World Vision, UnitingCare, Catholic Social Services and Philanthropy Australia are some of the many not-for-profit charities and organisations that have helped shape the bill and support it publically and consistently. ACOSS said just recently:


The creation of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission is the culmination of a long process and has broad support from the community and social services sector.


Chartered Secretaries Australia, in the Financial Review, contributed this view:


If we really want to support the NFP sector, the best way is to establish the ACNC, fulfilling the promise of all those inquiries and the desires of NFPs.


The Community Council for Australia said it:


… strongly supports the ACNC Bills on the basis that they provide for the establishment of an independent and responsive regulator for the charities and not-for-profit sector.


And Philanthropy Australia are supporting 'the principles of the ACNC being an independent regulator to deliver smarter regulation, reduce red tape and improve transparency and accountability within the sector'.


Last night Senator Cormann outlined the opposition's position, and I wondered, as I listened to him, whether he is not aware of or whether he is completely uninterested in the fact that the 2008 Senate inquiry brought down a unanimous report, the first recommendation of which was the introduction of an independent regulator.


So what has changed? I certainly hope Senator Mason's view has not changed. He was adamant when he spoke here in 2006, saying:


I have little doubt that the vast majority of organisations are doing the right thing and are doing great work. The problem is that we cannot sort out the many good not-for-profit groups from the handful of bad ones or those who are underperforming. It is my belief that this threatens the donor-charity trust relationship within the sector at large.


It is here that government needs to step in and provide clarity where confusion prevails. After all, the government does have a legitimate interest in the not-for-profit sector, as the sector is the beneficiary of a raft of taxpayer funded subsidies handed out by government.


…   …   …


Charities have a good reputation but trust can very easily be lost. It is vitally important that the sector makes itself more efficient and transparent, lest the sector experiences a decline in trust. There is a role here for government to step in and promote high standards within the sector and to establish a clear, transparent regulatory regime that will allow Australian charities to thrive in the 21st century.


Now we hear that the coalition not only is opposing the ACNC legislation but also will repeal the legislation and abolish the ACNC at the first opportunity.


The establishment of the ACNC is structural reform. It is about designing a regulatory framework which is suited to the not-for-profit sector and which addresses flaws in the current approach to not-for-profit regulation. The coalition's alternative charities commission is nothing more than an information and advice body, but that is not the key challenge confronting the sector in Australia. The key challenge is the need to address the deficiencies which currently exist when it comes to not-for-profit regulation—namely, the fragmented, inconsistent and uncoordinated approach to regulation of the sector.


If the coalition had their way there would be no ACNC and no regulatory reform. We would be back to the bad old days of gag clauses to silence dissent, as Senator Siewert said. We have already seen this occurring in Queensland. The National Compact would disappear. The work that has been done to develop a respectful relationship would be discounted and would disappear. Fundraising legislation would continue to be a nightmare for charities trying to raise money across borders or online. Volunteers would be subject to nonsensical cross-border rules that currently exist and which are part of the not-for-profit reform agenda negotiations. The sector would continue to be underpaid, underresourced and undervalued.


These bills before us today are about getting the balance right—promoting transparency and good governance while reducing red tape and supporting the capacity of the sector organisations. I congratulate the sector for its leadership and its persistence over more than a decade, and the Assistant Treasurer David Bradbury for his attention to this important agenda. He is someone with experience and connection with the sector who understands the importance of these reforms and who has championed them in cabinet. Senator Siewert made some important points about the role of the commissioner.


I commend to everyone the work of the interim commissioner, Susan Pascoe, who has done an amazing job in driving these reforms and in dealing with the consultation that has been part of the development of these bills. Starting with the original 2001 charities bill, the draft of which was rejected so soundly under the previous government, she has brought the sector and government to the place that we are today. It has been an amazing effort and she is to be commended for her leadership of her team and for the work she has done with the ACNC task force. All of this is a big-picture vision. It is about not-for-profit reform. It is about positioning our organisations for Australia in the future.


We need to come to a definition of charity. We are still working with the Queen Elizabeth statute common law provisions. We need to consider how all of this plays out in terms of workforce planning. We know the demands that are being placed on the sector. We know the challenges. We know where the compact is taking us, and the codes of conduct and of consultation that are being developed there. We know how much work is being done to understand the sector through funding the work of organisations like the Centre for Social Impact, another big commitment from this government to understand the sector and provide some intellectual framework around it. We know the work that has been invested in the Social Investment Fund, and the kinds of models that are being developed for enterprise opportunities. We know the work that is being done by organisations on capacity building for the sector.


All of those things were in a hiatus for a decade, and all of those things now need to be invested in and supported. They come quite clearly out of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission report, which outlined, quite succinctly and quite transparently, the agenda of five key pillars for this sector that are going to sustain them into the future. It is a seminal piece of work, and I recommend that it be on everyone's bookshelf. If you really need to understand what is going on in the sector that is a really good place to start.


I place on the record my thanks to Senator Claire Moore and Senator Siewert for their work in bringing this latest round of amendments to the Senate. It reflects good consultation and the way committees work best in this place. It is about improving legislation that is in the national interest. It puts party politics out of reach and that allows people to honour the commitment we have made to the sector through the national compact that we would develop and support a thriving, robust, independent sector into the future. These things which are now part of the COAG reform agenda in health, in ageing, in community services are things that we need to invest in now for the long term. I am quite sure that these bills before the Senate today will be part of underpinning good policy and good practice to carry us through into the 21st century.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (13:00):  I also rise to speak on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012. As the title of the bill suggests, the bill seeks to establish a new statutory office, a Commonwealth-level regulator for the not-for-profit sector called the Australian charities and not-for-profits commission.


Let me be clear up front: the coalition does oppose this bill. We do so on the basis that despite the intent, the new regulator would hinder not help civil society. I want to acknowledge the previous contributor to this debate, Senator Stephens, who has a genuine interest in the not-for-profit sector and has had that interest for many years. But on this occasion I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that she has reached.


A robust civil society is a reflection of the sort of country that we are. It is built through people who choose to freely associate with organisations and causes that are important to them. Australia has a strong and diverse not-for-profit sector that thrives on community spirit and goodwill. We all know of local carer groups in the cities and towns we live in, the sporting clubs which as members of parliament we have associations with and we know that these networks, associations and clubs are sustained by people who volunteer their time and energy to causes that matter to them and to organisations that they see as important. 


It is the view of the coalition that the state should be at the service of civil society to make life easier for civil society. We on this side of the chamber start with the principle that the government should do no harm to the efforts and endeavours of the not-for-profit sector. Government should be a facilitator but it should not intrude upon the operation of the not-for-profit sector. The government's proposal enshrined in this bill for a new regulatory body is what you might call a typical Labor 'reform'. The intent is fine, worthy and noble, but the reality in the text of the legislation we think would lead to an altogether different outcome.


When the new regulator was proposed, the primary objective was to reduce administrative compliance and reporting duplication for the not-for-profit sector. The intent of that was to allow these organisations to direct more of their limited resources and time to their core business. We do not believe that the bill in its current form does justice to the original objective. One of the key aims of the legislation is supposedly to reduce red tape for the not-for-profit sector. We do not think that it will do that. Also unless the states and territories agree to hand over their powers to the Commonwealth and agree to harmonise their laws, these bills would add a layer of red tape which the sector would have to meet. Susan Pascoe, the head of the commission implementation task force, has stated that:


You are only going to achieve full red-tape reduction with the involvement of the states and territories. 


The states and territories to date have declined to hand over any of their powers with respect to charities and not-for-profits. In fact, they are highly critical of the proposed commission. The Commonwealth have not had a terrific track record, it must be said, of negotiating with the other jurisdictions. Instead they tend to try and seek to blame and scapegoat the states at every opportunity.


The proposed commission treats Australian not-for-profits as though they are not entirely to be trusted. The legislation has a range of powers to interfere with the internal workings of an organisation which has the potential to jeopardise the independence of civil society. The bill gives the commission the power to deregister an organisation if it is deemed to be conducting its affairs in a way that might cause harm or threaten the public trust or confidence in the not-for-profit sector. While that is a noble sentiment, it is a very strong power for a government to be able to deregister a not-for-profit. The phrase 'public trust and confidence' in the legislation is ambiguous and creates uncertainty as to the definition of that phrase. No doubt if this legislation is passed it would ultimately be the courts that would determine what the phrase means.


The bill provides the ACNC commissioner with a range of enforcement powers that go far beyond what is necessary. The commission would have the authority to issue warning notices, issue directions, enter into enforceable undertakings, apply to the courts for injunctions, suspend or remove responsible entities and appoint acting responsible entities.


These sorts of provisions are, I think, disproportionate for the potential risk that there is in the sector. We think that, when it comes to the not-for-profit sector, you should not be adopting not so much a risk minimisation policy but rather a risk management policy. Where the risk is low, government should have a light touch. We think that the powers proposed here are not commensurate with the level of risk and that they are excessive.


As I have said, the powers and penalties contained in the legislation are pretty heavy-handed. But also of concern is the commissioner's ability to remove the director of a not-for-profit. In his submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into the legislation, Mr David Gonski, of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, raised the issue that Australia may be the first country in the world to make being a director of a not-for-profit more onerous than being a director of a for-profit organisation.


In short, the legislation is a bad piece of legislation. What was supposed to create a one-stop shop for charities has created an environment that in effect undermines confidence in the not-for-profit sector. There is no agreement with the states to harmonise powers. There would be duplication of reporting requirements, and the onerous compliance obligations would have the potential to discourage community involvement and volunteers from being involved in local organisations. There are approximately 600,000 entities in Australia's not-for-profit sector. They are made up on people who give their time and their energy to many Australians who greatly need it.


The coalition have a different approach. We reject the legislation. We will not be supporting the creation of a heavy-handed regulatory body that would only add to red tape and compliance burdens for the not-for-profit sector. The government should seek to work with the sector rather than treating it as an arm of the state. I think that the level of intervention that this legislation seeks to give government the capacity exercise is a reflection of the Labor Party's philosophical approach. We should make sure that government is of service to Australia's civil society, that it should not hinder it. That is what the coalition will endeavour to achieve.


We oppose the legislation and, as my colleagues have indicated already, if we have the opportunity, we shall repeal it. As I said at the commencement of my remarks—and now that Senator Stephens is in the chamber I will repeat my remarks—I do respect Senator Stephens' interest in and contribution to the not-for-profit sector and the charitable sector over a long period of time. I listened to her contribution but, on this occasion, I respectfully have reached a different conclusion to her.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:10): I rise today to speak to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012. There have been many reviews of the not-for-profit sector over the past 17 years, including the 2001 Report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations, the 2009 review into Australia's future tax system and the 2010 Productivity Commission report, The contribution of the not-for-profit sector. Each of these reviews has recommended the establishment of a national regulator, which would simplify regulation for the not-for-profit sector, which is why the Gillard Labor government made it an election commitment to do exactly this.


As the not-for-profit sector grows, we must help it consolidate its standing in the community. The reform of the not-for-profit sector is ambitious, and the government has undertaken extensive consultation to ensure that these bills address the issues facing not-for-profit organisations. Through both a public consultation process—to which 47 written submissions were received—and a public hearing held in Canberra in September, organisations such as the Smith Family, the Salvation Army, World Vision, Mission Australia, the Fundraising Institute of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia, to name a few, have contributed their views on the proposed reform of the sector.


From the beginning, effective and close consultation with the not-for-profit sector has been of vital importance to the Gillard Labor government. Issues raised during the public consultation period and through the committee hearing have been considered and the bills revised to ensure that they deliver the most effective outcome in light of the feedback that has been received. The sector has made it clear they want an independent regulator which can focus entirely on their needs, which is what these bills in fact deliver.


Australia's not-for-profit sector is very much diverse. It is made up of charities, charitable trusts, churches, religious groups, sporting organisations and clubs, advocacy groups, community organisations, cooperatives, trade unions, trade and professional organisations, chambers of commerce, welfare organisations and service providers. It is incredibly diverse. The sector currently consists of some 600,000 organisations, of which nearly 60,000 are economically significant, in that they employ roughly eight per cent of the nation's total workforce—some 890,000 people—and they contribute $43 billion to the nation's gross domestic product. The remaining 440,000 organisations are small, unincorporated organisations which have been traditionally exempt from reporting obligations. They do not have an ABN, and cannot be endorsed as charities or receive deductible gift recipient status. They can, however, self-assess income tax exemptions.


The not-for-profit sector performs a valuable role in our society as it very much endeavours to provide services that meet the needs and betterment of the Australian community. It is for these reasons that the government provides assistance to such organisations, both directly through the funding of programs and services as well as through tax exemptions and concessions. In seeing the immense value of the sector, everyday Australians also lend their support by volunteering their time and through financial and in-kind donations. 


In the 2006-07 financial year, donations of more than $7.2 billion were made to the sector, and over 4.6 million Australians donated their valuable time. Increasingly, not-for-profits and their donors are influencing where community and government resources are directed. Regulation of the not-for-profit sector has traditionally fallen to the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO has been responsible for determining charitable status and for determining whether not-for-profit organisations are eligible for tax exemptions and concessions such as fringe benefits tax, deductible gift recipient status, refundable franking credits and goods and services tax concessions. This can potentially be seen as conflict of interest, as the ATO is ultimately responsible for revenue raising while also being charged with making decisions on whether not-for-profit organisations should be granted charitable status.


Regulation of not-for-profit organisations limited by guarantee has fallen to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Some not-for-profit organisations can also receive state or territory tax concessions or exemptions and therefore need to be registered with their own state or territory government. This means that, depending on their status and location, not-for-profit organisations have found themselves subject to a number of reporting requirements at both Commonwealth and state or territory level. Many of the reporting requirements have been designed with for-profit organisations in mind and are therefore unsuited to the not-for-profit sector, as they quickly become both time consuming and costly.


This is why the Gillard Labor government has committed to reforming the NFP sector. We want to ensure this sector is transparent and accountable while also ensuring that resources are directed to the most valuable outcomes rather than being swallowed up by excessive regulatory requirements. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 will: establish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission, charge the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission with registering not-for-profit entities and maintaining a register, provide powers for the commissioner in relation to the regulation of registered entities, establish a single national regulatory framework for not-for-profit entities, and set out the obligations and duties of registered entities.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission will be a one-stop-shop regulator for the not-for-profit sector—something that the not-for-profit sector have been asking for and have been wanting for some time, to clear out the hodgepodge nature in which not-for-profits have been able to become regulated and receive those levels of status and recognition that they deserve and should have access to in a timely fashion. I note Senator Fifield's earlier comments, and I also note the opposition's position to not vote for this bill. In doing so, the opposition is not supporting the not-for-profit sector, because this bill very much reflects what the not-for-profit sector have been calling for. I noticed that Senator Fifield talked about the fact of this regulatory environment and his opposition to the new regulatory environment which will be created through this new commission. But already we have South Australia agreeing to align its own regulatory environment with the new commission that is being created. I congratulate the South Australian government for having the foresight to do so and I hope that other states follow suit fairly soon. Again, that shows that states also want to have a simplified, one-stop-shop process to this issue of regulating the not-for-profit sector. Senator Fifield fails to understand—or at least omitted, in his contribution in the debate on this bill—the fact that South Australia is already agreeing to align its regulatory environment with the new commission. 


The new commission will act as an independent statutory agency, separate from the ATO. It comprises a commissioner, an advisory board and officers who are engaged under the Public Service Act 1999. The commission will report through the Treasurer to the parliament each year and will be held accountable for its work in delivering reductions in the regulatory burden. While registration is voluntary, it will be a prerequisite for those charities wishing to access certain Commonwealth tax concessions. The commissioner will be required to maintain the register and will be able to revoke the registration of those not-for-profits who, after being given written notice and the opportunity to contest, fail to meet the necessary conditions.


The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission provides a framework for record keeping and reporting, requiring all entities to keep records which correctly record and explain the financial position and performance of each entity. In order to gain and maintain registration, not-for-profit organisations will be required to meet governance and external conduct standards set out in the regulations, keep financial and written records and, in the case of small not-for-profit organisations, provide information statements. In the case of large and medium organisations, they will be required to provide financial reports, audits or review reports, and of course they must notify the commissioner of relevant changes in circumstances.


While all registered not-for-profit organisations will be required to provide an annual information statement, the Gillard Labor government recognises that a one-size-fits all approach is not appropriate. That is why entities with revenue less than $250,000 will not have to provide financial reports. Entities with revenue between $250,000 and $1 million will be required to provide financial reports which will be reviewed, and large entities with revenue of $1 million or more will be required to provide audited financial reports.


The key purpose of these bills is to reduce the red tape requirements associated with running a not-for-profit organisation and enable those valuable organisations to focus on their true purpose, on their mission, on their values, and on the objectives that define what that community organisation is supposed to be doing and what it is all about. The evidence has long shown that regulatory reform of the not-for-profit sector is necessary and there is agreement that the establishment of a national regulatory authority and a national regulatory framework is an essential component of such reform.


I have long been involved with the not-for-profit sector—through my work in the past, as Director of the Working Women's Centre in Tasmania and, more recently, as a founding CEO of the Asbestos Free Tasmania Foundation, both not-for-profit community organisations, as well as being on committees and boards, having involvement in various other community organisations and seeing the work that they do. They often run on the smell of an oily rag. They have limited funding, staff, time and resources. They need to direct all of those resources as much as possible into their mission, into the values and objectives that define what that organisation is all about. For most, that is through supporting people at the grassroots level. They are not into overly burdensome regulatory reporting and all the red tape that has gone with seeking deductible-gift-recipient status through the ATO, which for some has taken many months, if not years, to finally receive, because it is such a cumbersome and difficult process.


Unless some of those not-for-profit organisations have accountants or people with a legal background or the necessary skills and expertise on their boards or on their committees, they simply find it very cumbersome and difficult to meet the necessary ATO requirements for them to receive that status, even though their mission statement and their objectives often fit very much in line with being able to receive that status. That is why these bills are so important to that sector. The bills very much allow them to ensure that the mainstay of their work and their workforce is focused on the things that matter, and that is delivering on their objectives, delivering on supporting people in our community, delivering on their lobbying, delivering on supporting workers, and whatever else that organisation may represent. I can see considerable benefits through this new regulatory body.


Of course, as we heard from Senator Fifield, unfortunately those opposite do not share the view of the government or the sector. By opposing the establishment of the commission, the coalition is very much ignoring the views of those who would be affected by these bills, they are ignoring the views of the thousands of workers in the not-for-profit sector and they are ignoring the evidence base, preferring instead to ground their policies in the negativity which we continue hear. As Senator Fifield shared with us, if, lo and behold, they do ever get into government, it is another example of good policy, good legislation, which they intend to repeal.


What I want the not-for-profit sector to hear loud and clear today is that an Abbott-led government would repeal this legislation. An Abbott-led government would ensure that the status quo of the burden of trying to apply for deductible-gift-recipient status, for example, would remain and this new regulatory regime, this new body, this new commission, would no longer exist. Organisations would no longer have a one-stop shop available to them to be able to ensure that they are being listened to and responded to in a timely fashion. They would no longer have their workforce able to focus on the things that matter, their objectives, because they would instead be going back to the dark ages, like other positions of the opposition, such as climate change and the like. They would be going back to the dark ages of a very cumbersome and awkward regulatory method for ensuring that an organisation is able to gain the necessary charitable status that they should be able to gain in a more timely fashion. That is incredibly disappointing.


One strong message that needs to be heard today as we debate these bills and as we vote on these bills is the fact that the Abbott opposition is not supporting these bills and, in doing so, is not supporting the not-for-profit sector in Australia. As I said, the sector currently consists of some 600,000 organisations across this country, of which nearly 60,000 are economically significant to this country, and they employ some eight per cent of our nation's total workforce. That works out to be nearly 900,000 people across this country who are contributing some $43 billion to the nation's gross domestic product. They are the workers, the charitable organisations and the community organisations that I listed earlier, and the opposition is not supporting them. Let's make it very clear: we know that the opposition supports the profit-raising of the biggest miners in this country, but, when it comes to the 900,000 community workers in this country, it decides to not support them at all and stays in the position of going back to the dark ages. Why? Because it is a sector that the opposition simply does not care about. The community sector does not even warrant any kind of presence on the opposition's agenda. It shows absolute disrespect for the community sector. With his lack of support for these bills, Senator Fifield should be ashamed to be in this place and not supporting the community sector. The Gillard Labor government very much believes in a strong, innovative and independent community sector. That is why we have brought these bills to the Senate—they deliver that aim. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (13:30):  This is an important debate about a very important aspect of Australian civil society—the voluntary sector. It contributes so much in addition to, or perhaps even instead of, government in so many different areas in dealing with the challenges of health, education and underprivilege. Indeed, it often does a better job than government.


As we debate these bills and argue about the levels of regulation and compliance in the charities and not-for-profits sector, and the best ways to balance accountability and, of course, flexibility, one issue remains largely unaddressed, and it has not really been addressed in the debate thus far today. It is a problem that has been with us for some years now, and I remember raising it in this chamber some eight years ago, but little has changed since then. If anything, the problem is even more pronounced today. It is simply this: increasingly, some charities are moving into political advocacy, not just in addition to their other work but, in many cases, almost as their sole work. We live in a democracy and everyone is entitled to voice their opinions, advocate for certain positions and lobby for any outcomes they desire. That is all fine; none of us would object to that. This right applies to individuals as well as groups of people, businesses and, indeed, charities and not-for-profits—of course it does. But the right to free political expression does not entail an ancillary right to have that free political expression subsidised by the taxpayers. That is the issue. This, however, is what some charities now expect.


Charities and not-for-profits enjoy numerous tax benefits. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, they are exempted from income tax, they can get refunds on imputation credits, they can reduce their fringe benefits tax and they can obtain all sorts of various GST concessions. They are entitled to all that. Last but not least, the gifts and donations they receive from the public tend to be tax deductible. They are all benefits the charities and not-for-profits receive. This has been a longstanding practice which recognises the public benefit—the public good—that derives from the work of charities, which we all accept. In return for these benefits, we as a society and a government agree that we should make life and work easier for charities so they can better compete for staff with the public and private sectors as well as help them raise funds to finance their work. In a sense, that is the give and the take of what they do.


This has been a pretty straightforward proposition for hundreds of years now—indeed, since Elizabethan times—generating a strong consensus and little debate, because the public benefit from the work of charities was pretty clear. People could see it everywhere: education charities would provide education, health charities would provide medical care, social charities would care for those in need, and, more recently, environmental charities would roll up their sleeves and plant trees, clean up pollution or shelter animals. That is what they would do.


But the last few decades have seen the emergence of a new phenomenon: some charities and some not-for-profits are now simply involved in political advocacy and campaigning. No longer would community donations go to help charities do something; they would go to help charities lobby the government to do something. There is a big difference. It is a sort of philanthropy by proxy or compulsory philanthropy. It is no longer really philanthropy because when the government does something we all pay for it whether we want it or not.


This is of course always a matter of degree—I accept that. Many, if not most, charities and not-for-profits from time to time find themselves trying to influence public debate. That happens all the time and I accept that. The law has always recognised this as an entirely legitimate activity if carried in an ancillary way to the main charitable purpose. So the Salvation Army or St Vincent de Paul may talk about poverty, but their main purpose is providing for the poor. They are quite able, of course, to lobby government in certain areas and in certain sectors. There has never been a problem with that. The problem is when influencing public debate becomes a dominant, or even the sole, purpose for the charity's existence. That is when the problem emerges. For such charities, their work becomes less tangible. It is no longer underprivileged kids getting a better education or the homeless getting a roof over their heads or a koala habitat being protected and preserved—it is about affecting the direction of government policy and government spending, or even affecting those who are elected to government.


Such charities are no longer charities per se; let's face it: they are in effect not-for-profit lobbying and PR outfits, enjoying a sizeable subsidy from the taxpayers and the public purse. That is what they become. The question is: should they? If the aim is to effect policy or political change, shouldn't the charity workers join political parties, which have their own and relatively low tax deductible thresholds? Or, conversely, if political lobbying or campaigning should have tax benefits for charities, then why not for everyone else as well? If it is okay for koalas and the homeless, why isn't it okay for sugar farmers or small business men?


An even more ambiguous case than merely lobbying is campaigning at election time. This seems to be particularly common in my home state of Queensland, where charities and other groups enjoying favourable tax status, such as the Wilderness Society, have on many occasions in recent years produced and distributed election material, including how-to-vote cards, aiming to boost the Australian Greens or the Labor Party or at least diminish the coalition vote. That is what they have done with the tax benefits that they receive. This is not what a majority of people imagine charities do or should be doing. The courts and the bureaucracies, however, have been quite liberal in reinterpreting the definition of charitable purpose, as well as expanding the scope of other activities that charities can engage in without losing those particular tax benefits. We might ask, however, is it good public policy? We might want to ask ourselves that question. Should the taxpayers really be subsidising political lobbying and political campaigning? What makes charities so special that they should enjoy this privilege and benefit, which is not available to anyone else in our society except, to some extent, to political parties? Are some charities in reality merely associated entities of political parties? Are not the tax benefits granted to charities in recognition of the value of services and actual tangible support delivered to those actually in need? Should then these tax benefits be available to self-proclaimed charities which do not actually do anything directly to help, but merely write press releases and lobby politicians? Is that appropriate? We need these sorts of questions debated, and sooner rather than later actually answered—one day soon. 


As any questioning of the status quo invariably attracts a howl of indignation about the evil Liberals trying to stifle debate and silence dissent, let me repeat that the debate is not whether charities have the right to express their opinion or to lobby. Yes, they do. I make that very clear. Of course they do. The debate is whether some of them should enjoy a special tax status, not available to anyone else, if their supposedly charitable work consists mainly in expressing opinion or lobbying. That is the question. 


The coalition opposes the current bill because it ends up burying civil society in red tape. I do hope, however, that future governments will find time to address the problem of politicised charities. Way back in 2004 I made a few comments and they are still relevant today. I said that the taxpayers of Australia are owed some answers regarding the activities of organisations such as the Wilderness Society. But also, just as importantly, we owe it to other charities and groups enjoying tax deductible status, who quietly go about their work of helping others without involving themselves in the rough and tumble of politics, to ensure that charities, which as a general rule do so much good in our society, are not tarnished in the public's eye by the misdeeds of a few political wolves in charity sheep's clothing. If the coalition wins the next election, I do hope we address this issue, which gnaws at the credibility and public acceptance of the status and benefits which we bestow very willingly on our charities.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:41):  I too rise today to make a contribution to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012. The not-for-profit sector plays a vital role in the Australian community by providing support and assistance of some of the most vulnerable people whilst also supporting a number of issues-based causes that might not otherwise receive advocacy. The government values the important work provided by the not-for-profit sector in building social capital and helping to make stronger communities. That is why we want to ensure that we provide appropriate support to allow the sector to grow and flourish into the future.


Our commitment to reform of the not-for-profit sector began at the 2010 federal election when we announced that we would introduce the most extensive national reforms the sector has ever seen. The introduction of this bill is the culmination of delivering these reforms. They will support the sector and build upon the announcement that we made in the 2011-12 budget that the government would deliver these series of reforms to strengthen and support the sector, to ensure its sustainability into the future. We are doing this because over the past 17 years there have been a number of reviews looking into the not-for-profit sector. These include a comprehensive 2001 report of the Inquiry into the Definition of Charities and Related Organisations, the 2009 review into Australia's Future Tax System and the 2010 Productivity Commission report into the contribution of the not-for-profit sector. There has also been a number of parliamentary inquiries which have encompassed this issue. Together, these reviews and inquiries have identified the need to establish a single national regulator to simplify and reduce regulation for the not-for-profit sector.


The not-for-profit sector is made up of a wide range of organisations which range from small sports clubs right up to multinational charitable organisations. Due to the important role all these different charitable entities play in Australian society, the not-for-profit sector receives a wide range of support, including funding, donations from members of the public and tax concessions, grants and other support from local, state and federal governments. So the government wants to ensure that there is a strong regulatory system that helps deliver good governance, accountability and transparency in the not-for-profit sector.


Which brings us to the government's introduction of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012, which delivers on the outcomes raised by the reviews I mentioned earlier by establishing a national regulator and a national regulatory framework for the not-for-profit sector. The Assistant Treasurer, David Bradbury, is on record outlining the aims of the ACNC bills. There are three objectives. The first is to maintain, protect and enhance public trust and confidence in the not-for-profit sector. The second objective is to support and sustain a robust, vibrant, independent and innovative not-for-profit sector. The third objective underlines the important role that the ACNC will have to promote the reduction of unnecessary regulatory obligations on the not-for-profit sector.


A number of features of the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 will establish the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission which, as I have said, is the ACNC; it will give authority for the ACNC to register not-for-profit entities; and it will maintain a register of these organisations. It will provide the powers for the commissioner in relation to the regulation of these registered entities. It also sets out the obligations and duties of these registered entities.


I will just take a moment to examine in a little more detail some of these aspects of the bill. From the beginning of the bill, only tax endorsed charities will be regulated by the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission; however, the bill establishes a regulatory framework to ensure that it can be extended to all not-for-profit entities in the future.


To register with the ACNC, and maintain registration, charities will apply directly to the commission and operate consistently with the definition of a charity, whilst also complying with prescribed registration conditions and requirements. The ACNC will also have the role to work with the not-for-profit sector to help provide education and guidance on their participation in the national regulatory framework.


The bill will establish an online, publically-available information register containing the details of the charities registered with the ACNC which, of course, is a very important reform. This register will be able to be accessed easily by the public to ensure that donors and volunteers will be able to rely on the information provided to help them make decisions as to whether to volunteer or donate to a registered charity. I know that is something that will ensure that life is much easier for those who are operating in this sector; there will be a one-stop shop so people will be able to access information about their organisation publicly and make an informed decision.


The bill will create the Office of the Commissioner of the ACNC. The commissioner will have the role to maintain general administration of the ACNC legislation and will have the power to register not-for-profit entities, and the legislation will provide the commissioner with the processes and grounds for revocation of the registration of a charitable organisational. Through this legislation the ACNC will also be required to report annually to parliament on its progress on red tape reduction. That is one of the issues that was raised by many of the submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this piece of legislation—the need for a reduction of red tape. The fact is that through this legislation, the commissioner, through the office of the commissioner will have to report its progress on reducing red tape for the not-for-profit sector.


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee held an inquiry into this bill, and arising from the report the government has made a number of amendments to the bill. At our hearing, and through submissions, the committee heard that many in the sector wanted the government to ensure that this bill did not restrict the independence of charitable organisations. As outlined in the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report:


The committee believes the fostering of an independent not-for-profit sector is essential, and supports this as an object of the Bill. Gag clauses are an objectionable feature of contracts with not-for-profit entities. They are particularly inappropriate in those contexts where a monopsony exists: where the government offering the contract is the only purchaser of services. The committee believes such clauses should not be introduced.


I am pleased to say that through ongoing consultations the government has been conducting with the not-for-profit-sector, and after receiving the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report, the government has made amendments to this bill to ensure the independence of the not-for-profit-sector.


The government has also announced that the legislation will be reviewed after five years to ensure that the ACNC is operating as expected and to see how the objects of the bill have been achieved—in particular the elements designed to reduce the unnecessary regulation on the not-for-profit sector. As I have said previously, this is a very important aspect for the not-for-profit sector.


The federal government will also be negotiating with the states and territories on national regulation for the not-for-profit sector because we recognise that the greatest reduction in red tape for the sector can only be achieved with national coordination. On 17 October 2012 the government announced further changes to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission that will see further reductions in red tape for the not-for-profit sector after the changes to grant guidelines. The government will be amending the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines to support the implementation of a 'report once, use often' reporting framework for the not-for-profit sector—again, another important measure. Once established, the ACNC will help reduce the regulatory burden, which can be quite onerous, imposed on the not-for-profit sector. The introduction of the 'report once, use often' reporting framework will essentially mean that Australian charities will not have to provide the same information repeatedly to the government. This is an important step to help reduce the regulatory burden on the sector and allows them to get on with the job of helping those who are most vulnerable in our community. If we can put in place measures that deliver good accountability, transparency and oversight of the not-for-profit sector whilst also reducing the regulatory compliance of charitable organisations, allowing them to improve the effectiveness of the services they deliver, then this can only be a good thing for the sector.


In closing, I am pleased that the government is enacting a commitment made at the last federal election and then built upon in the 2011-12 budget to simplify the regulatory burden of the not-for-profit sector by introducing a one-stop shop. The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission has been a long time coming. The need for this commission has been long identified through a number of reports over the past 17 years, so this bill, I believe, is a step in the right direction.


I also think it is important that we acknowledge Senator Ursula Stephens's role and the huge amount of work she has done in this area. I would also like to acknowledge the Assistant Treasurer, David Bradbury, who, through consultation with the sector and after receiving the Senate Community Affairs Committee report into this legislation, has made a number of amendments. These amendments address a number of concerns raised by the sector and the Community Affairs Committee, and ultimately help strengthen the bill. This bill will go a long way to supporting the not-for-profit sector now and ensuring that it is sustainable into the future and I commend the bills to the chamber.

Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (13:55):  The coalition will be opposing these two bills, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill 2012 and the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2012. When the legislation was first mooted, I went looking for the examples of charity fraud that would require legislation of this depth and breadth. Where were the cases involving billions of dollars being scammed and defrauded out of charities? Where were the cases of the boards and governance in charity groups deliberately siphoning off funds to terrorist organisations or to tax havens? There must be of course billions of dollars going into this area in the same way as we have seen fraud and poor governance in organisations like Trio Capital, Storm Financial and dozens of others that have required the strengthening of our governance rules with regards to corporations and investment funds. So there must be millions of dollars being scammed off all over the place in terms of charities or there would be no need for legislation of this magnitude and at this cost.


Of course there is not. There is the odd case of a problem gambler who has defrauded the organisation they work for. There certainly have been some interesting investigations undertaken by ASIO and others into how some groups are functioning. But we do not have an endemic problem within the functioning and the governance of their charity organisations.


Once again we have the ridiculous situation of this government announcing its reform, which will involve all the states and territories agreeing to hand over their power of course, and then telling us after the bills have passed that that is when they will go and check if the states and territories think they would like to hand over the legislation. Many, many small charities are more than ably governed by the current state and territory bodies and should remain so, except for the empire-building delusions of the government. 


For example, let us look at one of the proposed amendments to this bill being put by Senator Xenophon. The bill of course is called the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill and it will set up an Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Yet one of the amendments being proposed is that we actually come up with a definition of charities. Wouldn't that be nice? No, no, let us set up the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission and then decide what the definition of charities is and what the definition of not-for-profit is, and then we will go and ask the states and territories whether they agree to it. We will do all of that later, having invested millions of dollars in the establishment of the commission and in getting staff involved in the commission. It is another complete bungle of empire building by this government, which will achieve nothing except extra red tape and extra cost. We are not in any way persuaded by the government's argument that this is true reform. It is not. Certainly there is nothing to suggest that what this government is proposing to do will improve in any way the governance of charities in Australia. As I said, there is no overwhelming evidence to suggest that there is overall poor governance in this sector. Certainly, there are lots of volunteers doing their very best, and there may be some ignorance of governance, but in no way is it dishonest, fraudulent behaviour.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either an answer or an explanation..


The minister has failed to provide either an answer or an explanation, so I move this motion given that his office was called this morning and at the last sitting his office was contacted.


As the chamber is aware, Victorian communities were severely impacted by flood events in December 2011 and February, March and June of this year. For many it was and still remains a very difficult time. The process of recovery—our Queensland colleagues will agree with this—has been a long and arduous journey. For 20 of the local government areas hit by floods in my home state of Victoria, recovery and re-establishment efforts have been increasingly stressful due to inaction by this government. Despite repeated submissions from the Victorian government, who have willingly met all requests for additional information and stand ready to deliver their 50 per cent contribution surrounding category C national disaster relief recovery arrangements funding, still there has been nothing from this government. Under this particular program, primary producers and businesses impacted by severe disaster events are eligible to up to $25,000 to aid recovery. Obviously these moneys are joint funded by state and Commonwealth government. To their absolute credit, the Victorian coalition government have put their money on the table for all these affected areas.


Since the floods, four of the 20 affected Victorian local government areas—Shepparton, Indigo, Moira and Towong—have been granted category C funding approval, and I welcome that decision. Some 769 category C grants have been approved for these four shires, giving us an indication of the extent of the damage inflicted. However, businesses and farming families in Mildura, Campaspe, Benalla, Wodonga, Wangaratta, Grampians, Pyrenees, Murrindindi, Macedon Ranges, Mansfield-Latrobe, Wellington, South Gippsland, East Gippsland, Alpine—I apologise for the length but you can see the extent of the problem, Mr Deputy President—Mitchell, Strathbogie, Whittlesea, Ballarat and Greater Bendigo shires have not been granted the same help yet their need is no less. I have been advised that more than 80 primary producers around Joel Joel were affected by the December 2011 floods with an estimated damage bill of $3.7 million, 400 kilometres of fencing destroyed and 1,500 head of sheep drowned. Thirteen hundred farmers have applied for category C assistance in the Gippsland region following their flood event.


There has been a change around how the government has been dealing with these criteria which is leading to frustration. I will quote from the Deputy Premier of Victoria, who raised this again in a grievance motion last week: 'Again the standards that have been set seem to exceed those that have applied historically. We have been asked to provide more information and we provided it ad nauseam.' They have had conversations, they have had letters. I quote again from the Deputy Premier: 'I say again that we have written letters, we have had the conversations, we have supplied the information, yet either we do not have the responses available or those responses that have come from the Commonwealth simply do not meet the demonstrated needs of the people who are seeking these grants.' 


Similarly, the minister's response to this question, put on notice a long time ago, reminded in the last sitting that we would be seeking a response from the Attorney-General, but still we are left waiting. I look forward to the minister representing the Attorney-General getting behind the people of Victoria affected by this flood. I think that the only conclusion, given the minister's answer, is that regional Victoria's flood affected communities will be paying the price for the desperate attempts by this government to find that wafer-thin surplus, and it is simply not good enough.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:09):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Brandis today relating to the Budget.


Since the 2010 election the centrepiece of this government's economic policy and fiscal policy has been to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13. That is the foundation of their economic credibility. There is no promise, there is no commitment, there is no assurance more fundamental than that reiterated again and again and again. One could be forgiven for being sceptical of that promise, given that not only has this government never produced a surplus budget but its four budgets for which we have the final budget outcome so far have consecutively produced the four greatest budget deficits in Australian history. So one might be sceptical of a government promising to produce a budget surplus when it has won the gold, silver, bronze and runner-up medals for the four worst budget deficits in Australian history. One might be sceptical of that but there can be no doubt about this: it has promised time and time again that bringing the budget back to surplus in 2012-13 was the foundation of its fiscal strategy.


I do not warrant the comprehensiveness of this research but I can tell you, Mr Deputy President, that since the beginning of 2011 we have found at least 30 separate occasions when the Prime Minister has promised that the 2012-13 budget would be brought back to surplus—at least 30 occasions. And in the same period the Treasurer, Mr Swan, so far as our research takes us, has promised on at least 15 occasions that the budget would be brought back to surplus. So, Mr Deputy President, even for a famously dishonest government you would think that no fewer than 45 separate promises in the space of 20 months would be enough to give you an indication of the government's intention. 


Yesterday in the House of Representatives the shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, asked the Prime Minister a direct question: does the Prime Minister stand by her promise to deliver a budget surplus this year? To nobody's surprise, there was a very rapid shifting ground on the part of the Prime Minister. In the space of a column and a half recorded in Hansard, the Prime Minister waffled, the Prime Minister procrastinated, the Prime Minister stonewalled, but never was she prepared to reiterate what she has said more than 30 times since the beginning of last year, that the government promised to bring the budget back to surplus. 


It might be that the Prime Minister was distracted by the manifold scandals surrounding her government. Maybe she was not concentrating. So we thought that today we would give her Finance Minister, Senator Penny Wong, the opportunity to set the record straight. I asked Senator Penny Wong the very same question that Mr Hockey in another place asked the Prime Minister yesterday: does the government still promise to bring the budget back to surplus by 2012-13? But not a promise, not a forecast. So I asked her again in the first supplementary and I asked her again in the second supplementary, and on each of those three occasions it reminded me of chapter 36 of the Gospel according to St Matthew when St Peter denied Christ thrice. 


On three occasions—three out of three—given the opportunity to reaffirm the promise that lies at the heart of this government's fiscal strategy, Senator Penny Wong resiled from repeating that promise. Thrice she denied it. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:14):  I am so pleased that Senator Brandis referred to the Bible in that statement because as I was listening to him pontificating about the process and reiterate the verb 'promise'—and I am sorry, I forgot to count how many times Senator Brandis said that; I will have to refer to Hansard, but I will say it was several times that Senator Brandis made that statement—I was actually thinking of Matthew. I do not often go off into the realms of biblical response, but I was thinking when he kept saying, 'How many times?' that Bible classes from school were going through my mind. How many times did they deny? It was just appropriate that in the end Senator Brandis went from his statements of promise into Matthew and talking directly from the Bible.


Senator Brandis also said that you could be cynical about statements in this place. Well, Mr Deputy President, you can be truly cynical in this place when anyone from either the opposition or the government looks across this chamber and demands a guarantee, because we well know that there is no way that anyone in this place can ever say, 'I guarantee this will happen'. What we can say, and what we have said, is that this government is committed to bring in the surplus.


If we go back and look at the process we see the fact that the government has committed to bring in a surplus in this financial year. When the Treasurer, with Senator Wong, brought down the MYEFO statements late last week that statement was made again: that this government has a commitment to bringing in a surplus in this year's budget and that we are moving in every way to respond to that commitment.


Today in her answers, Senator Wong responded to a number of questions about what was happening with MYEFO, the budget and also the mining resources tax. She talked about the efforts that the government has made. We pointed to the savings that came down in the statement last week; difficult savings identified across a range of departments. These were responding to what has happened not only to our economy but to the world economy in recent years. We pointed out the fact that from the time we drew up our original budget for 2012-13 there has been a significant reduction in income to the government.


We have actually stated what that reduction has been, through taxes raised and through the reduction in our minerals and resources areas. These were the figures on which our original budget statement was made and we then said at that stage that in maintaining our commitment to having a budget surplus this year we would have to make changes. That is why the midyear budget changes are announced. This is not something that this government has created; this is a system that has been in place in our financial system through many, many years. In terms of process: the government brings down a budget; we put forecasts in that budget about what we intend to do; in the midyear cycle we review what has happened—we go through what has happened to income and also to expenditure; and we make changes. That is why MYEFO exists.


We did say that we needed to make changes because the of the processes that had happened. There continues to be a commitment to working with our economy to have a budget surplus in this financial year. Those statements will continue to be made, and I am looking forward to hearing Senator Brandis coming back in times to come and saying how many times different statements will be made. We will have the answers; we will come back and say what we are doing as a responsible government in looking at what is happening in the economy to ensure that we are able to make a commitment to the Australian people that we are seeking to have a budget surplus.


So in terms of what the government has done: the minister responded in detail to questions. We have put out the information about where the cuts are going to be made. The challenge now of course is that the government has put out this process and we will have to come back to this place and have the debate to see whether the opposition will support the savings measures. That will be what will happen. We will see the debate then, and again we will see how any government is able to actually work with the economy when there is resistance from the opposition at every turn.


So, returning to Matthew: we will have to study our Bible to see what happens next, and the government will continue to do the job for which it was elected. We will continue looking at the budget. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-10-30,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:19):  I am following on from my colleague Senator Brandis, who put his argument so well about this proposed budget surplus in the future.


It was an honour just a couple of hours ago to have a chat to former Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, at the front of Parliament House, in relation to the men's sheds and the great work that he does with mental health. I said to Mr Kennett, 'I remember the days when you won government in Victoria, when the Labor Party under the Kirner-Cain government left the state broke'. There was a $60 billion debt, and Mr Kennett had to sell off electricity; $19 billion worth, and every cent used to retire debt.


At the same time, of course, the South Australian government went broke under Labor. So did the Western Australian government and the Tasmanian government. In the meantime, Canberra in those days—the late eighties and early nineties—was under the so-called careful financial watch of one Mr Paul Keating, who was borrowing around $10 billion a year. The legacy of Labor is to empty the bank account, and the amazing thing about it all was that a couple of years ago here was a government borrowing and spending and stimulating the economy while the Reserve Bank was doing what, Senator Bushby? Raising interest rates to slow the economy! That is like driving your car with your foot on the accelerator and pulling the handbrake on at the same time! We have a government borrowing money to a massive $256 billion of gross debt last Friday while the Reserve Bank is putting the brakes on the economy. How foolish is that? There would not be one economist in the world who would agree that that is good economic policy.


Following on from Senator Brandis, let me quote from Prime Minister Gillard in Hansard 11 May 2011:


As promised, we will return the budget to surplus in 2012-13.


On 11 May, again in Hansard, she said:


This budget is bringing the budget back into surplus in 2012-13—


There are some 30 quotes here from Prime Minister Gillard saying that there will be a budget surplus this year.


There is one thing you can rest assured of and that is that the election will be before mid-September next year, because in mid-September the true figures of this financial year's budget will be released. There will be no surplus. Even fudging the books, bringing $5 billion PAYG payments into this financial year will not save them. They will put on new taxes. We can go back through the luxury car tax, the alcopops tax, the cigarette tax, the flood tax, the carbon tax, the mineral resource rent tax—and it has been an absolute farce the way they have managed their budget with regards to that—there will be no budget surplus, and fudging the books will not fool the Australian people. 


This is the point—the Australian people do not trust this government. They do not trust this government to manage money. They do not trust this government to spend taxpayers' money and, sadly, borrowed money, wisely. So much has been wasted in stupid stimulus programs on school buildings and pink batts and in the meantime, when we really need some money for essential programs, the debt is so great now that money has been spent. There will be no budget surplus—




Senator Fifield:
  Under a government I lead!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  and I will take the interjection from my colleague Senator Fifield. There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead!




Senator Fifield:
  She got her lines mixed up!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  There will be no budget surplus under a government I lead! I can go back through my life from leaving school at the end of 1972 in Adelaide. Every state government led by Labor and every federal government led by Labor could not manage money. Every time the coalition was elected after a state or federal government changeover, what do they have: debt, debt, and more debt!


Look at Queensland. The $70-odd billion of debt is going be $85 billion by 2015 and $100 billion before 2020. There are 4½ million people in Queensland and they wonder why Premier Campbell Newman is making cuts. He has to make cuts or let his state go down the road of Greece, Portugal or Spain. You cannot do that. Likewise in New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell inherited a mess, a $5 billion black hole and a huge debt. This government will keep wasting, they will keep borrowing, and we will never see black print at the end of a budget. That is why we will have an election before mid-September next year, to save the embarrassment of more debt.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (15:25):  I rise to take note of the answer from Minister Wong on the Labor government's budget management record. Before Senator Williams leaves the chamber, I remind him that before he starts talking about the Tasmanian government being in debt, he should get his facts correct. In 1989-92 the Labor government was actually paying off the debt that was left by the Liberal government in Tasmania at that time. 


Economic management has been one of the highlights of this Labor government. This Labor government is getting on with the job of managing the Australian economy. Everyone in this place knows the tremendous job we did throughout the global financial crisis where Labor's fast, targeted action to stimulate the economy has seen our economy now 10 per cent larger than before the GFC. While many advanced economies are still smaller than they were before global crisis, Australia has come out of the worst financial hit since the Great Depression with an economy that is growing at a good level. As Minister Wong said during question time today, Labor is committed to doing what is required to grow our economy and we have delivered a midyear budget update that brings the budget back to a surplus. Australia has an unemployment rate that is lower and an inflation rate that is low, and this responsible fiscal management gives the Reserve Bank room to lower interest rates, if it decides to.


And let us not forget that we have continued to move Australia forward while ridding our workplaces of that torrid industrial relations relic, Work Choices, that torrid system where more than four million workers lost basic protections. They were just gone.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order of relevance. This is about Senator Wong's answer to my question which was specifically about the budget surplus, and more specifically about whether that statement is any longer a promise. That is the only thing the question was directed to. I know that there is a reasonable latitude given in these debates but to talk about industrial relations policy of a previous government has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the question.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Thank you, Senator Brandis.




Senator Wong:
  On the point of order, I would remind the good senator of the content, for example, of Senator Williams's contribution, which did traverse in lengthy detail his memory of Labor governments past and former Premier Jeff Kennett. I know that Senator Brandis has a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to points of order on relevance but I humbly suggest that it is really not apposite on this occasion.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Thank you, Senator Wong. I was going to rule that Senator Urquhart is relevant in the context of the debate. Senator Urquhart you have the call.




Senator URQUHART:
  Obviously Work Choices is a very sore point with the opposition. A generation of workers who entered that system were vulnerable, and those young workers who were not aware of their rights, Australians who did not have experience to fall back on, were the worst affected. Labor has repealed Work Choices and brought Australia through the worst financial shock since the Great Depression with an economy that is growing. Labor is managing that economy in a much more responsible manner than those opposite did.


How do we know this? We know this because the Labor government has received a triple-A credit rating from all three rating agencies, a rating that those opposite could not achieve while in government. Under Labor, Australia sits with just six other countries in the world with top credit ratings, and doesn't that touched a nerve with those opposite! The facts show that Labor is actually the more fiscally responsible party, the better managers of the economy, insofar as job creation through the global financial crisis, the worst financial shock to the world economy since the Great Depression, and because we are actually a lower taxing government than those opposite were. 


A great fact that those opposite wish they could escape is that tax as a proportion of GDP under Labor is lower than it was under the previous coalition government. Former Prime Minister Howard and his Treasurer Costello presided over what was in fact the highest taxing government in memory. We are doing more with what we have been given than those opposite could have dreamt of doing, and we are doing it while keeping our focus on the changes needed to keep Australia competitive going forward. We put a price on carbon, the price that those opposite have almost forgotten about because it did not come with the big shock that they were so hoping it would. We are building the NBN that those opposite have opposed all the way—a network that will connect all Australians with superfast broadband, enabling more efficient provision of health and education services, as well as opening up endless opportunities for businesses. We are increasing retirement savings through superannuation reforms and boosts to the pension, whilst—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Urquhart, whilst I ruled earlier that you were within the context of the debate, you are now straying a fair way off the mark. I will just bring you back to the substance of the debate.




Senator URQUHART:
  I will bring it back; I intended to do that. We have not run out of steam yet. We have comprehensive policy agendas across whole of government, with plans to make Australia a fairer and better place to grow up, work, raise a family and age well in.


Just this week, this Labor government has released its comprehensive Asian century white paper, and that is a framework for Australia to emerge stronger over the decades ahead by taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Asian century. Australians look at this government's forward agenda and see a group wanting to take on the tough challenges. They see a government that has repealed that industrial relations relic, Work Choices, and a government that is committed to responsible budget management and has clear plans for Australia's future. They also see an opposition with no vision for our country's future, and that is evident today in this debate.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:31):  A number of years ago, the member for North Sydney, the honourable Joe Hockey, predicted that this current Labor government, the combined Rudd-Gillard government, would never deliver a surplus. Indeed, the record shows at this point that they have failed dismally in that regard. I think in the first budget they handed down they actually predicted a surplus, but when the actual figures came in that went on to be one of the four largest deficits that this country has ever seen. Indeed, the four largest deficits that this country has ever seen were in fact the first four budgets that this Labor government actually delivered. I am not talking about what they handed down on budget night. I am talking about what the actual figures showed when the final accounts for each of those financial years came in. That is despite predicting a surplus when they handed down their first budget. The current budget they handed down this year, also predicting a surplus, will also end up in deficit. Just as an interesting historical note, the four largest surpluses that were ever delivered in this country were actually delivered in the last four years of the Howard government. It makes for an interesting contrast.


Senator Moore stood up here earlier and said there is no way the government could stand up and make a promise that there would be a surplus delivered and that the best they could do was provide a commitment that they are working towards a surplus. That is actually true because it is not possible to take account of the vagaries of what might happen in international developments and even domestic developments and how that might play out on taxes and expenditure. But this is exactly the point we are making. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer on numerous occasions—and Senator Brandis outlined some of those when he was speaking—have promised that they will deliver a surplus. That first occurred with the Treasurer, I suspect, in response to those comments that the member for North Sydney was making when he raised the likelihood that this government would never deliver a surplus. I suspect the Treasurer and the government of the day felt a political need to go out and say they would deliver one. So they nominated a date when they thought they could do it, and that was the 2012-13 year.


But the reality is that, since then, things have changed. As Senator Moore noted, circumstances do change, and it has put them in a little bit of a political tight spot because the reality of being able to deliver that surplus has got harder and harder as they have gone on. It is instructive to look at what happened in the last financial year before we transfer that on to what might happen this financial year. Two years ago, Wayne Swan predicted that the budget would run at a deficit of $12.3 billion for the 2011-12 year, which is the year that has just ended. Two years ago he said, 'We will be looking at a deficit of $12.3 billion for the 2011-12 year.' But when the budget for the 2011-12 year was released six months later, that $12.3 billion that they were predicting then had blown out to almost double that at $22.6 billion. In December of 2011, that figure had climbed from $22.6 billion to $37.1 billion in deficit. So it was $12.3 billion when he first mentioned it, it went to $22.6 billion in the budget and then it went to a $37.1 billion deficit by the time of MYEFO in December last year. The final figure in August this year was $43.7 billion. So we have gone from $12.3 billion to $22.6 billion to $37 billion to $43.7 billion over the course of about 18 months in predictions. I think that is instructive of the challenges the government is facing by having put itself in the position two years ago where it promised that it would deliver a surplus in the current financial year. The reality is that the underlying economic conditions that have led to the massive deterioration in the budget of the 2011-12 year have been at play in the figures and their forecast for the 2012-13 year. So the government has had to, as a result, perform more accounting tricks and more twists and turns than you would see at the Moscow Circus.



Just looking most recently at MYEFO, even the timing of the release of MYEFO is enough to raise eyebrows as it is the first MYEFO that has been released in the month of October where we did not have a federal election the following month. You could suspect that maybe we are going to have an election in the following month, but I think that is probably unlikely, although not completely out of the question. The only other alternative for bringing it forward and releasing MYEFO so early is that the Treasury was trying to deceive the public by reporting the figures before they became even worse.

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:41):  I seek leave to move a motion relating to the death of former member of the House of Representatives and minister the Honourable Gordon Neil Bilney.


Leave granted.




Senator CHRIS EVANS:
  I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 28 October 2012, of the Honourable Gordon Neil Bilney, former Minister and Member for Kingston, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


I served for a very short time with Gordon Neil Bilney in this parliament. He was a great Labor character, and he was much admired across the parliament. Gordon Neil Bilney was born in Renmark, South Australia, on 21 June 1939, the son of Neil and Elaine Bilney. He attended school in Adelaide at Marryatville Primary School, Prince Alfred College and Norwood High School. Gordon then studied Dentistry at the University of Adelaide and graduated in 1961.


However, a lifetime as a dentist did not appeal to Gordon, and he went back to university to study for an Arts degree, graduating with honours in 1965. He joined the Australian diplomatic service in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1966. During his lengthy career in the service, he was posted to Jakarta, Manila, Geneva and Paris and represented Australia as a member of the Australian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1972.


His diplomatic career was paused in 1973, when he joined the Prime Minister's staff as private secretary. At this time, the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, also held the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. This was a reforming time for the first Whitlam government. Gordon was associated with the recognition of the People's Republic of China, the abolition of conscription and the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam. When Whitlam relinquished the Foreign Affairs portfolio to the great Western Australian Senator Don Willesee, Gordon moved to Willesee's office. After the dramatic dismissal of the Whitlam Government in November 1975, Gordon returned to the Department of Foreign Affairs—to the OECD and EEC branches successively.


In 1980 he was appointed Australia's High Commissioner to Jamaica, a position he would hold until 1982. But his interest in and love of politics saw him return to the centre of Australian politics by successfully contesting the marginal Adelaide electorate of Kingston at the 1983 election, which was of course the year that Bob Hawke was elected with a very large majority. Gordon was re-elected a further four times in the seat of Kingston, holding the seat until the Keating government left office in 1996. His greatest electoral challenge came in 1990, when the high-profile leader of the Australian Democrats, Janine Haines, chose his electorate of Kingston as part of her tilt to have Democrat representation in the lower house. Gordon survived that challenge and retained the seat.


Drawing on his vast experience in foreign affairs, he served the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the expanded Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade from 1983 until his appointment to the ministry in 1990. He was first appointed as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and in 1993, at a time when Australia was working for greater cooperation in our region, Prime Minister Keating appointed Gordon as the first Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs.


It is probably this period in the ministry for which Gordon is best remembered, and I know he will be affectionately remembered throughout the South Pacific, where he travelled regularly and was much loved and admired. He developed a great reputation as a person and a great reputation for Australia based on his work. He remarked that his appointment as the first minister for pacific island affairs indicated the Keating government's focus on Australia's relationship with its South Pacific island neighbours. It was a new beginning in Australia's relations with its near neighbours.


Continuing the Labor tradition of activism in foreign affairs and development, Gordon was pivotal in making substantial changes to our development programs. His reforms benefited women, with a doubling of aid for women in development projects and the lifting of the freeze to family planning assistance in Australia's aid program. He was also a strong advocate for Australia's role in providing aid assistance to South Africa during their transition from apartheid to democracy in the early 1990s. He was also responsible for mobilising Australian assistance after Papua New Guinea's devastating earthquake in 1993.


Anyone who knew him knew that he was a genuine character, both in public and in private. He was a master wordsmith with a quick and devastating wit. He was never short of a smile or an anecdote or two. He was just great company. As a proud South Australian, he shared two of that state's great passions, AFL football and South Australian red wine. Combining his love of words, humour and advocacy for a great bottle of red, Gordon achieved wide success with his fundraising campaigns. Senator Abetz may refer to this, but he assures me he did well on both sides of the parliament in selling his wine, so it must have been keenly priced and a good drop.


After the Keating government's defeat and Gordon's eventual electoral loss, Gordon was quoted as saying that the future would include some thinking about cooking and enjoying one of South Australia's 'gorgeous glasses of red'. He spent time after life in parliament fishing and playing chess, as well as still being active around the place. But after a combination of 16 years as a diplomat, 13 years as an MP and six years as a minister he probably enjoyed having the chance to be a little freer to speak his mind.


One of his notable contributions, which I think has been widely quoted in recent days, was in 1996, just after his loss at the polls, when he wrote the following letter to a local official in his former electorate:


I saw your letter today of 26 February. One of the great pleasures of private life is that I need no longer be polite to nincompoops, bigots, curmudgeons and twerps who infest local government bodies and committees such as yours. In the particular case of your committee, the pleasure is acute.


Wouldn't we all like to have written letters like that! Some people suggest senators are more likely to write them anyway, but I think it is a great reflection of the attitude of many retired politicians when presented with new freedoms. It also reflects his great sense of humour. I think from the Labor point of view people like him and John Button were great characters of the Labor Party during that period. While being effective politicians, they were also great human beings and great fun to be around.


He lived a full life and was very dedicated to his family. I am very pleased that Senator Don Farrell is going to speak, because Don knew him far better than I did and I am sure he will bring a more personal reflection. But, on behalf of the Senate, I extend our condolences to his wife, Sandy, his daughters and his extended family.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:50):  The Hon. Gordon Neil Bilney represented the seat of Kingston for our political opponents in the Australian Labor Party from the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983 to the defeat of the Keating Labor government in 1996. In many ways, arriving and departing with a Labor government, Mr Bilney was an exemplary Hawke-Keating minister. I am not one who is often given to quoting Alan Ramsey, but allow me to do so on this occasion. He described him as 'a free spirit of great style and wit'. The coalition members who knew him and who have spoken to me, and my own chief of staff, who recalls him from working in the office next door, would vouch for that description by Mr Ramsey.


There is no doubt that Mr Bilney's abiding calling was foreign affairs. He was in the Australian diplomatic service from 1966 to 1982, being stationed in Jakarta, Manila and Geneva. Previously he had served as private secretary to Prime Minister Whitlam with responsibility for foreign affairs. Prior to entering parliament he served as High Commissioner to the West Indies from 1980 to 1982. In 1993 he was made the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs—the first time a minister had been appointed to this role and a role he took to with great gusto.


Prior to entering parliament, he served as High Commissioner to the West Indies from 1980 to 1982. From 1990 to 1993, he was Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. In 1993 he was made the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs—the first time a minister had been appointed to this role, one he took to with gusto. 


He has been described to me as person of ruddy complexion, a tousle-haired fellow for whom coalition members had a deep and abiding affection. He clearly had great diplomatic skills. For a start, he managed to hold the marginal South Australian seat of Kingston for 13 years until swept out by the Howard landslide in 1996. For his 13 years in parliament he was aided by assiduous fundraising with sales of his Kingston shiraz.


Even more impressively, it is the view of some of the old timers in the coalition that much of the funds raised was money out of the wallets of Liberal Party and National Party members and staffers. In the temporary parliamentary annex built into the old House of Representatives rose garden, Mr Bilney plied a strong trade in Kingston shiraz. Many members and staffers eagerly awaited the arrival of each vintage.


 My staff member has described Mr Bilney as having a most endearing quality—that he was completely without cant. He spoke with a disarming honesty, directness and joviality, which made one instantly feel one was talking to an old and trusted friend. He was always good for a yarn and always offered his views on Labor colleagues and the Labor Party, but because of his disarming manner, nobody ever took advantage of Mr Bilney's forthright expression of his views. 


Many members on both sides of the parliament and former members will sadly miss Mr Bilney. Despite his Labor membership, he brought panache and warmth to this parliament. On behalf of the coalition, I extend our condolences on his passing to his partner and his two daughters.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (15:54):  I am very happy to speak in addition to Senator Evans and Senator Abetz about a man whom I would consider a friend. People have commented on his ruddiness. In fact, there is a photograph in the Australian today where you can see that ruddiness. I think it was Senator Abetz who referred to two of his favourite occupations after leaving parliament—drinking red wine and fishing. It is not quite clear from the photograph whether it was the red wine or the fishing which caused that ruddiness. Perhaps it was a combination of both. Of course, the red wine he would have been supplying to all members of the parliament would have come from that great wine area of McLaren Vale, from where some of the best reds come, particularly shiraz. 


He was a fine South Australian, who sadly passed away last Sunday at the age of 73. I was disappointed to hear that. I did not even know he was sick. I would have seen him at some point during the course of this year, so it was sad to hear of his passing. He was born in Renmark on the Murray River and, like me, came from the Murray community. He was an ordinary bloke who rose to be a foreign diplomat. Of course we are aware these days of politicians who have a background in foreign affairs. He might have been considered to be an earlier version of one of those.  He became a foreign diplomat, was an adviser to Gough Whitlam and a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments. He was renowned for his outspoken humour and a deep belief in ordinary people getting a decent go in life. As others have said, he was a dentist who changed careers to serve with the Australian Diplomatic Service from 1966 until 1982. He was deputy representative to the OECD and then High Commissioner to the West Indies. 


In that great wave of the Hawke era of 1983, Gordon was chosen by the Labor Party in a highly contested pre-selection contest. It is not just currently that we have deeply contested pre-selection contests; they even had them back in 1983. Gordon ran in the seat now occupied by that fantastic local member Amanda Rishworth and before her David Cox, both of whom very much relied on Gordon's always sage advice about how to win that seat, which often changes with government.


I cannot quite recall the candidate who ran against him in that pre-selection but I think it was John Lewin from the Australian Workers Union—I could be wrong about that. It was a bitterly contested pre-selection and how I came to first hear of Gordon Bilney was that Gough Whitlam, who by this time was out of parliament but still a great hero of the party, rang a fellow called Murray Glastonbury. Murray was an old stager from the Electrical Trades Union, a very wise and crafty fellow. Gough rang him seeking support for Gordon Bilney. I will not pretend to copy his voice; I will leave that to somebody like John Faulkner, but it was Gough on the phone. Murray was impressed by the fact that the former Prime Minister was ringing him, saying he was supporting this fellow Gordon Bilney. Murray said, 'I've never heard of this Gordon Bilney character. Where does he live?' Gough said, 'He lives in Kingston.' Murray said, 'I can't recall anybody by the name of Gordon Bilney who's connected with the Labor Party in the seat of Kingston.' Gough said, 'I'm not talking about Kingston in South Australia; I am talking about Kingston in Jamaica,' which of course was where Bilney was: he was a diplomat in Kingston, Jamaica, seeking preselection for this seat in South Australia. Most people considered that a pretty outrageous thing to do. Even now it could be considered an outrageous thing to do! But Gough held sway. He rang enough people, and Gordon won that preselection. He then continued to hold it, election after election, for the whole period of the Hawke-Keating government. That includes the difficult preselection where he beat the high-profile leader of the Australian Democrats, Janine Haines, in what was pretty much hand-to-hand combat through the streets of the seat of Kingston.


One of his great friends from South Australia was Chris Schacht, a fellow member of the Keating government. He records, in the Australian newspaper article I referred to earlier:


… he had a wonderful sense of humour; a dry sense of humour …


I think anybody who met him would know that. He would sometimes surprise you with a comment and you would think he was serious, but then you would suddenly realise he was just making fun of you.


Gordon was best known nationally for his roles as federal government Minister for Defence Science and Personnel from 1990 until 1993, and then as Minister for Development Co-operation and Pacific Island Affairs from 1993 to 1996. He was a prominent member of the political stage, but he never lost sight of the welfare of ordinary Australians. After he retired from politics, he continued to live in the seat of Kingston and continued to try and help people who he thought deserved his support. He did a range of other things in the course of his 13 years in parliament.


Having entered the parliament in 1983, he was successful in the 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993 elections, and as I mentioned before he held off a challenge from Janine Haines. He was a man of good humour, and the former Premier of South Australia, John Bannon, has described him as a man of very high intelligence with no self-importance. Anybody who met Gordon in a pub, in an airport or at a fundraiser for Amanda Rishworth or David Cox would know that was absolutely true. He was always a straight talker.


There is a story that one of his former employees, John Bistrovic, tells about him. It was in the lead-up to the 1996 election. He arranged to set up a stall at the Noarlunga Australia Day festival; he paid his fees and made all of the necessary arrangements. On the day of the festival, just before Prime Minister Keating called the 2 March election, Gordon's stall was covered with corflutes, standard election flyers, when someone from the festival committee asked him to remove the corflutes and the other paraphernalia, claiming that they were too political. He thought this was a rather bizarre situation, considering they allowed him to set up a stall knowing of course that he was a politician. Not wanting to cause an incident, he was happy to comply with their request but unfortunately lost the election. The letter that Senator Evans referred to was in response to that particular event, so I will not go through the words again; but that is how the letter came about, as a result of that.


It is very sad to see Gordon go. He was a fine fellow and always enjoyable company. He had that great sense of humour and he always had something very sensible to impart, particularly to young politicians at the time, like me. I express my condolences to Sandy Calhoun, his wife—a hell of a nice lady—and to his children, Caroline, Sarah and Nicholas. We shall not forget his contribution to the Australian parliament.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The aim of the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 is to reduce the activity of money laundering in gambling venues by amending the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006.


In September this year, journalists Chip Le Grand and Adam Shand from The Australian revealed that a Melbourne hotel had failed to act on suspicions of money laundering through its poker machines, even though there were records showing an individual and his family were claiming winnings of up to $40,000 per week.


Anyone who knows anything about poker machines will tell you these odds are impossible.


This article was only the most recent in a long history of stories and warnings about the vulnerabilities of poker machines to money launderers.


In 2010, Vanda Carson of the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that ""industry sources estimate that nearly $2 billion a year is laundered through hotel, club and casino poker machines and gambling chips. As much as 40 percent of this is laundered in New South Wales.""


Whilst that figure cannot be independently verified, it does highlight a systemic issue—the ease with which money can be laundered through poker machines.


According to the current laws, gambling venue owners are supposed to report suspicious transactions, but there is no legal obligation.


Usually, the most common way for criminals to launder money through the pokies is simply to load up the machine with a large amount of cash, play a few games and lose a small amount of money, and then cash out the remaining credits.


In New South Wales, for example, up to $10,000 can be loaded onto a machine at one time. If the amount is just under $10,000 it currently escapes the reporting requirements for AUSTRAC.


Depending on the regulations in each state, careful 'playing' can ensure the criminal walks out with thousands of dollars in 'clean' money.


A second option for criminals, usually used in combination with the first, is to wait around venues until a gambler wins a prize. Depending on the regulations, winnings over a certain amount are issued by cheque, to make sure that gamblers have a cooling-off period while the cheque processes, so they don't gamble their winnings.


Instead, criminals approach gamblers and offer to buy the cheques off them for cash (often at a discount), which the gambler can then immediately use to play. The launderers then cash the cheques, which have been signed over by the original claimant.


This bill aims to address both avenues through various measures.


Firstly, the bill inserts a new definition of 'gaming machine credit' to ensure that both winnings and unplayed credits are captured by the provisions in the bill.


Secondly, the bill inserts two new paragraphs into the definition of 'threshold transaction'. Under the Act, a threshold transaction is one that must be reported in the required form to AUSTRAC. This reporting usually includes relevant personal details and details of the transaction itself.


These two new paragraphs will mean that any payout of winnings or gaming machine credits totalling over $1,000 in a gambling venue will be a threshold transaction, and therefore reportable to AUSTRAC.


They also require the cashing of any cheque that is a payout from a gambling venue and where the cheque has been transferred to another person to be a threshold transaction.


It is important to note that the very nature of poker machines means this will not be an undue burden on venues. Poker machines rarely pay out in large amounts, and instead are generally programmed to provide smaller, interspersed wins in normal use.


Creating these two new definitions of threshold transactions will allow AUSTRAC access to information relating to large wins, and will show up particular patterns or habits that will be vital in the organisation’s crime prevention activities.


Thirdly, the bill also amends the Act so that the controller of a gaming machine venue will be considered to be providing a 'designated service' under the Act. This will mean controllers of gaming machine venues will be required to abide by the laws surrounding threshold transactions.


Lastly, the bill inserts a new subsection, which requires gaming machine venues to issue cheques for payouts of winnings or gaming machine credits over $1,000. The cheques must also indicate that they have been used for this purpose, so that they can be identified if signed over to another party. Failure to do so will result in two years' imprisonment or a fine of 120 penalty units.


Currently, poker machines are a soft target for money launderers. The ability to load them up with large amounts of cash, as well as the often lax regulations surrounding payouts, mean that launderers can, and do, take advantage of the system. The fact that no or very little face-to-face contact with staff is required also advantages criminals in these situations.


AUSTRAC already has regulations in place relating to some forms of gambling, including sports betting and casinos. These additional safeguards are a way to plug a loophole in the law, as well as protecting problem gamblers and venue owners.


Ultimately, poker machines cause enough harm in our communities without being a soft touch for crimes such as money laundering. This bill is an important step in reducing this risk.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:22):  Senator Fifield is noted for submitting great matters of public importance for discussion in the Senate and this is a particularly good one, as I am sure you recognise, Acting Deputy President. As I have said on a few occasions over the last couple of years, there is one thing worse than the Labor Party keeping its election promises. What is that?




Senator Williams:
  Not keeping them.




Senator MASON:
  Exactly. But even if the Labor Party keep their promises, their implementation is atrocious. The Achilles heel of the Australian Labor Party is their implementation. The list of failures is as long as it is shameful. In a way, some of it is mildly amusing, and it would be amusing if it had not cost the taxpayers billions of dollars and in the case of one program it cost a few lives. If the Senate needed an illustration, it need look no further than the recent Senate estimates hearings. My area of education was front and centre as an illustration. You will recall that we first had computers in schools. You have heard me on this before, arising from Kevin 07's election promise that laptop computers would be the toolbox of the 21st century. In the end they were delivered, though they may have cost several million dollars more. Of course they are obsolete now, and the program has no more legs. 


Putting that aside because I am in such a good mood, the problem was this: the schools have not been linked up to the NBN. The government made the promise that not only would this be delivered to high school students but they would be connected to the NBN or to high-speed digital transmission. Do you know how many have been connected after five years of Labor government? Ten out of 2,650 schools have now been connected to the NBN. That is the record of the Labor government. That is the so-called digital revolution. The revolution has fallen asleep. 


Who would be surprised at all about the pace of the rollout? The evidence at the recent estimates was that the government is signing up new customers to the NBN at the astonishing rate of five households per day. Given there are probably about 10 million households in this country, it will only take a couple of thousand years before they are all connected at that rate! I was just thinking, imagine if the Labor Party had put together the Overland Telegraph Line and it was their job to connect it up. After 150 years, they would not have reached Broken Hill! That is the sort of shambolic implementation we see from the Labor Party. 


You will recall that they made another big election promise—forget computers in schools and the digital revolution, for a second. What about trade training centres? What has happened after five years? We now know that 92 per cent of schools are still waiting. This was a signature Labor promise. Half the money is spent and only eight per cent of the centres have been delivered. 


If you think that is bad, far, far worse—and my friend Senator Scullion would agree with me—are the Indigenous boarding facilities. I hate to say this because I am having such a good time, but Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory aren't because five years after the election, five years after Minister Macklin made the promise, only one has actually been built. The other two that were promised have not even commenced work after five years. 


I am rebuked for talking about deadlines. We do not use the word 'deadlines' anymore with the Labor Party. We are not allowed to use the word 'deadlines' because that is too male, perhaps; we cannot say that. We cannot even use the word 'timetable'. I am not allowed to use the word 'timetable' when it comes to Indigenous boarding facilities. Do you know what I have to talk about now? Aspiration—no deadlines, no timetables just aspirations. It is all aspirational targets. The fact that only one boarding school has been delivered in five years—one out of three—is a failure of aspiration, not a failure in delivery. When I was young, I remember my mother saying to me, 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions.' Today with the Labor Party, the road to hell is paved with aspiration—not paved well, I might add; the work is always over budget and behind schedule. 


We are talking about education, just think about Gonski, which is central to education reform for the Labor Party and the government. You would think that after all this time there would be some funding model. What did we discover after estimates, Acting Deputy President? There is no funding model. There is no money to pay for it even if there was one, and there is no agreement with the states. Do you know what we do have, Acting Deputy President? We have an aspiration. 


The Prime Minister said at her address to the National Press Club that legislation will be introduced to parliament before the end of this year. She has about seven days left in the House of Representatives for the education act to be introduced. That act will not be about a funding model. It will not be about who pays for what. Do you know what the education act is going to be all about, Acting Deputy President? It is going to be about aspiration—yet again. There will be nothing about money and who pays for what or even what kids learn; it will be about aspiration. It will read like some United Nations declaration. It will be a matter of principle and heartfelt intuition, and aspiration. 


When looking back now over all of these years of sitting through estimates, as you and I so often have, Acting Deputy President Marshall, I still find it hard to believe that the Building the Education Revolution still keeps on giving. After all this time, 87 school halls still have not been completed—two years after the end of the program. It is the gift that keeps on giving. And we could go on. You might think I get some joy, Acting Deputy President, from this litany of failure. I get no joy, because too many billions of dollars of taxpayers' hard-earned money have been flushed down the fiscal toilet. I do not get any particular joy out of this.


The problem with the government is not that their ideas are necessarily bad. It is not that their aspirations are bad. It is that their capacity to implement them is so absolutely appalling. It is always like this: some bloke from the blue carpet down there has a brain snap, some great idea, the grander the better. It is always a grand idea, a 10-second media grab. It goes something like this: a computer for every student, a great grab; a hall for every school, another great grab; broadband for every Australian home, another great grab. But, of course, the work has not been done. No-one thinks through all of these issues. No-one costs them and no-one does feasibility studies or business cases. Figures are just plucked out of thin air, but it all sounds terribly good on the 6 pm news—that is the problem.


They have grand ideas, lovely rhetoric, but no implementation and no business case. Then they wonder, of course, why it all falls flat. If Labor had only learned from their mistakes. But, even yesterday, we had the Asian century white paper released. Again there is talk about putting five more Australian universities in the top 100. That is all very well. I love the aspiration. But that will cost, says Professor Milbourne, at least $10 billion more, and this at the same time that in MYEFO the government has cut research by $½ billion. It is all very well to talk about aspiration and rhetoric but, in the end, you have to deliver, and the great failure of this government has not been their ideas or even their policies; it has been their failure to implement them effectively.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:32):  It is easy to stand here today and refute these allegations in this matter of public importance. If I can concentrate on some of the aspects that Senator Mason did, something I love talking about in this chamber is the Building the Education Revolution. I characterise it as this: new halls, libraries, science centres, undercover learning areas, performing arts buildings and kitchens, refurbished classrooms and Japanese gardens. Can you really describe—as do the opposition—those facilities, those initiatives, the advantages of them and how they will impact on our future generations of students—as waste or failure? We put $16.2 billion into that program, which is ensuring our children have the best education facilities money can buy, and those opposite are calling it waste.


I have been so privileged to be a duty senator for five duty seats—Longman, Dickson, Brisbane, Forde and Wright—and to have the opportunity to go to some of those openings—I think it is now somewhere in excess of 134—to officiate the opening of the Building the Education Revolution projects. Each school has generally built something different as a result of their desire and their consultation, generally with their parents and citizens associations—in some cases they have collaborated with the Catholic education system—and they have made amazing achievements.


Some of the schools I have visited can now fit their entire student body into one location. This kicked off their full assemblies, something they were never able to do before. Quite often I get comments from principals, teachers, students, parents and the P&Cs that they would have never been able to achieve these facilities through lamington drives or their other ways of raising money in the past. They would never have been able to get these facilities had it not been for a Labor government. It has been the biggest injection of funds into schools ever by a federal government.


One school built a language centre and a Zen garden to complement their Japanese students. They were also working with a local primary school, the University of Queensland and the Japanese consulate to give their students a boost in learning the language. We only just the other day released our white paper on the Asian century and what will happen in our schools in the future in providing these opportunities for people to learn another language. Another school on the Sunshine Coast ensured they had a nice big kitchen, and it was built into their hall to complement their federal government-funded Stephanie Alexander garden. This way the students could learn how to grow their own vegetables and use these fresh products to make healthy meals. You tell me if that is waste.


I have seen covered sporting facilities, where students can play sport or do HPE classes, rain, hail or shine. I have seen performing arts buildings where schools can now host their own musicals and plays. The possibilities are endless when it comes to these opportunities. The other added benefit of the Building the Education Revolution is the ability of communities to have access to some of these halls that schools have chosen to build. Karate classes, church groups and so on have come into the halls and had the opportunity to use them on the weekends or after school. I have spoken to parents, teachers and principals, and not one of them has indicated any negativity about the BER project—only those opposite.


As you know, Acting Deputy President Marshall, some of the opposition turn up—whether federal or, in my case the other day, one of the new LNP Queensland state members—and they will push you out of the way to get in the photograph. They cannot wait to be in the photograph about a project they condemned all the time. We just heard from Senator Mason, who was condemning the BER project, and the opposition voted against it. But there they are, pushing their way in and stumbling over each other to try and get into the photograph. The hypocrisy of this is stark. The hypocrisy of those opposite and from the other House turning up to be part of these photographs is unbelievable. And what did it do? It generated jobs, and certainly in those five duty seats that I indicated. Longman, Dickson, Brisbane, Forde and Wright—all those members have turned up on most occasions for the Building the Education Revolution openings.




Senator Williams:
  I didn't.




Senator FURNER:
  I know you did not—you are not a Queensland senator, that is why you were not there. That is quite easy to understand. In concentrating on jobs, I really want to crunch this reality: in the state of Queensland we have a situation where the new Premier up there is sacking 14,000 public servants—and that is just the tip of the iceberg. They are going to eliminate them off the face of the earth. But when it comes to jobs for the Liberal National Party in Queensland they focus quite squarely on jobs for the boys, like Michael Caltabiano, who is now facing possible criminal charges. They focused on him and made sure he had a job when they were recently elected.


What happened after that? Former DG Neil Scales was terminated as a result of one of those 14,000 jobs that the state government was going through. He was on $343,000 then, and was paid that as a result of his termination, only to be re-hired on $428,000. How do you figure that? It is just another example of the waste of money and of how they treat jobs in Queensland.


Then there is the arts minister's son, Ben Gommers, who was hired to work in the transport department, being investigated by the Crime and Misconduct Commission. Where is Minister for Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts Ros Bates when all this is going on? First it was annual leave, now it is sick leave—she is roaming around in shopping centres with an injured shoulder but nowhere to be seen when it comes to having to answer questions in the Queensland parliament about these atrocities. This is what the LNP government is about in Queensland—jobs for the boys, not jobs for our struggling workers who need them the most.


Focusing once again on the BER outcomes and concentrating on each of those areas: in the seat of Longman there was $94,344,435 spent on 122 projects; in the seat of Brisbane $81,959,700 was spent on 132 projects; in the seat of Forde $102 million was spent on 127 projects; in the seat of Wright $100 million was spent on 245 projects; and in the seat of Dickson $71 million was spent on 113 projects. That is just an example of what those opposite describe as waste—money in education for our future generation that will only benefit them as a result of getting that great initiative and that spending to ensure that they are best situated for the global situation into the future.


One of the Labor Party's core election commitments in 2007, and the crux of my decision to run in this place, was to abolish the Howard government's Work Choices and the unfair, entitlement-robbing industrial relations laws. We did this decisively, to make sure workers were treated fairly, had confidence and security in their workplaces and were not unfairly dismissed. We introduced unfair dismissal laws and we introduced an independent workplace relations tribunal, Fair Work Australia.


One thing we lead paramount on is fairness in the workplace and fairness overall. That is one thing the Labor Party stands for. That is where the divide is between us and those opposite. We believe in fairness while those opposite believe only in the example I gave of Queensland—creating jobs for the boys. This is where we differ—we have created 800,000 jobs since we were elected while those opposite are up there in Queensland with the LNP terminating 14,000 of them. It is the tip of the iceberg.


This government supports Australians at different stages of their lives. One prime example is that, not long ago, the Paid Parental Leave scheme was introduced by this Labor government. It is a proud and genuine scheme that will make sure that workers who are in times of need and giving birth to children have the opportunity to be protected and to have reasonable payment of wages paid to them at a time when they generally need it the most. Shortly, through the partner scheme, we will also be enabling partners to stay at home with their partner and new children for at least two weeks.


I do not have the opportunity to go through all our fantastic initiatives, but this is an example of what we have provided over our term in government and, certainly, since our last election in 2010, and we will continue the rollout of these fantastic initiatives.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (16:42):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. Ten minutes is nowhere near long enough to go through the systematic government waste and incompetence of the Rudd and Gillard governments. Ten minutes is nowhere near long enough to go through even the systematic government waste and incompetence exposed at Senate estimates in just the one committee that I intend to touch upon today—the Senate environment and communications committee—and the gross examples of waste and incompetence that were once again discovered, uncovered and discussed at those estimates hearings.


The gold medal winner of them all in the environment portfolio under this government is the Home Insulation Program. Nothing stands out more and nothing looks better in terms of waste from this government than how they failed in that Home Insulation Program—what would come to be known as the pink batts debacle. We discovered in estimates how much it cost—what the final tally was: $2.156 billion was spent over four years on installation costs and clean-up costs in this dodgy program that saw so much waste occurring around Australia and so many wasted taxpayer dollars. The pink batts disaster, announced in February 2009 and abandoned barely 12 months later, has left this multibillion-dollar legacy and has been linked to at least four deaths and more than 200 house fires. The program has also left behind some debts for the government—2,494 bad debts that this Labor government is still trying to chase, taxpayer money it has given to businesses and is now trying to get back because it was fraudulently claimed. These 2,494 bad debts total $34.5 million from the Home Insulation Program, and indeed the subsequent Insulation Industry Assistance Package, which was meant to be rectifying the problems, has itself left 58 bad debts totalling $5.45 million. It would be comical if it weren't so sad; it would be funny if it wasn't taxpayer money being wasted.


But what we have is a situation where even the clean-up went wrong and taxpayers have had to foot the bill and are left with bad debts. Such are the bad debts that the government is trying to chase that the Department of Environment and Climate Change have called in the debt collectors. They have engaged what they politely refer to as a 'mercantile agent' to try to recover some of the money that the government has handed out and now wants to claim back because it gave the money to people who should not have got it in the first place. Dun & Bradstreet now stand to charge the government to chase these bad debts to try to get back some of the taxpayer money. The Dun & Bradstreet website assures taxpayers and others who might want to engage them that their 'experienced team is committed to maximising your collections whilst ensuring that your customer relationships are maintained'. Here is a bit of advice for the government: firstly, I do not think you want to maintain relationships with the people who ripped your government and the taxpayers off for this money in the first place. Secondly, if Dun & Bradstreet are so good at managing to get money when it is needed, perhaps you should ask this company to collect your mining tax as well, because it does not seem to be going so well for the government on that front.


The Home Installation Program is but one. On a far greater scale of implications for the Australian economy is Labor's absolute incompetence when it comes to the management of its carbon tax. In the carbon tax we discover that the government has effectively outsourced this tax regime to Europe. The confirmation was given in Senate estimates that if Europe were to take steps for Europe to adopt a more ambitious target than it currently has, that would, all other things being equal, result in Australians paying a higher carbon tax. That means a policy taken in Brussels, made with European considerations in mind, would result in Australians paying more carbon tax. This is the type of madness this government has embarked upon. It has decided that if the government is not capable of making decisions itself it is happy to outsource those decisions to Europe.


Little wonder then that as a consequence of outsourcing the decision-making to Europe on the rate of Australia's carbon tax, the government cannot tell us what the carbon tax may be. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency could not tell us in estimates whether the $29 predicted in the forward estimates of the government would be accurate or even a best estimate. They pointedly refused to describe the government's own budget forward estimates as accurate or as a best estimate. Instead all we could get was that: 'In the current market the estimate is not implausible'. That is good to know about the budget forward estimates, isn't it? The budget forward estimates that this government is relying upon are 'not implausible'. That really provides a lot of confidence. Equally, when asked whether Senator Milne's prediction that the carbon price could, when linked with the European scheme, go to $50 in a few years, we were told that was 'not completely inconceivable'. Clearly Australians can have absolutely no confidence in what they will be paying as the carbon tax under this government, because $29 is 'not implausible' and $50 is 'not completely inconceivable'. Who knows what we will be paying? All that is clear is that Australians will most certainly be paying more under the carbon tax.


The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and the new Clean Energy Regulator are on a drive to increase workplace productivity. We discovered that the New Clean Energy Regulator, one of several new bureaucracies established to manage the carbon tax, have in setting up their new offices decided to undertake a measure of workplace productivity that is quite novel. They have installed eight Nespresso coffee machines at a cost of $20,175 to the taxpayer. The justification for this? According to the CEO:


That procurement was for eight machines which was one for each of the staff kitchens. We did that obviously to provide a level of staff amenity but also because we thought it would be beneficial for productivity for staff to be able to buy their coffee on the premises rather than go out of the building.


It is nice to know that the taxpayer is now footing the bill for coffee machines as productivity measures within the Public Service. However, the Clean Energy Regulator is but a small-time contributor when it comes to such measures, because the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research admitted to buying five $15,000 coffee machines at a total cost of $75,000. The advice to public servants looking to transfer between departments is if you want good coffee the department of industry, with its $15,000 coffee machines, is going to have better coffee than the Clean Energy Regulator who paid a paltry $20,000 for eight machines. Perhaps I should be applauding the Clean Energy Regulator on the efficiency of the purchase of those coffee machines.


I am sure the coffee will go nicely with the wine cabinet that is needed for the climate change department's new building. The new Nishi building in Canberra is receiving a $20.5 million taxpayer funded fit-out that comes complete with luxuries like a stainless steel wine cabinet. Apparently there was a need to accommodate either a wine fridge or a standard fridge in the executive dining room of the department's new digs. I trust they will be well enjoyed. Having new digs and dining rooms, of course, requires you to have kitchens. Luckily the government built some kitchens for the sole purpose of the climate change ads. They built kitchens at a cost of $79,700, although sadly they were fake kitchens. If they are hoping to be able to enjoy meals from these kitchens in the dining rooms with the coffee made by the coffee machines, the government will sadly be mistaken, because the $79,000 kitchens were fake kitchens. We hope that if the government are going to go on another multi-million dollar advertising spree at taxpayer expense that requires the use of kitchens they will still have these fake kitchens available to use.


I could go on, but what we see from this government is such waste that comes about every single estimates. This is why the Australian public have so little confidence in the government. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (16:52):  I have to say that I am fairly concerned today by the matter of public importance—and I am concerned because the opposition have fallen into this inescapable pit of negative language that they cannot crawl their way out of. Coming into this place, the only words that are uttered by those opposite are criticisms and pejoratives, and the same hollow catchphrases and the same empty, shallow rhetoric goes on day after day and week after week. The words fly out of the mouths of Senator Fifield, Senator Abetz and others opposite, and they do it in quite an authoritarian way. They speak of doom and destruction and of faceless union boogeymen that live under the bed. I have to say that it reminds me of that great poem 'We'll all be rooned', said Hanrahan. It is a great poem. To listen to those opposite, that is exactly how they go on.


They talk about waste and the way the government have allegedly wasted money. I remind all those opposite of Work Choices. How much did you guys waste on Work Choices? I am reminded about those mouse pads that were put out that were not even able to be used as landfill. So when you come in here you have to be careful about what you start carrying on about. Those opposite talk about Whyalla being wiped off the map by cobras, pythons, or octopus or whatever animal the Leader of the Opposition wants to use to mix into his metaphors. There are also quite a few three-word catchphrases the opposition's tactic committee has decided upon to try and impart a bit of fear in their fellow Australians, and those opposite come in here and repeat them robotically and ad nauseum—in fact, sometimes it is quite nauseous.


Why do they do that? We on this side know why they do it. They do it because they have no plans, they have no vision and they have no policy—and the only strategy they have is to oppose. They are still fairly embittered that they failed to form government in the other place and they come into this place and scream like banshees about waste and incompetence. I think that is why the Australian people are starting to switch off to them.


This government has made significant achievements in helping to support Australian workers and Australian families. Despite the assertion in today's MPI, the government's signature programs have not failed. We have introduced Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, allowing working parents the financial security to spend much more time at home with their new child. From 1 January next year, two weeks of Dad and Partner Pay will also be paid in addition to paid parental leave. We know how important it is to support Australian families, especially in those first few weeks and months after the birth of a new child.


We have introduced tax cuts for all Australian workers earning less than $80,000 a year, by lifting the tax-free threshold to $18,200. We have delivered around $47 billion in personal tax cuts. So a worker earning $50,000 is now paying over $2,000 less in income tax than they were before Labor came to office in 2007.


Previous speakers mentioned the roll-out of the National Broadband Network. Coming from Tasmania, I know it is a great thing, and I have yet to hear any Tasmanians grizzle about it—except those on the other side. The complaint I hear, if one can call it a complaint, is that they just want the rollout program to go a bit faster and to get to their areas a bit faster and to get the plan going a bit faster. I have to say that they really love it in Tasmania. Within three years Tasmania will be the first state to have the rollout completed.


The NBN is rolling out fibre optic cable to communities that until just recently have only had access to slow ADSL or even slower dial-up. We all know—even though those opposite deny it—that the NBN is allowing businesses, local governments, schools, hospitals and individuals in the home to connect, interact and conduct business in a way that has previously been impossible. And that will only improve over the years. We all know how fast technology is changing and, as that progresses, there will be more and more that people will be able to do with the NBN. The NBN is a nation-building project which will allow all Australians to take advantage of an increasingly interconnected future.


Despite claims by those opposite that the carbon price would have an 'unimaginable' impact on prices, the implementation has occurred as modelling predicted. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index rose by 1.4 per cent in the three months to September—compared to a 3.8 per cent increase when the coalition's GST came into effect in the September quarter of 2000. The opposition's climate action spokesman, Mr Hunt, has continued with the scare campaign by claiming the September quarter CPI increase was largely due to higher electricity prices. In fact, higher electricity prices contributed 0.3 percentage points of the 1.4 per cent CPI increase, less than a quarter of the CPI rise—and, of course, not all of this was due to the carbon price.


Treasury modelling shows the impact of the carbon price on household electricity bills averages around $3.30 per week—and the Gillard government is providing households $10.10 a week on average. The clean-energy future program is cutting pollution, investing in clean energy and protecting the environment by putting a price on carbon—without a wrecking ball, a python or a missing Whyalla in sight!


The new schoolkids bonus, which replaces the education tax refund, supports families at a rate of more than $400 for each child in primary school and more than $800 for each child in high school from 1 January 2013. This will make life so much easier for parents to meet the education costs of their children. We on this side understand the role that education plays in improving outcomes for our next generation. Despite the importance of this payment to Australian families, the Shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, has confirmed that a coalition government would scrap the schoolkids bonus. That is right: they would scrap the schoolkids bonus; they would slap in the face thousands of parents of school-age children.


The government have also delivered greater justice for Australia's lowest paid workers in a number of sectors. The government have issued new guidelines that will ensure cleaners working for government agencies will have their wages and conditions protected; we have delivered greater rights and protections for vulnerable textile, clothing and footwear outworkers; we are securing the future of shipping in Australia with greater opportunities for Australian seafarers and an increased number of Australian flagged vessels; and we have delivered a new road safety remuneration system for Australian trucking.


The Gillard government is committed to delivering 100 per cent of our share of the historic Fair Work Australia increases for social and community services workers. SACS workers will receive pay rises of between 23 and 45 per cent in nine instalments from December this year. This means that 150,000 of Australia's lowest paid workers, 120,000 of them women, who have been underpaid for years will finally get fair recompense for the work they do. And who has done that? We have done that—not those on the other side but people on this side. 


The Gillard government is investing $1 billion to deliver the first stage of a National Disability Insurance Scheme, beginning from July next year. The first stage will benefit about 20,000 people in five locations across the country, including in my home state of Tasmania. We are also working closely with state and territory governments and people with disability and their advocates to work out key issues such as assessment and eligibility. This will help prepare us as we work to make an NDIS a reality for all Australians. This is a vital program for all Australians, in particular those with disability, their families and carers.


In the minute or so that I have left, I would like to point out that the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook shows the Gillard government is on track to return the budget to surplus, and it shows again that the fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong, despite global turmoil. The responsible savings we have made since we were elected have also made room for true Labor reforms like the biggest increase to the age pension and paid parental leave. We are returning the budget to surplus despite global turbulence ripping almost $22 billion from government revenues. The ongoing tough times abroad reinforce that there is not a country in the world you would rather be in than Australia—something we can all be extremely proud of.


We have continued to find savings in a balanced and responsible way, doing everything we can to protect low- and middle-income families and the community's most vulnerable. The economic disturbances mean that we will have to find substantial savings to return the budget to surplus, but we remain committed to doing just that, because it is our best defence against global economic turbulence. Those on the other side know that. This government has delivered solid growth, low unemployment, strong investment and it has contained inflation—showing that our economy stands tall in the face of global economic challenges.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (17:02):  I was waiting for Senator Bilyk to cease her screeching. She comes into this place and says that she is sick of people screaming like banshees. You ought to listen to yourself, Senator Bilyk. Once again we have yet another one of the quota girls coming in here, preaching in unison, reading from the script—the same old script of lies and misrepresentation. Anyway, let me turn to the matter of public importance that is before us. 




Senator Bilyk:
  Whatever happened to solidarity among the sisterhood?




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Don't ever refer to me as the sisterhood, Senator Bilyk.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Bilyk, if you are going to interject you need to do it from your seat; but you shouldn't do it from your seat in any case.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Perhaps you can ask Senator Bilyk to come to order. She is getting a bit carried away.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think we should move on with the debate before us.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  The debate before us is in relation to the waste and mismanagement of the Australian Labor Party and their Greens alliance partners and how it is adding billions of dollars to what has already been wasted on failed schemes; plans that have gone absolutely, totally astray; and blatant, wanton misspending of taxpayers money with absolutely no regard whatsoever as to how the money is going to be paid back.


This is a government wallowing in red ink. Of course, the Australian Labor Party love red ink, because they have left a trail of it right across Australia at the state level where they have been ousted from power. Let us look at some examples of mismanagement and absolute wastage of money from the recent estimates hearings. Senator Furner was talking about Queensland. Perhaps he has not been to some of the places that I have been to. Let me give you an example, Senator Furner, and perhaps on your travels you might like to go and visit this place. It is in the seat of Flynn and it is a school hall that cannot be used. Do you know why it cannot be used? Because there are no toilets. So this green monstrosity just sits there, out in the back of nowhere, and it cannot be used. Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been wasted because it cannot be used, because there are no toilets in this place. To me, that is a very good example of what an absolute debacle the BER was. Other examples have been eloquently exemplified and articulated by Senator Mason. 


I now come to another example of waste and mismanagement which was given to us in estimates. Finally we started to see the cost of the protection racket for Mr Craig Thomson and the HSU investigation. I have of course traversed the innards of this scandalous and putrid episode in this government. Of course, now we know that Fair Work Australia has so far spent more than $1.8 million on outside legal and accounting advice for its investigation into the rorting of HSU funds: $1.3 million on external legal advice, $100,000 on external accounting advice, $430,000 on KPMG's review of the investigation, and, of course, the $1.8 million does not include the cost to taxpayers of Fair Work Australia's Federal Court action against Craig Thomson. That court action now follows Fair Work Australia findings that Mr Thomson has used HSU funds to pay for escort services and for other improper purposes.


I come to the Slipper matter and what was revealed at estimates last week. The Australian Government Solicitor admitted at estimates that there were 17 lawyers. Having been a former lawyer at the Australian Government Solicitor myself and having had a 20-year association with that office, as I said at estimates, I have never seen 17 lawyers working on a case at the Australian Government Solicitor's office. I will come to why that is the case. It was clear from the evidence that was given that the instructions in relation to this matter came directly from the Attorney-General, the quota girl in chief. The Australian Government Solicitor told us that, in addition to the 17 lawyers, there were also barristers. The bill was around $730,000, all for a case which finally settled for $50,000.


The revelations in the Senate last Tuesday evening show just how Nicola Roxon has acted in this matter. I have to question, as have other people questioned, the political instincts of Minister Roxon, the Attorney-General, which need to be curbed. She has done her high office, which ought to be respected, and her reputation no favours whatsoever. I quote from the Australian editorial of 18 October which says:


Ms Roxon has done her high office and her reputation no favours by becoming mired in the messy legal fallout of Mr Slipper's ghastly text messages that fit the definition of ""misogyny"" in any dictionary.


Clearly, the motivation for this was purely political, because it could not have been legal. I cannot see the legal advice that may have been given for this.


Ms Roxon sought to permanently stay Mr Ashby's claims four days after she was briefed on the lurid text messages, which, by the way, they had since May this year. It is very clear, and I think she has been damaged very much in relation to this matter. It is not surprising that we read about deep divisions. The Australian Financial Reviewof 18 October said:


Deep divisions have emerged in the federal government over the handling of the sexual harassment case against former speaker …with strong internal criticism of the role of Attorney-General Nicola Roxon.


Perhaps finally people have worked it out. After the disaster that this woman left in the department of health, now she is going to create a trail of disaster in the Attorney-General's Department as well.


Let's look at other examples—



Senator Polley interjecting—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, perhaps you could ask those women cackling over there to please cease their cackling because it is really quite annoying. If they want to make a decent contribution—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  If you are seeking protection of the chair, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, you will receive it. I require interjections to cease.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  You always tell me and others on this side to cease. Perhaps you might tell those opposite likewise to desist.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I just did that.




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  But I note there have been interjections from both sides. Now that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has brought that to my attention, I will not allow any interjections.



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS:
  That is right: she is not even doing it from her seat. Thank you, Senator Siewert.


In the time available, let me look at a couple of other things in relation to the costs. Defence officials confirmed at estimates that the $200 billion to $230 billion cost to buy the capabilities outlined in Labor's 2009 Defence white paper, Force 2030, is almost completely unfunded. In addition, the white paper promised three per cent real growth in funding every year to 2017-18 and 2.2 per cent real growth beyond that. Of course, these promises have fallen by the wayside, like many of the other things. Labor have siphoned off more than $25 billion from Defence, using the money to prop up their budget bottom line. Having said that, despite these cuts the Army has not been spared, because it will have to pay the carbon tax. The carbon tax is expected to cost the Army $20.3 million in increased energy costs.


I come to an item briefly in relation to the Pacific Highway. The duplication, from 2016 to 2020, will add at least $800 million to the cost of the project. The delay in the completion of the Pacific Highway will add those costs. Regarding asylum seekers, where do we start? The shambolic immigration system of this government has become an absolute policy failure. There was not just one policy failure. Who was the person who said 'one boat'? That is another policy failure. There have been thousands of policy failures by this government and the Prime Minister in this area.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-10-30,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (17:13):  Yet another matter of public importance from the opposition; yet another opposition own goal. Today's MPI is particularly embarrassing for the opposition, which was left to promote its own miserable efforts at Senate estimates, because, simply put, no media outlet was interested. With four days of hearings, eight committees in session and no distractions from the other side of the building as the House of Representatives was not sitting, there was a heaven-sent opportunity for a capable opposition—that is not the one across the chamber today, of course—to make some ground. No ground was made. No political benefit was achieved and no credit should go to anyone associated with such a miserable political failure.


Hit with the cold, hard reality that the opposition had bungled their way through a rolled-gold opportunity and had failed to score any political points at all in the media, Senator Abetz panicked. He tried to remind the media that the opposition were still breathing and that the wheels of the Senate estimates process were still turning. So what did he do? He put out a press release—I even have a copy of it here. It is about the coalition's work in estimates. Then, when still no media outlet would do the right thing by the opposition and pick up on all the hard work and tough, rigorous questions that they had asked, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate tried to save the day by misusing the MPI debate here in the Senate chamber as a way of talking up the opposition's Senate estimates work. It is a pity nobody had proofread the press release and it is really a pity that no-one had fact-checked the press release in Senator Abetz's name—what a pity, anyway, that they needed such an exercise in self-promotion in the first place.


Here it is. Under the breathless Liberal Party words 'See it and read it first', we have the headline 'Senate Estimates Committees—Labor's Waste and Mismanagement'. I hope that the written Hansard will accurately reflect the monstrous assault on traditional English grammar and usage that you find throughout this document. Could I request that the Liberal Party in future use appropriate tenses, proper punctuation and upper case letters when required and even try to put some verbs in some of the sentences in their press releases. After the mangled headline of this press release, the third sentence of the release grandly claims:


Here are just some examples of Labor waste and mismanagement which was uncovered by the Coalition this week during Senate Estimates.


And it went on, embarrassment after embarrassment.


I am reminded of a column by Verona Burgess in the Australian Financial Review. This was some time ago. Ms Burgess is, of course, acknowledged on all sides of politics as the foremost public commentator on the Senate estimates process. Let me quote for the benefit of all senators Ms Burgess's words. She quotes an old hand in this article, entitled 'Bruised Libs let rancour rule', who was talking about our friends on the other side of the chamber:


""They are disorganised, with no apparent leadership, no co-ordination, too individualistic, lots of wasted effort, poor timekeeping, meaning agencies had to drop off, [and] poor impact … [They used] bad tactics. Estimates is most effective when two or three co-ordinate an attack.""


Nothing has changed since those words were written in 2008. I found 2009's article, headed 'Opposition mud-throwing barely sticks', and 2010's article—and I commend these to the opposition: you read, you might learn—under the headline, 'Unruffled under estimates fire'. And so it goes on. Nothing has changed after 16 rounds of estimates. Since the Howard government lost office the opposition has simply failed to master the art of Senate estimates. The only mud the opposition has got to stick at estimates was on the Godwin Grech issue, and that mud they managed to stick on themselves. That takes some talent from the opposition—you have to give them marks for that. The only mud they managed to stick stuck all over them.


It is particularly galling, I must say, to see the opposition in their document attacking a great Labor reform like the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which I think will positively transform the disability care and support system in this country, a system that, I believe, for too long has been letting down people with disabilities, their families and their carers. That scheme will deliver a whole new approach to the way we provide immediate support to the disabled. It will continue to invest in the future for some of the most vulnerable members of our community. I am proud of that initiative and I was disappointed to see that included in this very partisan political attack from the opposition because I know many people in the community do really eagerly await the implementation of this scheme.


So it has come to this. The negativity of the opposition has plumbed new depths. They are not just opposed to taking action on climate change, Building the Education Revolution or providing high-speed broadband through the NBN. They are now against coffee machines for public servants. They are against Australia's ambassador to Rome having a place to sleep at night. They are against the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency procuring a bar fridge. We even heard them whingeing about the cost of their own policy, sending asylum seekers to Nauru.


And we now know all this thanks to the efforts of the opposition today because no media outlet would run the story for the and do the right thing by the opposition and report all this guff about their estimates achievements; we had to hear it from themselves. So even though no-one else believes it—no-one in the press gallery, no-one in the parliament, no-one in the public, no-one in the community—we now know, courtesy of today's MPI debate right here in the Senate chamber, that Senate estimates was a triumph for the Liberals. Thank you so much for informing us about that.


Let me say this. I have always said that it is a very sad indictment when politicians start to believe their own publicity. And it is an even sadder indictment when politicians start to believe their own lack of publicity.

Senator KROGER:
  I am appalled that Foreign Minister Carr sought to impugn the integrity and reputation of my family, my two sons, in answer to a question asked by Senator Abetz during question time today. Immediately after question time I called Senator Evans to seek an apology and I am disappointed to say that Senator Evans has not showed me the courtesy of returning my phone call. The coalition has asked questions in estimates and again today about what due diligence has been undertaken in ensuring that taxpayers' money has not been channelled through an organisation that is accused of having links with known terrorists. I am dumbstruck by the fact that Senator Carr seems to have the resources to trawl through my family and yet has not chosen to look at a disturbing video that has come to light that can be easily googled by any one of us or certainly by someone in his office. This is politics of the lowest order. 


My sons chose to spend a Christmas working voluntarily in a legitimate law firm in Israel putting together a class action for victims of crime. For the record, they had no involvement in the issue of the Union of Agricultural Work Committees. Yet the Foreign Minister chooses to mock their integrity. This is from a Foreign Minister whose own family have been subject to adverse media commentary and who, frankly, should know better. This behaviour reflects very poorly on him and he should have the decency to come into this place this afternoon, right now, and apologise.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (17:26):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


It has been a long time since we have heard anything from this government in relation to Australia's pulp and paper industry. It is interesting that this week, when the ForestWorks conference is on and representatives of the timber and paper industry are in town, Minister Combet has made a decision to make a ministerial statement. But you really wonder what the value of this statement actually is given the tawdry history of the way the government has managed this particular issue. The ministerial statement says in part:


In 2009, the government convened the Pulp and Paper Industry Strategy Group to undertake a strategic review of Australia's pulp and paper industry. 


I will come to the time lines around that later. The strategy group's report included a recommendation on the themes for innovation, investment and sustainable productivity. The government's response is on the website. It then goes on to talk about the establishment of a leadership group and the government's key announcement in the statement that was tabled in House of Representatives yesterday was the appointment of the advisory group to the manufacturing leaders group of Mr Michael O'Connor and Mr Jim Henneberry, who the statement says will play a key role in ensuring that the concerns of the pulp and paper industry are heard and considered in the development of our manufacturing industries. 


I have to say you really wonder what has been going on within government and what the government has been doing with its own appointment when on 11 October 2010 they appointed experts to guide pulp and paper industry development. So the government at that point in time put together a pulp and paper industry innovation council, to be chaired by Mr Steven Payne, head of the manufacturing division in his department, and appointing Mr Jim Henneberry from Australian Paper and Mr Michael O'Connor as the deputy chairs. There is no reference to that appointment or this committee that included a number of members from the paper industry, the union movement and the forest industry, back in 2010. It is my understanding that there is nothing happened or meetings held of that committee since. And so here we have, two years later, the appointment of two of the same personalities out of that committee to another group by the government.


When you go back and look at the history of this whole process, and the government's attitude to the pulp and paper industry, it is interesting to note that since 1998 the Labor Party has had a policy position which was promising a pulp and paper industry strategy, 'to devise growth strategies based on new investment and new innovation and a commitment to job opportunities,' and to base that strategy on the regional forest agreement. Now that has been the promise of the government since 1998. Yet in government, here we are in 2012 making two appointments to a group that reflect very much two appointments that were made to a similar group two years ago.


We go back to the outset of this process, where on 6 March 2009, in response to an announcement by Australian Paper that they were reviewing the operations of two paper mills on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Minister Carr and the member for Braddon, Mr Sidebottom, conducted a meeting in Melbourne. Minister Carr could not come to Tasmania to meet the locals; they all had to go to Melbourne to meet him. They announced, with great fanfare, that they would put together a pulp and paper strategy group—a reference group to review the industry.


The review and reference group was announced on 6 March by then Minister Carr and Mr Sidebottom. The press release that they put out said:


The strategy group will run in parallel with the current company review, which is intended to be completed by the end of June.


And also:


The review and the strategy group report will give government, the North-West Coast community and the industry a clearer understanding of where things are at and what the industry may need to sustain its future.


That was on 6 March 2009.


Three months later, we still did not have terms of reference for that group. On 20 March, when we made some inquiries through the minister's office, Minister Carr's office said that the terms of reference were still being decided. On 15 May we made further inquiries and Minister Carr's office said that the terms of reference, 'will be announced within two weeks'. On 11 June, Minister Carr's office told the media that there was no time frame for the terms of reference. The review being done by Australian Paper of their paper mills was almost over and the terms of reference had not even been announced.


Then on 12 June, Mr Sidebottom said, 'There is no connection between the Australian Paper review and the government process'. So, despite the initial announcement on 6 March saying that the strategy group would run in parallel with the current company review, by the time we got to 12 June, and no action out of the minister's office, Mr Sidebottom had to say that there was no connection between the Australian Paper review and the government process. What a complete and utter farce!


On 19 June, Minister Carr finally announced the terms of reference, with the review to be finalised by November 2009. In August the minister again claimed that the report would be finalised in November 2009. On 21 October Minister Carr said that the report would be finalised on 16 December. And on 16 December, Minister Carr announced that the report would be due by the end of March 2010. What a complete debacle! And the government wants us to think that they are serious about the pulp and paper industry.


On 20 April we finally got the report. By that time, Australian Paper had announced the fate of its mills in December 2009 and, as we said back in March, 'The way the government is going, Australian Paper will have made its decisions before the report comes out', and that is exactly what happened. And here we are in 2012, having released the report, and the one recommendation that the government has done anything about at all was the development of a pulp and paper industry innovation council to improve innovation.


That council was appointed in 2010. It has done nothing. And now, with the Forest Works Conference in town this week, we have Minister Combet coming out with an announcement to say, 'We are appointing Mr Jim Henneberry and Mr Michael O'Connor as co-chairs to provide advice to the manufacturing leaders group'. How can the pulp and paper industry in Australia have any confidence at all in the management of its industry by this government?


The two paper mills on the north-west coast of Tasmania have long since closed. They were supposed to use the process that the government set up to inform them, the community and the workers of how to move forward. It was a year later that the report finally became available, after a number of delays. Then we have this process where there has been no action for two years and suddenly we have two appointments that were mirror appointments of those made at this time in 2010, and we are supposed to believe that this government has plans, ideas and thoughts to take this industry forward. I do not see how anybody can have any confidence that that might be the case.

 (Queensland) (17:38):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report of the committee, Australia’s overseas representation––Punching below our weight?I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted. 




Senator MOORE:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


In doing so, I will be making a statement very similar, I believe, to that which was made by my comrade in the lower house. This report identifies a chronic underfunding of DFAT over the last three decades, which has resulted in a diplomatic network which is seriously deficient and does not reflect Australia's position within the G20 and OECD economies. Australia has the smallest diplomatic network of the G20 countries and sits at 25th in comparison with the 34 nations of the OECD, hence our title: Australia is clearly punching below its weight. 


Our committee has recommended in this report that the budget priority for overseas representation should be significantly raised because of the real benefits that accrue from diplomacy. In the medium term, Australia should substantially increase the number of its diplomatic posts by at least 20 posts to bring it to a level commensurate with its position within the G20 and OECD. 


In the longer term, funding to DFAT should be increased to a set percentage of gross domestic product sufficient to reflect Australia's standing as a middle power. There appears to be no overall strategy for Australia's diplomatic engagement with the world or any criteria for establishing, continuing or closing diplomatic posts. To address this deficiency the committee has recommended that the government produce a white paper to set the agenda for Australia's whole-of-government overseas representation.


Our committee has received DFAT's priorities for increasing Australia's diplomatic footprint should it receive increased funding and a number of suggestions from interested parties for opening new diplomatic posts in particular countries. The committee however has restricted itself to recommending that there should be additional posts in Asia, and in particular in China and Indonesia, and of course having the white paper and the review would lead to further discussion and perhaps decision.


The committee absolutely recognises the valuable activities undertaken abroad by Australia's representatives in promoting Australia's interests, promoting trade opportunities, and through providing consular assistance to Australians abroad. Many in this place have had the fortune to visit with diplomatic posts overseas and we always acknowledge the superb service and professionalism of those posts.


Our committee notes, however, that issues relating to the effect of recent funding cuts on overall effectiveness, resource allocation of any additional funding, and the number and performance of locally engaged staff would benefit from further examination. The committee has therefore recommended that there be an external review of DFAT to prepare it for the future and, hopefully, for the implementation of other recommendations in our report.


The committee has made a number of recommendations including: funding the ever-increasing demand for consular services from Australians who travel abroad in part from revenue sources such as increased passport fees and a small tiered levy structured to take into account those Australians who have taken out travel insurance or who are unable to obtain travel insurance; placing on the COAG agenda discussion of the location, coordination and effective use of state and Commonwealth trade representatives; the creation within AusAID of a mediation unit to reduce the potential need for aid and rebuilding assistance by preventing conflict; and establishing an office of e-diplomacy within DFAT to harness the potential and deal with the challenges of e-diplomacy particularly in light of the constantly evolving nature of this technology.


The operations of a diplomatic network are being challenged by a lack of funding, the growth and development of Australia's economy, the shift of global power towards Asia, the impact of technology and the rising importance of public diplomacy. This report along with recent reports by the Lowy Institute and the Asian century white paper highlight the urgent need to rebuild Australia's diplomatic network and enhance our independent international standing. We believe that our diplomatic network must be resourced to grow if Australia is again to punch above its weight in the world.


In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who provided submissions to the review and provided evidence at the public hearings. There is real interest, knowledge and concern in this country about this issue. Finally, I thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, and the secretariat in particular John Carter, Peter Kakogiannis, Jessica Butler and Sonya Gaspar. I commend this report to the Senate.

I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (CAPITAL GAINS TAX RELIEF AND OTHER EFFICIENCY MEASURES) BILL 2012


This Bill amends various superannuation laws to implement a range of improvements to Australia's superannuation laws.


Schedule 1 reinstates the temporary tax relief for merging superannuation funds with some modifications. The tax relief will permit eligible entities to roll-over unrealised gains or losses on revenue and capital assets and allow the transfer of realised revenue losses and capital losses. This will ensure that certain tax considerations are not an impediment to superannuation funds seeking to merge and consolidate in response to the Stronger Super reforms, which will deliver benefits to members from the efficiency generated by the reforms.


Schedule 2 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to introduce a registration regime for auditors of self managed superannuation funds.


It delivers on a key part of the Government's 23 June 2012 announcement of a new SMSF auditor registration framework.


The Government's Super System Review found that while some approved auditors are subject to minimum competency standards through their professional association, not all approved auditors are subject to the same minimum competency standards, nor are they subject to the same enforcement actions.


The Self managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF) sector is the largest sector in the superannuation industry at some $400billion. The members of these funds are advised by a range of experts including lawyers, financial planners and accountants. 


A key role is played by the 11,000 or so SMSF auditors. They play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of a major sector of the superannuation system. Each year, SMSF trustees are required to appoint an approved auditor to audit the financial reports and the operations of the fund. The auditor is required to assess the fund's overall compliance with the law and the fund's financial statements. 


The annual audit provides assurance to the Government and the general public that SMSFs are complying with the sole purpose test, something that is particularly important given the amount of retirement savings held in SMSFs.


The amendments will introduce a registration regime for SMSF auditors, where auditors will be required to meet initial and ongoing requirements relating to their qualifications, competency and independence. 


Transitional arrangements are being developed as part of the Regulations to give recognition to highly experienced, competent auditors, including registered company auditors.


The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will be the registration body for SMSF auditors and will be responsible for setting competency standards and taking enforcement action against auditors who have not met their obligations. The Australian Taxation Office will monitor auditor's compliance with relevant standards and refer any non compliant auditors to Australian Securities and Investments Commission for consideration of enforcement action.


SMSF auditor registration will increase the assurance that can be placed in the SMSF audit by ensuring that SMSF auditors are competent to detect and report contraventions of the superannuation law.


The legislation has been put together in consultation with members of the Joint Accounting Bodies. 


Schedule 3 amends the tax law to expand the existing reporting obligation for superannuation providers. Under the revised obligations, superannuation providers will be required to provide statements for all members who held an interest in the superannuation plan at any time during a reporting period, not just those for whom contributions are received as is presently the case.


These amendments will allow the ATO to display more comprehensive superannuation information to individuals and facilitate the consolidation of inactive accounts with a low balance. To the extent that this enables individuals to locate lost accounts, it will help improve individuals' retirement savings.


Schedule 4 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Capital Gains Tax Relief and Other Efficiency Measures) Bill 2012 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act) and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 (RSA Act) to improve the quality of information in the superannuation system, and facilitate fully effective e commerce.


As part of the Government's SuperStream package of reforms, a number of measures were announced to improve the efficiency of the superannuation system. The Government legislated standards for superannuation transactions in June this year, and this legislation will ensure the effectiveness of these standards. 


It has been estimated that the Australian superannuation industry processes more than 100 million transactions annually. The potential gains to the system from effective e-commerce in superannuation are significant. 


Currently poor member information quality leads to difficulties in allocating contributions, unnecessary duplicate accounts and a large amount of lost and unclaimed superannuation. 


This legislation supports the industry in achieving the goals of effective e-commerce and improving information quality. The Commissioner of Taxation will provide two key services: 


A central register containing accurate and secure details of superannuation funds which is critical to effective e commerce, and


A tax file number validation service which can be used by employers and trustees to ensure the information they hold for their employees and members is correct. 


It is estimated that the SuperStream proposals could save the industry and, therefore, members of superannuation funds up to $1 billion per year. Much of the benefit of these savings should flow through to members in the form of lower fees and charges.


SUPERANNUATION AUDITOR REGISTRATION IMPOSITION BILL 2012


This bill provides for the imposition of fees relating to approved auditors of self managed superannuation funds.


In recognition of the important role self managed superannuation fund auditors play in the regulatory arrangements for self managed superannuation funds, the Government accepted the recommendation of the Super System Review to establish a registration regime for approved self managed superannuation fund auditors. 


Self managed superannuation funds auditor registration will increase the assurance that can be placed in the self managed superannuation fund audit by ensuring that self managed superannuation fund auditors are competent to detect and report contraventions of the superannuation law.


This bill imposes some fees to help recover costs of establishing the self managed superannuation fund auditor registration regime.


Approved self managed superannuation fund auditors will be required to pay fees for certain things as part of the registration process. It is expected that applying for registration will cost $100, undertaking a competency exam will also cost $100 and submitting an annual statement to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission will cost $50. Approved self managed superannuation fund auditors will be liable for additional fees if they do not submit their annual statements on time or fail to notify the Australian Securities and Investments Commission of certain matters on time. The amount of these fees will depend on how late the statement or information is provided to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.


Certain searches of the Register of Approved self managed superannuation fund Auditors and Register of Disqualified self managed superannuation fund Auditors that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission keeps may also be subject to fees. These fees are based on cost recovery and will depend on the resources required to find information for the requested search. However, online searches of the register will be free.


Full details of this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:56):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The minister tabled the EFIC annual report for 2011-12 yesterday. It is important to note from the report that the EFIC financed up to $1 billion worth of projects in the year 2011-12. However, it is questionable whether this money is well spent in the interests of the Australian economy and the developing countries that are affected by these projects. From the report, $195.5 million of the $1 billion facility provided by EFIC are given to the small and medium-sized enterprises. That means that close to 80 per cent of the project financing by EFIC is used to support large corporations. This looks more like a corporate welfare program than what EFIC is meant to do, which is support the growth of the export industry. Large corporations which EFIC supported have the financial wherewithal to seek financing from banks and other financial bodies. The report released by the Productivity Commission in June this year has shown that most of the time a large corporation seeks help from EFIC because it is convenient and cheaper to do so. This does not mean that there is a market failure with regard to export financing that warrants EFIC 's intervention. More often than not the high cost of financing for these large firms only reflects market value. Large corporations can afford them but choose not to and as a result it overcrowds EFIC's financing, which resulted in close to 80 per cent of their financing going to large corporations.


The Greens argue that this is unacceptable. Why is Australian public money going to loans given to large corporations that do not need help in the first place? Shouldn't EFIC support more small and medium sized enterprises in their financing? SMEs are more sustainable economically because they are adaptable and home-grown and bear the potential of being a huge source of employment for the economy. Despite the benefits associated with supporting home-grown SMEs, they receive less than 20 per cent of EFIC 's financial support. This may be brought about by a couple of reasons. It may be because the application process for EFIC funding is prohibitively difficult for SMEs to gain approval, or it may be that the application processes are systematically biased towards large corporations. Hence it is important that in light of this report the government reviews the EFIC financing process and addresses the stark imbalance between the amounts of money SMEs get compared to the large proportion received by large corporations.


Another major concern that the EFIC annual report failed to address adequately is the environmental and social impacts of the projects it financed in developing countries. This is particularly worrying as it is disclosed in the report that 60 per cent of the financing is given to the mining industry. EFIC says that it advances corporate responsibility and puts in place safeguards to manage the environmental and social impacts of the projects it finances overseas. However, there are major concerns by civil society organisations, like Jubilee Australia, that the safeguards that mining companies and EFIC say are in place are in fact inadequate.


Take, for example, the Oyu Tolgoi mines project, a mine owned by Rio Tinto, which is a category A project under EFIC. Insufficient time was given by EFIC for the civil society organisations to canvass the project impacts. This mine is in Mongolia, and while there was some extension of time, certainly from reports I received, many organisations still regarded it as inadequate.


Another controversial project which EFIC supported is the LNG project in PNG. That has been reported extensively, and it again highlights the problem that EFIC is confronting when it moves in to provide the assistance to mining companies.


The annual report reflects on the reputation of EFIC. There is a need for greater transparency of EFIC's corporate safeguards. More explanations and more readily accessible reports need to be disclosed by EFIC. We need greater oversight of EFIC and the projects that it supports. I feel that this annual report does not answer substantially the impact EFIC has on low-income countries with respect to environmental and social impacts.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2012-10-30,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (19:12):  I rise to speak on the recent Investigative Report by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the US national security issues posed by Chinese telcos, including Huawei. This report was released three weeks ago by Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Rogers, a Republican, and Ranking Member, CA Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat.


Let me state for the record that Australia welcomes Chinese investment and it welcomes Huawei to Australia. However I am concerned at Huawei's attempts to gloss over this report as well as the reasons for Huawei's exclusion from Australia's NBN, which were based entirely on national security. Huawei's local spokesman, Jeremy Mitchell, tweeted:


… it's all politics. Why is it UK agencies happy for their PM to meet Huawei CEO and huawei deliver their NBN for last 7 years?


Indeed Huawei has made much of its involvement with Britain's National Broadband Network. The truth is that Britain has tried to address security issues by limiting Huawei's access to its infrastructure and evaluating its equipment and software before it enters the infrastructure.


The US House Intelligence Committee report states that, as part of an overall mitigation strategy the British government entered an agreement with Huawei to establish an independently managed Cyber Security Evaluation Centre. The report says:


The goal of the British government is to attempt to lessen the threat that Huawei products deployed in critical UK telecommunications infrastructure pose to the availability or integrity of UK networks.


Huawei has proposed similar schemes for products entering the United States market and only last week Huawei's Australian chairman, Rear Admiral John Lord, in a speech to the National Press Club, proposed the creation of a cyber-security evaluation centre for Australia. 


According to the US House intelligence committee report:


For a variety of technical and economic reasons, evaluation programs as proposed by Huawei ... are less useful than one might expect. In fact, the programs may create a false sense of security that an incomplete, flawed, or misapplied evaluation would provide …


Unfortunately, given the complexity of the telecommunications grid, the limitations of current security evaluation techniques, and the economics of vendor-financed analyses provide a sense of security but not actual security.


For detailed reasons outlined in the US intelligence committee report, I believe Australia should reject Huawei's proposal for a national cybersecurity evaluation centre for Australia. Indeed, Britain's Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee has confirmed it is reviewing the presence of Huawei in regards to critical national infrastructure and whether this should give rise to concern.


Australians should be cognisant of the findings of the US Intelligence Committee. After extensive interviews with company and government officials, submitting questions, requesting documents and an open hearing, the committee found that:


Huawei did not fully cooperate with the investigation and was unwilling to explain its relationship with the Chinese government or Chinese Communist Party, while credible evidence exists that it fails to comply with US. laws.


According to the committee, Huawei's repeated failure to answer key questions or support their answers with credible internal evidence—in short, their obstructionist behaviour—makes addressing these national security concerns a national imperative for the US.


Huawei admitted that the Communist Party of China maintains a party committee inside the company, but it failed to explain its function or membership, simply stating that all Chinese companies are required to have such committees. This was a key area of concern to the US intelligence committee because of the opportunity for the Chinese state to influence Huawei's expansion into critical US infrastructure.


During the US intelligence committee's hearing, Mr Ding from Huawei suggested he did not understand and had no knowledge of the term 'national champion', used to describe favoured Chinese companies which act to expand China's influence and prestige. The committee found that Mr Ding's response was not credible. Huawei even blamed the use of the term 'national champion' in a slide presentation at Capitol Hill in November 2011 on a third party it said created the slide.


But this was not Huawei's evidence to last month's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security where Rear Admiral Lord said:


As far as being the national champion, it is recognition. There is no title and no certificate; we have never been given a trophy. It is something the company is proud of in that it has gone from US$3,000 in 1987 to a US$40 billion revenue company now, and it is innovative.


The US intelligence committee found that Huawei failed to answer key questions or provide supporting documentation for its claims to be financially independent of the Chinese government, although it admits its customers receive billions in support from Chinese state owned banks and that it had received favourable loans from Chinese banks for years.


Huawei denied doing business with the Iranian government but refused to provide any internal documents relating to its decision to scale back operations in Iran. Huawei stated that it did not allow employees to engage in population monitoring but refused to answer detailed questions about its operations in Iran or other sanctioned countries or provide evidence to support its claims that it complies with all international sanctions.


The committee found that Huawei's corporate history indicated ties to the Chinese military and that Huawei failed to provide detailed answers about those connections. Huawei refused to provide details on its R&D programs, while other documents undermined its claim that Huawei provides no R&D for the Chinese military or intelligence services. The House committee received internal Huawei documentation from former Huawei employees which appeared to show that Huawei provides special network services to an entity the employee believes is an elite cyberwarfare unit within the PLA.


The committee received multiple, credible reports from former and current Huawei employees which provided evidence of a pattern and practice of potentially illegal behaviour by Huawei officials in the US. Those allegations include immigration violations, fraud and bribery when seeking contracts, discriminatory behaviour against non-Chinese employees and a pattern and practice of Huawei using pirated software in its United States facilities. These and other alleged violations are being referred to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.


Further, I understand that a second phase of inquiry is expected because 'dozens and dozens' of new complaints have emerged about Huawei following the intelligence committee's 11-month investigation. Going to a key concern of the House committee's findings in the unclassified section of its report, I quote:


Inserting malicious hardware or software implants into Chinese-manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for US customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national security systems in a time of crisis or war. Malicious implants in the components of critical infrastructure, such as power grids or financial networks, would also be a tremendous weapon in China's arsenal.


Malicious Chinese hardware or software implants would also be a potent espionage tool for penetrating sensitive U.S. national security systems, as well as providing access to the closed American corporate networks that contain the sensitive trade secrets, advanced research and development data, and negotiating or litigation positions that China would find useful in obtaining an unfair diplomatic or commercial advantage over the United States.


For all the above reasons, the US House intelligence committee recommended that US government systems, particularly sensitive systems, should not include Huawei equipment, including in component parts, and, similarly, that government contractors, particularly those working on contracts for sensitive US programs, should exclude Huawei equipment from their systems. It strongly encouraged private sector entities in the US to consider the long-term security risks associated with doing business with Huawei for equipment or services. It also strongly encouraged US network providers and systems developers to seek other vendors for their projects. The House intelligence committee stated that, based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei could not be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus posed a security threat to the United States and its systems.


In recent years Huawei has attempted to gain a profile and acceptance in Australia by appointing an Australian board, sponsoring the Canberra Raiders and appearing at the National Press Club. Huawei's presence in Australia is to be welcomed. However, at the same time, the Australian government and industry should be aware of the potential issues that this raises.
