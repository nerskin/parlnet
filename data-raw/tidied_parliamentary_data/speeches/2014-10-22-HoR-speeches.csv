Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (09:02):  I want to again extend thanks to the shadow minister for moving the second reading amendment. In my previous contribution I spoke about the important policy reform that was undertaken by the last government in the area of dental care. We have known for a long time in Australia that dental care has been in many respects the poor cousin of health care not for any kind of moral or sound public policy reasons but really through the different ways it has been managed by governments. In 2012 Labor announced the biggest investment in dental care since Federation. It was an enormous reform that has changed the situation for so many Australians, especially Australian children, who were the big focus of that scheme, and lower income adults, whom all of us in this chamber know are those who have really borne the brunt of what has happened to dental care over successive governments both state and federal.


In my last contribution I was talking a little bit about some of the concerns we hold on this side of the House about the progress of this important issue through this parliament. I am very sad to say that we have seen a pretty destructive pattern from those on the other side of the House. They appear to have come into government with very few ideas of their own and instead have put their energies towards busily unpicking some of the really good things Labor did while in government. I think we heard the beginnings of some quite disturbing rhetoric from the minister when he gave his second reading contribution. He talked about these early concerns that he had with the dental program. He talked about how they would be monitoring this program very carefully. Unfortunately, we have heard this story before from that very same minister. Whether it was promises to make no cuts to health and then immediately attempting to introduce a new tax to make changes and cuts to state funding to health, whether it was school and university funding, all of these things went through this same pattern of behaviour. I want to put the government on notice that with the leadership of the shadow minister we will be very much holding them to account on upholding what has been an important reform that was made by the Rudd and Gillard governments.


Of course, much of the bill pertains to administration of the transfer of arrangements that were made in 2012, and we are very happy to support those detailed elements of the policy, but I say again that we will be watching. It is the same robust protection that we have turned on Medicare and other iconic elements of our system of social protection that we will also be putting onto the dental reforms.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (09:05):  I rise today to speak on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. A strange sense of deja vu comes over me as I again have to fix another one of Labor's bungled attempts at finding their elusive surplus. When the Labor government decided to axe the coalition's Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme we lost a great service. That scheme provided over 17 million services to approximately one million patients from 2007 to 2012. It provided $4,250 in dental benefits over two years for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Then Labor cut the plan and had no backup system until 2014. It put those with chronic dental conditions out into the wilderness with no plan in place—and Labor preaches its concern and regard for the health of our nation! To this I say: rubbish, absolute rubbish. 


Labor's alternative was just another program that did nothing but plunge the disadvantaged people into even worse circumstances. Dental care should be a basic right as an Australian citizen. Constituents in my electorate of Paterson, who cannot afford any more cuts in funding, wrote to me in droves as they discovered that a basic service like dental care was taken away from them. Pensioners make up a large percentage of my electorate and they are most likely to have other health issues that can get worse without regular dental check-ups and treatment. Parents with young children were told they would need to wait at least 13 months until they could get their children's growing teeth examined. Working families living in remote rural areas, who do not have immediate access to a public dental hospital, had to incur lost time, travel costs and invariably accommodation costs for what should be a given service to taxpayers. The disabled and the unemployed are already working within tight budgets and tough situations, especially the disabled where every aspect of their health needs to be carefully managed. These disadvantaged people had already endured other cuts by Labor when searching for a surplus—a surplus that was never achieved. The Labor government failed yet again. The Labor government failed to service those most in need—the chronically ill—yet they preach their commitment and their concern to the disadvantaged of this great nation.


The purpose of this bill that we are debating today is to restore sanity to the system. We have an opportunity to help those dentists who were so overwhelmed with patients that they did not have the opportunity to do the paperwork. The Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill of 2014 will waive debts for dentists who, under the former Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, did nothing more than make minor paperwork errors and who have been waiting for way too long for an adequate resolution. The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was set up in 2007 and provided access to benefits of up to $4,250 over two calendar years for patients with chronic health conditions. Eighty per cent of people who accessed this scheme were concession card holders. It was the country's biggest investment ever into dental care and in 2012 the former Labor government closed it down. For what purpose? Political gain. Another failure to add to the former Labor government's cap.


The scheme included a technical reporting requirement. Dentists needed to provide treatment plans to GPs along with a quote and a treatment plan to patients prior to commencing treatment. The former Labor government sought to use dentists' technical oversights as a means of discrediting the scheme. They introduced a change that saw dentists who did not meet all of these reporting requirements pursued for repayment of the full amount of the Medicare benefits paid under the scheme although in most cases the dentists had met all other requirements of the scheme and, importantly, had provided much needed services to the patients. It should be all about the patients and their health care.


I understand that some believe this scheme was scrapped due to an abundance of dentists who committed fraud and did not comply with the other legal requirements of the program. This was clearly not the case. The majority of dentists provided services in good faith and treated their patients with the care they needed. They will now be rewarded for their service. It was yet another shameful act that a former Labor government used as a political power play.


The Council of Australian Governments Reform Council has released its latest snapshot on the progress of the Commonwealth against the 2008 National Healthcare Agreement. The Healthcare in Australia report notes six areas of concern. One of them is that more Australians are putting off dental care because it is seen as too expensive. It is a worrying precedent that some Australians are not going to see their dentist, orthodontist or other dental professional because of costs. The report finds that nearly one in five—18.8 per cent—of Australians aged over 15 put off seeing a dentist. The statistics are worse in our poorer communities. Amongst the poorer communities, one in four people put off going to see a dental professional because of the costs. If you go to the doctor, particularly in a disadvantaged area, it is bulk-billed; there is no cost to the patient. But, if you go to a dentist, there is a significant cost, and it is a big deterrent to people.


According to an Australian Bureau of Statistics report, Census of population and housing: socio-economic indexes for areas (SEIFA), my electorate of Paterson has a population of 230,235 people. This report notes that, out of 722,685 doctor visits, 566,357 were bulk-billed. That is over 78 per cent of my residents who need bulk-billing. With that high a percentage for standard GP visits, you can only imagine the number who could not access dental health specialists. 


Dental health is critical to maintaining good health. It is especially important when you already have other medical ailments, other health issues, to manage. This is increasingly common when you are in the older segment of our society, when you are elderly. In my electorate of Paterson, senior citizens make up a large part of my community—self-funded retirees and age pensioners. In Paterson I have 36,319 constituents aged 60 and over, who make up 28.4 per cent of the electorate. In Australia the number of constituents aged 60 and over is approximately 4.2 million, which equates to 19.6 per cent. So you can see we are batting above the average in terms of the elderly in my electorate of Paterson. By 2037, nearly 23 per cent of the nation's population will be 65 years old or older, and this equates to more than 6.4 million people by 2037.


As my constituents get older, they encounter more healthcare needs. As the following examples will explain, their dental health can prove interconnected with their existing conditions when it comes to treatment options. I was contacted by a constituent who wanted to complain about the axing of the Labor government's scheme. This person is 66 and was diagnosed with lupus, with secondary Sjogren's syndrome. Despite surgery on her saliva ducts, this lady's glands were producing a minimum amount of saliva. Due to this, her teeth were deteriorating rapidly and she required a lot of dental procedures. Also factor in the cost of the additional trips to Westmead Hospital's Specialist Dental Centre, which involved hotel stays overnight. With her condition consisting of six extra issues caused by the first, she was seeing eight different specialists in all, so her medical bills were high, and, with the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme being closed down, she was concerned about the future of her health. I can fully understand why. She would not be on her own in that respect. My electorate is rural and, in parts, quite remote, so any visit to Sydney is quite a journey, and when you are sick it would be quite exhausting.


Another resident contacted my office. She too was concerned when the scheme was closed down. She was over 60 and being treated for breast cancer. This terrible disease had her enduring surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In addition to all this, these services were causing problems with her bones and her teeth. Her GP referred her to a dentist under the scheme, but six weeks later the scheme was shut down. So not only does this resident have to endure the biggest battle of her life with breast cancer; she also has to take on dental issues as a second, encore round.


And it is not just seniors who are finding it tough. A resident in my electorate who goes by the name of Angel was seriously injured in a car accident when he was in his early 40s and was affected by the axing of the chronic disease dental plan. In this accident he broke his back in three places and his pelvic plate in five places and completely snapped his right hip joint. He broke his left leg and both his ankles and broke his heel bones off. He also received muscular damage and torn nerve endings. He spent four months in traction and six months in a wheelchair, and once he finally regained the ability to walk he was slapped with a $25,000 bill. So, already, Angel has taken on his fair share of the pain, and that is quite a recovery that he will have to make. Following all this, he has to take heavy medication for the pain and the nerve damage, which has an effect on his teeth. He estimates that his teeth will rot within a couple of years if he does not go to a dentist on a regular basis—which of course he cannot, without the scheme that was in place.


Now my constituent has to choose between going further and further into debt and losing his teeth at the age of 45. And I have to ask: how could the former government have been so cruel to those who needed their help the most? When you are fighting cancer you have to keep up good dental health because of the amount of surgery you will be having. That is why it is quite concerning for a senior citizen, whom I have mentioned before in this place, who is fighting breast cancer. She is having surgeries as a result of chemotherapy and if she does not find the money to fund her dental treatments she cannot continue to fight the cancer. As I asked at the time, when Labor was cancelling the scheme, what kind of a heartless government would cancel such a vital scheme that delivered so much to people outside the major cities? Let me take you back to 2012, when we were first discussing the ridiculous concept of scrapping the scheme. I told you about Margaret Rylands from Forster, who had been living with diabetes for 52 years. Her husband had to have five bypass operations and then they had little money coming in. They also had bad teeth. Now, with no scheme in place, if their teeth get worse or her husband needs another operation, they could be in real trouble.


Let me explain. I know of a young man in Forster who had jaw cancer. He needed to keep good teeth while battling this disease, at it could affect his general health. If he got so much as a gum infection in a tooth, it would flow on to his bones and down to his jaw. Now he has cancer and an infection, and that infection could kill him. In my area of an ever-growing number of retirees, this could be catastrophic. If one of my elderly residents falls down and breaks their hip, they will need surgery. If they have bad teeth, they will now have to find the funds to first fix their teeth before they can even get onto the waitlist for a hip replacement. This means that they will need to find extra help just to get around, and then wait until their dental health is cleared before they can take the steps towards independence again.


As I said earlier, I yet again find myself having to fix another one of Labor's bungled programs. In the past year we have had to deal with many of their shoddy schemes—policies like disastrous home insulation schemes, the failed solar rebate, the implementation of crippling carbon taxes and mining taxes, and the lapse in border protection. All of these were especially felt in my electorate. And of course there were the never-ending issues with digital television, which I raised yesterday. To fix one more mess and assist the overworked, undercredited dental health specialists in my area is important. This bill will address that in part. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-10-22,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:18):  In Australia, you should be able to get dental care on Medicare. Going to the dentist should be like going to the doctor: you can bring out your Medicare card and have treatment, in the same way. The mouth is part of the body, and if you keep your mouth and your teeth healthy you in fact significantly reduce the risk of contracting other, potentially more serious, diseases. But in Australia, when it comes to healthcare funding, we treat the mouth as being separate to the rest of the body. As we have been reminded, yesterday in particular, there were struggles in the initial establishment of Medicare, or a form of universal health care in this country, and it was resisted. But it was ultimately accepted and is now one of the things that people like about Australia.


The cost of going to the dentist, however, is getting to the point where many people are putting off treatment for themselves or for their family members. And we are seeing, increasingly, people presenting to GPs and in some instances to hospitals because of preventable diseases or health issues that have arisen because they did not get their teeth seen to in time. It is not only a health issue; it is also a social justice issue—you are less likely to get that job if you turn up to the interview with fewer teeth. Someone who turns up to a job interview with a full set of teeth, looking good and in good health stands a much better chance.


Prior to the 2010 election, the scheme that we had in this country, the CDDS scheme we are discussing here today as part of this legislation, was a measure that the federal government was taking towards health care and dental care. But by no means was it universal. It did not mean that you could front up to the dentist with your Medicare card and say, 'I need some treatment.' In fact, it only addressed the situation when it had got to that end where no-one wants to get to: the chronic stage. There was no federal government scheme to help people with the cost of going to see the dentist to stop them getting into that situation in the first place. There was no federal government scheme before 2010 that would allow you to do something akin to taking your Medicare card to the dentist to get support.


The 2010 election saw a power-sharing parliament. In 2010, thanks to the people of Melbourne, we were in the position of sitting down and saying to the government: we will support you but we will support you on conditions. One of those conditions was putting a price on pollution and taking world-leading action on global warming. Another of those conditions, in an agreement that I was very pleased to sign, concerned reform of our dental scheme.


During the course of the last parliament, we commissioned some expert analysis from the Oral Health Council to say: if you wanted to start putting dental care into Medicare and making dental care universally available in this country in the same way that other forms of health care are, how would you go about it given that there may be a limited budget to spend? Also, from a straight health perspective, what is the best way to go? That council considered a number of options and reported back to the government and to us. They said very clearly: 'We can give you a few ways to go but here is what we think is best: the best way to improve the dental health of the Australian population is to start with the kids, to start with young people. 'Because if we can create a generation of young people who have no substantial dental health issues and know how to maintain themselves then we are going to, first of all, make a much healthier Australian public but, secondly, we are going to reduce the burden for generations to come on doctors and on hospitals who, at the moment, are seeing those people who are suffering from diseases that they could have prevented if they had only got to the dentist in time.'


So with that in mind, we crafted some legislation and some policies in the last parliament that said let's take Australia on the journey towards getting dental care into Medicare. Let us start making going to the dentist like going to the doctor. We followed the report of the experts, which was to say let's start, first of all, making universal dental care available to children. So we began by saying: if you are eligible for certain family tax benefits, you can now take your kid to the dentist, present your Medicare card and get a certain amount of treatment for free. We made sure in the package that was negotiated that that would not be an excuse for states to pull back on funding. In fact, we made sure there was funding available for states to expand their public health system so that people, including pensioners, who were on healthcare cards now had an expanded public health system to get into.


We were aware, because the experts told us, that this was not something we were going to be able to flick the switch to overnight. There actually were not enough dentists and health professionals in Australia at the time to enable the flicking of the switch to a universal dental healthcare scheme, so there was a proposal to train up some more health professionals to ensure that in time everyone would be able to get access to universal dental health if we proceeded on this plan. Part of that reform involved rolling the existing CDDS into this new scheme. Part of that was because the government insisted that there was not an unlimited amount of money and therefore it had to be found from somewhere and so should be found from this, but part of it was also a policy question. Rather than picking people up when they get to the extreme end, let's make sure there is support available for healthcare card holders, pensioners and those who cannot afford it and let's start making this a universal scheme where you can get access to it no matter how much money you earn and where the mouth starts to be treated as part of the body.


In that respect, I think the government, in moving and speaking to this bill, needs to tone down some of the rhetoric about the reasons for the closure of the CDDS. They may have a view that there was an ideologically mounted attack or it was about some health minister or other not liking a particular scheme, but I can tell you that from our point of view the reform of the scheme was necessary because it was a lot of money going to a few people whereas the Greens believe in the principle of universal health care. We would much rather see money being spent across the board on everyone regardless of income and on improving the dental health of the whole of the Australian population. This should not be an excuse to attack a particular political party by saying that a minister had a particular vendetta. We should be having the debate here about how to spend Australian taxpayers' money to get the best return and to ensure that everyone in this country can go to the dentist no matter how much money they earn.


I cay say that, as someone who represents the electorate with the most public housing of any electorate in the country, there are many people who have just put off going to the dentist because they were not able to afford it. In some states, there have been very good programs run by the state governments for children through schools and through other public health providers. That has given children some access to it; but, for families in public housing, if something went wrong with their kids' teeth, prior to us morphing the CDDS into this new universal scheme there was nowhere for them to go. Parents who did not have a lot of money—and by definition that is what those in public housing are—were just not able to take their kids to the dentist. By 'kids' we are talking about people under 18 as well, not necessarily only those who are in primary school. I something goes wrong, they just could not take them to the dentist. Then that festers, and they are the people who in their 20s find themselves with fewer teeth than others. They are the people who, as they go on into their 30s and 40s find themselves at greater risk of heart disease because they do not have all their teeth in their mouth in good condition.


I am very proud that, working with the other members of the last parliament, we were able to change that so that low-income families in my electorate and right around the country can now take their children to the dentist, present their Medicare card and be able to get some free services. That is a good start, and we need to build on that.


Rather than having an ideological and small-minded partisan debate in this place, we should be having a debate about how we can make dental health care universal and how can we make it so that not only children, especially children of families up to a certain point, but everyone is able to front up to their dentist with their Medicare card just as they do with their doctor. There are plenty of places to find the money for it if we wanted to. We give billions of dollars each year in subsidies to the big banks, we give billions of dollars in subsidies to big miners and fossil fuel companies. If you asked Australians: 'Would you rather the government dollars go towards giving the likes of Gina Rinehart subsidised diesel fuel or would you rather the government use that money to ensure that everyone can go to the dentist when they need it?'—I know what people would say.


That is the debate that we need to have here because we do not have a budget crisis, as we hear from the government. If anything, we have a revenue crisis. We are not raising the revenue that we need to fund the services that Australians expect and that is the debate that we should be having here. People in Australia like Medicare and they want dental care to be part of it. Let us go down that road.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-10-22,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (09:31):  This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008. It allows the operation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule to be overseen in a similar fashion to the Medicare oversight process. Not only will the professional service review process be able to be applied to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule but also the CEO of Medicare can request documents to substantiate Chronic Disease Dental Scheme billing is appropriate. These are sensible and appropriate measures that ensure compliance with the intent and design of the scheme.


I would just like to make some observations on this scheme and its history and some reflections on the previous government's dental policy and its development. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule commenced in January this year, but it is a leftover policy from the previous government. There has been a dental scheme absence, apart from state-based public dental schemes, since the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was axed in August and September 2012.


The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was a great scheme, with a good clinical basis and intent, but, like in any government scheme, there were instances where either patients or dental practitioners were pushing the boundaries to a stage where the envelope was broken. I am very loath to say 'abuse' or 'fraud' but in some cases the intent and the administration of it was not ideal, and the response was not appropriate to the problem. In classic ALP fashion, rather than instituting compliance and oversight, which you would think any sensible administration would bring into play if it had concerns, it appears to me that it gave them the excuse to get rid of a scheme or a coalition achievement that actually had some runs on the board.


There also appeared to be the opportunity to save the previous administration a heap of money, because there was no replacement for about 14 months. They also summarily demanded in retrospect refunds of thousands of dollars from dentists who had supplied services to patients. The justification of that, to me, seems to be a technicality—that the dentist had not filled out part of the paperwork. This also reflects badly on the previous administration because, surely, with most transactions in business you check that the work has been done before you pay the provider. That tells me that they were not checking on the processes that they should have had in place in the first instance.


For many people in my electorate this scheme was a godsend, because there are lots of elderly people, concession card holders and pensioners in the electorate of Lyne who unfortunately, because of the generation they grew up in, had bad dentistry. They also have serious kidney, vascular and heart conditions. The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme in many instances prevented further disease. Even though it was being done late in life for many of these recipients, it was very preventive. If you have kidney disease, gingivitis, rotten teeth or you cannot eat good nutrition because you have no teeth, this was a godsend. Twenty-five per cent of the electorate of Lyne either have a concession card or are in receipt of a pension, so this change had massive ramifications for the electorate. When the axe fell, many were left in limbo. In some cases, they were halfway through their treatment program. Others who had committed to it were left high and dry and struggled on in chronic discomfort or had to commit to multiple extractions and false teeth.


I think the previous administration were so desperate to save money anywhere that they just saw this as an excuse to blame the dentists and give them an account rather than institute what we are doing with this amendment. We are instituting proper oversight of a scheme which is targeted to a different cohort altogether. Paradoxically, the two-year-old to 17-year-old cohort probably have the best teeth in the country. We are also instituting means-testing so that it is applied to people who really need the help.


I am sure the spin doctors were consulted heavily in the development and rollout of this scheme, because it is hard to criticise anything that is targeted at children. Everyone knows that if children have good nutrition, have a toothbrush that is used, have fluoride in their toothpaste and are not fed sweet drinks all the time, most of them should be left with healthy teeth and gums by the age of 17. I hope this really is a dental program and not a spin doctor program that was punched out in the dying days of the previous government.


The coalition government will certainly be monitoring and observing this scheme to make sure it has the outcome that was intended. We still need to address the other problem: with the summary execution of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, many genuinely concerned and good practising dentists and dental practices were left with huge bills, in retrospect, months and years after they delivered good service. This is a classic case of using a fig-leaf response to cover up the deficiencies and inadequacies of the previous administration. The old saying 'Throwing out the baby with the bathwater' is applicable here. There were problems with the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, but, rather than fixing them, they got rid of the whole scheme altogether.


The amendments to section 34 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act, with oversight and the CEO of Medicare able to inquire, and with professional services review processes, will simplify the process of garnering the debts that were levied. It will also give the department the ability to waive the debts. It will not excuse fraud; it will not excuse abuse. Currently, the investigation process whereby money is retrieved is so laborious and long that the amount of funds expended in getting funds back costs as much as the returns. Also, I find that it was an affront to bill retrospectively professional people who were doing a good job for patients with chronic disease.


I commend these amendments to the House. As I have said on so many occasions, when you are in government you have to have good administration. This is a good legislative response to a problem that is now going to be addressed and fixed. I commend the bill and the amendment to the House.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2014-10-22,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (09:40):  I am speaking to the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I think that the government has to be cognisant of the fact that we are a wealthy country—an extremely wealthy country by world standards. The government says that they are broke. There is a wonderful paper out about comparing the deficits of the allegedly terrible ALP government—and I probably would agree that it was a terrible government!—comparing Wayne Swan's deficit with the Menzies last budget and the massive deficit that was registered there. But, of course, they were made to sound like irrelevancies compared to the deficits registered by the Queensland government that I was part of.


It was made mention of with Gough Whitlam yesterday—I might seem like I am wandering off track here but I can assure you that I am not, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker—that there was a vote of no confidence in Gough because he sacrificed economic growth for social reform. It was a very perceptive comment and, in my opinion, very accurate. There will be those who argue that social reform needed to come. Where I am going with this is that there has never been a government in human history that has not accused the outgoing government of making the government broke, 'We've got no money and therefore we can't do these things.' That is just standard operating procedure. After 41 years in parliament I think that every minister probably says it at least once every second day.


Where I am going with this is that here is this great, rich country—one of the richest countries on earth—and it cannot supply dental services to its citizens. My homeland is North Queensland's midwest, the country between Mount Isa and Townsville. I have lived there all my life and four or five generations before me. In that area, the four main towns in the midwest are Cloncurry, Richmond, Julia Creek and Hughenden. There are may be seven, eight or 10,000 people living in those towns. For my entire time as a state member I can never remember us having fewer than three dentists serving that area.


Normally when I have rung up over the last 10 or 15 years, there have been no dentists in the area. A person can go from Julia Creek on a 400- to 600-kilometre round trip to Mount Isa to see a dentist. A person in Hughenden can go to Charters Towers—a 500- or 600-kilometre round trip. Or maybe he has to go on to Townsville. The costs of doing this—and the ability to be able to do this if you have a jo—are so high. That is in a remote area. Let me switch to the outer suburbs of Cairns, to Babinda. A good friend of mine came along to one of our meetings. He had taken out his own tooth on Channel 9 because he had waited for two years in pain. They had said, 'Oh, we had you on the top of the list but we had to put you down again.' This was after two years, he was in continuous pain and he realised that he was never going to get there. So he pulled the tooth out himself with a pair of pliers on Channel 9. Outrageous as that seems, it is a matter of public record; it was done on Channel 9. Similarly in Richmond another person pulled his own teeth out with a pair of pliers. So in this great wealthy nation there are people who go to the most primitive methods of medical treatment. With no painkillers or anything they haul their teeth out with a pair of pliers.


This is a very sad day for Australia. We are wasting the time of the House talking about an audit requirement. Quite frankly, the dentists I have spoken to have said: 'Of course there should be an audit requirement. Surely that does not have to go in legislation.' Any properly operated scheme anywhere does not need legislation to back it up. Just haul them in. Surely there is accounting oversight taking place now.


That is the bill as it stands. I was deeply disappointed when a minister who I considered to be quite a good minister, the now deputy leader of the Labor Party, abolished the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which dealt with cases like the one I referred to on the outskirts of Cairns where an elderly person had to take his own tooth out. It came to grips with that sort of problem. The approach that had been used was very good, but that money was taken away and put into some prevention program for children. Yes, all right, there might be value in a prevention program for children, but I would have thought that giving every kid in Australia a toothbrush and the schools a tube of toothpaste and getting them to brush their teeth every morning would be 100 times more effective than putting something on a video screen and having a teacher talk to them. It would go in one ear and out the other. It would be very practical if they actually brush their teeth as part of the school curriculum.


We spoke all of yesterday about the legacy of Gough Whitlam. I most certainly would not be hypocritical enough to say it was an all-good legacy—and I would probably say something short of that. There is the provision of a great fund of money to address the real problems of Australia, such as the health problems. A government has no higher priority than that. There was a wonderful article in The DailyTelegraph that stated that the primary responsibility of government is to protect the people. It should be to protect their people from one of the most terrible pains that can be registered. I have had enormous pain in my life playing rugby league and other such activities—and I dealt a bit out too, I might add. There are some times when the pain of toothache can be really out of this world. Of course the Nazis used it as a torture device to get people to speak because it is one of the worst pains you can possibly have. People in Australia are taking the worst pain you can possibly have and they cannot get in to see a dentist. In my home town of Charters Towers there are two dentists. The last time I attempted to get in there was a three-month wait. If a dentist friend of mine in Townsville had not stayed back an extra hour, I might have been running around with the pliers to pull my own teeth out too.


The government is failing miserably in this area. I do not blame the minister and I do not blame the last minister. They have been given very limited resources. The federal Labor government was blaming the state Liberal governments and prior to that the Liberal federal government was blaming the state Labor governments. I checked this and found really neither were to blame in the sense that over a decade there has been an over 300 per cent increase in federal spending on health in the state of Queensland and also a 300 per cent increase in federal health spending.


In Queensland—and I suspect this may well be all over Australia—the long-serving president of the AMA in the state quoted the figure again and again that 16 years ago there were three hands-on health workers—nurses, doctors—for every backup staff, and now it is reversed. I spoke to 11 doctors that have served for over 15 years and each of them said that, yes, that figure would be about right. So we are carrying one of the most top-heavy—with administration and PR and a whole run of other people—health departments.


We had an example of what they do in Queensland. I am pleased the member for Leichhardt is here because I am sure he would back me up in this. Two of our doctors in Cairns had the temerity to say, 'A suspected Ebola patient came in here and they were just treated like an ordinary patient until somebody said they were an Ebola suspect and raced them off down to what was supposedly an isolation ward but really was just a ward down the end of the corridor effectively.' There was no particular characteristics of that ward that made it an isolation ward. Those doctors were immediately punished. Under the successive Labor governments in Queensland, there was a culture of fear that you were not supposed to speak up.


Heavens, in the Bundaberg hospital there is a man losing his leg from gangrene. This is not a hard thing to pick up. If any of my footballers break a limb, I would go down there to check myself to see there was no redness or swelling because you have got to move very quickly if you are dealing with something like gangrene. In the case in Bundaberg, this bloke visibly had gangrene and only one single nurse had the courage to speak up, which is an absolutely scalding indictment of the other people that worked in hospital who were quite happy to preserve their jobs to watch a man lose his leg. It was claimed in the press that 11 times that sort of incident was repeated in the Bundaberg hospital because everyone was too scared to speak out. The nurse who spoke up, of course, was punished immediately.


That terrible culture that surrounded the 'Doctor Death' incidents at the Bundaberg hospital is still there. It is alive and well and blossoming. Oh, an Ebola patient went into a general ward in hospital and we have got no ability to deal with them, and all of these health workers were exposed. What do we do? What we do is get anyone that opens their mouth. The answer is not: what we do is make sure we introduce protocols to protect our health workers in our hospitals, no. That is not what we did. We immediately moved to shut them up.


It is to do with the health department in Queensland making sure that they have a great PR message to take out there and nothing to do with the health and welfare of the people. You can look no further than the incidents of the so called 'Doctor Death' at the Bundaberg hospital and look no further than the two top nurses that are still stood down at that hospital for doing the right thing. They were punished for doing the right thing, and it is a scathing indictment upon the administration of the health department in Queensland.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (09:53):  It is a great opportunity to speak on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This is a relatively uncontroversial bill but we are obviously having an important debate about dental care in our country. As the member for Ballarat said, oral health care is the missing link out of Medicare. I think there is a great deal of truth to that.


Oral health has been left to the states for a long time. What we have seen really out of the states' administration of this area is a system of haves and have-nots. We have seen over the last couple of decades the federal government, by necessity, become increasingly involved in the area of dental care. We can go right back to when I joined the Labor Party. I can remember the Keating government embarking on a program to reduce state waiting lists for public dental care, because those waiting lists had grown so long—not just the time you waited to get seen but the time you waited to actually get the treatment. So, there were often two waiting lists: the waiting list to get an assessment and then the waiting list to get the treatment. And they blew out, particularly in New South Wales at that time. The member for Kennedy talks about people removing their own teeth. Sadly, sometimes people were going to that extreme, taking drastic action themselves, because of these terrible waiting lists.


So there was an endeavour by the Keating government at that time to address this matter, and we saw even the Howard government—no friend to Medicare, no friend to universality or to getting involved in state responsibilities—embark on the CDSS. We know that that was a poorly targeted scheme. It was meant to cost $90 million a year and ended up costing $80 million a month. Now, maybe that is because there is vast demand out there; I do not know. But one of the things we also know about it is that more than 20 per cent of the recipients were not concession card holders, were not pensioners, and more than 20 per cent of the spending was on high-cost restorative services. So, that was the record of the Howard government. They were getting involved in this area, I guess out of necessity, because the states were doing such a poor job. We all know that there were problems in that scheme, and those opposite should not try to run from them.


The previous Labor government, of course, embarked on a $4.1 billion scheme, and that was designed basically to clear waiting lists to create a workforce—and not just a workforce in capital cities but a workforce outside of capital cities—and also focused on children's health. Children's health is particularly important. The member for Ballarat in her speech talked about some terrible statistics—that 20,000 children under the age of 10 are hospitalised each year because of avoidable dental issues and that by the age of 15 six out of every 10 kids have tooth decay. We know that this is not just because they do not have toothbrushes or because of sugary drinks; it is because they do not see a dentist. A dentist is an integral part of oral health care.


The impact of oral disease is particularly important. The Department of Health, on its website—the National Advisory Council on Dental Health—talks about the National Oral Health Plan for 2004 to 2013. It says:


Oral health is fundamental to overall health, wellbeing and quality of life. A healthy mouth enables people to eat, speak and socialise without pain, discomfort or embarrassment. The impact of oral disease on people's everyday lives is subtle and pervasive, influencing eating, sleep, work and social roles. The prevalence and recurrences of these impacts constitutes a silent epidemic.


It goes on to talk about the international research that indicates associations between chronic oral infections and lung disease, stroke, low birth weight and premature birth. Associations have been made between periodontal disease and diabetes in international literature as well.


So, we know that oral health is vital to the health of the rest of the body. And the statistics that are there scream out for a shift away from the system of haves and have-nots that is endemic in allowing the states to retain responsibility over this area. We know they have not done a good job. They have not done a good job for decades; this is not something that has sprung up overnight. I remember when the Rann government came to power in 2002 one of the things we acted to do was to aim to reduce the waiting list for public dental care, and that is because in electorates like mine I am often shocked—and I do not have great teeth—by just how bad some people's teeth are, and often they are desperate to get treatment. There are a whole lot of impacts, obviously, on their lives. It is very hard to seek work and it is very hard to socially engage if you have got really poor teeth. Obviously it is very painful and affects your overall health.


The statistics are very serious and pretty brutal. In 2010 nearly half of children aged 10 had experienced tooth decay in their permanent teeth. That is out of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the University of Adelaide's Oral health and dental care in Australia: key facts and figures trends 2014. So we know that those statistics are not good. In terms of tooth decay in adults there is the effect of geography as well. The proportion of people with untreated decay varied from 23.5 per cent in major cities to 37.6 per cent in remote and very remote areas. An obvious point that we know about our health system is that the further you are from the GPO, the harder it is to get health treatment generally. We know that prior to the previous government's opening of cancer centres there were some pretty horrendous figures in relation to cancer and degrees of remoteness—the further you were away from the GPO affected your treatment—and it certainly does in dental as well. 


There is an income barrier as well. In 2004-06, the proportion of people with untreated decay was higher for those with a household income of less than $12,000 a year and lower where the household income was $100,000 or more. A higher proportion of uninsured people, 31.1 per cent, than insured people, 19.4 per cent, had untreated decay. So there is a gap related to geography and there is a gap related to income.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  You might learn a thing or two, Member for Mayo. I talked about the states before. I talked about their poor record—all of them, Labor and Liberal—in this area. So let us share the blame around. I know the member for Mayo is a centralist in his heart, just like his old boss, John Howard—a great believer in the federal government. We saw that in their ideology in Work Choices—the commitment to a single, central system in this country. It is something that I think is spread in the coalition. We would like to see that.


But back to the statistics about dental. About one in three cardholder adults had untreated decay, 32.9 per cent, compared to less than one in four non-cardholders, 22.9 per cent. Obviously there are big impacts related to geography and income in your ability to access dental care. These are all mapped out in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the University of Adelaide's report. It notes similar things in terms of gum disease, where age has an effect, gender has an effect and geography certainly has an effect. In terms of gum disease, 36.3 per cent of those living in remote areas had gum disease compared to 22.1 per cent living in major cities. In terms of income and gum disease, people on lower household incomes generally were more likely to have gum disease than those on higher incomes, varying from 42.3 per cent for those in households earning less than $12,000 per year to 14.3 per cent for those in households earning $100,000 or more. A lower proportion of the insured, 19.4 per cent, than the uninsured, 27 per cent, had gum disease. Cardholders had higher rates of periodontal disease than non-cardholders—some 33.6 per cent compared to 19.5 per cent, respectively.


These are pretty stark figures. We know that what this government is doing will not help these figures. We know that. We know of their plans in health generally—some $50 billion worth of cuts and the GP tax. It is a tax which cascades from your GP waiting room into the place where you get your blood tests and into the place where you get your scans. And if you have to go back through the process to see your doctor again to get more tests, to get more scans, then the $7 cascades over and over again. We know that those opposite are committed to that GP tax and they are committed to the $50 billion worth of cuts.


We know that one of the things they did in the last budget was also basically to defer a $390 million partnership. There are 400,000 people on dental waiting lists around the country and in some states this funding has helped to cut waiting lists by half. We know that if you let those waiting lists blow out the problems get worse. I have heard other speakers say, 'Why did the previous government start with children?' That is because prevention is better than cure and universality is an important thing. One of the things it does is it lets people see their doctor or their dentist before problems get out of hand, before people have to have more extensive work and before they have to be, God forbid, hospitalised. We talk about some 20,000 children across the country being hospitalised for avoidable dental operations and interactions, you know that prevention is better than cure. It is much cheaper, too—that is the thing. There is a saving in it for the Commonwealth, there is a saving in it for the states and there is a saving in it ultimately for the community.


We know that the delay of the $390 million national partnership programs is going to be a disaster. Griffith University Professor of Dental Research Newell Johnson said:


It's certainly going to make it worse for people who rely on the public system. It's high time we realised that dental health is as important as any other part of the body.


Australian Dental Association President Dr Karin Alexander said waiting lists could double or triple, depending on the delay:


Then the waiting lists are going to grow and you are going to have people sitting there in pain at once again.


It is not good enough for this nation, which is wealthy, which has experience of universal health care in Medicare—a reform that was hard fought for in the Whitlam era. It was hard fought for then; it was hard fought for by the Hawke government, which went down the Medicare path and managed to institute it into our public life, make it untouchable for those opposite—and they will find the GP tax that they are so committed to will be their undoing. But it is not good enough to simply say that dental care should be left out of Medicare, that it should be a haves and have-nots system, that it should be a system where your health is dependent on your income and your ability to pay for a service that is vital for your interaction with the community, for your place as a citizen in this community. And if there is one thing we should learn from this debate it is that these schemes where the Commonwealth is fiddling about, trying to fix up what the states have not the wit, the inclination or the resources to do is an error. We should look at putting dental care in its rightful place in our public health.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-10-22,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:08):  I am pleased to rise on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. As this is a health related bill, I would like to firstly address my comments to rebut some of the points made by members of the opposition during this debate.


We have heard this common phrase throughout many of the members of the opposition's speeches about 'cuts to health spending'. I am not sure, but I think maybe in their talking points members of the opposition are told: 'Just keep repeating this, time after time after time. Never mind the facts, and then maybe it might become a truth.' I have more faith in members of the Australian public to look at what the actual facts are and determining those facts and seeing if they are being misled.


The facts are that for overall health spending this financial year there is a nine per cent increase—this government is putting $1.3 billion extra into health spending this financial year. Next financial year, on top of that $1.3 billion, there is yet another nine per cent—or $1.4 billion—increase in health spending. And in the financial year after that, the third financial year of this government's budget, there will be yet another nine per cent increase. That is another $1.5 million, on top of all those other increases, that is going to our hospitals from this federal government. So if members of the opposition come in here and think that a nine per cent increase every year for the next three years is not enough, it is up to them to simply say how much more they are going to put in, but most importantly where the money will come from. Where will the money come from if a nine per cent—$1.3 billion to $1.5 billion—increase each year in our health spending by this federal government is not enough? How much more do they want and where will that money come from?


Getting onto the exact provisions of this bill: to explain the details of this bill and the necessity for it, it is necessary to do a review of history to see how we have come to this stage. There is the concept that this government would like to see more money invested in dental care across the nation, but there is simply no such thing as free health care or free dental care. Somebody has to pay for it; the money has to come for it from somewhere. There is no such thing as Magic Pudding economics. At the end of the day the bills have to be paid by someone.


To go back to the origins of this bill we need to go back to 1996, when the previous coalition government were first elected. What they inherited at that time was a budget in deficit and $96 billion worth of accumulated debt—that was their inheritance. But even more importantly, they also inherited a liability to pay interest on that debt of $9.5 billion in the first year. So rather than having $9.5 billion to spend on all the many things that we needed in our society, $9.5 billion worth of taxes had to be raised, taken out of the economy and used to pay the interest bill on the previous government's debt. And what we saw was a successful government; we saw they were successful because they created opportunity. They encouraged entrepreneurs to get out there and take risks, to experiment with their new business ideas and to innovate: that is what created the wealth and prosperity, so the money started to flow into the federal Treasury, which allowed us to slowly pay down the debt; to run a surplus year after year and to slowly wind back that debt.


One of the most important things the previous government did to wind that debt back was to lower company tax rates. It often sounds quite counterintuitive, but by lowering company tax rates the Howard and Costello government actually got more money in the coffers. For example, in the first year of the Howard and Costello government company tax rates were 36 per cent; about 3.3 per cent of GDP was raised in company taxes, something close to about $19 billion. But what the Howard and Costello government did was lower those tax rates; they wound those company tax rates back to 30 per cent. Now for those who do not understand how the economy works they would simply say, 'That will cause revenue to the government to fall', but the exact opposite happened. By lowering those company tax rates, by giving individuals and companies and businesses and small businesses the incentive to go out there and invest because of a lower company tax rate, we saw an expansion of the economy. What we also saw was the percentage of total GDP raised by company taxes increase, and increase substantially, at a lower rate of company tax.


So then we move forward to about 2005 or 2006. By then, after good economic management for close to a decade, we had finally been able to pay back that $96 billion worth of Labor debt. But most importantly, because there was no debt, there was no interest bill that the government had to finance. That freed up money to fund a lot of the social programs that are so desperately needed in our society. One of those social programs put in by the then health minister, now the Prime Minister, was the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. This is one of the dividends of good economic management: when you have government keeping the budget in surplus and the economy running, the benefits and dividends you get allow you to spend on social programs. That Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, established during the Howard government by the now Prime Minister, provided $4,250 every two years for private dental treatment for people who had a chronic dental disease. Twenty million services were provided to over one million Australians who benefited under that scheme. One million Australians were the recipients of that good economic benefit—that dividend—through the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It was the most successful scheme for curing dental disease and dental issues in our nation's history.


But what happened when the Labor government came to power? We saw reckless and wasteful spending, and one of the saddest things of all was that they tried to delegitimise the success of the previous Howard government. They went out and criticised the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. What they did so they could take it away—because they wanted to cut costs to try to wind their budget back—was go out looking for scapegoats. Remember, one million Australians received benefits under this scheme. So they went out looking for scapegoats and the scapegoats they found were the dentists who had made a mistake filling out their paperwork. That is simply what they had done: they had made a genuine mistake filling out the paperwork. Of course, the previous Labor government came out and said this was rorting. They found a few cases—a handful of cases—out of one million Australians who received treatment under the program, and that is the reason they gave for cutting this scheme off. The true reason was they were too embarrassed to admit this was a successful scheme brought in by the previous health minister, then opposition leader, and current Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.


This is what this bill addresses. It enables those so-called debts that were created—debts the government claims are owed by dentists—to be wiped off. They are not genuine debts; the services were performed. They are simply the result of an error of paperwork. We all know how hard it is to fill out government forms and paperwork. Only the other day I was at a volunteer awards ceremony in southern Sydney with all the volunteers. There were many worthy volunteers in that room. There were rural firefighters; people who volunteer in our hospitals; people who volunteer in our aged-care sector; and people who volunteer with our kids with disabilities. But the overall winner was a group called the 'form-filling helpers'. Their specific volunteer contribution to society is to help citizens fill out government forms.


This is why you cannot simply go back and look at a form in which there has been a slight discrepancy and try to take away the money that was paid to dentists for work they did in good faith—to claw that money back. That is what this bill addresses. It winds back and brings in amendments to make sure those so-called debts, where the work was done in good faith, are repealed. Without delaying the House any further, I commend this bill to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:19):  I speak in support of the amendment to the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. It is well known that bad oral health can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life. Untreated dental decay, as well as causing pain and infection, can affect nutritional status and growth and cause issues such as sleep disturbance, poor concentration and other behavioural impacts. Addressing oral health in children and young people in particular can significantly improve lifelong oral health, which is a key determinant of health and wellbeing throughout a person's life.


In my electorate of Kingsford Smith, particularly among young children, dental health is a real issue and as such it sparked a local public health initiative to tackle the problem. I am pleased and proud to say that the charity arm of the mighty South Sydney Rabbitohs, Souths Cares, launched an oral health care program on 8 April this year, designed to help spread the message of 'clean well, drink well' and the importance of oral hygiene for young people in South Sydney. Accompanied by graduate students from the University of Sydney, lead member of the Souths Cares team and former first grade rugby league player Rhys Wesser launched the program's first session at La Perouse for children from kindergarten to year 2. Rhys began by reading the children an Indigenous Dreamtime inspired story called The healthy tribe: 'I can help my body stay well'. The book aims to educate children about oral health and general health and it focuses on the oral health message 'eat well, drink well and play well'. The story is about a young boy named Marley who talks about his journey gaining the knowledge to live a happy and healthy life, which is told through stories of the Biripi and Worimi people. These tales were developed so that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people could gain the knowledge to improve their health in a culturally appropriate way. I congratulate Souths Cares and all concerned with this organisation for the work they are doing to promote better health care, particularly among young Indigenous students in my community. That is an example of one of the oral healthcare programs that runs in my electorate.


Labor, of course, considers dental health and dental care a vital component of good public health. In this area, it is fair to say, we have put our money where our mouth is. In August 2012, Labor introduced a $4 billion dental program aimed at providing access to government subsidised dental care to millions of children and adults on low incomes or in rural areas. As part of our plan to address increasingly poor oral health among Australians—in particular, low- and middle-income families—the unprecedented six year dental health reform package included $2.7 billion for around 3.4 million Australian children who will be eligible for subsidised dental care; $1.3 billion for around 1.4 million additional services for adults on low incomes, including pensioners, concession card holders and those with special needs, who will have better access to dental care in the public system; and $225 million for dental capital and workforce, which will be provided to support expanded services for people living in outer metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas.


This bill will create a waiver provision for the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and make a number of amendments to the operation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. When Labor was in government an audit of the activity of the CDDS detected a high rate of noncompliance with the reporting requirements for dentists. As a result of this audit, activity debts were raised against dentists found to be noncompliant. The last speaker, from the other side, mentioned that it was his belief that this was one of the most successful healthcare programs that had ever been run in Australia. My experience from talking to GPs in our community was that, unfortunately, the CDDS was being rorted by a small number of doctors and dentists. I spoke to a number of GPs in my community who gave examples of people requesting certificates to say they had chronic dental diseases and required dental treatment under the scheme through Medicare when in fact they did not fit that category but had heard from others that there was an opportunity to get free dental health care through this program. That was uncovered in an audit of this program that was run by the previous government. That is why the program was shut down. It was found that taxpayers' valuable dollars were being wasted—admittedly in a small number of cases—and there was no ability to put in place measures and other safeguards to rein in the rorting that was occurring in the scheme. That is why Labor acted to replace that program and make changes to the program. On the whole, I think the targeted program that Labor put in place, particularly to target those people on low to middle incomes and children, has been effective.


This bill also makes amendments to the Dental Benefits Act and the Health Insurance Act to align compliance powers and make those powers applicable to the CDBS. It also amends both acts so that the Professional Services Review scheme can be applied to dental services provided under the CDBS. The CDBS commenced on 1 January 2014 and provides to those aged from two to 17, who meet a means test, access to up to $1,000 in benefits over two calendar years for basic dental treatment. This program is an investment in prevention. We know that the oral health of our children is the best predictor of oral health as adults. We know that children from low-income families and low-socioeconomic areas have inferior dental health to those from more affluent areas. That is why this scheme was targeted and means tested for children who fit those criteria. The CDBS replaces the Medicare Teen Dental Plan and provides more comprehensive coverage through a greater range of services to a larger group of children.


Labor also takes very seriously the issue of inappropriate professional behaviour and supports the application of compliance powers as well as the operation of the Professional Services Review scheme. The dental health reform package that Labor implemented is delivering a better and fairer system of dental care for Australians. It is an accessible and affordable scheme that focuses on prevention to deliver future improvements in Australia's oral health. From its commencement on 1 January 2014 until 1 March 2014, over 84,000 children received dental treatment under the CDBS, including over 26,000 children from outside of major cities. That is proof positive that this scheme is working and delivering its intended benefits without the rorting that we saw under the previous scheme that was put in place by the Howard government. In 2013, over 200,000 public dental patients received treatment because of Labor's program and its funding of the public dental waiting list blitz. It is because of Labor that over 280,000 adults now have better oral health as a result of free or subsidised care under the dental health reform package.


I am proud of Labor's improvements to dental health. I am proud that Labor has increased accessibility to dental health through a targeted scheme to ensure that low-income families in this country get the necessary support to access basic dental healthcare services and, importantly, that children, particularly those from low- to middle-income families and low-socioeconomic areas, have access to those dental schemes. It is a great legacy from the previous Labor government. This bill will tidy up the deficiencies in the Howard government's Chronic Dental Disease Scheme and will ensure that the legacy is removed forever. I commend the bill, with the amendment, to the House.

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (09:02):  I want to again extend thanks to the shadow minister for moving the second reading amendment. In my previous contribution I spoke about the important policy reform that was undertaken by the last government in the area of dental care. We have known for a long time in Australia that dental care has been in many respects the poor cousin of health care not for any kind of moral or sound public policy reasons but really through the different ways it has been managed by governments. In 2012 Labor announced the biggest investment in dental care since Federation. It was an enormous reform that has changed the situation for so many Australians, especially Australian children, who were the big focus of that scheme, and lower income adults, whom all of us in this chamber know are those who have really borne the brunt of what has happened to dental care over successive governments both state and federal.


In my last contribution I was talking a little bit about some of the concerns we hold on this side of the House about the progress of this important issue through this parliament. I am very sad to say that we have seen a pretty destructive pattern from those on the other side of the House. They appear to have come into government with very few ideas of their own and instead have put their energies towards busily unpicking some of the really good things Labor did while in government. I think we heard the beginnings of some quite disturbing rhetoric from the minister when he gave his second reading contribution. He talked about these early concerns that he had with the dental program. He talked about how they would be monitoring this program very carefully. Unfortunately, we have heard this story before from that very same minister. Whether it was promises to make no cuts to health and then immediately attempting to introduce a new tax to make changes and cuts to state funding to health, whether it was school and university funding, all of these things went through this same pattern of behaviour. I want to put the government on notice that with the leadership of the shadow minister we will be very much holding them to account on upholding what has been an important reform that was made by the Rudd and Gillard governments.


Of course, much of the bill pertains to administration of the transfer of arrangements that were made in 2012, and we are very happy to support those detailed elements of the policy, but I say again that we will be watching. It is the same robust protection that we have turned on Medicare and other iconic elements of our system of social protection that we will also be putting onto the dental reforms.

 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (09:05):  I rise today to speak on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. A strange sense of deja vu comes over me as I again have to fix another one of Labor's bungled attempts at finding their elusive surplus. When the Labor government decided to axe the coalition's Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme we lost a great service. That scheme provided over 17 million services to approximately one million patients from 2007 to 2012. It provided $4,250 in dental benefits over two years for eligible patients with a chronic health condition. Then Labor cut the plan and had no backup system until 2014. It put those with chronic dental conditions out into the wilderness with no plan in place—and Labor preaches its concern and regard for the health of our nation! To this I say: rubbish, absolute rubbish. 


Labor's alternative was just another program that did nothing but plunge the disadvantaged people into even worse circumstances. Dental care should be a basic right as an Australian citizen. Constituents in my electorate of Paterson, who cannot afford any more cuts in funding, wrote to me in droves as they discovered that a basic service like dental care was taken away from them. Pensioners make up a large percentage of my electorate and they are most likely to have other health issues that can get worse without regular dental check-ups and treatment. Parents with young children were told they would need to wait at least 13 months until they could get their children's growing teeth examined. Working families living in remote rural areas, who do not have immediate access to a public dental hospital, had to incur lost time, travel costs and invariably accommodation costs for what should be a given service to taxpayers. The disabled and the unemployed are already working within tight budgets and tough situations, especially the disabled where every aspect of their health needs to be carefully managed. These disadvantaged people had already endured other cuts by Labor when searching for a surplus—a surplus that was never achieved. The Labor government failed yet again. The Labor government failed to service those most in need—the chronically ill—yet they preach their commitment and their concern to the disadvantaged of this great nation.


The purpose of this bill that we are debating today is to restore sanity to the system. We have an opportunity to help those dentists who were so overwhelmed with patients that they did not have the opportunity to do the paperwork. The Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill of 2014 will waive debts for dentists who, under the former Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, did nothing more than make minor paperwork errors and who have been waiting for way too long for an adequate resolution. The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was set up in 2007 and provided access to benefits of up to $4,250 over two calendar years for patients with chronic health conditions. Eighty per cent of people who accessed this scheme were concession card holders. It was the country's biggest investment ever into dental care and in 2012 the former Labor government closed it down. For what purpose? Political gain. Another failure to add to the former Labor government's cap.


The scheme included a technical reporting requirement. Dentists needed to provide treatment plans to GPs along with a quote and a treatment plan to patients prior to commencing treatment. The former Labor government sought to use dentists' technical oversights as a means of discrediting the scheme. They introduced a change that saw dentists who did not meet all of these reporting requirements pursued for repayment of the full amount of the Medicare benefits paid under the scheme although in most cases the dentists had met all other requirements of the scheme and, importantly, had provided much needed services to the patients. It should be all about the patients and their health care.


I understand that some believe this scheme was scrapped due to an abundance of dentists who committed fraud and did not comply with the other legal requirements of the program. This was clearly not the case. The majority of dentists provided services in good faith and treated their patients with the care they needed. They will now be rewarded for their service. It was yet another shameful act that a former Labor government used as a political power play.


The Council of Australian Governments Reform Council has released its latest snapshot on the progress of the Commonwealth against the 2008 National Healthcare Agreement. The Healthcare in Australia report notes six areas of concern. One of them is that more Australians are putting off dental care because it is seen as too expensive. It is a worrying precedent that some Australians are not going to see their dentist, orthodontist or other dental professional because of costs. The report finds that nearly one in five—18.8 per cent—of Australians aged over 15 put off seeing a dentist. The statistics are worse in our poorer communities. Amongst the poorer communities, one in four people put off going to see a dental professional because of the costs. If you go to the doctor, particularly in a disadvantaged area, it is bulk-billed; there is no cost to the patient. But, if you go to a dentist, there is a significant cost, and it is a big deterrent to people.


According to an Australian Bureau of Statistics report, Census of population and housing: socio-economic indexes for areas (SEIFA), my electorate of Paterson has a population of 230,235 people. This report notes that, out of 722,685 doctor visits, 566,357 were bulk-billed. That is over 78 per cent of my residents who need bulk-billing. With that high a percentage for standard GP visits, you can only imagine the number who could not access dental health specialists. 


Dental health is critical to maintaining good health. It is especially important when you already have other medical ailments, other health issues, to manage. This is increasingly common when you are in the older segment of our society, when you are elderly. In my electorate of Paterson, senior citizens make up a large part of my community—self-funded retirees and age pensioners. In Paterson I have 36,319 constituents aged 60 and over, who make up 28.4 per cent of the electorate. In Australia the number of constituents aged 60 and over is approximately 4.2 million, which equates to 19.6 per cent. So you can see we are batting above the average in terms of the elderly in my electorate of Paterson. By 2037, nearly 23 per cent of the nation's population will be 65 years old or older, and this equates to more than 6.4 million people by 2037.


As my constituents get older, they encounter more healthcare needs. As the following examples will explain, their dental health can prove interconnected with their existing conditions when it comes to treatment options. I was contacted by a constituent who wanted to complain about the axing of the Labor government's scheme. This person is 66 and was diagnosed with lupus, with secondary Sjogren's syndrome. Despite surgery on her saliva ducts, this lady's glands were producing a minimum amount of saliva. Due to this, her teeth were deteriorating rapidly and she required a lot of dental procedures. Also factor in the cost of the additional trips to Westmead Hospital's Specialist Dental Centre, which involved hotel stays overnight. With her condition consisting of six extra issues caused by the first, she was seeing eight different specialists in all, so her medical bills were high, and, with the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme being closed down, she was concerned about the future of her health. I can fully understand why. She would not be on her own in that respect. My electorate is rural and, in parts, quite remote, so any visit to Sydney is quite a journey, and when you are sick it would be quite exhausting.


Another resident contacted my office. She too was concerned when the scheme was closed down. She was over 60 and being treated for breast cancer. This terrible disease had her enduring surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. In addition to all this, these services were causing problems with her bones and her teeth. Her GP referred her to a dentist under the scheme, but six weeks later the scheme was shut down. So not only does this resident have to endure the biggest battle of her life with breast cancer; she also has to take on dental issues as a second, encore round.


And it is not just seniors who are finding it tough. A resident in my electorate who goes by the name of Angel was seriously injured in a car accident when he was in his early 40s and was affected by the axing of the chronic disease dental plan. In this accident he broke his back in three places and his pelvic plate in five places and completely snapped his right hip joint. He broke his left leg and both his ankles and broke his heel bones off. He also received muscular damage and torn nerve endings. He spent four months in traction and six months in a wheelchair, and once he finally regained the ability to walk he was slapped with a $25,000 bill. So, already, Angel has taken on his fair share of the pain, and that is quite a recovery that he will have to make. Following all this, he has to take heavy medication for the pain and the nerve damage, which has an effect on his teeth. He estimates that his teeth will rot within a couple of years if he does not go to a dentist on a regular basis—which of course he cannot, without the scheme that was in place.


Now my constituent has to choose between going further and further into debt and losing his teeth at the age of 45. And I have to ask: how could the former government have been so cruel to those who needed their help the most? When you are fighting cancer you have to keep up good dental health because of the amount of surgery you will be having. That is why it is quite concerning for a senior citizen, whom I have mentioned before in this place, who is fighting breast cancer. She is having surgeries as a result of chemotherapy and if she does not find the money to fund her dental treatments she cannot continue to fight the cancer. As I asked at the time, when Labor was cancelling the scheme, what kind of a heartless government would cancel such a vital scheme that delivered so much to people outside the major cities? Let me take you back to 2012, when we were first discussing the ridiculous concept of scrapping the scheme. I told you about Margaret Rylands from Forster, who had been living with diabetes for 52 years. Her husband had to have five bypass operations and then they had little money coming in. They also had bad teeth. Now, with no scheme in place, if their teeth get worse or her husband needs another operation, they could be in real trouble.


Let me explain. I know of a young man in Forster who had jaw cancer. He needed to keep good teeth while battling this disease, at it could affect his general health. If he got so much as a gum infection in a tooth, it would flow on to his bones and down to his jaw. Now he has cancer and an infection, and that infection could kill him. In my area of an ever-growing number of retirees, this could be catastrophic. If one of my elderly residents falls down and breaks their hip, they will need surgery. If they have bad teeth, they will now have to find the funds to first fix their teeth before they can even get onto the waitlist for a hip replacement. This means that they will need to find extra help just to get around, and then wait until their dental health is cleared before they can take the steps towards independence again.


As I said earlier, I yet again find myself having to fix another one of Labor's bungled programs. In the past year we have had to deal with many of their shoddy schemes—policies like disastrous home insulation schemes, the failed solar rebate, the implementation of crippling carbon taxes and mining taxes, and the lapse in border protection. All of these were especially felt in my electorate. And of course there were the never-ending issues with digital television, which I raised yesterday. To fix one more mess and assist the overworked, undercredited dental health specialists in my area is important. This bill will address that in part. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-10-22,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:18):  In Australia, you should be able to get dental care on Medicare. Going to the dentist should be like going to the doctor: you can bring out your Medicare card and have treatment, in the same way. The mouth is part of the body, and if you keep your mouth and your teeth healthy you in fact significantly reduce the risk of contracting other, potentially more serious, diseases. But in Australia, when it comes to healthcare funding, we treat the mouth as being separate to the rest of the body. As we have been reminded, yesterday in particular, there were struggles in the initial establishment of Medicare, or a form of universal health care in this country, and it was resisted. But it was ultimately accepted and is now one of the things that people like about Australia.


The cost of going to the dentist, however, is getting to the point where many people are putting off treatment for themselves or for their family members. And we are seeing, increasingly, people presenting to GPs and in some instances to hospitals because of preventable diseases or health issues that have arisen because they did not get their teeth seen to in time. It is not only a health issue; it is also a social justice issue—you are less likely to get that job if you turn up to the interview with fewer teeth. Someone who turns up to a job interview with a full set of teeth, looking good and in good health stands a much better chance.


Prior to the 2010 election, the scheme that we had in this country, the CDDS scheme we are discussing here today as part of this legislation, was a measure that the federal government was taking towards health care and dental care. But by no means was it universal. It did not mean that you could front up to the dentist with your Medicare card and say, 'I need some treatment.' In fact, it only addressed the situation when it had got to that end where no-one wants to get to: the chronic stage. There was no federal government scheme to help people with the cost of going to see the dentist to stop them getting into that situation in the first place. There was no federal government scheme before 2010 that would allow you to do something akin to taking your Medicare card to the dentist to get support.


The 2010 election saw a power-sharing parliament. In 2010, thanks to the people of Melbourne, we were in the position of sitting down and saying to the government: we will support you but we will support you on conditions. One of those conditions was putting a price on pollution and taking world-leading action on global warming. Another of those conditions, in an agreement that I was very pleased to sign, concerned reform of our dental scheme.


During the course of the last parliament, we commissioned some expert analysis from the Oral Health Council to say: if you wanted to start putting dental care into Medicare and making dental care universally available in this country in the same way that other forms of health care are, how would you go about it given that there may be a limited budget to spend? Also, from a straight health perspective, what is the best way to go? That council considered a number of options and reported back to the government and to us. They said very clearly: 'We can give you a few ways to go but here is what we think is best: the best way to improve the dental health of the Australian population is to start with the kids, to start with young people. 'Because if we can create a generation of young people who have no substantial dental health issues and know how to maintain themselves then we are going to, first of all, make a much healthier Australian public but, secondly, we are going to reduce the burden for generations to come on doctors and on hospitals who, at the moment, are seeing those people who are suffering from diseases that they could have prevented if they had only got to the dentist in time.'


So with that in mind, we crafted some legislation and some policies in the last parliament that said let's take Australia on the journey towards getting dental care into Medicare. Let us start making going to the dentist like going to the doctor. We followed the report of the experts, which was to say let's start, first of all, making universal dental care available to children. So we began by saying: if you are eligible for certain family tax benefits, you can now take your kid to the dentist, present your Medicare card and get a certain amount of treatment for free. We made sure in the package that was negotiated that that would not be an excuse for states to pull back on funding. In fact, we made sure there was funding available for states to expand their public health system so that people, including pensioners, who were on healthcare cards now had an expanded public health system to get into.


We were aware, because the experts told us, that this was not something we were going to be able to flick the switch to overnight. There actually were not enough dentists and health professionals in Australia at the time to enable the flicking of the switch to a universal dental healthcare scheme, so there was a proposal to train up some more health professionals to ensure that in time everyone would be able to get access to universal dental health if we proceeded on this plan. Part of that reform involved rolling the existing CDDS into this new scheme. Part of that was because the government insisted that there was not an unlimited amount of money and therefore it had to be found from somewhere and so should be found from this, but part of it was also a policy question. Rather than picking people up when they get to the extreme end, let's make sure there is support available for healthcare card holders, pensioners and those who cannot afford it and let's start making this a universal scheme where you can get access to it no matter how much money you earn and where the mouth starts to be treated as part of the body.


In that respect, I think the government, in moving and speaking to this bill, needs to tone down some of the rhetoric about the reasons for the closure of the CDDS. They may have a view that there was an ideologically mounted attack or it was about some health minister or other not liking a particular scheme, but I can tell you that from our point of view the reform of the scheme was necessary because it was a lot of money going to a few people whereas the Greens believe in the principle of universal health care. We would much rather see money being spent across the board on everyone regardless of income and on improving the dental health of the whole of the Australian population. This should not be an excuse to attack a particular political party by saying that a minister had a particular vendetta. We should be having the debate here about how to spend Australian taxpayers' money to get the best return and to ensure that everyone in this country can go to the dentist no matter how much money they earn.


I cay say that, as someone who represents the electorate with the most public housing of any electorate in the country, there are many people who have just put off going to the dentist because they were not able to afford it. In some states, there have been very good programs run by the state governments for children through schools and through other public health providers. That has given children some access to it; but, for families in public housing, if something went wrong with their kids' teeth, prior to us morphing the CDDS into this new universal scheme there was nowhere for them to go. Parents who did not have a lot of money—and by definition that is what those in public housing are—were just not able to take their kids to the dentist. By 'kids' we are talking about people under 18 as well, not necessarily only those who are in primary school. I something goes wrong, they just could not take them to the dentist. Then that festers, and they are the people who in their 20s find themselves with fewer teeth than others. They are the people who, as they go on into their 30s and 40s find themselves at greater risk of heart disease because they do not have all their teeth in their mouth in good condition.


I am very proud that, working with the other members of the last parliament, we were able to change that so that low-income families in my electorate and right around the country can now take their children to the dentist, present their Medicare card and be able to get some free services. That is a good start, and we need to build on that.


Rather than having an ideological and small-minded partisan debate in this place, we should be having a debate about how we can make dental health care universal and how can we make it so that not only children, especially children of families up to a certain point, but everyone is able to front up to their dentist with their Medicare card just as they do with their doctor. There are plenty of places to find the money for it if we wanted to. We give billions of dollars each year in subsidies to the big banks, we give billions of dollars in subsidies to big miners and fossil fuel companies. If you asked Australians: 'Would you rather the government dollars go towards giving the likes of Gina Rinehart subsidised diesel fuel or would you rather the government use that money to ensure that everyone can go to the dentist when they need it?'—I know what people would say.


That is the debate that we need to have here because we do not have a budget crisis, as we hear from the government. If anything, we have a revenue crisis. We are not raising the revenue that we need to fund the services that Australians expect and that is the debate that we should be having here. People in Australia like Medicare and they want dental care to be part of it. Let us go down that road.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-10-22,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (09:31):  This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008. It allows the operation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule to be overseen in a similar fashion to the Medicare oversight process. Not only will the professional service review process be able to be applied to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule but also the CEO of Medicare can request documents to substantiate Chronic Disease Dental Scheme billing is appropriate. These are sensible and appropriate measures that ensure compliance with the intent and design of the scheme.


I would just like to make some observations on this scheme and its history and some reflections on the previous government's dental policy and its development. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule commenced in January this year, but it is a leftover policy from the previous government. There has been a dental scheme absence, apart from state-based public dental schemes, since the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was axed in August and September 2012.


The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme was a great scheme, with a good clinical basis and intent, but, like in any government scheme, there were instances where either patients or dental practitioners were pushing the boundaries to a stage where the envelope was broken. I am very loath to say 'abuse' or 'fraud' but in some cases the intent and the administration of it was not ideal, and the response was not appropriate to the problem. In classic ALP fashion, rather than instituting compliance and oversight, which you would think any sensible administration would bring into play if it had concerns, it appears to me that it gave them the excuse to get rid of a scheme or a coalition achievement that actually had some runs on the board.


There also appeared to be the opportunity to save the previous administration a heap of money, because there was no replacement for about 14 months. They also summarily demanded in retrospect refunds of thousands of dollars from dentists who had supplied services to patients. The justification of that, to me, seems to be a technicality—that the dentist had not filled out part of the paperwork. This also reflects badly on the previous administration because, surely, with most transactions in business you check that the work has been done before you pay the provider. That tells me that they were not checking on the processes that they should have had in place in the first instance.


For many people in my electorate this scheme was a godsend, because there are lots of elderly people, concession card holders and pensioners in the electorate of Lyne who unfortunately, because of the generation they grew up in, had bad dentistry. They also have serious kidney, vascular and heart conditions. The Chronic Disease Dental Scheme in many instances prevented further disease. Even though it was being done late in life for many of these recipients, it was very preventive. If you have kidney disease, gingivitis, rotten teeth or you cannot eat good nutrition because you have no teeth, this was a godsend. Twenty-five per cent of the electorate of Lyne either have a concession card or are in receipt of a pension, so this change had massive ramifications for the electorate. When the axe fell, many were left in limbo. In some cases, they were halfway through their treatment program. Others who had committed to it were left high and dry and struggled on in chronic discomfort or had to commit to multiple extractions and false teeth.


I think the previous administration were so desperate to save money anywhere that they just saw this as an excuse to blame the dentists and give them an account rather than institute what we are doing with this amendment. We are instituting proper oversight of a scheme which is targeted to a different cohort altogether. Paradoxically, the two-year-old to 17-year-old cohort probably have the best teeth in the country. We are also instituting means-testing so that it is applied to people who really need the help.


I am sure the spin doctors were consulted heavily in the development and rollout of this scheme, because it is hard to criticise anything that is targeted at children. Everyone knows that if children have good nutrition, have a toothbrush that is used, have fluoride in their toothpaste and are not fed sweet drinks all the time, most of them should be left with healthy teeth and gums by the age of 17. I hope this really is a dental program and not a spin doctor program that was punched out in the dying days of the previous government.


The coalition government will certainly be monitoring and observing this scheme to make sure it has the outcome that was intended. We still need to address the other problem: with the summary execution of the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, many genuinely concerned and good practising dentists and dental practices were left with huge bills, in retrospect, months and years after they delivered good service. This is a classic case of using a fig-leaf response to cover up the deficiencies and inadequacies of the previous administration. The old saying 'Throwing out the baby with the bathwater' is applicable here. There were problems with the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, but, rather than fixing them, they got rid of the whole scheme altogether.


The amendments to section 34 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act, with oversight and the CEO of Medicare able to inquire, and with professional services review processes, will simplify the process of garnering the debts that were levied. It will also give the department the ability to waive the debts. It will not excuse fraud; it will not excuse abuse. Currently, the investigation process whereby money is retrieved is so laborious and long that the amount of funds expended in getting funds back costs as much as the returns. Also, I find that it was an affront to bill retrospectively professional people who were doing a good job for patients with chronic disease.


I commend these amendments to the House. As I have said on so many occasions, when you are in government you have to have good administration. This is a good legislative response to a problem that is now going to be addressed and fixed. I commend the bill and the amendment to the House.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2014-10-22,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (09:40):  I am speaking to the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. I think that the government has to be cognisant of the fact that we are a wealthy country—an extremely wealthy country by world standards. The government says that they are broke. There is a wonderful paper out about comparing the deficits of the allegedly terrible ALP government—and I probably would agree that it was a terrible government!—comparing Wayne Swan's deficit with the Menzies last budget and the massive deficit that was registered there. But, of course, they were made to sound like irrelevancies compared to the deficits registered by the Queensland government that I was part of.


It was made mention of with Gough Whitlam yesterday—I might seem like I am wandering off track here but I can assure you that I am not, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker—that there was a vote of no confidence in Gough because he sacrificed economic growth for social reform. It was a very perceptive comment and, in my opinion, very accurate. There will be those who argue that social reform needed to come. Where I am going with this is that there has never been a government in human history that has not accused the outgoing government of making the government broke, 'We've got no money and therefore we can't do these things.' That is just standard operating procedure. After 41 years in parliament I think that every minister probably says it at least once every second day.


Where I am going with this is that here is this great, rich country—one of the richest countries on earth—and it cannot supply dental services to its citizens. My homeland is North Queensland's midwest, the country between Mount Isa and Townsville. I have lived there all my life and four or five generations before me. In that area, the four main towns in the midwest are Cloncurry, Richmond, Julia Creek and Hughenden. There are may be seven, eight or 10,000 people living in those towns. For my entire time as a state member I can never remember us having fewer than three dentists serving that area.


Normally when I have rung up over the last 10 or 15 years, there have been no dentists in the area. A person can go from Julia Creek on a 400- to 600-kilometre round trip to Mount Isa to see a dentist. A person in Hughenden can go to Charters Towers—a 500- or 600-kilometre round trip. Or maybe he has to go on to Townsville. The costs of doing this—and the ability to be able to do this if you have a jo—are so high. That is in a remote area. Let me switch to the outer suburbs of Cairns, to Babinda. A good friend of mine came along to one of our meetings. He had taken out his own tooth on Channel 9 because he had waited for two years in pain. They had said, 'Oh, we had you on the top of the list but we had to put you down again.' This was after two years, he was in continuous pain and he realised that he was never going to get there. So he pulled the tooth out himself with a pair of pliers on Channel 9. Outrageous as that seems, it is a matter of public record; it was done on Channel 9. Similarly in Richmond another person pulled his own teeth out with a pair of pliers. So in this great wealthy nation there are people who go to the most primitive methods of medical treatment. With no painkillers or anything they haul their teeth out with a pair of pliers.


This is a very sad day for Australia. We are wasting the time of the House talking about an audit requirement. Quite frankly, the dentists I have spoken to have said: 'Of course there should be an audit requirement. Surely that does not have to go in legislation.' Any properly operated scheme anywhere does not need legislation to back it up. Just haul them in. Surely there is accounting oversight taking place now.


That is the bill as it stands. I was deeply disappointed when a minister who I considered to be quite a good minister, the now deputy leader of the Labor Party, abolished the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, which dealt with cases like the one I referred to on the outskirts of Cairns where an elderly person had to take his own tooth out. It came to grips with that sort of problem. The approach that had been used was very good, but that money was taken away and put into some prevention program for children. Yes, all right, there might be value in a prevention program for children, but I would have thought that giving every kid in Australia a toothbrush and the schools a tube of toothpaste and getting them to brush their teeth every morning would be 100 times more effective than putting something on a video screen and having a teacher talk to them. It would go in one ear and out the other. It would be very practical if they actually brush their teeth as part of the school curriculum.


We spoke all of yesterday about the legacy of Gough Whitlam. I most certainly would not be hypocritical enough to say it was an all-good legacy—and I would probably say something short of that. There is the provision of a great fund of money to address the real problems of Australia, such as the health problems. A government has no higher priority than that. There was a wonderful article in The DailyTelegraph that stated that the primary responsibility of government is to protect the people. It should be to protect their people from one of the most terrible pains that can be registered. I have had enormous pain in my life playing rugby league and other such activities—and I dealt a bit out too, I might add. There are some times when the pain of toothache can be really out of this world. Of course the Nazis used it as a torture device to get people to speak because it is one of the worst pains you can possibly have. People in Australia are taking the worst pain you can possibly have and they cannot get in to see a dentist. In my home town of Charters Towers there are two dentists. The last time I attempted to get in there was a three-month wait. If a dentist friend of mine in Townsville had not stayed back an extra hour, I might have been running around with the pliers to pull my own teeth out too.


The government is failing miserably in this area. I do not blame the minister and I do not blame the last minister. They have been given very limited resources. The federal Labor government was blaming the state Liberal governments and prior to that the Liberal federal government was blaming the state Labor governments. I checked this and found really neither were to blame in the sense that over a decade there has been an over 300 per cent increase in federal spending on health in the state of Queensland and also a 300 per cent increase in federal health spending.


In Queensland—and I suspect this may well be all over Australia—the long-serving president of the AMA in the state quoted the figure again and again that 16 years ago there were three hands-on health workers—nurses, doctors—for every backup staff, and now it is reversed. I spoke to 11 doctors that have served for over 15 years and each of them said that, yes, that figure would be about right. So we are carrying one of the most top-heavy—with administration and PR and a whole run of other people—health departments.


We had an example of what they do in Queensland. I am pleased the member for Leichhardt is here because I am sure he would back me up in this. Two of our doctors in Cairns had the temerity to say, 'A suspected Ebola patient came in here and they were just treated like an ordinary patient until somebody said they were an Ebola suspect and raced them off down to what was supposedly an isolation ward but really was just a ward down the end of the corridor effectively.' There was no particular characteristics of that ward that made it an isolation ward. Those doctors were immediately punished. Under the successive Labor governments in Queensland, there was a culture of fear that you were not supposed to speak up.


Heavens, in the Bundaberg hospital there is a man losing his leg from gangrene. This is not a hard thing to pick up. If any of my footballers break a limb, I would go down there to check myself to see there was no redness or swelling because you have got to move very quickly if you are dealing with something like gangrene. In the case in Bundaberg, this bloke visibly had gangrene and only one single nurse had the courage to speak up, which is an absolutely scalding indictment of the other people that worked in hospital who were quite happy to preserve their jobs to watch a man lose his leg. It was claimed in the press that 11 times that sort of incident was repeated in the Bundaberg hospital because everyone was too scared to speak out. The nurse who spoke up, of course, was punished immediately.


That terrible culture that surrounded the 'Doctor Death' incidents at the Bundaberg hospital is still there. It is alive and well and blossoming. Oh, an Ebola patient went into a general ward in hospital and we have got no ability to deal with them, and all of these health workers were exposed. What do we do? What we do is get anyone that opens their mouth. The answer is not: what we do is make sure we introduce protocols to protect our health workers in our hospitals, no. That is not what we did. We immediately moved to shut them up.


It is to do with the health department in Queensland making sure that they have a great PR message to take out there and nothing to do with the health and welfare of the people. You can look no further than the incidents of the so called 'Doctor Death' at the Bundaberg hospital and look no further than the two top nurses that are still stood down at that hospital for doing the right thing. They were punished for doing the right thing, and it is a scathing indictment upon the administration of the health department in Queensland.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (09:53):  It is a great opportunity to speak on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. This is a relatively uncontroversial bill but we are obviously having an important debate about dental care in our country. As the member for Ballarat said, oral health care is the missing link out of Medicare. I think there is a great deal of truth to that.


Oral health has been left to the states for a long time. What we have seen really out of the states' administration of this area is a system of haves and have-nots. We have seen over the last couple of decades the federal government, by necessity, become increasingly involved in the area of dental care. We can go right back to when I joined the Labor Party. I can remember the Keating government embarking on a program to reduce state waiting lists for public dental care, because those waiting lists had grown so long—not just the time you waited to get seen but the time you waited to actually get the treatment. So, there were often two waiting lists: the waiting list to get an assessment and then the waiting list to get the treatment. And they blew out, particularly in New South Wales at that time. The member for Kennedy talks about people removing their own teeth. Sadly, sometimes people were going to that extreme, taking drastic action themselves, because of these terrible waiting lists.


So there was an endeavour by the Keating government at that time to address this matter, and we saw even the Howard government—no friend to Medicare, no friend to universality or to getting involved in state responsibilities—embark on the CDSS. We know that that was a poorly targeted scheme. It was meant to cost $90 million a year and ended up costing $80 million a month. Now, maybe that is because there is vast demand out there; I do not know. But one of the things we also know about it is that more than 20 per cent of the recipients were not concession card holders, were not pensioners, and more than 20 per cent of the spending was on high-cost restorative services. So, that was the record of the Howard government. They were getting involved in this area, I guess out of necessity, because the states were doing such a poor job. We all know that there were problems in that scheme, and those opposite should not try to run from them.


The previous Labor government, of course, embarked on a $4.1 billion scheme, and that was designed basically to clear waiting lists to create a workforce—and not just a workforce in capital cities but a workforce outside of capital cities—and also focused on children's health. Children's health is particularly important. The member for Ballarat in her speech talked about some terrible statistics—that 20,000 children under the age of 10 are hospitalised each year because of avoidable dental issues and that by the age of 15 six out of every 10 kids have tooth decay. We know that this is not just because they do not have toothbrushes or because of sugary drinks; it is because they do not see a dentist. A dentist is an integral part of oral health care.


The impact of oral disease is particularly important. The Department of Health, on its website—the National Advisory Council on Dental Health—talks about the National Oral Health Plan for 2004 to 2013. It says:


Oral health is fundamental to overall health, wellbeing and quality of life. A healthy mouth enables people to eat, speak and socialise without pain, discomfort or embarrassment. The impact of oral disease on people's everyday lives is subtle and pervasive, influencing eating, sleep, work and social roles. The prevalence and recurrences of these impacts constitutes a silent epidemic.


It goes on to talk about the international research that indicates associations between chronic oral infections and lung disease, stroke, low birth weight and premature birth. Associations have been made between periodontal disease and diabetes in international literature as well.


So, we know that oral health is vital to the health of the rest of the body. And the statistics that are there scream out for a shift away from the system of haves and have-nots that is endemic in allowing the states to retain responsibility over this area. We know they have not done a good job. They have not done a good job for decades; this is not something that has sprung up overnight. I remember when the Rann government came to power in 2002 one of the things we acted to do was to aim to reduce the waiting list for public dental care, and that is because in electorates like mine I am often shocked—and I do not have great teeth—by just how bad some people's teeth are, and often they are desperate to get treatment. There are a whole lot of impacts, obviously, on their lives. It is very hard to seek work and it is very hard to socially engage if you have got really poor teeth. Obviously it is very painful and affects your overall health.


The statistics are very serious and pretty brutal. In 2010 nearly half of children aged 10 had experienced tooth decay in their permanent teeth. That is out of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the University of Adelaide's Oral health and dental care in Australia: key facts and figures trends 2014. So we know that those statistics are not good. In terms of tooth decay in adults there is the effect of geography as well. The proportion of people with untreated decay varied from 23.5 per cent in major cities to 37.6 per cent in remote and very remote areas. An obvious point that we know about our health system is that the further you are from the GPO, the harder it is to get health treatment generally. We know that prior to the previous government's opening of cancer centres there were some pretty horrendous figures in relation to cancer and degrees of remoteness—the further you were away from the GPO affected your treatment—and it certainly does in dental as well. 


There is an income barrier as well. In 2004-06, the proportion of people with untreated decay was higher for those with a household income of less than $12,000 a year and lower where the household income was $100,000 or more. A higher proportion of uninsured people, 31.1 per cent, than insured people, 19.4 per cent, had untreated decay. So there is a gap related to geography and there is a gap related to income.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  You might learn a thing or two, Member for Mayo. I talked about the states before. I talked about their poor record—all of them, Labor and Liberal—in this area. So let us share the blame around. I know the member for Mayo is a centralist in his heart, just like his old boss, John Howard—a great believer in the federal government. We saw that in their ideology in Work Choices—the commitment to a single, central system in this country. It is something that I think is spread in the coalition. We would like to see that.


But back to the statistics about dental. About one in three cardholder adults had untreated decay, 32.9 per cent, compared to less than one in four non-cardholders, 22.9 per cent. Obviously there are big impacts related to geography and income in your ability to access dental care. These are all mapped out in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the University of Adelaide's report. It notes similar things in terms of gum disease, where age has an effect, gender has an effect and geography certainly has an effect. In terms of gum disease, 36.3 per cent of those living in remote areas had gum disease compared to 22.1 per cent living in major cities. In terms of income and gum disease, people on lower household incomes generally were more likely to have gum disease than those on higher incomes, varying from 42.3 per cent for those in households earning less than $12,000 per year to 14.3 per cent for those in households earning $100,000 or more. A lower proportion of the insured, 19.4 per cent, than the uninsured, 27 per cent, had gum disease. Cardholders had higher rates of periodontal disease than non-cardholders—some 33.6 per cent compared to 19.5 per cent, respectively.


These are pretty stark figures. We know that what this government is doing will not help these figures. We know that. We know of their plans in health generally—some $50 billion worth of cuts and the GP tax. It is a tax which cascades from your GP waiting room into the place where you get your blood tests and into the place where you get your scans. And if you have to go back through the process to see your doctor again to get more tests, to get more scans, then the $7 cascades over and over again. We know that those opposite are committed to that GP tax and they are committed to the $50 billion worth of cuts.


We know that one of the things they did in the last budget was also basically to defer a $390 million partnership. There are 400,000 people on dental waiting lists around the country and in some states this funding has helped to cut waiting lists by half. We know that if you let those waiting lists blow out the problems get worse. I have heard other speakers say, 'Why did the previous government start with children?' That is because prevention is better than cure and universality is an important thing. One of the things it does is it lets people see their doctor or their dentist before problems get out of hand, before people have to have more extensive work and before they have to be, God forbid, hospitalised. We talk about some 20,000 children across the country being hospitalised for avoidable dental operations and interactions, you know that prevention is better than cure. It is much cheaper, too—that is the thing. There is a saving in it for the Commonwealth, there is a saving in it for the states and there is a saving in it ultimately for the community.


We know that the delay of the $390 million national partnership programs is going to be a disaster. Griffith University Professor of Dental Research Newell Johnson said:


It's certainly going to make it worse for people who rely on the public system. It's high time we realised that dental health is as important as any other part of the body.


Australian Dental Association President Dr Karin Alexander said waiting lists could double or triple, depending on the delay:


Then the waiting lists are going to grow and you are going to have people sitting there in pain at once again.


It is not good enough for this nation, which is wealthy, which has experience of universal health care in Medicare—a reform that was hard fought for in the Whitlam era. It was hard fought for then; it was hard fought for by the Hawke government, which went down the Medicare path and managed to institute it into our public life, make it untouchable for those opposite—and they will find the GP tax that they are so committed to will be their undoing. But it is not good enough to simply say that dental care should be left out of Medicare, that it should be a haves and have-nots system, that it should be a system where your health is dependent on your income and your ability to pay for a service that is vital for your interaction with the community, for your place as a citizen in this community. And if there is one thing we should learn from this debate it is that these schemes where the Commonwealth is fiddling about, trying to fix up what the states have not the wit, the inclination or the resources to do is an error. We should look at putting dental care in its rightful place in our public health.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:08):  I am pleased to rise on the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. As this is a health related bill, I would like to firstly address my comments to rebut some of the points made by members of the opposition during this debate.


We have heard this common phrase throughout many of the members of the opposition's speeches about 'cuts to health spending'. I am not sure, but I think maybe in their talking points members of the opposition are told: 'Just keep repeating this, time after time after time. Never mind the facts, and then maybe it might become a truth.' I have more faith in members of the Australian public to look at what the actual facts are and determining those facts and seeing if they are being misled.


The facts are that for overall health spending this financial year there is a nine per cent increase—this government is putting $1.3 billion extra into health spending this financial year. Next financial year, on top of that $1.3 billion, there is yet another nine per cent—or $1.4 billion—increase in health spending. And in the financial year after that, the third financial year of this government's budget, there will be yet another nine per cent increase. That is another $1.5 million, on top of all those other increases, that is going to our hospitals from this federal government. So if members of the opposition come in here and think that a nine per cent increase every year for the next three years is not enough, it is up to them to simply say how much more they are going to put in, but most importantly where the money will come from. Where will the money come from if a nine per cent—$1.3 billion to $1.5 billion—increase each year in our health spending by this federal government is not enough? How much more do they want and where will that money come from?


Getting onto the exact provisions of this bill: to explain the details of this bill and the necessity for it, it is necessary to do a review of history to see how we have come to this stage. There is the concept that this government would like to see more money invested in dental care across the nation, but there is simply no such thing as free health care or free dental care. Somebody has to pay for it; the money has to come for it from somewhere. There is no such thing as Magic Pudding economics. At the end of the day the bills have to be paid by someone.


To go back to the origins of this bill we need to go back to 1996, when the previous coalition government were first elected. What they inherited at that time was a budget in deficit and $96 billion worth of accumulated debt—that was their inheritance. But even more importantly, they also inherited a liability to pay interest on that debt of $9.5 billion in the first year. So rather than having $9.5 billion to spend on all the many things that we needed in our society, $9.5 billion worth of taxes had to be raised, taken out of the economy and used to pay the interest bill on the previous government's debt. And what we saw was a successful government; we saw they were successful because they created opportunity. They encouraged entrepreneurs to get out there and take risks, to experiment with their new business ideas and to innovate: that is what created the wealth and prosperity, so the money started to flow into the federal Treasury, which allowed us to slowly pay down the debt; to run a surplus year after year and to slowly wind back that debt.


One of the most important things the previous government did to wind that debt back was to lower company tax rates. It often sounds quite counterintuitive, but by lowering company tax rates the Howard and Costello government actually got more money in the coffers. For example, in the first year of the Howard and Costello government company tax rates were 36 per cent; about 3.3 per cent of GDP was raised in company taxes, something close to about $19 billion. But what the Howard and Costello government did was lower those tax rates; they wound those company tax rates back to 30 per cent. Now for those who do not understand how the economy works they would simply say, 'That will cause revenue to the government to fall', but the exact opposite happened. By lowering those company tax rates, by giving individuals and companies and businesses and small businesses the incentive to go out there and invest because of a lower company tax rate, we saw an expansion of the economy. What we also saw was the percentage of total GDP raised by company taxes increase, and increase substantially, at a lower rate of company tax.


So then we move forward to about 2005 or 2006. By then, after good economic management for close to a decade, we had finally been able to pay back that $96 billion worth of Labor debt. But most importantly, because there was no debt, there was no interest bill that the government had to finance. That freed up money to fund a lot of the social programs that are so desperately needed in our society. One of those social programs put in by the then health minister, now the Prime Minister, was the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. This is one of the dividends of good economic management: when you have government keeping the budget in surplus and the economy running, the benefits and dividends you get allow you to spend on social programs. That Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, established during the Howard government by the now Prime Minister, provided $4,250 every two years for private dental treatment for people who had a chronic dental disease. Twenty million services were provided to over one million Australians who benefited under that scheme. One million Australians were the recipients of that good economic benefit—that dividend—through the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. It was the most successful scheme for curing dental disease and dental issues in our nation's history.


But what happened when the Labor government came to power? We saw reckless and wasteful spending, and one of the saddest things of all was that they tried to delegitimise the success of the previous Howard government. They went out and criticised the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. What they did so they could take it away—because they wanted to cut costs to try to wind their budget back—was go out looking for scapegoats. Remember, one million Australians received benefits under this scheme. So they went out looking for scapegoats and the scapegoats they found were the dentists who had made a mistake filling out their paperwork. That is simply what they had done: they had made a genuine mistake filling out the paperwork. Of course, the previous Labor government came out and said this was rorting. They found a few cases—a handful of cases—out of one million Australians who received treatment under the program, and that is the reason they gave for cutting this scheme off. The true reason was they were too embarrassed to admit this was a successful scheme brought in by the previous health minister, then opposition leader, and current Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.


This is what this bill addresses. It enables those so-called debts that were created—debts the government claims are owed by dentists—to be wiped off. They are not genuine debts; the services were performed. They are simply the result of an error of paperwork. We all know how hard it is to fill out government forms and paperwork. Only the other day I was at a volunteer awards ceremony in southern Sydney with all the volunteers. There were many worthy volunteers in that room. There were rural firefighters; people who volunteer in our hospitals; people who volunteer in our aged-care sector; and people who volunteer with our kids with disabilities. But the overall winner was a group called the 'form-filling helpers'. Their specific volunteer contribution to society is to help citizens fill out government forms.


This is why you cannot simply go back and look at a form in which there has been a slight discrepancy and try to take away the money that was paid to dentists for work they did in good faith—to claw that money back. That is what this bill addresses. It winds back and brings in amendments to make sure those so-called debts, where the work was done in good faith, are repealed. Without delaying the House any further, I commend this bill to the House.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (10:19):  I speak in support of the amendment to the Dental Benefits Legislation Amendment Bill 2014. It is well known that bad oral health can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life. Untreated dental decay, as well as causing pain and infection, can affect nutritional status and growth and cause issues such as sleep disturbance, poor concentration and other behavioural impacts. Addressing oral health in children and young people in particular can significantly improve lifelong oral health, which is a key determinant of health and wellbeing throughout a person's life.


In my electorate of Kingsford Smith, particularly among young children, dental health is a real issue and as such it sparked a local public health initiative to tackle the problem. I am pleased and proud to say that the charity arm of the mighty South Sydney Rabbitohs, Souths Cares, launched an oral health care program on 8 April this year, designed to help spread the message of 'clean well, drink well' and the importance of oral hygiene for young people in South Sydney. Accompanied by graduate students from the University of Sydney, lead member of the Souths Cares team and former first grade rugby league player Rhys Wesser launched the program's first session at La Perouse for children from kindergarten to year 2. Rhys began by reading the children an Indigenous Dreamtime inspired story called The healthy tribe: 'I can help my body stay well'. The book aims to educate children about oral health and general health and it focuses on the oral health message 'eat well, drink well and play well'. The story is about a young boy named Marley who talks about his journey gaining the knowledge to live a happy and healthy life, which is told through stories of the Biripi and Worimi people. These tales were developed so that Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people could gain the knowledge to improve their health in a culturally appropriate way. I congratulate Souths Cares and all concerned with this organisation for the work they are doing to promote better health care, particularly among young Indigenous students in my community. That is an example of one of the oral healthcare programs that runs in my electorate.


Labor, of course, considers dental health and dental care a vital component of good public health. In this area, it is fair to say, we have put our money where our mouth is. In August 2012, Labor introduced a $4 billion dental program aimed at providing access to government subsidised dental care to millions of children and adults on low incomes or in rural areas. As part of our plan to address increasingly poor oral health among Australians—in particular, low- and middle-income families—the unprecedented six year dental health reform package included $2.7 billion for around 3.4 million Australian children who will be eligible for subsidised dental care; $1.3 billion for around 1.4 million additional services for adults on low incomes, including pensioners, concession card holders and those with special needs, who will have better access to dental care in the public system; and $225 million for dental capital and workforce, which will be provided to support expanded services for people living in outer metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas.


This bill will create a waiver provision for the Medicare Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and make a number of amendments to the operation of the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. When Labor was in government an audit of the activity of the CDDS detected a high rate of noncompliance with the reporting requirements for dentists. As a result of this audit, activity debts were raised against dentists found to be noncompliant. The last speaker, from the other side, mentioned that it was his belief that this was one of the most successful healthcare programs that had ever been run in Australia. My experience from talking to GPs in our community was that, unfortunately, the CDDS was being rorted by a small number of doctors and dentists. I spoke to a number of GPs in my community who gave examples of people requesting certificates to say they had chronic dental diseases and required dental treatment under the scheme through Medicare when in fact they did not fit that category but had heard from others that there was an opportunity to get free dental health care through this program. That was uncovered in an audit of this program that was run by the previous government. That is why the program was shut down. It was found that taxpayers' valuable dollars were being wasted—admittedly in a small number of cases—and there was no ability to put in place measures and other safeguards to rein in the rorting that was occurring in the scheme. That is why Labor acted to replace that program and make changes to the program. On the whole, I think the targeted program that Labor put in place, particularly to target those people on low to middle incomes and children, has been effective.


This bill also makes amendments to the Dental Benefits Act and the Health Insurance Act to align compliance powers and make those powers applicable to the CDBS. It also amends both acts so that the Professional Services Review scheme can be applied to dental services provided under the CDBS. The CDBS commenced on 1 January 2014 and provides to those aged from two to 17, who meet a means test, access to up to $1,000 in benefits over two calendar years for basic dental treatment. This program is an investment in prevention. We know that the oral health of our children is the best predictor of oral health as adults. We know that children from low-income families and low-socioeconomic areas have inferior dental health to those from more affluent areas. That is why this scheme was targeted and means tested for children who fit those criteria. The CDBS replaces the Medicare Teen Dental Plan and provides more comprehensive coverage through a greater range of services to a larger group of children.


Labor also takes very seriously the issue of inappropriate professional behaviour and supports the application of compliance powers as well as the operation of the Professional Services Review scheme. The dental health reform package that Labor implemented is delivering a better and fairer system of dental care for Australians. It is an accessible and affordable scheme that focuses on prevention to deliver future improvements in Australia's oral health. From its commencement on 1 January 2014 until 1 March 2014, over 84,000 children received dental treatment under the CDBS, including over 26,000 children from outside of major cities. That is proof positive that this scheme is working and delivering its intended benefits without the rorting that we saw under the previous scheme that was put in place by the Howard government. In 2013, over 200,000 public dental patients received treatment because of Labor's program and its funding of the public dental waiting list blitz. It is because of Labor that over 280,000 adults now have better oral health as a result of free or subsidised care under the dental health reform package.


I am proud of Labor's improvements to dental health. I am proud that Labor has increased accessibility to dental health through a targeted scheme to ensure that low-income families in this country get the necessary support to access basic dental healthcare services and, importantly, that children, particularly those from low- to middle-income families and low-socioeconomic areas, have access to those dental schemes. It is a great legacy from the previous Labor government. This bill will tidy up the deficiencies in the Howard government's Chronic Dental Disease Scheme and will ensure that the legacy is removed forever. I commend the bill, with the amendment, to the House.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (11:45):  by leave—Today bills are introduced for the second red tape repeal day. It is the second of many repeal days to come. Every day this government is working to build a strong, prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. Every day we are seeking to identify ways to make life easier for individuals, community groups, charities and businesses large and small. Our Economic Action Strategy aims to remove burdens from business, make our country more competitive and drive more jobs and higher living standards for all Australians. But today—this day—I am pleased to report that since the election this government has reduced annual red-tape costs by over $2 billion. This more than doubles our original commitment of a $1 billion a year cut in red-tape costs.


While some regulation is necessary, and nearly all regulations originally had some point, we are now suffering from regulatory overkill. Between 2010 and last year, an act of parliament was passed every two days. Under the former government some 21,000 new regulations became part of our national life. That does not include the regulations, laws and by-laws that were added at state and territory and local levels. While it is easy to point to bizarre examples, like the ACT government's attempt to require safety supervisors at sausage sizzles, the purpose of this government today is to look beyond the absurd. It is to identify the raft of red tape that adds costs without commensurate public benefit. Talk to any butcher, newsagent, drycleaner or cafe owner and he or she will tell you that it is the accumulation of regulation that damages initiative, productivity and the willingness of people to have a go.


If red tape can grow incrementally, then it can be cut in the same way and that is what the government is doing today. When it comes to regulation, we are changing the culture of government. Deregulation units are now in place across government; ministerial advisory councils have been established in each portfolio so that the people impacted by decisions can have a say on them. Portfolio regulation audits are underway. The performance pay of senior public servants now includes deregulation as a key performance indicator. The site cuttingredtape.gov.au has been established, allowing every Australian to make a contribution to the government's deliberations on cutting red tape. Regulatory impact statements are required for cabinet submissions because assessing the cost of any regulation is as important as knowing its benefits. Soon, a regulatory performance framework will drive cultural change within regulators and help to ensure that regulations are administered effectively and efficiently.


In March, we held the first ever red tape repeal day. On that day, nearly 10,000 unnecessary or counterproductive regulations and 1,000 redundant acts of parliament were removed. That day we relegated some 50,000 pages of redundant regulation from the law books to the history books. Since the first red tape repeal day we have scrapped the carbon tax and the mining tax. Scrapping the carbon tax has not only saved typical households $550 a year and removed a $9 billion a year handbrake from our economy, but it has provided a direct red-tape saving to business of $85 million a year.


Each repeal day is an opportunity to reduce or eliminate regulation and legislation that has outlived its usefulness or does more harm than good. Today we add to this with almost a thousand acts and regulations to be scrapped. More than 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation will go as a result of this second red tape repeal day.


These changes, large and small, are about making people's lives easier, because we are a government that is freeing up businesses so that they focus on the people they are meant to serve. We will make it easier, for instance, for bricks-and-mortar shops to compete with online stores by reducing their compliance costs because, all too often, the retail sector has to interact with multiple agencies from local, state and national government. We are making it easier for Australian Apprenticeships Support Network providers, who will no longer have to maintain some three million paper files and waste money every quarter doing so. By reducing administrative costs, these service providers can better focus on assisting apprentices and employers in meeting the skills Australia needs. We are also making life simpler for users of managed investment schemes, who will no longer have to undertake two separate know-your-customer checks before they can complete their applications, because one check should be enough. Every year there are over 500,000 new applicants for these schemes and every duplicate check costs the managed funds around $40—as well as the time the customer spends providing the same information twice.


In health care we are reducing the time taken to list medicines on the PBS to improve access to those vital life saving and life enhancing drugs. We are delivering a one-stop shop for environmental approvals. Reducing these approval delays is expected to result in regulatory savings to business of over $426 million a year.


Our Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda is promoting lower costs, better skills and the have-a-go ethos that is so much a part of the Australian character. By reinvigorating Australian businesses we reinvigorate the economy. Deregulation is an essential part of that agenda because bubble wrapping our creative minds in red tape stifles innovation and flexibility. Importantly, the competitiveness agenda includes proposals to reduce duplication of our regulatory arrangements where trusted international standards have already been met or trusted international assessments have already been made. Our guiding principle is that if a system, service or product has been improved under the trusted international standard or risk assessment then Australian regulators should not impose any additional requirement without a demonstrable reason to do so.


We are already seeing the benefits of this. For instance, the Therapeutic Goods Administration has just advised Cochlear, who make the bionic ear, that all of its products are eligible to use European Union certification to streamline TGA certification and that implementation will begin from next month. This change, according to Cochlear, will mean that thousands of people here and overseas will have access to the very latest devices, sometimes up to a year earlier than may otherwise have been the case.


As well, we are making it easier for small to medium exporters to finance their export activity now that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation has the flexibility to lend directly for all types of exports—not just capital goods—reducing business costs and processing time. EFIC's adoption of accelerated execution processes for some transactions could shorten processing time by 40 per cent. This could save an average of $5,000 per export contract. These measures will make it easier for entrepreneurs to transform ideas into reality and create an environment where small businesses can do more.


With changes to the Corporations Act governing the administration of general meetings making it harder for activists to make vexatious requests for shareholder meetings, the management of Australia's largest companies can spend more time focused on managing their company and managing their shareholders. We are making these changes because people do not work for government, government should work for people. It is government's job to serve the people, not the people's job to serve the government. We are a country of people who work hard, pay their taxes, volunteer in their local communities and save for their retirement.


Where we can make it easier for people to spend their time as they choose, rather than waste it filling out forms, we should. For example, a working mother who does not want to be contacted by telemarketers during her spare time will be able to register both her home and mobile phone number on the Do Not Call Register. By keeping her numbers on the list indefinitely we are now also making sure that she does not have to remember to re-register every eight years. This same mother could also benefit from the rollout of the myTax online portal that prefills individual's tax returns so that they do not have to spend hours flipping through the pages of a paper tax return. For over 250,000 people this program should reduce the time taken to submit a tax return. And the broader myGov system means that Medicare, Centrelink and Child Support customers can obtain information, make claims and access services without having to visit a service centre in person or spend time on hold on the phone.


Cutting red tape is about making life easier. It means anything from less time in airports waiting in queues because of SmartGate to more forms of identification that marriage celebrants may accept. Cutting red tape should mean less time in queues, less time filling out forms and less time searching for information. These changes and other changes since September of last year have removed over $2 billion in annual red-tape costs. But this is the start, not the end. We are not only cutting red tape but changing the culture that fosters and encourages it. Regulation should not and must not be the default option for policymakers, because more regulation is not the answer to every corporate, community or personal failing. We are a country with highly skilled and highly capable people running businesses, helping community groups and making our country better. We are putting more trust in them to make the right choices and we know that our people are up to the task. I am proud of the progress that we have made so far and I pledge that there is much more yet to come.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (12:00):  I thank members of the government for enthusiastically voting for the motion to allow me to speak for 13 minutes! I certainly hope that the repeal day coming up goes better than the last one. The Prime Minister said in his ministerial statement just then that 'our purpose is to look beyond the absurd'. That would have been a valid aim on the last so-called repeal day.


Since the last one I have had a chance to go through the costings provided for the savings. The Prime Minister just now referred to a number of global figures for how much will be saved through these bills. Last time we ended up with costings for how much individual acts were contributing, in dollar terms, in red tape reduction. The Amending Acts 1901 to 1969 Repeal Bill 2014 allegedly saved—and it is part of the global total the Prime Minister uses—$210,000. This was the act that repealed a Defence Act, which had a definition relating to a naval officer of a state navy, notwithstanding that the states have not had navies since 1913. It repealed the Defence Act 1909 that, among other things, stipulated that the owner of a mule or bullock required for naval or military purposes shall furnish it for such purposes and the owner may have to register them from time to time. The minister who is at the table, the Minister for Agriculture, will know the extent to which the owners of mules and bullocks have been frightened that—




Mr Joyce:
  It does not take much for a bullock to be frightened.




Mr BURKE:
  That is very good. He knows the extent to which they were frightened the Australian government was going to come in and take their stock for military purposes. It also repealed the Judiciary Act 1914 that made the High Court of Australia a Colonial Court of Admiralty, notwithstanding that Colonial Courts of Admiralty had ceased to exist in 1988. 


Somehow getting rid of these laws that were redundant, meaningless and had no impact on anyone—so there was no problem getting rid of them; we did not oppose it—adds up to $210,000 worth of savings. I do not know how. I do not know how those numbers get put together, but it makes more sense than when they established $350,000 worth of savings for the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 1). This was the bill that removed hyphens and commas. The purpose of that bill was to remove one comma in the Patents Act and 11 hyphens in various Commonwealth statutes. Where it said 'e-mail' they decided to remove the hyphen and just make it 'email'—obviously on the technical understanding of email, probably from the Attorney-General—and where it said 'facsimile' or 'facsimile transmission' they changed it to 'fax' in 16 pieces of legislation. Somehow this is $350,000 worth of savings. In the way the government is calculating the savings on these bills, when you add it up that would amount to in the order of $10,000 per comma. There is a fair bit of hype going on in the total dollar figures of the savings to business and consumers through these bills.




Mr Frydenberg:
  You belittle the measures and then you question the numbers. How about getting on board?




Mr BURKE:
  I hope that the government simply does better than it did last time. The member for Kooyong needs to understand that we are willing him to succeed in this. We just want him to do a good deal better than he did last time.


The other test that is often applied here is simply the number of regulations. Since the last repeal day I understand that the government has introduced 600 new regulations. Most of those regulations are good things to do. Simply having a regulation is not a measure of whether you have something stifling business. I give the simple example—and this was supported by the Liberals opposite and opposed by the Nationals opposite—of when we deregulated the wheat industry. When we got rid of the AWB monopoly it was a deregulation measure but it involved more regulations on the statute books than had previously been there. So to simply have the number of regulations as the test does not actually mount your policy case for whether you are providing more freewheeling opportunity for business to avoid unnecessary regulation.


That last time the government dealt with this issue they put a number of proposals. We are not arguing that there was not a cost saving to government but we would certainly argue with the merit of the proposals that they had. Last time they claimed savings, more than a quarter—28.3 per cent of the $700 million—involved the watering down of consumer protections for the Future of Financial Advice reforms and giving a fresh licence for contractors to cut the wages of cleaners through the abolition of the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines. I do not dispute that there were savings there, but they were savings without merit. They were savings that hurt consumers and savings that hurt some of the lowest paid workers in this country.


If we get rid of regulations, is it automatically good? Getting rid of redundant regulations is a reasonable thing to do. We got rid of in the order of 16,000 regulations in the time we were in government. Sometimes, as I have said before, the introduction of additional pieces of regulation is of itself a deregulation measure—and the abolition of the AWB monopoly is a perfect example of where something like that was done. I acknowledged that the National Party opposed it. Almost everybody sitting around you, Minister Joyce, supported us on that one, but, as I have acknowledged already, your decision was to oppose us on that.


We will wait till we see the legislation in full before we make a decision obviously as to which way we are going to vote. Last time it took some time before the full list of what the government had abolished became clear.


Last time, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was abolished on red tape repeal day; only for the government to later realise that this was something they wanted to put in place; they have since committed to bring it back. So this was a position that existed; there had been bipartisan support for it to exist. On regulation repeal day, they got rid of it. But only shortly after they said: 'Oops! Didn't mean to do that one.' 


The government acknowledge that simply getting rid of a regulation is not automatically a good thing. Some things are there for national security purposes. Many things are there for consumer protection purposes. Many issues are there for occupational health and safety. There are a range of regulations that are there for a good purpose. That said, if there are regulations that are redundant or if there are ways of streamlining the rules for business, that is a good thing to do. 


Since the last repeal day, the Prime Minister has boasted about savings—and he referred specifically to the issue of carbon pricing—to households. In the interim, though, we had a budget which put a cost onto those same households and which eclipses the figures that the Prime Minister just provided to the parliament. In the same way, in the interim, we had the government propose for small businesses to be saddled with an avalanche of job applications when the government proposed that job seekers were going to have to put out 40 job applications a month. Not one small business thought that that idea from the government made the other proposals they had in red tape reduction worth it. Small business across my electorate and across the country knew quite clearly that, for all the talk of regulation repeal, what the government was putting in front of them was an avalanche of extra paperwork that they did not want.


The government also, in the comments made by the Prime Minister, referred to a number of reforms which have involved putting information onto the internet and providing access to information through various webpages, which are good initiatives. He has referred to the myGov website, which is a good initiative but an initiative that did not begin with the advent of this government. An initiative of people being able to access government services through the myGov website was well and truly set up and well and truly underway under the previous government. 


The SmartGate system at airports was an initiative started under the Howard government; advanced fully during the years of the Labor government; and continued under this government. For it to be now announced in a ministerial statement by the Prime Minister of Australia as though it is something new, and part of red tape reduction day, when it has been a process going through Australia for near on a decade, is an absurd claim. 


Similarly, I will concede that what they have said about myTax is true; that is theirs, because they have renamed e-tax, which was available under the Labor government, which was progressively being updated and which would have evolved in its next generation to be exactly what myTax is now. But they wanted to be able to claim that they had one new. So, for three different things that they were doing on the internet, they thought: 'Well, we'll at least rename one of them, because then it will be true that myTax is new'. Yes, that one is new, which does roughly something similar to where the e-tax system was already up to and was continuing to evolve. 


Labor will work through the legislation when it is introduced, because at the moment all we have is the occasional op-ed from the parliamentary secretary opposite—




Mr Frydenberg:
  Excellent articles! You should read them!




Mr BURKE:
  I do read them. And I will concede that his latest op-ed was better than the previous ones I had read. So they are improving.




Mr Frydenberg:
  You never even did a regulatory impact statement!



Mr Joyce interjecting—




Mr BURKE:
  I have a response for the Minister for Agriculture's interjection, but I am holding back. The final thing I will say is that the government makes much of regulatory impact statements, claiming that due process will be followed in cabinet. We have seen in this parliament how quickly all of that falls away the moment there is a deal with the crossbench—for example, look at the future of financial advice reforms. Are we to believe that—in the space of 24 hours, when the new deal was cut—there was a cabinet submission, with a regulatory impact statement attached, to work out what the new cost to the public was, on a change of policy that was being negotiated outside the Senate door? Is that what we are meant to believe? The answer here is quite simple. The government has been willing to ditch any of these processes the moment there is a political deal on the table with the crossbench. We have seen it time and again and we will see it into the future. 


Getting rid of old regulations is a sensible thing to do. If the government does that, we will continue to support that, as we did last time. But, please, do not trumpet the ordinary work of government as though it is something new and exciting. And, please, do not come into this House—to the members opposite—claiming that they are somehow adding up these global figures, when what they are doing is attaching a dollar figure to hyphens and commas.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-10-22,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12:14):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


In a report soon to be released by the global professional services firm Deloitte, it is estimated that in Australia there are one million people working in the compliance sector. This is three times as many people as work in the mining sector and represents one in every 11 Australians.


This represents, very graphically, a failure by both federal and state governments over a number of years. And no government was as culpable for the increase in regulation than the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. They gave us 21,000 additional regulations, despite Kevin Rudd promising a 'one in, one out' policy. In fact, Kevin Rudd told the Australian people that business regulation is 'out of control'. Craig Emerson, the former Minister for Small Business, said that he would take 'a giant pair of scissors to cut red tape'. But despite this, they introduced the carbon tax, with 18 different acts and 1,100 pages of regulation and legislation, and the mining tax, with 11 different acts and 525 pages of legislation and regulation.


This is why we came to government promising to cut $1 billion a year in red tape each year. This is why we promised to establish deregulation units within every portfolio. This is why we committed to setting up ministerial advisory committees, who could advise the relevant ministers on the priorities and the areas for cutting red tape. This is why we have changed the remuneration for senior public servants, so that they would be incentivised to cut red tape as opposed to increasing it. This is why we tasked the Productivity Commission to come up with a framework for auditing the performance of the regulators. This is why the Prime Minister himself has taken responsibility for the deregulation agenda and why the Office of Best Practice Regulation and the deregulation units that were previously housed in the Department of Finance have now been moved to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. And this is why we have assigned two days every year for this parliament to debate the repeal of unnecessary and redundant pieces of legislation and regulation.


In our first repeal day in March of this year we had great success. We removed more than 10,000 pieces of legislation and regulation, removing more than 50,000 pages from the statute books and announcing more than $700 million worth of compliance savings. There were issues like offshore petroleum approvals processes; opening up the Comcare scheme to allow companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions to self-insure; changing the building certification requirements for aged care so that they do not overlap between state and federal; changing the way that movies, DVDs and 3-D movies are classified, ensuring that they do not have to get multiple classifications when the content is still the same. We have had great success in moving this through the Senate because of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014. The changes to the agvet chemical system and also to the classification system have all successfully moved through the upper house, together with the changes to the future of financial advice, which brought nearly $200 million worth of compliance savings.


So, we have had success with repeal day 1. And now we are repeating it with our second repeal day next week and the introduction to the House of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 today. We are removing more than 7,200 pages from the statute books and getting rid of nearly 1,000 pieces of legislation and regulation. And it is important to understand that it is a net figure of $2.1 billion worth of compliance savings. The number will be exponentially bigger than that when you talk about the positive impact for the economy, because if you have a streamlined environmental approval process then billions of dollars of investment that otherwise may have been deferred or cancelled will now go ahead, creating many new jobs, stimulating innovation and encouraging entrepreneurship.


We are all about jobs, and deregulation goes to the heart of productivity and job creation. There are three key themes in the various bills and measures—more than 400—that we have announced through these repeal day processes.


Firstly, we are making people's interaction with government easier. The Prime Minister referred to the myGov site, where five million Australians have accounts to be able to access Medicare, Centrelink and other services on one, centralised online portal. And there is myTax, which ensures that individuals can have data pre-populated on their tax return when that data is already in the possession of the government, like interest on bank accounts, or the income from their salary or dividends from their shares.


We are also ensuring that job service providers do not need to go out and incur great expense getting documentary evidence for whether somebody actually has a job because that information is already in the possession of government. ADF personnel who leave the force and become veterans will no longer have to go through a 100-point identification check when they are seeking a claim from Veterans' Affairs because their ADF badge or their ADF identification will be sufficient. Two hundred-and-twenty hearing service providers, who provide services to more than 640,000 Australians can now lodge their applications online. This has already reduced the number of calls to government from 900 to just 170 a day. All these changes are about using new technology to ensure that the interaction of people and families with government is easier, cheaper and more time efficient.


The second set of reforms which we are introducing as part of our repeal day measures goes to the heart of trying to reduce compliance where it is duplicative, too expensive or unnecessary. One good example is the 100-shareholder rule. If Woolworths has more than 400,000 shareholders, just 100 shareholders should not be able to call a special general meeting, as they have in the past, leading to costs of $1 million for the company, let alone the time taken out by senior management and the board to acquiesce to that request. So we are saying that 100-shareholder rule need not apply, but 100 shareholders can still put issues on the agenda at a special general meeting.


The Federal Safety Commissioner requires accreditation for builders who are tendering for certain government contracts. The member for Herbert brought to my attention that in Townsville there are builders of Defence housing—some 900 Defence houses were built over the last year—who cannot afford the $75,000 for federal safety commissioner accreditation and the $38,000 each year it costs to maintain their accreditation. Therefore, they cannot afford to tender for government projects like Defence housing. This means big builders from the cities have to come to the country, regional and remote communities to do the work, which means that local plumbers, sparkies, carpenters and others miss out on doing the job. When there are overlapping occupational health and safety requirements already at the state and federal level, this additional layer of compliance for the federal safety commissioner is unnecessary in this case, so single dwellings will be exempt from that red tape requirement. This is really significant because this could open up huge amounts of jobs. I congratulate Senator Abetz also for his important work in this regard.


My colleague and friend the member for Dunkley, Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Business, has done a lot of work to ensure that 32,500 small businesses that do not pay GST no longer have to do a BAS statement. And 432,000 small businesses that have minimal income and have to submit a BAS statement will now be exempt from the pay-as-you-go system. This is again removing red tape for small business—the heart and soul of the Liberal Party and the Nationals—and ensuring that they get a fairer go.


Aged care providers last year made 10,000 calls or submissions or applications to government departments to tell them when they changed key personnel, which may even have included a nurse. We have said that is unnecessary. So in the bills today is a reform in this area which means only if an aged care provider feels they cannot materially carry on their job will they need to make a subsequent notifications to the government. All this is about is sensible reforms to reduce compliance. One hopes that those opposite see the sense in these changes.


The third suite of reforms is around making Australia a more attractive place to invest. It is here that the one-stop shops, where the Minister for Environment has so successfully led the charge, are going to lead to more than $420 million of annual compliance savings by streamlining approval processes between state and federal governments. The Business Council of Australia documented one case where a company wanted to make a $1 billion investment in the resource sector in Australia and sought an environmental approval. It took that company more than two years, cost them more than $20 million, required 4,000 meetings and required a 12,000-page report. And when the approval came back, it had 1,500 conditions attached—300 at the federal level, 1,200 at the state level—and 8,000 sub conditions. Now I ask you: which company can go through that process and expect to want to invest again in Australia ? We are not the only country in the world that produces iron ore or coal or uranium. We are in a global market where business is not sentimental and capital is mobile, and that is why we have to make Australia a place to invest.


The Minister for Trade, Andrew Robb, should be congratulated for the changes he has made to the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, which will allow small and medium enterprises—the exact constituents that the member for New England and the Minister for Agriculture are defending day in day out—to get support from the government when they are looking to expand their businesses overseas. Currently there is a requirement that EFIC can only support producers of capital goods, not non-capital goods. But capital goods are only five per cent of exports, so you have got all these non-capital goods. One of the problems is somebody who is exporting cows could have the support but not somebody who is exporting milk. We need to extend the ability of EFIC to loan to these small and medium enterprises that export non-capital goods and not confine them to just a credit guarantee, which means that they have to pay extra costs.


There are lots of little changes that are also significant for red tape, which colleagues on this side of the House understand benefit their constituents and will be selling day after day in their electorates. Exporters no longer need to put little green tags of the tales of cattle when exporting to Europe. Nine million Australians on the Do Not Call Register will no longer need to renew their position every eight years because once they are on, they will be on indefinitely. And 70,000 motorcycles will not have to go through the extra expense of being retrofitted with special mudguards because we are bringing ourselves in line with jurisdictions overseas like Europe. People who are submitting for Defence honours—more than 13,000 applications were received last year from veterans, their families and Defence personnel—can now do it online as opposed to going through a paper based system. Companies that are limited by guarantee, more often than not with incomes under $1 million who are not-for profits, will no longer be required, as a result of changes we are introducing in the House today, to appoint an auditor. They have never been required to have an audit so why do would they need to appoint an auditor? It is just common sense.


Takeover panel members can now participate in teleconferences when they are overseas, as often they are. Importers of Defence equipment will no longer need separate permits for every consignment, for hundreds of consignments, of the same product. They will be able to have one single permit which will assist them in streamlining red tape. Exporters will no longer need to get a certificate of origin to export under the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement; they can now self-certify, saving them $70 each time they do a self-certification. NBN users will no longer be mandated to have a backup battery; it will be optional because so many people have mobiles and do not need this expensive backup battery. University staff, particularly researchers, will no longer be mandated by the government to do expensive research surveys. The Minister for Education should be congratulated on his work here because 31,000 researchers in our 39 universities will save thousands, more than 3,300, days' worth of their time. These are significant changes across the board.


The Omnibus bill, the Amending Acts 1970 to 1979 Repeal Bill 2014, the Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2014 and the Spent and Redundant Instruments Repeal Regulation 2014 are whole-of-government initiatives which are going to lead to so many pieces of legislation being repealed and pages being removed from the statute books. In this Omnibus bill are 26 deregulatory measures from across nine different portfolios. The Fishing Industry Policy Council is a ministerial advisory council in the agriculture portfolio that has not been convened since the Fisheries Administration Act commenced in 1991. That will now be abolished. The Product Stewardship Advisory Group was created in December 2012 to advise the Minister for the Environment on a list of classes of products that should be accredited or regulated under the Product Stewardship Act 2011 but the Department of the Environment already consults industry on the list on an 'as needs' basis. So that will also be abolished. And the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council will also be abolished as the Department of the Environment is better placed to consult with industry on an 'as needs' basis in relation to product stewardship arrangements for oils and the recovery and recycling of used oils under the Product Stewardship Oil Act 2000. This is consistent with the recommendations in the Commission of Audit, led by Tony Shepherd, which said that the government needed to consolidate so many of our bodies. And we have done that with the abolition of more than 70 bodies already.


Also in this Omnibus bill are examples of spent and redundant acts that will be repealed. The Home and Community Care Act 1985, which was made redundant in the context of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations 2008, will now be repealed. The Papua and New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1970, which relates to a guarantee of a 1973 loan to PNG that matured in 1994 and which the Bank for Reconstruction and Development has confirmed has been repaid in full, will now be repealed.


There will also be a streamlining process through measures in this Omnibus bill such as modernising the publication of requirements for the Australian Communications and Media Authority under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. ACMA will no longer be required to publish a notice in the Commonwealth Gazette when determining, varying or revoking a program standard but instead must publish a notice on ACMA's website and in one or more forms that are readily accessible to the public. These amendments will provide ACMA with increased flexibility to choose a method of publication that is most appropriate to reach its target audience and will better alert stakeholders to regulatory change. The Minister for Communications has done a fantastic job looking at every element of his portfolio and working with his parliamentary secretary, the member for Bradfield, to try to cut red tape right across the board. Both the minister and his parliamentary secretary deserve to be congratulated.


Under the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000, fuel producers and suppliers report certain information to the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics on a monthly basis for the compilation of the Australian petroleum statistics. They will no longer be required to report that information on an annual basis under the act as well. Again, that removes duplication.


Importantly, the Minister for Social Services, who again is undertaking reform of red tape, is amending the Aged Care Act 1997 so that aged-care providers, who are currently required to notify the Department of Social Service of changes to key personnel within 28 days, will instead only have to notify the department of changes that materially affect the provider's suitability to provide care. So, as you can see, in this Omnibus bill there are many, many important measures.


In addition to our initiatives on repeal day one and now on repeal day two, we are doing a lot through our competitiveness agenda. My colleagues sitting behind me have come to the table with important ideas and reforms, particularly around how we can recognise in Australia products, systems and services that have already been approved under trusted international standards overseas. The fact is that we do not need to put companies like Cochlear through a second hoop here if they have already gone through that hoop overseas.


Why in Australia do we have a situation where, as was pointed out to me by the member for Longman, a manufacturer of footballs and cricket balls who brings into Australia a leather cutting machine from Italy has to pay $3,000 to get it accredited here and also has to wait a significant amount of time? Why does the approvals process that Cochlear has to go through here in Australia take 14 months longer than the same process in Europe? When a branch office of an American medical device maker that employs 52 people here in Australia wants to bring in a heart valve device from America why does it take 31 months to get approval? It costs them $300,000 to pay the application fees, get the data and employ consultants whereas that some process in Canada took just a few months and cost a quarter of the amount. By the time they had the approval for this medical device a second-generation device was already on sale in Europe. So Australian consumers missed out.


Why do importers of flame retardants that have been deemed to be a non-hazardous chemical overseas have to pay up to $100,000 to get accreditation here? Why does that happen? Why does a company importing commercial cooking equipment into Australia incur a $12,000 cost—$8,000 for testing and $4,000 for the application—before it can actually give that cooking equipment to the hospitality industry, the tourism industry or the aged-care industry? This is all about reducing significant costs, and I thank the members behind me for their absolute commitment in this respect.


What about COAG? Again, COAG is an important opportunity where we are trying to streamline deregulation by better cooperation with the states and territories. There are four specific areas where we are looking at deregulation, and the individual states and territories have been tasked to come back to COAG with ideas on how to progress reform: manufacturing, higher education, early childhood—where Sussan Ley, the member for Farrer, is doing so much good work, responding to the Productivity Commission report—and small business. The fact is that in Australia a cafe may face 75 different sets of regulations—25 at the Commonwealth level, 29 at the state level and 11 at the local level. A winery with cellar door sales could be facing up to 140 different types of regulation, just to meet its requirements.


The other key area for us is around the role of the regulators. The Commonwealth has more than 150 regulators. Some of those regulators are big, like the ATO, ASIC, APRA and ACMA, and some are much smaller, like the passports office. But what these regulators need to understand is that, from the government's perspective, we want them to take a risk based approach. We want them on one hand to understand what the risk to the community is, and the protections that are required, and on the other hand to understand what the real cost to the community and the stakeholders is if the level of compliance is so great that it is a disincentive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship. And it is about getting that balance right, it is about ensuring good governance, about ensuring on one hand that these regulators who are setting rules are also enforcing those rules—separating those two functions. Often those regulators are able to operate on a cost recovery model, and we do not want those regulators to try to mitigate risk all the time and therefore impose additional costs on their stakeholders because they have a cost recovery model. To rein in the role of the regulators, to get them to adopt a risk based approach, is something that I know the member for Mitchell very much understands and has been a good advocate for in this place.


It is not just the coalition that has said that these reforms are important. These reforms have been supported publicly by groups like APPEA, ACCI, the BCA, the Australian Industry Group, Universities Australia and the Australian Retailers Association. Groups that employ millions of Australians have applauded this government's determination. I want to say that this has been a whole-of-government effort. The Prime Minister has led it and his ministers have driven this reform. And I want to congratulate each and every one of them for the role they have played.


My role has been assisted by a fantastic group of colleagues on a deregulation committee: the member for Bass, Andrew Nikolic; the member for Pearce, Christian Porter; the member for Deakin, Michael Sukkar; the member for Reid, Craig Laundy; the member for Hindmarsh, Matt Williams; and the member for Ryan, Jane Prentice. They have provided absolutely wonderful support to me and to the government as we have been coming up with ideas, as we have been trying to implement them and drive them forward with our colleagues.


I want to finish with an anecdote told to me by my friend and colleague the member for Hughes just a few days ago. He said that in his electorate he was asked to go and present volunteer awards. He expected to go and present a volunteer of the year award to Lifesaving volunteers, or to those in the rural and regional fire service, or to members of his school council or local school councils. But the award he presented, for the volunteer team of the year, was a to a group of 'form fillers', people with the best of intentions who worked hard and were wonderful volunteers and members of his community and whose single job it was to help their fellow citizens navigate their way through the maze of government. What are our systems coming to when we have to take the time of volunteers and rely on their good offices to actually help other citizens fill in government forms? It is no surprise to me, when I think that the combination of our tax acts is more than 5,000 pages, or that the Corporations Act is small by comparison at more than 2½ thousand pages, or the fact that it has been documented that this chamber has doubled the amount of federal legislation and regulation approximately every 15 years since Federation. We are saying to those opposite: enough is enough. We on this side are succeeding where they failed. We on this side will not allow another 21,000 additional regulations to be introduced into the parliament, into society, without rigorous economic analysis.


As the Prime Minister said, regulation will no longer be the default action of government; it will only be a means of last resort after every other avenue has been exhausted. And we are alert to the costs to families, we are alert to the costs to individuals, we are alert to the costs to small businesses and we are alert to the costs of the not-for-profit sector.


I and my colleagues on this side of the House will ensure that the men and women of Australia are unshackled from the regulations that the Labor Party left them. No longer will we deny them an opportunity to employ more people, to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation and, at the end of the day, to boost productivity. This is an important agenda, and $2.1 billion of savings is an absolutely brilliant result for this government. I commend the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014 to the House.

Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Minister for Communications) (12:53):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


As the Prime Minister said in the House earlier today, and as Parliamentary Secretary Frydenberg just said with great energy and persuasion a moment ago, the key task of any government and especially this government is to help, not hinder, businesses and individuals to do their work, to innovate, to go about their lives and to ensure that we are enablers of every aspiration, every dream that the citizens and the businesses of Australia have. 


As far as regulations are concerned, in enacting regulation and considering regulation to meet a policy objective, as the parliamentary secretary said, echoing the Prime Minister, governments should use regulation as a last resort and always look for a simpler, more straightforward answer. Is regulation needed? Because we are in the business of making laws, there is a tendency for governments and parliaments to assume that every problem needs a law, every problem needs a new regulation. And it does not. We need to be very practical and focused on ensuring that there is the lightest touch on business, consistent with achieving our policy objectives.


In terms of existing regulations, our statute books are littered with regulations that are an unnecessary burden on business. I will not repeat the parliamentary secretary's address, but I thought he set out very well the way in which the government, by going through this exercise of regular spring cleaning, is able to save billions of dollars of expense off the shoulders of business, and indeed off the shoulders of government, because of course unnecessary regulation has a cost both to business and to government.


The approach that we need to take with every regulation is to say firstly in respect of it: what is the policy objective this regulation is designed to achieve? Is that policy objective still relevant? Do we still agree with it? If the answer to that is no then the regulation should go. But if the answer is yes, yes the policy objective is still a valid one and a relevant one, then the question is: is there a smarter, cheaper and more efficient way of achieving that policy objective? 


The innovations that we have seen in terms of digital platforms that the parliamentary secretary and the Prime Minister described earlier in this debate are so relevant. The fact is that invariably legislation and regulation are playing catchup with technology. Technology is moving so quickly we cannot just sit back and think that when we are making laws with respect to transactions and regulations between citizens and government, we can leave them there forever untouched. The technological context in which they operate is changing so quickly we have to make sure the laws can be brought up to date. That is why, ideally, one should have a minimal level of regulation because the less regulation you have, the less you have to update and spring clean, and we should endeavour wherever possible to make that regulation technology agnostic so that as technologies change they continue to be effective.


Turning to the specifics of the Broadcasting and Other Legislation Amendment (Deregulation) Bill, I note that the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors, which are within my responsibility and my department, are two of the most heavily regulated parts of the Australian economy. Their regulatory frameworks are still fundamentally based in a mid-1990s world of relatively stable technologies and business models. They are still in large measure pre-internet regulations. The world we live in today has seen the rise of the internet and mobile devices. Smart phones have become ubiquitous. And we have social media and fast broadband networks, not just the NBN Co but so many other wireless networks and so forth. Of course empowering all of this, is the rise of cloud computing. The combination of greater computing capacity, greater telecommunications capacity and innovation has utterly transformed the communications environment in which we live.


The pressures that these changes will make on our regulatory arrangements will only increase. We will always seek, as we go through our deregulatory agenda in this portfolio, to ensure that we strike the right balance between deregulation and ensuring that there is diversity in our media industry, whilst always ensuring that consumer protections are both effective and relevant.


As part of the first repeal day, we removed more than 1,000 pages of unnecessary regulation in my portfolio, which has saved the communication sector $35 million a year. Today my parliamentary secretary and enthusiastic deregulator, the member of for Bradfield and I are announcing a package of measures to eliminate yet more unnecessary red tape and remove more onerous and outdated reporting requirements across the sector. Of course, many of the reforms in the broadcasting and communications area have been included in the omnibus package that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister spoke to a moment ago, but a number of measures are dealt with in specific bills dealing with broadcasting and later my parliamentary secretary will deal with similar deregulatory changes in the telecom sector.


This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Radiocommunications Act 1992 and the Australian Communications and Media Authority Act 2005. It removes unnecessary legislation and reduces the regulatory burden on the broadcasting industry. The bill will implement a number of broadcasting related measures identified in the communications deregulation road map I released in May this year. It will also address issues raised through extensive consultation with industry and accessibility advocates. The bill will remove some of the onerous requirements placed on the free-to-air broadcasters and subscription television licensees, streamline and simplify broadcasting legislation and save industry time and money. 


Schedule 4 to the Broadcasting Services Act provided the regulatory framework for the transition from analog to digital-only television broadcasting. The last terrestrial analog television services were switched off on 10 December 2013. After completion of digital switchover in each licence area, the restack program commenced. This restack program involves the progressive reorganisation of television services in terms of their location in the spectrum across Australia. This is to ensure that broadcasters do not use the digital dividend spectrum, which was the spectrum vacated as a consequence of the switch to digital, and a large part of it has been licensed for the purpose of wireless broadband, and also to ensure that television services are transmitted in a more spectrally efficient matter. The restack program is on schedule to be completed by 31 December 2014. Therefore, many of the licensing and planning provisions in broadcasting legislation that regulated the industry during the simulcast period are redundant or, for the purpose of restack, are about to be. This bill will remove or amend those provisions.


The bill will also amend the framework for the planning of broadcasting services band spectrum by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. While many of these planning provisions were necessary when the ACMA first established its planning instruments, many are now considered onerous, given the other legislative requirements the ACMA is required to adhere to.


Reflecting stakeholder feedback, the communications portfolio deregulation road map identified captioning reporting as an area for reform in 2014. The ACMA and my department have consulted with industry and key accessibility groups on a range of potential reforms that primarily seek to improve administrative arrangements for the free-to-air broadcasters and subscription television licensees while requiring that they continue to meet their captioning obligations. I want to make it quite clear that broadcasting licensees will still be required to meet the same specified level of captioning for television programs to assist viewers with hearing impairment. In recent years, captioning requirements on the free to air television stations have gradually increased to such an extent that it has become very clear to consumers when services do not meet them. This allows a move to a complaints based system instead of the existing onerous annual reporting arrangements. The change will reduce compliance costs for free-to-air broadcasters and it is a condition of commercial broadcasters licences that they do supply captioning services and a breach is a serious offence which could result in a direction from the ACMA or, in more extreme cases, the suspension of a licence. 


The captioning requirements placed on subscription television licensees, pay television licensees, are considerably more complex than those applying to free-to-air television broadcasters. Subscription television licensees are required to provide differing levels of captioning over a 24-hour period on different channels, which means there is currently no easy way for consumers accurately to know whether a particular program is required to be captioned. A move to a full complaints based system for subscription television licensees therefore is not appropriate for these licensees at this time. To achieve a better outcome in the long term, the Department of Communications will conduct further consultation with the industry to identify ways in which the subscription television captioning regime could be improved to best suit the needs of all stakeholders. In the meantime, this bill introduces a number of measures designed to enhance flexibility and to reduce the regulatory burden on subscription television broadcasters. 


The amendments will also reduce record keeping requirements and provide greater flexibility for the ACMA when assessing whether subscription and free-to-air broadcasters are providing high-quality captioning services. Among these changes, there is the amendment of section 130ZV to allow for the aggregation of captioning targets across an identified associated group of sports channels which would allow a channel provider to direct its live captioning budget to those events of greatest interest to subscribers. To ensure that subscription broadcasters are not able to meet the entire aggregated target on one channel we are also setting a minimum captioning level for each channel. This will assist in ensuring an appropriate distribution of caption content across the various types of sports content.


The bill will also make changes to the way in which increases in population affect the regulation of broadcasters. It will do this by providing grandfathering relief for commercial broadcasting licensees that, through no fault of their own, would otherwise be placed in breach of the statutory control rules and local content rules for commercial radio if they maintained their existing operations. This measure will ensure a more consistent application of grandfathering arrangements to deal with any inadvertent consequences arising from changes in population. 


The bill will also correct an anomaly in the way certain licence areas are treated with respect to the media ownership and control rules. This will make sure that the method used to calculate media diversity voices—the requirement variously five or four independent media voices—more accurately reflects the practical reality of commercial radio services available to residents in certain licence areas.


The bill will ensure, for example, that, where a smaller commercial radio licence area is entirely within another larger commercial radio licence area, the commercial radio services licensed to operate in the larger licence area are also counted as media diversity voices in the smaller licence area.


Finally, the bill repeals section 123A which requires the ACMA to conduct periodic reviews to assess whether a number of provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act operate in accordance with prevailing community standards. The provisions require industry codes of practice to apply the classification system provided by the Classification (Publication, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 to films that are broadcast and include additional measures to ensure that films are suitably modified, broadcast in appropriate time zones, and that consumers are aware of the reasons for a particular film's classification. 


I note there has never been a review under section 123A since its enactment in 1992 as there are alternative mechanisms for the ACMA to determine whether these provisions operate in accordance with prevailing community standards. This may be based upon the volume of complaints received from viewers or the ACMA's own inquiries. Codes of practice are also periodically reviewed and the ACMA is required to ensure that a draft code provides appropriate community protection. 


The bill also repeals a similar provision that applies to datacasters which also suffers from the same redundancy as section 123A. This particular provision is even more unnecessary as there has never been an industry code of practice for datacasters. Both provisions are clearly redundant and should be repealed.


The government is committed to reforming broadcasting legislation, particularly in areas where onerous regulation is holding the industry back. This reform process, this deregulation process, does not end today; it will be a continuing part of the Abbott government's agenda as the Prime Minister has said today. Every government, I think, in the history of civilisation has promised to cut red tape and to deregulate. We are determined not just to talk about it but to do it. This bill and many others that are being introduced today are evidence of that. I commend the bill to the House.

We have abolished the carbon tax but we have kept the carbon tax compensation, which means that seniors and households right around Australia are better off, on average, by $550 a year. It is worth pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition—

  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order: relevance. I asked the Prime Minister a very straightforward question.



The SPEAKER:  There is no point of order. The member will resume his seat.




Mr ABBOTT:
  This government has abolished the carbon tax and that means that seniors, in common with every other Australian—



Ms Macklin interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence from the member for Jagajaga!




Mr ABBOTT:
  will be better off on average to the tune of $550 a year per household. We are doing the right thing by the people of Australia. If seniors are anxious they should be anxious about members opposite, because if the members opposite ever got back into government the first thing they would do is bring back the carbon tax—a $550-a-year hit on households.




Ms Macklin:
  They are anxious about you!

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (15:13):  What an unedifying display it was in question time today to see the Prime Minister of this country who has introduced the most regressive policies when it comes to health actually not understand or know the detail of his policies, of the imposition of the GP tax when it comes to diagnostic imaging. In fact, the statements that the Prime Minister said in relation to diagnostic imaging are simply untrue. It is absolutely extraordinary when it comes to one of the government's own budget measures, when it comes to health policy, that the Prime Minister through those budget measures will be making it harder for people who need to get a cancer diagnosis, adding hundreds and thousands of dollars of up-front costs for people having to access diagnostic imaging for their cancer diagnosis—hundreds of dollars out of pocket.


We were not making figures up or plucking them from the air; these were figures that have come from the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association. The impact of the government's budget when it comes to diagnostic imaging is more than $7. The government has not been telling the truth to the Australian public about its $7 GP tax when it comes to diagnostic imaging. That is because it is not just a $7 GP tax that represents a $5 rebate reduction per item, not per time, that you have to represent for diagnostic imaging. It may be a number of MBS items are actually charged during that time. So it is a $5 rebate reduction per item according to the advice of the Department of Health to the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association. It is also the abolition of the 10 per cent cut in rebates for general patients who were previously bulk-billed due to the abolition of the bulk-billing incentive.


The Prime Minister sought in question time to say, 'Oh, there's a low gap incentive that will cover that.' That is simply not true. The low gap incentive does not apply to anybody who is a general patient. So if you are general patient, not a concession card holder, and you currently go to diagnostic imaging and you do not have a lot of money, and the radiographer decides that you should be bulk-billed for that cancer diagnosis, something that is very expensive to undertake, then what happens is that you will have to pay up-front for a start and you will have to pay the additional cost that now will be borne by the radiographer because the government has got rid of the 10 per cent bulk-billing incentive.


The other thing that they have done is that they have abolished the general permissible gap which moderates the cost of high cost items from 1 January 2016. The figures are, frankly, pretty disturbing. For those high-end scans when you are talking about PET scans in particular, that can potentially be $1,000. That is $1,000 that you will have to pay up-front in order to get your PET scan. This is how absolutely appalling these measures are that this government has introduced. It is not telling the Australian public the truth about the impact of its decision to apply—I call it a GP tax because it is about raising revenue off the back of sick people; that is exactly what it is—what its co-payment, as it calls it, actually means for diagnostic imaging. It is a very serious issue. We already know that people often leave their scans, their access to be able to get their cancers diagnosed, too late in some circumstances. We know that many people—we want to be optimistic about our health—put off finding out what is wrong with them and that often means that they leave their scans too late for a cancer diagnosis. We do not want that to happen in this country. We do not want barriers to be put in place for people accessing the diagnostic imaging that they need in order to have a diagnosis of cancer; we want people to do that early because they know they have a higher chance of survival. So what this government is doing with its measure, frankly, is making it less likely that people will be able to access diagnostic imaging, make it even more expensive up-front for people to get that diagnosis and will leave them potentially hundreds of dollars out of pocket. 


I comes, of course, in the overall attack that this government has had on our universal health insurance scheme. We celebrated yesterday the life of Gough Whitlam and we on this side of the House that 40 years ago, when Medibank was introduced in a historic joint sitting of parliament to get it through, that this mob on the other side fought it tooth and nail—not only fought it tooth and nail but at the first opportunity they had they got rid of it. It took to get in the Hawke and Keating governments to introduce our universal health insurance scheme that is Medicare, the scheme that has served this country well, with some of the best health outcomes in the developed world. It is a scheme that we all support. 


What we saw at the time was the Liberal-National Party saying that they would work with every breath in their body to try and kill off Medicare. We know that has been their agenda. What we have seen with this first Abbott government budget is an appalling attack on our universal health care system; a $7 GP tax for every time you go to see a GP, putting a barrier in the way of that critical primary-care part of our system where we want people to go to stay well, to access prevention—making it harder for people to access in fact what is the most efficient and cheapest part of our health care system that is at the centre of Medicare.


But it is not only a tax when you go to the GP; it is an X-ray tax, a pathology tax, an MRI tax, a tax on PET scans, a tax on CAT scans—a tax every time you need to access a diagnosis for cancer. Or if your kid falls off the monkey bars, in a circumstance I am very familiar with, and breaks their arm. It is a tax on all of those services. It is also more than $50 billion worth of cuts to the public hospital system, which has serious implications for health and hospital reform over the next decade. There were historic agreements that were reached with states and territories to reform our public hospital system and make it better: make it more efficient to get access to emergency departments and to elective surgery—to actually get the states and territories to agree on an efficient price for funding activity in hospitals, driving really important health reform.


The new Abbott government has decided that it does not want to be in the business of public hospitals. It actually thinks that the states should do it. It wants to withdraw and go back behind the barriers to say, 'We don't want to participate in actually reforming our public hospital system.' I know many people in the community want the Commonwealth to be in the business of reforming our hospital system and should be in the business of making sure people have access to decent emergency department waiting times and elective surgery waiting times.


We have also seen the $1.3 billion cut to pharmaceuticals, a bill that is sitting before the Senate at the moment. It is $1.3 billion, changing in a very sneaky measure the safety net, making it harder and harder for concession card patients to actually meet that safety net, and making the cost of medicines unaffordable in this country. There is also the $368 billion for the national partnership agreements on prevention, funding states that were relying on this from this financial year to tackle obesity, smoking rates and alcohol abuse—activities happening in communities right the way across the country: in our workplaces, in our schools and throughout our community organisations.


But there has also been more than $600 million cut from our public dental programs, including $200 million this financial year alone—walking away from the national partnership agreements for adult public dental services. There has been a cut of $197 million from what we call the health flexible funds, which have been going largely to not-for-profit organisations—things like the Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council and AIDS councils—to run their activities. This is really important work to improve our health system in communities across this country.


This is what the Abbott government's first budget means for health, and it is an unprecedented attack on our universal health insurance scheme. We know that if it was not for Gough Whitlam introducing Medibank 40 years ago we would not have Medicare today. We know that if the Liberal-National parties had their way, then Medicare would never have existed and they want to kill it off today. From the measures they have introduced into this budget, it is obvious that they are attempting to destroy Medicare by stealth and we absolutely on this side of the House stand and condemn them. Medicare is not your plaything. Keep your hands off Medicare; keep our public health insurance scheme! Learn the lessons of your own history. The Australian public will not stand for it!

"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2014-10-22,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (15:23):  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I thank colleagues who are very interested in an important debate. I want to correct a lot of what the shadow minister had to say, and I want to inject some facts, strangely enough, into this debate. Much of what we heard from the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat, is Labor rhetoric and part of a scare campaign, and we saw the opposition misleading the public again in question time today.


It is worth having a sober look at the actual statistics and what the figures provide for in this budget, in black and white. The total expenditure goes up each and every year in this budget. The money we are spending on health and in hospitals goes up each year. The reality for this budget, quite opposite to that which was proposed by the member for Ballarat, is that we put more money into Medicare again this year. In fact, we will put about $19½ billion into Medicare this year. That has gone up by 42 per cent over the past five years. But if we do not take some action over the next 10 years, Medicare will go up by an amount that will mean we will spend $34 billion a year—so $20 billion this year, growing to $34 billion in 10 years' time. If Labor believe that is sustainable, then they should put that on the record. Certainly state Labor health ministers do not believe it is sustainable. Certainly it is the case that the two independent reports commissioned by both the Rudd and Gillard governments advised Labor that spending on health at its current rate each year was unsustainable.


And so what have we done in this budget? What we have said in relation to hospitals is that we will increase funding to hospitals by nine per cent this year, by nine per cent next year, by nine per cent the year after that and by 6½ per cent in year 4. Labor want to betray the 2½ per cent reduction from nine down to 6½ per cent growth as a cut, which is quite tricky, and politically the member for Ballarat may well get away with that. No doubt people listening to this debate today will think, 'On the member for Ballarat's contribution, the government's cutting funding to hospitals.' But we are increasing it by nine per cent each year over the next three years, and we have put it at 6½ per cent in year 4—6½ per cent when our economy is growing at five per cent, which I think is quite reasonable. It is a lot more than what is happening in some other developed nations around the world, including in New Zealand for example, and I believe that that is putting it on a sustainable path.


That is at the same time as the government is trying to pay down Labor's debt. We are borrowing money each and every month to pay down just the interest bill, let alone the capital of the debt that Labor ran up. Bear in mind that they were only in government for six years, but ran up debt approaching $667 billion. And anybody in the gallery today, listening to this broadcast at home, those who do their own household budgets know you can only spend more money than you earn each year for so long. You cannot continue to spend more than you earn; you can until you run out of savings, until the bank takes the house, but then the whole operation closes down. So, yes, we are trying to pay down Labor's debt and yet still increase spending each year, but by a more sustainable path. I think that is perfectly sustainable; I think that is perfectly reasonable.


The honourable member opposite, the member for Ballarat, talked about the introduction of Medibank and Medicare. It is quite interesting to reflect on some of the comments that were made by Labor when Labor was a strong party. The Bill Shorten of today is no Gough Whitlam of yesterday. That is the reality. The Leader of the Opposition is not a patch on former Labor leaders, including Gough Whitlam and Bob Hawke. I will tell you what Gough Whitlam had to say in relation to Medibank. I think it is very instructive. It was one of the guiding principles of Labor during the fifties, sixties and seventies. Gough Whitlam had this to say:


The government is determined … to give all Australians access to high quality health care at reasonable cost.


'At reasonable cost'. He never claimed that you could give everything to everybody for free, which is what this Labor opposition is pretending. Four out of five presentations to doctors today are for free; 80 per cent of those presentations are free. Now the taxpayer works hard and pays taxes so that we can provide those services for free to four out of five people.




Ms Burke:
  What is the Medicare levy then?




Mr DUTTON:
  The Medicare levy? 'The Medicare levy' comes from the former Speaker in this place. It was not even good enough to be put up by her good friend Julia Gillard, the former Prime Minister. Let me correct that: the former Speaker, the member for Chisholm, says that somehow the Medicare levy should cover what we spend on Medicare. Let me give her a basic lesson in economics: we raise with the Medicare levy about half of that we spend on Medicare each year. The problem is—the basic economic facts escape Labor—that the growth rate of Medicare is much greater than that which we collect on the Medicare levy, so over time Medicare becomes even more unsustainable. The basics need to be understood by the Labor Party opposite before they can make a proper contribution to this debate. Gough Whitlam got it right when he said that health care needed to be 'at reasonable cost'. He did not propose that 80 per cent of services, when you go to the doctor, should be for free.


So what have we said in relation to this budget?


Much the same as what Bob Hawke said: 'It's very difficult to suggest a co-payment … is going to create great hardship.' What did Bob Hawke suggest? Bob Hawke suggested and implemented a co-payment of $3.50 which incidentally, had it been indexed—



Ms Butler interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Griffith is not in her seat and not entitled to interject.




Mr DUTTON:
  over the course of the last years, would be about $6.40 today. What is the government proposing today? A co-payment of $7. But, importantly, we are retaining bulk-billing not for four out of five services but for those people who cannot afford a co-payment themselves. That retains the principle of universality, which is what this matter of public importance is supposed to be about; it was mentioned only once during the course of the shadow minister's contribution. But universality means that you can provide support to those to those who cannot afford health-care costs themselves. We do that. It is central to the principle of the plan we have on the table. We say people who have the ability to pay $7 should pay it so that we can keep Medicare sustainable. If you want to adopt Labor's proposal that everything is free for everyone, and we continue to rack up debt on the credit card, it will fall over.


Australians are not stupid. They saw through the Rudd and Gillard governments and they see through Bill Shorten and his opposition as well. At the next election we will look the Australian public in the eye and say that yes, we have had to take tough decisions during the course of the first 12 months of this government, and no doubt over the course of the next two years, to rectify some of the waste and deficit that Labor racked up; but at the same time we have sustained a Medicare system which will serve us for decades to come. I do not have any problem at all saying that to the Australian public. But at the next election the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party will have to say to the Australian public that they are not prepared to make changes which will make Medicare sustainable. If we want to have that debate I am more than happy to have it.


If we had abolished bulk-billing altogether I would think the member for Ballarat might have a leg to stand on. If the member for Ballarat could stand up here and say, 'You have wiped out the ability to provide for those who are in most need', then she would have a fair debating point. But that is not what is on the table. The government has said we will take care of those who are most needy.


Where Labor's greatest hypocrisy lies in this particular debate is around pharmaceuticals. Labor says it is completely unreasonable to ask people who can pay a simple a co-payment to pay it. But at the same time it was Labor that introduced a co-payment in the pharmaceutical system for those on concession cards. You would not know it from the contributions of those opposite. When the sickest, poorest Australian needs to fill a prescription at the pharmacist does Labor say that they can bulk-bill and have that prescription for free? No, they do not. They say to that person, 'You will pay $6.10 for the first script and every subsequent script, and the safety net does not cut in until you reach about 60 scripts.' So an equivalent co-payment in the medicine system is $360. Labor presided over that system all the way through the Hawke years, the Keating years and the Gillard years—or the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd trifecta disaster for this country. They sat on that policy and they charged the sickest and poorest; yet they come in here and suggest that a $7 co-payment to keep Medicare sustainable, while still protecting those who cannot afford the $7, is somehow unreasonable. They are completely wrong on this topic.


Do you know what else they do in the states? If you go around state-by-state, the Labor party charges co-payments in relation to dental and other emergency services. We will highlight that as the weeks and months go along. The Labor Party will have to explain at the next election why it stands for a Medicare which is unsustainable.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (15:33):  The honourable minister said he wanted to inject a few facts into the debate. Here are a few facts the minister got wrong.


The first is that Medicare is not free. We pay for it. We pay for it through our Medicare levy. That includes those people who are concession card holders. I know the minister tries to deny the fact that concession card holders are also paying, but one of the facts he might like to go and find out for himself is how many of those concession card holders are also taking up private health insurance. They are being whacked twice by this GP tax, a fact the minister does not like to admit.


He also gets his facts wrong on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He tries to convince people that it was the Labor government that introduced a co-payment for the PBS. I have news for the minister: there was this bloke called Menzies. The minister may not know our history very well but you would expect a Liberal Party minister to understand their own history a bit better than he does. It was Menzies who first introduced the co-payment into the PBS system. It was 1960 and it was a charge of five shillings.


Yesterday the House, and indeed the nation, mourned the passing of a great Australian. Today we on this side of the House recommit ourselves to his vision for a better Australia—a better Australia that includes universal access to health care. As Gough Whitlam stood on the steps of Parliament House some 39 years ago, he issued a solemn injunction to all fair-thinking Australians. He said to us, 'Maintain your rage.' Maintain your rage against all of those who seek to make Australia a place that is smaller than it is today—a place that is less equitable than it is today. There is much that we remain angry about. That sacred duty to maintain the rage now falls to each and every Labor member of parliament, because just as Labor was the party that introduced Medibank and Medicare, we are the last line of defence for those who would seek to destroy them.


Amidst the confusion, the chaos, the ineptitude, the false communication and the rotten handling of this terrible budget, we can define a consistent line of thought that joins this Prime Minister, this health minister and the policies of this rotten government to those Liberal elitists who sought to destroy Medibank 40 years ago—who sought to stop Medibank ever being introduced and then over the next four years pulled it apart, brick by brick. It was Billy Snedden who said in the debates during the historic joint sitting of parliament to introduce the Medibank legislation:


We will fight and we will continue to fight. We will destroy it.


Of all the promises that this government seeks to keep and all the faith that they tried to keep between 1974 and today, it is the promise to destroy Medicare brick by brick—and that is exactly what they are attempting to do. They are trying to destroy Medicare, just as they tried to stop it happening in 1974 and again in 1984.


I want to talk about the regions. When we contemplate the impact that these atrocious policies are going to have on regional Australia we are left wondering what it is that binds the MPs on the other side of the House to these mad policies. Let's contemplate the facts—as the member for Ballarat has done today—of the cost of diagnostic imaging for people living in regional Australia. It is $90 up front for an X-ray, $380 for a CAT scan and $160 for a mammogram. A PET scan could cost over $1,000 for people who are living in some of the poorest communities in the country. You have got to ask yourself why the people who pretend to represent those communities in regional Australia are binding themselves to these mad policies. If they were such good members as they pretend to be, they would be standing here today arguing against those policies and they would be crossing the floor when the legislation comes before the House because that is the right thing to do.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (15:38):  Those on the other side have an affliction with free stuff. I know that 30 years ago there was a leader of this country who wanted free health care. But do you know what? Not just Australia but the entire world has moved on. It was interesting for me in 1997 when I got my chance to meet the great man himself, Gough Whitlam. And, no, it was not out in Western Sydney, it was not in a public hospital. It was in Australia's finest private hospital, and he certainly had no problem with the fine system we have of public and private hospital provision. Let's be honest, we have a system where there is choice. I have no problem with both sides of this chamber exercising choice. But do not for one minute be so misguided as to think that the Medicare levy pays for Medicare. We have had two Labor spokespeople now say that the $10 million that we collect from the 1.5 per cent actually pays for Medicare. I suspect that I am now going to hear that a Labor government would be prepared to rule out, or otherwise, an increase to the Medicare levy to pay for Medicare—that's right, double it!


The Medicare levy costs us all around $500 a year, if you are earning about one hundred grand a year, and an extra $500 for every $10,000 that you earn on top of that. That can add up over time—$50 for every $10,000 above that. That is what those higher income earners pay into the system. But that only pays for half of the cost of Medicare, which has gone from $9 billion to $18 billion over the last 10 years and will go up to $34 billion over the next 10 years. It is a challenge to bend the cost curve. Every economy in the world is working on bending that cost curve. But the poor unfortunate Labor Party is riveted, welded and stapled to this notion of free health care because their great leader said so in 1975. They are stuck with that notion. They are unable to review it and unable to reconstruct their thinking because it is all about the free stuff. Let's keep in mind that throughout the known world, and particularly here in a developed system like Australia's, people without financial means are bulk-billed and will continue to be. It will never be compulsory to charge a co-payment. That co-payment is still less than a Macca's meal deal—a quarter pounder mid-sized meal deal. The smartest, most talented and hardworking professionals in this community are worth $7 to spend some time with to look after your health. They are worthy of that payment. Do not take it from the doctors or the health planners on this side; talk to the doctors on your side. 



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr LAMING:
  What? There are no doctors on the opposite side? Where are the doctors on that side? They are not including you over there, Dr Gillespie. Give me Dr Leigh over there, one of the finest minds who under any other system of merit would be opposition Treasurer by now—but not in the Labor Party. That fine Dr Leigh said that we need a moderate co-payment:


… not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc.


Perfectly said, Dr Leigh. Come and join the doctors over here and let's have a world-class health system.


Now let's be honest, bulk-billing is still absolutely endemic—



Dr Leigh interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott

Mr LAMING:
  in diagnostic radiology and pathology. As long as those requests are on the same form in pathology, there is only the one co-payment charged. Two-thirds of all items under Medicare when you see a doctor are exempted from the co-payment. Any of the chronic disease items are co-payment exempt.


But let's go back to that Labor world. That was where they used to promise you the free stuff in the form of a super clinic—except they only built 33 of the 66 of them planned. And what were those buildings doing? Long before they could even find a GP to steal from the neighbouring general practice—because that is what they did—they turned all the lights on. That's right, in the member for Petrie's area there was no working super clinic; they just turned the lights on with a big cross outside! They delivered a super clinic, but what was undelivered was staff in it actually doing some work! Of course, we have the PBS co-payment. Right now, Australians pay around $6 to fill a script. But this lot will not pay the same amount to go and see the highest trade professionals in the health system. Who were the architects of the pharmaceutical co-payment? Labor. Who tried to dull the pharmaceutical co-payment without success? Labor. How much does it add up to over time over time? Sixty scripts at $6 adds up over a while, doesn't it? But oh no, we cannot have a $70 maximum capped out co-payment to see a doctor. The argument is so thin. The argument is riven with holes, like Swiss cheese.


Let's move to private health insurance. That's right, you are quite prepared to nickel and dime average Australians by making health insurance more expensive. Out go the ancillaries and home come the allied health professionals from the regional areas because there is no work anymore. How much does it cost a patient to insure the continuity of their health care? This is a Labor government welded to the past, welded to the ideas of Whitlam and not keeping up with the future of a sustainable Medicare.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (15:44):  The government are attacking the universality of health care in this country and they are doing it because it is in their DNA to attack the universality of health care in this country. Under Gough Whitlam, who passed away yesterday, Labor introduced universal health care after many years of policy development and broad consultation with people. I will tell you what Gough Whitlam said because there have been some unfortunates on the other side verballing him today. I will explain it in Gough's own words. He said in 1969:


We propose a universal health scheme, based on the needs and means of families.


That is what he said in 1969. In 1973 he said:


It is only our insurance program—because it is based on the payment of a percentage of taxable income—which can overcome this problem—


that is, the expensiveness of health care in Australia. He continued:


It is only our insurance program which will ensure that a low income earner will pay less than a middle income earner and that a middle income earner will pay less than a wealthy man. Australia will not have a just and equitable health insurance system until that principle is enshrined in its laws.


For all those people over there claiming that somehow health care is currently free and that people should pay for their health care, as previous speakers have said, people already make a payment for their health care. I can tell you that you do not need a price signal to value GPs. You do not need a price signal to value the medical assistance and advice that you get from a GP. You absolutely do not. It is an absolute fallacy.


At the end of the submission to the Commission of Audit that advocated for the co-payment—and we all remember the Commission of Audit—the author said, 'By the way, we should actually find out whether there is a problem of people going to the doctor when they do not need to.' Oh, do you think? Do you think you should find that out before you start putting in disincentives for sick people to get primary health care that might keep them out of hospital, keep them safe, keep them well and give them the opportunity for early treatment, because we all know that early treatment is the key?


Everyone on this side of the House understands those principles of universality. The minister claimed that universality was about low-income earners being able to get health care. Universality is about having a great health system for everyone, no matter how rich or how poor they are. It is not about a two-tiered health system where there is some safety net for poor people and rich people get great health treatment somewhere else. It is about universal access to health care so it is whether you are sick that determines the health care you get not the size of your wallet and income. That is what universality means.


What is this government doing? This is in the great tradition of Liberals and Nationals past, who opposed the introduction of Medibank in the 1970s, who opposed the introduction of Medicare in the 1980s and who, under John Howard, attacked bulk-billing. I remember fighting a 'Save Medicare' campaign back then too. They cannot help themselves—they always want to lay into Medicare because they do not support it. They are just getting sneakier. John Howard learnt that you cannot openly attack Medicare in this country. He learnt that the hard way, so they have to get sneakier. Let us not let them get away with it. Let us talk about what the Prime Minister's budget is actually doing to health care in this country.


Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, came to power promising that there would be no new taxes and no cuts to health. I remember in my by-election the Prime Minister coming to Brisbane and telling the voters in Griffith that there were no plans for a GP tax when his own Commission of Audit already had a submission, when his own candidate in Griffith had already welcomed the idea and when he knew full well—or he ought to have—that there was a very real prospect of a GP tax in the budget. And what did we get? We got a GP tax in the budget. We got a GP tax that will slug you every time you go to the doctor or get an x-ray or a blood test.


According to the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association, we have also got the situation where general patients will have to pay upfront a minimum of $90 for an x-ray, $380 for a CAT scan, $160 for a mammogram—and what do the Liberals and Nationals have against mammograms?—and $190 for an ultrasound. For a PET scan the upfront costs could hit $1,000. For a typical patient with thyroid cancer the upfront charges for the scans and tests would come to around $1,000. A woman with a lump in her breast would need to spend at least $280 upfront to have her cancer diagnosed. A person with lung cancer will have a minimum upfront payment of $320. Shame. (Time expired)

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-10-22,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (15:49):  As we pay our respects to Gough the legend, we look mournfully at those opposite. If only there were something—anything—of 'legend' about the current Labor offering and if only there were a glimmer of hope, we might be content. But, no. The former Labor government had absolutely no comprehension of how to manage money or how to provide services on a sustainable basis. Indeed, I do not think many of them on that side can even add up, excluding the member for Fraser, who has done some excellent work on the health system. They rack up debt every time they get into government and then it is our job to come in and clean up the mess.


This government will not stand by and watch Medicare collapse under its own weight. So let us look at some facts. Unfortunately in the speeches from the last couple of speakers from that side we did not see many of these facts. Let us look at the sustainability of the healthcare system under Labor. When we came into government, as they have already pointed out, the Commission of Audit pointed out the areas where we are spending most of our money. They turn out to be welfare and health. The two biggest numbers, which constitute about 40 per cent of our budget, are for welfare and health. 


Here is where it gets hard. They are growing at a much faster rate than the economy. They are growing at about eight or nine per cent a year—almost 10 per cent per year—but the economy is growing at 4.5 per cent or five per cent in a good year. So if you keep going and wait long enough, the whole economy will be health and welfare. It is simple mathematics. There will be nothing else left. That happens surprisingly quickly. Indeed, on these growth rates, out of control health spending will reach almost a quarter of the economy within 20 years. The member for Fraser is looking over here saying: 'Yes, I have done those numbers. They are right.' That means that almost one out of every four dollars would be spent on health. Who is going to pay for that?


The biggest numbers for the government are in Medicare. So let us put this in perspective. The total cost of the health system, federal and state, is about $140 billion. The Medicare levy we pay in our taxes is about $10 billion out of that $140 billion. Very little is paid for by the Medicare levy. We know that and we heard that from previous speakers. People know that over the last five or six years the Medicare expense in this country has gone up by 42 per cent. 


The biggest increases are coming from chronic disease funding. If you take the MBS item numbers that cover chronic disease, they are rising at 25 per cent a year. In 2007, the beginning of the Labor government, those costs were $200 million. In 2014, those costs will be just over $1 billion—five times greater in only seven years. It does not matter how you look at it; that is not sustainable. It will not be a universal health system for the next generation if we do not deal with this now.


Of course, those opposite mistake 'universal' for 'free'. 'Universal' does not equal 'free'. So let's look at how free the healthcare system was under the previous Labor government. It turns out that during the time that Labor was in power, health care required large direct payments from individuals throughout the system. And I will give you some numbers here. Under the PBS, 17 per cent of the costs were paid for by individuals; other health practitioners, 55 per cent. These numbers are from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Dental was 67 per cent; aids and other appliances, 74 per cent; and non-PBS medications, 97 per cent. So in total almost 40 per cent of the costs across all of those various items were paid for by the individual. The health system is not free, and those opposite know it, they just want to pretend otherwise. 


We know that the co-payment is reasonable. We are asking for a $7 contribution. We know that in New Zealand it is $17.50. And New Zealand has a much lauded health system—in fact, those opposite have often praised the New Zealand health system. We are not saying that it should be $16, as it is in some parts of Europe. We are saying that $7 is a reasonable payment for Australians to make. 


Our country is paying $1 billion a year in interest. We are on our way to $3 billion. One group in this place says: 'If we've got a spending problem, just up the taxes.' We say: we want a sustainable health system, and the way to do that is to ensure that those who can pay do so.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm) (15:54):  I really do feel like it is groundhog day. One of the things I campaigned on in my first election campaign before I came into this place was to save Medicare. If you look at my Facebook page, you will see me with Gough Whitlam, and a balloon that reads 'Save Medicare'—to save our universal health system.


Unlike those opposite, we do not equate 'universal' with 'free'. We understand that universality is about access for all. If you want to go and look at numbers, maybe you should read what has just been announced in Senate estimates today; senior Treasury officials say the $7 co-payment will not help the healthcare system, as those opposite have been crying out. Here we are again—16 years later—and yet another Liberal government is doing everything it can to destroy universal healthcare in this country. 


Gough Whitlam and the Labor Party established universal healthcare in 1974. In the face of Liberal Party intransigence, it took a double-dissolution election and a joint sitting to establish—and thank goodness it did—what has become one of the greatest assets this country has ever had: universal access, Medicare. Yet, ever since the establishment of Medicare, the Liberal Party has done nothing but try to destroy it. Whenever there is a Liberal government, universal healthcare is at risk, and never more so than under this despicable Liberal government. 


It is notable that, when responding to the passing of Gough Whitlam, the Abbott government's loudest cheerleader, the ever mean-spirited, Alan Jones, said:


The Abbott government is even today dealing with the costly consequences and culture of entitlement bequeathed by Whitlam's decisions to give free universal medical care and university education.


The central policy unit of the LNP, the Institute of Public Affairs, yesterday described the establishment of universal healthcare simply as 'regrettable'. That is the thing those opposite do not want to say: this is about the beginning of the end—the destruction of Medicare, the destruction of universality—despite the fact that maintaining universal access to affordable healthcare has been a linchpin in our society's ability to remain healthy and prosperous. 


You do not need to just take our word for it; study after study after study demonstrates that Australia's healthcare system is one of the best, one of the most affordable, because of our access to primary healthcare. Prevention is better than cure. Prevention upfront, ensuring people get to the doctor in time; have a mammogram in time; do not leave it until it is too late. Then it is genuinely too costly not just to the individual but to our whole society. As sickening as these comments from these unelected representatives of the Liberal party are, they represent the ugly truth of the Abbott government's attitude towards the very notion of universal health care. Their policies prove their intent to try and kill it, once and for all. 


We have not even managed to bury Gough and he is turning in his grave—he has not even got there yet—because of what this government is trying to do: a $7 tax on visiting the doctor, a $5 hike in the price of medicine; more than $50 billion cut from hospitals; and more than $4 million cut from dental programs. These measures spell the death of universal health care; just what the Abbott government is planning and hoping for. 


The GP tax of course will apply to far more than just visiting the doctor. And the Abbott government's 10 to 15 per cent cut in the rebate paid to radiologists will dramatically increase the out-of-pocket cost for people needing scans. In fact, as we heard in question time today, the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association has said that we will have to pay a minimum of $90 upfront for an X-ray.


My son managed to destroy his thumb before grand final day, ending up in hospital—missing out on seeing his Swans beaten, which was probably a saving grace. We would have been up for $90; we would have been up for more for the plastic surgeon we had to see that day. 


In my electorate there is a great organisation called Knitted Knockers, who are out there knitting prostheses to give away to women who have suffered breast cancer and had mastectomies. They are appalled that there will not be help upfront. Women will be prevented from going to a doctor. This government stands condemned.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (15:59):  It gives me great pleasure today to speak against the member for Ballarat's outrageous matter of public importance. The member for Ballarat's statement could not be further from the truth. In fact, it is the Abbott government who are actually protecting Australia's healthcare system by ensuring that it will still be functioning when the next generation want to use it. I want to make sure that our healthcare system is still around when my granddaughter Evie is an adult and might need it. That is what we are doing over on this side of the House.


The coalition's budget measures for health are all about building a strong health system. We are laying the foundations for a stable system that can absorb the pressures caused by an ageing population, by chronic disease and by higher costs. Medicare, the PBS and public hospitals have really been feeling intense pressure from these factors, and the coalition government is supporting these agencies by working with them to create strong plans for a sustainable future in health care. Expenditure on these has grown faster than the economy. We are focused on delivering a stronger, more stable health system for the future, and only the coalition government can deliver this system.


In my electorate of Solomon, I was able to secure—along with the health minister—$110 million to build a brand-new hospital to cater for the growth of health service needs in Palmerston and Darwin. My good friend, the Northern Territory health minister, Robyn Lambley, and her team are doing a fantastic job, delivering on this project. They are taking the time to make sure that we get it right and to spend the money wisely, because we all know that health money is very precious. We want to make sure that we have a hospital that is being built to cater for the needs of the Darwin and Palmerston residents of the next 50 years.


This is how the people of Darwin and Palmerston know that the coalition is taking health care seriously. People in my electorate know that the adults are now in charge of something as precious as our public healthcare system.




Mr Perrett:
  It's the juveniles!




Mrs GRIGGS:
  The member for Moreton just needs to button his lips!Labor's blatant waste of taxpayer dollars in our healthcare system is absolutely outrageous. Let's put the facts on the table. They spent $463,000 to do a study on a fat tax—on junk food—when they had already ruled it out. They spent $236,000 on an informative Facebook page that actually gained a whopping 244 likes. I cannot do the figures but I think that is a very excessive amount of money for 244 likes. They also spent $650 million on the infamous GP superclinics, and we heard earlier that of the 66 promised clinics only 33 were delivered.


The previous Labor government were more interested in putting bureaucrats in front of paper than in putting the nurses and doctors in front of the patients. Instead of delivering on healthcare promises they stood around and talked about it. The Labor government, as we know, is big on promises and very bad on delivering them. This government, however, is it committed to ensuring that our precious health dollars are spent in the most efficient way possible, ensuring that every dollar is directed towards improving patient outcomes. We are ending the wasteful and inefficient spending in the health portfolio that occurred under Labor.


Mostly we hear of the opposition's objections to our plans for health care. We very rarely hear of any plans that they come up with to improve health care. We heard from the member for Lingiari; he was whingeing and moaning about the co-payment but, in actual fact, he voted for one. So Labor has left the coffers dry. We want to make sure that the money that is there can be spent—

We all know that Labor cannot be trusted with money, we know they cannot be trusted with credit cards and we know they cannot be trusted with getting this country on track. That is why we are here. We have to clean up their mess time after time. We are doing it again and this rubbish about Medicare is just, as I said—rubbish. Medicare is not under threat—only from those opposite!

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (16:04):  It may have been a good idea for the member for Solomon to have made some references to the needs of the Indigenous community that she represents in this place.


I would like to start by saying that one of the iconic reforms of the Whitlam government was the establishment of Medibank, a universal healthcare system that provides access to best-quality health care and medical services to all Australians, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Universal healthcare cover has since become the Australian way of life, a system of health care that is highly valued by our community because no-one in this country has ever had to worry about forgoing medical attention. Nor have they had to worry about becoming ill or dying because they cannot afford to go to the doctor. In fact, Australians, and in particular my constituents, have never had to be concerned about the size of their cheque books or wallets when it comes to health care.


That is why this MPI is very important, because it puts this government on notice that the opposition, together with the Australian people, will fight hard and will fight long to protect our universal healthcare system because we all believe that access to health care for all is a right and not a privilege.


Perhaps this government has not learnt from the Howard government's attempts to tamper with Medicare and bulk-billing in the past. Or perhaps they have learnt, as the member for Griffin said earlier on, that if you want to attack Australia's universal healthcare system you do not let the public know in advance. That is why they deceived the public in the lead-up to the last election by promising no cuts and no new taxes. My constituents are livid at the broken promises and are prepared to fight this government's attempts to change the universality of our healthcare system.


In the time that I have been the member for Calwell, the availability of bulk-billing and after-hours GP services, which are a lifeline for the health and wellbeing of my community, have always been a priority. The proposed $7 GP tax, the $5 hike in medicines, the $50-billion cut from the public hospitals, the $400-million cut from the dental programs and the shutting down of 61 Medicare Locals is going to have far reaching ramifications in my electorate. I am concerned about this because I have a very large multicultural community, an ageing community and the general socio-economic status of my electorate is such that any additional cost will be a financial burden to the point where my constituents will be forced to make choices about going to the doctor—choices they have never had to make before.


So when the Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association reports that the effects of scrapping the bulk-billing incentives on diagnostics will mean that patients will have to pay a minimum of $90 for an X-ray or $380 for a CAT scan or $190 for an ultrasound or a person with lung cancer will have a minimum upfront payment of $320, my community and I become very alarmed. I have an electorate where, statistically, people are more likely to become ill than those in wealthier electorates. We cannot afford a situation where people cannot afford to go to the doctor.


I am particularly concerned about the impact of the GP tax on mammograms. Women in my electorate face paying a minimum of $160 for a mammogram, and especially alarming is the prospect that a woman with a lump in her breast will have to spend at least $280 upfront to have her cancer diagnosed. I spend a lot of time advancing awareness about breast cancer in this place and I know how important preventative measures are because early detection is critical to survival rates. I not only know how important it is for a woman to have a mammogram but I also know how difficult it is for many women, especially those from non-English speaking backgrounds, to make that decision. We work hard to encourage those women, but I can tell you that the burden of cost will be a deterrent. One in nine women get breast cancer. When a woman gets breast cancer, a family and a community is affected. Increasing the costs of visits to GPs will be a deterrent and that is just not acceptable.


For those of us on this side of the chamber and for the Australian public at large, Australia's universal health care system is to be treasured and maintained; it is not to be undermined.

Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (16:09):  How often do we see hypocrisy, hype and scaremongering in this House? Who was it that actually developed and delivered the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme? It was the coalition. It was the first vehicle for providing widespread dental care to a million people. Who got rid of it? The ALP. Who tried to make Medicare more sustainable by encouraging private insurance? The coalition did. Who attacked it? Labor did. All this hypocrisy is too much to bear. Who introduced the co-payment for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? It was Labor. Yet when we try to make something sustainable that is going to last for decades to come, they criticise it. They have no credibility at all. Just look at the money they wasted on super clinics—trophy buildings that pinch doctors from other medical centres. They have not really delivered much at all when you analyse what they are criticising.


As that famous woman who ran Britain for more than a decade said: pennies do not fall from heaven; they have to be earned here on earth. The same applies to the health budget. Governments do not create money. They are given it by taxpayers and they hold it in trust to be used wisely and efficiently. Primary industries, secondary industries, service industries and people that create wealth then pay a portion of it to the government. But we have this school of magic-pudding economics where the government pays for everything that just rears its ugly pudding head again and again.


Labor have a PhD in economics in the member for Fraser, a doctor. I think he needs to tend to the sick health economics being applied. The health budget is in terminal decline and maybe not even the good doctor could cure the health economic ills. The opposition does not seem to realise that it is not the universality that is being threatened; it is the long-term sustainability. Bulk-billing occurred 237 million times last year. Four out of every five visits to GPs were bulk-billed. That is $12.8 billion, a huge increase. There has been a 45 per cent increase in five years or 122 per cent in 10 years. Do they really think that is a sustainable course? It is simple home economics. People who have had to make their own way in life and do their own books the realise that sort of increase is not sustainable. For those that do have a healthcare card or for children, the co-payment occurs only 10 times or to a maximum of $70 in a year. Do we really think the four out of five people in Australia cannot afford $70? My electorate has more pensioners than any other electorate except for Hinkler. The reality is that most people are able to afford $7. After 10 visits or $70, it reverts back to bulk-billing.


The other mistruth that gets peddled around here is that we have already paid for our Medicare services. The Medicare payment only covers half, let alone accounts for the increase. Is the opposition going to propose putting up the Medicare levy by 122 per cent? Or are they going to put up general taxation revenue by 122 per cent to make it pay? No, they are not; they are just going to go to the magic pudding and borrow more money and take it away from general revenue, which will mean there will be no money for schools or bridges or roads.


The opposition want to have it all but they do not want to pay for it. We just need a giant reality check by the opposition to make them realise that what we are doing is what a sensible economic manager would do, which is what they did with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and introduce a co-payment. It sends a message both to the orderers of the tests as well as to the consumers—so it is not just for patients. There is a whole cohort of my colleagues that have not had to be responsible for the costs they incur for their patients. (Time expired)

Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call. The minister will proceed.




Mr BILLSON:
  I am being encouraged to go over it all again. It is great for your electorate, it is great for our nation, it is great for SMEs that are either current exporters or prospective exporters growing export markets and creating jobs and opportunities for our country. That is what this bill is about. It is also deregulatory, so we can do a better, more effective job and achieve deregulation outcomes, and that is what this is about.


I was explaining how the amendment to remove the word 'capital' from the definition of 'eligible export transactions' will see 'capital goods' replaced simply with the term 'goods'. Ninety-five per cent of goods exported from Australia are currently exempt or outside the reach of the direct support that EFIC is able to provide. This amendment deals with that by seeking to remove the word 'capital'. As a result of that amendment, it will be deregulatory in that it will reduce the time exporters face in not only doing paper work but also in multiple efforts to get the initial guarantee from EFIC and to go on to secure the funding facility from a bank that doubles the due-diligence processing time and requires two sets of documentation and legal fees. That is why this measure is not only good for enhancing the effectiveness of EFIC but is also a deregulatory measure. That will have a real benefit to Australian SMEs looking to secure export opportunities.


For example, consider the case of the South Australian family owned paint manufacturer Astec Paints. In recent years Astec Paints has been experiencing increased demand in Japan for its innovative paint products. The company's elastomeric paints, which are designed and manufactured in Adelaide, meet Japan's strict earthquake resistant building codes, giving them a competitive edge in the market. Thanks to the elimination of all tariffs on paint products under the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, the company anticipates that strong demand and strong growth will be there for its products in the Japanese market and that this will continue.


To meet this demand, Astec required additional working capital to scale up its production to be able to secure that delicious opportunity that it had identified. Although Astec's bank was supportive of their growth plans, it was unable to assist without additional security. EFIC stepped in to provide a $600,000 export working capital guarantee to Astec's bank. This allowed the bank to provide the funds that Astec required. However, under the current arrangements Astec had to make two separate applications—one to EFIC and another to their bank. As a result, they had to pay two sets of lender fees and charges.


Another EFIC client, PCT Global, manufactures EnduroShield, an easy clean surface treatment. This product was recently used to coat the spire of the new World Trade Centre building in New York. PCT also produces home do-it-yourself kits, which it distributes domestically through Bunnings Warehouse. The DIY product was recently featured as one of Time magazine'stop 10 most compelling products. Building on this success, PCT secured a multimillion dollar supply agreement with Home Depot in the United States, the world's largest home improvement retailer. PCT needed additional working capital to expand production, but their bank was unable to provide further assistance. In response, EFIC worked with PCT's bank to provide a US$650,000 working capital guarantee facility. This enabled PCT to meet the increased demand for this business changing contract. However, without the benefits of the proposed deregulatory measures, PCT faced additional fees, interest charges and administrative costs to secure the guarantee facility and to secure the export opportunities and the growth and jobs dividend for our economy.


These are just a couple of examples of how these changes will assist Australian SMEs and why this is such an important amendment to EFIC's direct lending arrangements. However, to ensure that these changes do not bring EFIC into direct competition with private sector financiers, the government has decided to apply competitive neutrality principles. This also implements the recommendation on competitive neutrality in the 2012 Productivity Commission report on Australia's export credit arrangements. To achieve this, this bill provides for EFIC to pay a debt neutrality charge and a tax equivalent payment. This will allow EFIC to help commercially viable exporters overcome financial barriers without discouraging or displacing private sector participation in the market.


In conclusion, the amendments in this bill will be of particular benefit to small and medium sized businesses, the engine room of our economy, while at the same time aligning with and contributing to the government's commitment to reduce business compliance costs by $1 billion per annum. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (17:53):  The bills before the House are one of the most savage attacks on the Australian safety net in living memory and, without a doubt, the most savage attack so far by this ruthless government on the Australian safety net since they have been elected. These bills are the classic Abbott playbook of double-dealing. It is sneaky and dishonest attempt to fundamentally recast the Australian social contract. This worthless government is attempting to stampede helter-skelter harsh and unprecedented cuts to Australia's family payments, income support and pension system. This is an unparliamentary assault on millions of Australians by this worthless government intent on ripping away money from low- and middle-income earners, young job seekers and senior Australians. And wrapped in this package of cuts and broken promises is the government's ruthless and dishonest attack on pensioners which, in some sort of attempt at peak absurdity, is now before both this chamber and the Senate.


Today Labor will vote against $11 billion worth of cuts. We will vote against these cuts because these changes, like the rest of the budget, undermine people's opportunities to be part of a living community. The changes in this bill take little account of the true need of millions of Australians. These changes further diminish the chance for dignity and for Australian's to participate equally in our country. These changes reduce people to a below-standard income when they have been overtaken by unemployment, illness, disability, veterans' service or indeed age. But the real shame of these changes is the loss of hope they provide people, and it is frightening.


There are people in this country who currently have no money to fall back on, and these changes hurt them; there are many people in this country with the stress of rent, and these changes hurt them; there are parents who, as we speak, cannot afford to give their kids some dollars each week for a birthday present for a friend's party, or for a school excursion, or for the right to participate in musical lessons or sports carnivals; and, even worse, there are children who know not to ask their parents for money because their parents cannot supply it, and these changes hurt their hope. This government is adding to the despair of a great many Australians and it should hang its head in shame.


Let's look at the changes they are making. They are abolishing family tax benefit B for families with children over the age of six years. Where did they say that before the last election? They are leaving young people with no income support for six months. Where did they say that before the election? They are shifting young people from Newstart allowance to the lower youth allowance, leaving them $2½ thousand a year worse off. They have abolished the senior supplement. In question time, we saw this pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister trying to pretend that abolishing the senior supplement was no big deal. It leaves seniors nearly $900 a year worse off. They have got rid of the pensioner education supplement; they have bulleted the education entry payment; they are freezing family tax benefits for two years; they are reducing family tax benefit end-of-year supplements and ceasing indexation; they are applying an interest charge for certain student debts; and they are replacing student start-up scholarships with income contingent loans. Labor will vote against these measures and Labor will vote against the government's cuts to the pension.


Joe Hockey said there are many hard days in opposition. What he is right about is this: it is always a hard day every day we listen to this government lie about cutting pensions. It is always hard for the true believers in this country to have a proper safety net when these people opposite and their worthless ministers say they are not touching the pension and that the pension goes up every six months. What a pack of disreputable twisters they are! We know, and they know, that the rate of indexation is being cut. No wonder the Tasmanian MP is leaving. Look what they are doing to Tasmania—no hope and no chance. Run away and run out of here—the electorate will still find you.


On the day before the 2013 election, Tony Abbott promised there would be no cuts to pensions and no changes to pensions. These bills are irrefutable proof that Tony Abbott's word is not worth the paper it is written on. The verdict is in, the evidence has been found and the smoking gun is here: this government has broken its promise on pensions. After lying to pensioners in order to get elected, the Prime Minister wants to cut seniors concessions; he wants to abolish the senior supplement; he wants to cut pensions; he wants to freeze superannuation; he wants to give Australia the world's oldest retirement age; and he wants to punish senior Australians with a petrol tax, a GP tax, new costs for pathology tests and new costs for diagnostic imaging. This chap who would be Prime Minister does not even know the changes that he is making—you know you are in trouble when you know less about the health system than the health minister! His own budget papers—the document that dare not speak its name—show that $450 million is coming out of the pockets of Australia's pensioners in the first four years alone. That is $450 million that will be taken off pensioners. I bet they are high-fiving each other over in the blue-carpet land. It is a good day's work done when they can do over the pensioners! Anyway, they think pensioners are leaners, don't they?


According to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the cut to the age pension will be almost $7 billion per year 10 years from now. This Australian Council of Social Services has estimated that Tony Abbott's pension cuts will cost pensioners $80 per week within 10 years. That is more than $4,000 ripped out of the pockets and purses of our most vulnerable Australians. What has happened to the once so-called small 'l' Liberal Party? There is nothing more extinct in Australia than a small 'l' Liberal. They should hand back the name 'Liberal' and instead be called the 'Radical Conservative Party of Australia', because that is what they are. They are the extreme right wing—the Tea Party. They are going to cut the age pension; they are going to cut carer payment recipients. Disability support pensioners and the veterans get a whack on the way through by this mob.


It is bad enough that we have a Treasurer who thinks that poor people do not drive cars, but it is even worse, in fact, that the Prime Minister thinks that they should have to pay for his broken promises—his unscrupulous desire to say and do anything to win power and then forget the promises he made. Today, Labor disagrees most sincerely with this government's propositions. Labor dissents from the vision of this country—the bleak and sterile vision—that those opposite would give Australia. We have fought these pension cuts. We have had a few victories—haven't we, member for Menzies?—and we will continue to fight them.


There was some trifle moment in the parliamentary debate when there was pause given yesterday to reflect that it was Gough Whitlam who first recognised the need to link pension levels to the growing standards and costs of living within the broader Australian community. Whitlam was right then, and Labor is right now. We will stand by Australians who have worked hard their whole life, paid taxes their whole life, made a contribution, built our communities and raised their children. We will stand by these people. We will fight for their right to a secure and dignified retirement.


Let us be clear: the age pension is not a king's ransom or a windfall going to the so-called leaners in Australian society. It is a most modest sum. I would like to see some of the people opposite live on it. Let us be clear: the pension is a post-retirement income support payment. It is not a family payment or a subsidy or a supplement that helps with other costs. For millions of Australian pensioners, it represents their entire household income. The mob opposite, with such rank disrespect for the political word and promises they made, would cut the indexation rate. Then, in the height of arrogance, they come to parliament every question time and lie about lying.


Gough Whitlam recognised this fundamental principle in the 1970s. He announced a commitment to maintain a pension rate at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Gough Whitlam's vision was for an Australia where all aged people can live in comfort and dignity. Whitlam recognised that the government have a responsibility to help pensioners keep up with the cost of living, but the government disagree. This recalcitrant, conservative and extreme right-wing mob only have one plan for Australia's retirees: to push pensioners below the poverty line. They think that pensioners do not drive cars. They think that pensioners should have to pay more for their medicines and to go to the GP. They think that pensioners should pay more for the diagnostic imaging which may well help prolong their lives. They think that pensioners do not deserve the modest concessions they receive. They certainly do not think that pensioners deserve the security and certainty of a fair pension.


After 12 long years of neglect under the previous conservative government, it took another Labor government in 2009 to increase this benchmark to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings and to introduce a new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. We sit for every question time. When confronted with these facts, the Prime Minister constantly says, 'I'm doing pensioners a favour,' and he is cutting their indexation. I hope the Prime Minister keeps lying to himself and keeps misleading the parliament on what he is doing, because the Australian electorate can work him out. They knew 12 months ago that they had doubts about him. Twelve months on, those doubts have been confirmed.


We have inequality in our society and it is being compounded by the failure of the Abbott government to create opportunities for the overwhelming number of our lower income, fixed income and middle-income Australians. Now the government are undoing the good work we did and they are lying about it. This is the Prime Minister who is used to making excuses for lying. He actually said, 'Don't listen to what I say; make sure you get it in writing.' This is the letter he gave in writing to Australians. This is a letter to pensioners—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Greg, do not say anything; you might learn something. This letter to pensioners is lying about pension cuts. It proves that what he writes is as worthless as what he says. I will repeat that: this letter to pensioners lies about the pension cuts and proves that what he writes is as worthless as what he promises in an election. One point two million dollars of taxpayer money for a letter is not worth the paper it is printed on. What an extraordinary display of contempt for Australian pensioners and Australian taxpayers from this slippery Prime Minister.


Let me say again for the people of Australia: the Abbott government are cutting the pension and now they are trying to gag debate on the future of the Australian safety net. They want to drop the guillotine on bills that threaten the decency and generosity of Australian society. We will oppose these pension cuts, where 3.7 million pensioners will be up to $80 a week worse off within 10 years. The Parliamentary Budget Office has confirmed this fact. Regarding the veterans' pension, the government make me frustrated beyond all belief when they talk about their love of the flag and their love of veterans. It only extends as far as a parade, a salute and an RSL function. When it comes to actually standing up for veterans, that is a different issue. These are patriots to the very superficial level that we see. A $65 million cut to war pensions is little service or recompense from this government.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs currently provides 140,000 service pensions and 84,000 war widow/widower pensions. All of these people will be up to $80 a week worse off within 10 years. Then look at the deeming rates. They are not content with going after the full pensioners; they have also had enough time in their busy diary to go after part-pensioners too. Part-pensioners face a double hit through reductions in their part-pensions because of the government's plan to reduce the deeming rates. As a result, if a pensioner has some shares or a small fixed term deposit in a bank, they will be punished by further reductions in their part pension.


We have the world's oldest retirement age. This, again, goes back to the out-of-touch nature of this arrogant government. Increasing the pension age—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Flinders. The worst sort of workplace injury he will ever suffer is a paper cut, yet he wants everyone else to work to 70. Increasing the pension age to 70 is an attack on the Australians who do the real heavy lifting. We on this side of the House know the real Australians who do the real work. Many of us have spent our working life representing tradespeople, labourers, cleaners, nurses and others who make a living with their skilled hands, strong minds and strong backs. Many Australians started work at 15, not playing in Liberal student politics until they had to finish. 


It is disgraceful that this government wants to force Australians to work until they are 70. Look at the mob sitting opposite trying to interject pathetically. They want you to work until you are 70, but they have not thought about how to lift workers compensation beyond 65. The usual Liberal, no idea. I think Alicia Silverstone would play Greg Hunt in the movie of 'Clueless'! 


At the same time, they are freezing superannuation, abolishing the low-income superannuation contribution, undermining the ability—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I love this mob opposite. They will give a tax holiday to people who have over $2 million in their superannuation retirement, and they will introduce a new tax on 3½ million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year. We could not have written this script. We could not have believed they would be so mean-spirited, but there they are at again.


We believe that Australia should have the world's best retirement savings system not the world's oldest retirement age. They do not know anything about pensioners' cost of living, otherwise they would not have axed the $1.3 billion in funding for seniors concessions, money which assisted seniors and pensioners for electricity and water bills. 


Look at Greg Hunt over there. He says he is a great man on bills. I tell you what, you have taken away—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order!




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Flinders—thank you.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  I request that the opposition leader refer to members by their titles.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Okay. I was going to call him the Minister for the Environment, but no-one would believe that, but I thank you for your direction. They have taken away from electricity and water bills, transport costs and council rates. All Australians will pay $7 extra every time they go to the doctor.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Member for Flinders, we will talk about what you have done right up to the next election, don't you worry about that. 


When we learn about this GP tax, we learn more about the hidden costs of this GP tax—and the more we learn, the worse it gets. This will probably be useful for our Prime Minister if someone could send this transcript to him—he did not have a clue about diagnostic imaging today. Medicare provides around 23 million diagnostic imaging and pathology services. The Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association estimates that the GP tax will reduce funding to these services by $188 million in 2015-16—it is a 10 per cent cut, Prime Minister—and rebates for general patients who were previously bulk-billed for pathology tests and imaging due to the abolition of the bulk-billing incentive from 1 July next year. The abolition of the greatest permissible gap safety net, a safety net which moderates the cost of high cost items, has gone too. 


As a consequence of the GP tax, some patients will be forced to fork out hundreds if not thousands of dollars up-front to pay for MRI, X-rays, CAT scans and mammograms. This will apply to many cancer patients and to holders of low-income healthcare and pensioner concession cards. They are ripping out $1.3 billion of the pockets of Australians by increasing the cost of medicine. 


Then there is the family tax benefit B changes. I thought these people opposite said that they were the great friends of families. Heaven forbid. Please, do not be our friends in future! Just stay right away! More than 700,000 single income and single parent families are going to lose their family tax benefit B over three years as a result of this savage mugging by the Abbott government just because their youngest child turned six. Because of Tony Abbott, a single income family on $65,000 with two children aged eight and 14 is going to lose over $6,000 per year by 2016. These payments help families struggling to make ends meet keep up with the cost of living. As John Howard said when he heard about this raid on family tax benefit B: 'Family tax benefit B are not welfare payments. They are just a recognition through the tax payment system of the undeniable fact, as all of us in the room have been parents know, that it costs money to have children.' I do not often agree with the former Prime Minister, but even a stopped clock can be right twice a day!


Then we look at their attack on young job seekers. 




Mr Hunt:
  That's an original one.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Are you still here? Under Tony Abbott's budget, more than 100,000 young people under 30 who are looking for a job will be forced to wait six months before receiving any income support. Labor have said that the changes to Newstart are perhaps the single most heartless measure in a very ugly, brutal budget, sentencing young people to a potentially endless cycle of poverty when they should be getting a hand to find a job. It is just a blame-shifting, cost-shifting measure that puts the price of unemployment on to the unemployed and their families.


The human rights committee chaired by Liberal Senator Dean Smith agrees. They have concluded that Mr Abbott's proposed six-month Newstart waiting period for people under 30 'breaches the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living'. Labor have clearly and consistently called this policy for what it is. It is a vicious, victim-blaming measure that does nothing to address youth unemployment or the challenges of finding work at a time when youth unemployment has soared to 13.4 per cent, around double the national average. Now is not the time for the Abbott government to turn its back on young Australians.


We know in this place, the Prime Minister's literary propaganda aside, that reducing pensions and attacking the poor and vulnerable does not help this country grow. It is long overdue in this country that we have a debate that the link between a more equal society and economic growth is inextricable and it is true. This is a government who talk about growth yet they would create greater inequality in our society. You cannot have fair dinkum, sustainable growth unless you have measures which create more equality in our society. I say it again: if the Liberals want to go after the pensioners, the vulnerable and the families, they are going to have to come through Labor. 


We say to the government today: you have drawn the battlelines for the next election. Labor have always pioneered advances in social services. We have always believed in the betterment of the people and we have been most interested in the great welfare of the middle-class, the lower income people, fixed income people and the most vulnerable in our society.


The current Liberal Party does not deserve the name 'Liberal'. At the next election Australians will be asked to choose between a party that protects the pension and a party that cuts it, between a party that stands up for families and a party that forgets them, between a movement that will always fight for them and a Prime Minister who lied to gain their vote at the last election.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! The Leader of the Opposition knows he should not use those words. I request him to withdraw.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I withdraw, and the Prime Minister who passed himself off at the last election in return for your vote undertook to do one thing and he has broken that contract and done something else.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I requested the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw. 




Mr SHORTEN:
  I did withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I apologise. I did not hear you.




Mr SHORTEN:
  But it has not changed what I just said in terms of this Prime Minister, who passed himself off at the last election as promising to do one thing and instead, after the election, did exactly the opposite. But that is okay, Prime Minister. We say to the Prime Minister about his unfair changes in this bill, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Australians want to know that they are part of a society which values all of its citizens. Australians want a society which includes the homeless, includes the unemployed, includes the lonely and includes our older Australians. Australians do not want a government that would weaken and break the relationship between any of our individuals and communities in which they live. Australians do not want policies which add to the insecurity, add to the misery and add to the want of many Australians.


There is a clear choice and that is the contest. I promise the government that Labor is up for this fight. We will fight you changes. We will defeat your changes and at the next election there will be a reckoning between you and the Australian people.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-10-22,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:16):  I rise today to speak about the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill 2014. This bill seeks to encourage students who have been inadvertently overpaid while on various government payments—including Austudy payment, fares allowance, youth allowance for full-time students and apprentices, and ABSTUDY living allowance—to enter into an arrangement to repay their debt and to act in a responsible manner. The way this bill seeks to encourage people to do the right thing is to make those who are repaying their debt, or have at least made an arrangement with the Department of Human Services to pay their debt at some time, exempt for the imposition of interest to that debt.


This bill does not set out to apply interest to each and every cent owed to the government by students who have been overpaid. This bill applies to the small percentage of people who finish their studies and either stop making automatic repayments through the social security system or those who have made no attempt to meet their obligation under the act to repay overpayments in a timely fashion according to their ability to do so.


While discussing this bill with my staff I found that two of them had been affected by an overpayment at least once during their studies at university, but both repaid their debt by paying a small amount from their regular Centrelink payment. Surely this is not too much to expect and not too difficult to organise. Both staff members told me it took just one phone call to make the arrangement and it was a set-and-forget payment. The government took $10 per fortnight from their usual payment to repay the debt.


 All this bill proposes is that students take responsibility for their obligations. We hear a lot about rights these days but with rights come responsibilities. In this country it is your responsibility to repay the government if you receive money from the taxpayers to which you were not entitled. Taxpayers are very generous to students in Australia. They pay for the majority of their tuition costs and only expect a modest repayment of just four per cent and then only when a student's income reaches more than $53,000 per year. As well as that, the taxpayer provides most students with a living allowance called Austudy, youth allowance or ABSTUDY which does not have to be paid back at all. If you are on the highest rate of Austudy payment as a single parent, that amounts to more than $14,000 per year. In return all the taxpayer asks is that students who are overpaid respect the support they are being given by the social security system and repay their debt.


I should like to point out to students that their bank will never be as generous when it comes to money they owe the bank, and that lesson is best learnt now by being a responsible member of the society that has supported them. For those few who continue to shirk their responsibility, their debt will be subject to an interest charge which is the same rate as applied to all debts owed to the Australian Taxation Office, the 90-day bank accepted bill rate plus an additional seven per cent, which is currently around 10 per cent. So I encourage students who have been overpaid to do the right thing—pick up the phone and make a payment arrangement and avoid any interest charges.


These moves were first proposed by the now opposition during their chaotic stint in government in the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the 2013-14 budget, but were removed when the budget passed in March 2014. Accordingly, we should expect the full co-operation of those opposite in supporting a slightly amended version of their own policy. However, given their current track record of rejecting common sense decisions, it would appear as though common sense is in short supply on the other side of the chamber, even though it was their proposal in the first place.


In order for students with Centrelink debts to have time to make a payment arrangement with the Department of Human Services, the application of interest to a debt will not start until 1 January 2015. The quicker this bill passes both houses and is signed into law, the more time students will have to make arrangements before interest is applied. I therefore call on the opposition to support this bill to ensure a quick passage for the sake of the students.


This bill also makes changes to the Student Start-up Scholarship by making the scholarship a repayable loan. The $1,025 loan is totally voluntary and is available twice a year at the start of each semester to help with the cost of books, stationery, laboratory fees and other equipment which students need to successfully complete their studies. This loan is similar to the old Student Financial Supplement Scheme except in one very big way. There is no requirement for a student to trade in 50 per cent of their Austudy payment in order to access these loans 


Those students on the Student Financial Support Scheme used to have to repay the full amount of their loan including 50 per cent of their Austudy money, and it had to be repaid at the same time as HECS-HELP was being repaid. So a student who has an outstanding HELP and SFSS debt and earns $1,025 a week has to repay six per cent of their income to cover their debt.


However, under this new scheme, no repayments for the student start-up loan will have to be made until after the student or former student has repaid the HELP debt in its entirety. In this case, courtesy of our taxpayers, the students are getting a pretty good deal—a low-interest, long-term loan in order to ensure students have their tuition heavily discounted, their educational needs met as well as a living allowance. 


For the 2014-15 tax year, this financial year, if a student earns less than $53,345 per annum, they are not obligated to make any repayments on HELP or SFSS. Interestingly, after the member for Lilley became Treasurer, what was the income a student had to earn before beginning to repay their student debt? I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: it was just $39,825 per annum. This government, the coalition government, is giving students an extra $13,520 in earnings before they have to begin to repay their debt. While the Labor Party continue to oppose their own advice on the restructuring of the higher education sector, they stand damned by their own track record of being harder on students than the coalition government is.


In summary, the coalition has increased spending in the higher education sector in actual dollar terms. The coalition is the highest spending government on education in Australian history. With this bill, all we are seeking to do is make students responsible for their obligations to the taxpayers who generously support them and provide a level of support to students so that they can continue their studies to go on to become vital members of our society. I support this bill.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (18:24):  Well, here we are again to debate some of the government's harshest budget cuts—cuts that will leave millions of Australian families worse off; cuts that will leave many, many young people destitute; and cuts that will see the standard of living of Australian seniors attacked. This is not the first time that these matters have been debated in this House. Indeed, not one of the measures in these three bills has not been through the House before. You might ask, 'Well, why is this?' It is because, thanks to Labor, the government has not been able to get any of these cruel cuts through the Senate. Each of these measures has already been rejected by the parliament, and I can assure each and every Australian listening that we intend to do everything in our power to reject them again.


These three pieces of legislation are a direct attack on ordinary Australians, an attack on the fair go in this country. We should not allow this government to get away with it. It is not only the cruelty of this budget that has Australians so offside; what has also got people offside is the sheer incompetence of how the government has gone about it. 


Just today, again we see the Minister for Social Services in TheGuardian making a very frank admission that the government cannot get these cruel cuts through the parliament. Even so, here we are debating these savage measures, and the government is clearly determined tonight to ram them through, even though the government must know that it does not have the numbers in the Senate and it certainly must have heard from the Australian parliament that the Australian people think that these measures stink.


The minister told TheGuardian today that he would consider any reasonable offer from the crossbench to salvage his cruel cuts—a frank admission from the minister himself that he is fresh out of ideas about how he is going to get this legislation through the parliament. I will be telling the minister loud and clear tonight that there is only one reasonable offer that will come from the Labor Party, and that is one I will offer him right now: he needs to dump this cruel budget, and dump it once and for all.


The first of these bills, the Social Services and Other Legislation (Seniors Supplement) Bill, seeks to abolish the seniors supplement. When before the last election did any of the Liberals or Nationals opposite tell the 300,000 seniors in this country that they were going to have their almost $900 a year supplement axed completely? When did they tell them this before the last election? Of course this measure also goes to 29,000 veterans. All of these people have worked hard all of their lives. They do not deserve to be punished by this government for their hard work. For many of these people, this payment is critical to help them with their bills and other rising cost-of-living pressures. Yet on 24 June this year this Prime Minister said that this payment was a cash splash. That is the disrespect and disregard that this Prime Minister has for senior Australians.


On other legislation, of course, the government is proposing to slash the indexation arrangements of the pension. This will see $23 billion—that is how much it is; it has been announced by the Treasurer that this is how much will come out of the pockets of pensioners by 2023. And it will see pensioners left $80 a week worse off within ten years of the change, according to the Australians Council of Social Services. This is despite the Prime Minister coming in here day after day denying that he is cutting the pension, denying that it is a broken promise—even though he said the day before the last election there would be no changes to the pension. No wonder pensioners are angry. And they are angry: it does not matter where I go around Australia, pensioners are angry—angry at having their very modest retirements cut. They also extraordinarily angry that the Prime minister stood there the day before the last election, looked them in the eye and said there would be no cuts, no changes to their pension.


Labor are out there campaigning against these cuts—and the Council on the Ageing are out there talking with pensioners and seniors across the country—and making sure that we do everything we possibly can to stop this cut to the pension. As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned just a few moments ago, we saw the Prime Minister stoop to an extraordinary low just last week, writing a misleading letter to Australia's 2.3 million pensioners—and spending $1.2 million of taxpayers' money for the privilege. Of course, he did not tell the truth in the letter. He did not tell pensioners that he is in fact going to cut the indexation of their pension.


The bills that we are debating tonight are a full-scale attack on the living standards of Australian families. In these bills we see the most extraordinary cuts to family benefits and parenting payments—and they are being slashed at the same time the government is proposing a new GP tax and a new fuel tax. These bills tonight contain billions of dollars of cuts to families. I will just go through a few of them. Nearly $2 billion will be cut from family tax benefits as a result of a freeze to the rates of family payments for two years. Nearly $2 billion is going to come out of the pockets of low- and middle-income families. According to the Department of Social Services, a freeze to the low-income free area for family tax benefit part A alone—just this one measure—will see 370,000 families around $750 a year worse off in 2016-17. So make sure when you are going to the ballot box at the next election, which will probably be in 2016, that you remind those families that you are taking $750 out of their pockets through that measure alone.


On top of that, another $2 billion is being taken out as a result of the decision to cut family tax benefit part B when the youngest child turns six. This measure alone is going to leave families around $3,000 a year worse off —$3,000 a year. That is what you are taking out of the pockets of these families. This is going to see so many families so much worse off. Unsurprisingly, we have heard very little about that from those opposite. It will be very interesting to see whether any one of those members opposite speaking on these bills tonight tries to defend these extraordinary cuts to families. The Department of Social Services revealed at Senate estimates that, if this legislation gets through the Senate, around 700,000 families will lose their family tax benefit part B when their youngest child turns six. So which one of you is going to front up to your single income, single parent families and tell them that they are going to lose $3,000 when their youngest child turns six? I can assure you that we will be fighting this all the way.


These bills will also see a billion dollars cut from end of year supplements. These bills will put more and more pressure on the lowest income families in this country. We have seen the analysis from NATSEM which found that around 1.2 million families will be on average $3,000 a year worse off. In contrast, the top 20 per cent of households will have either no impact or a negligible positive impact. That is the attitude of this government—so arrogant and so out of touch. It does not care that millions of Australians are going to be worse off because of these savage cuts.


We saw today the analysis from NATSEM on the hardest hit electorates. For example, in the electorate of Watson and the electorate of Blaxland, both in Sydney, the average household is going to have to give up $990 each year; whereas, in the Prime Minister's electorate, families will only be worse off by $144 a year. This is no fluke; this is what this conservative government is all about—looking after those at the top end of town and whacking those who are not so well off. This analysis from NATSEM—described by the Prime Minister as `Australia's most respected modelling outfit'—shows that the hardest hit people in the country are those who are already doing it tough. They should be told by this government that, as a result of these bills, the poorest people in Australia must shoulder the burden of the Prime Minister's cuts. In contrast, Labor will stand up for low- and middle-income families who will be so savagely hit by the cuts in this legislation.


But perhaps, as I have said a number of times, the cruellest measures in these bills are the Prime Minister's brutal attacks on young job seekers. These bills will see young people under 30 who are looking for a job forced to wait six months before receiving any income support—and in some cases they will have to wait even longer. So the government is saying to young people, 'You are on your own.' If after six months without income support the young person has not found a job, the measure will require them to go on Work for the Dole. And if after their time on Work for the Dole they have still not found a job they will lose their payments for another six months. What do those opposite think these people are going to live on? Where are they going to get their food from? Who is going to pay the rent?


Every single Australian that you talk to understands how harsh these measures are and what it is going to mean when you push these hundreds of thousands of young people into poverty, crisis and homelessness. In fact, the budget actually includes money for emergency assistance, because the government knows that these young people will have absolutely nothing. I can make it very, very clear to the government that we will not be supporting this measure. It is cruel, it is harsh, and we will not support it at all.


The government are out there trying to suggest that there may be room for a compromise. They do not have it in the legislation, of course. Tonight we are debating the same proposal that has been around for the last six months. The government want to see young people with nothing to live on for six months. I want to make it very clear: there will be no compromise. We will not be providing any support for any compromise by the government that might suggest people should have nothing to live on for a month or some other period that the government might pull out of their hat.


Also as a result of this legislation the government want to push young people under 25 onto the lower Youth Allowance. Once again this is a huge cut—$2,500 a year. We will not support this punitive measure. How on earth does the government think these young people are going to survive on these considerably reduced levels of support? How is it fair to say to a young person, 'You're going to lose 20 per cent of your income support, whereas somebody on $200,000 will pay around 0.2 per cent through a reduction in their income. That is why Australians understand that this budget is grossly unfair. They look at the reality of these bills—of who will pay the price. The price will be paid by the poorest Australians. It will be paid by those families who are doing it the toughest. 


For months, Labor have been campaigning against this government's savage budget. We will continue to stand side by side with pensioners, with young people, with families. Our message to them is: we will continue to stand with you and we will vote against these savage cuts. We will continue to fight this cruel budget every day from now until the next election.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (17:53):  The bills before the House are one of the most savage attacks on the Australian safety net in living memory and, without a doubt, the most savage attack so far by this ruthless government on the Australian safety net since they have been elected. These bills are the classic Abbott playbook of double-dealing. It is sneaky and dishonest attempt to fundamentally recast the Australian social contract. This worthless government is attempting to stampede helter-skelter harsh and unprecedented cuts to Australia's family payments, income support and pension system. This is an unparliamentary assault on millions of Australians by this worthless government intent on ripping away money from low- and middle-income earners, young job seekers and senior Australians. And wrapped in this package of cuts and broken promises is the government's ruthless and dishonest attack on pensioners which, in some sort of attempt at peak absurdity, is now before both this chamber and the Senate.


Today Labor will vote against $11 billion worth of cuts. We will vote against these cuts because these changes, like the rest of the budget, undermine people's opportunities to be part of a living community. The changes in this bill take little account of the true need of millions of Australians. These changes further diminish the chance for dignity and for Australian's to participate equally in our country. These changes reduce people to a below-standard income when they have been overtaken by unemployment, illness, disability, veterans' service or indeed age. But the real shame of these changes is the loss of hope they provide people, and it is frightening.


There are people in this country who currently have no money to fall back on, and these changes hurt them; there are many people in this country with the stress of rent, and these changes hurt them; there are parents who, as we speak, cannot afford to give their kids some dollars each week for a birthday present for a friend's party, or for a school excursion, or for the right to participate in musical lessons or sports carnivals; and, even worse, there are children who know not to ask their parents for money because their parents cannot supply it, and these changes hurt their hope. This government is adding to the despair of a great many Australians and it should hang its head in shame.


Let's look at the changes they are making. They are abolishing family tax benefit B for families with children over the age of six years. Where did they say that before the last election? They are leaving young people with no income support for six months. Where did they say that before the election? They are shifting young people from Newstart allowance to the lower youth allowance, leaving them $2½ thousand a year worse off. They have abolished the senior supplement. In question time, we saw this pathetic excuse for a Prime Minister trying to pretend that abolishing the senior supplement was no big deal. It leaves seniors nearly $900 a year worse off. They have got rid of the pensioner education supplement; they have bulleted the education entry payment; they are freezing family tax benefits for two years; they are reducing family tax benefit end-of-year supplements and ceasing indexation; they are applying an interest charge for certain student debts; and they are replacing student start-up scholarships with income contingent loans. Labor will vote against these measures and Labor will vote against the government's cuts to the pension.


Joe Hockey said there are many hard days in opposition. What he is right about is this: it is always a hard day every day we listen to this government lie about cutting pensions. It is always hard for the true believers in this country to have a proper safety net when these people opposite and their worthless ministers say they are not touching the pension and that the pension goes up every six months. What a pack of disreputable twisters they are! We know, and they know, that the rate of indexation is being cut. No wonder the Tasmanian MP is leaving. Look what they are doing to Tasmania—no hope and no chance. Run away and run out of here—the electorate will still find you.


On the day before the 2013 election, Tony Abbott promised there would be no cuts to pensions and no changes to pensions. These bills are irrefutable proof that Tony Abbott's word is not worth the paper it is written on. The verdict is in, the evidence has been found and the smoking gun is here: this government has broken its promise on pensions. After lying to pensioners in order to get elected, the Prime Minister wants to cut seniors concessions; he wants to abolish the senior supplement; he wants to cut pensions; he wants to freeze superannuation; he wants to give Australia the world's oldest retirement age; and he wants to punish senior Australians with a petrol tax, a GP tax, new costs for pathology tests and new costs for diagnostic imaging. This chap who would be Prime Minister does not even know the changes that he is making—you know you are in trouble when you know less about the health system than the health minister! His own budget papers—the document that dare not speak its name—show that $450 million is coming out of the pockets of Australia's pensioners in the first four years alone. That is $450 million that will be taken off pensioners. I bet they are high-fiving each other over in the blue-carpet land. It is a good day's work done when they can do over the pensioners! Anyway, they think pensioners are leaners, don't they?


According to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the cut to the age pension will be almost $7 billion per year 10 years from now. This Australian Council of Social Services has estimated that Tony Abbott's pension cuts will cost pensioners $80 per week within 10 years. That is more than $4,000 ripped out of the pockets and purses of our most vulnerable Australians. What has happened to the once so-called small 'l' Liberal Party? There is nothing more extinct in Australia than a small 'l' Liberal. They should hand back the name 'Liberal' and instead be called the 'Radical Conservative Party of Australia', because that is what they are. They are the extreme right wing—the Tea Party. They are going to cut the age pension; they are going to cut carer payment recipients. Disability support pensioners and the veterans get a whack on the way through by this mob.


It is bad enough that we have a Treasurer who thinks that poor people do not drive cars, but it is even worse, in fact, that the Prime Minister thinks that they should have to pay for his broken promises—his unscrupulous desire to say and do anything to win power and then forget the promises he made. Today, Labor disagrees most sincerely with this government's propositions. Labor dissents from the vision of this country—the bleak and sterile vision—that those opposite would give Australia. We have fought these pension cuts. We have had a few victories—haven't we, member for Menzies?—and we will continue to fight them.


There was some trifle moment in the parliamentary debate when there was pause given yesterday to reflect that it was Gough Whitlam who first recognised the need to link pension levels to the growing standards and costs of living within the broader Australian community. Whitlam was right then, and Labor is right now. We will stand by Australians who have worked hard their whole life, paid taxes their whole life, made a contribution, built our communities and raised their children. We will stand by these people. We will fight for their right to a secure and dignified retirement.


Let us be clear: the age pension is not a king's ransom or a windfall going to the so-called leaners in Australian society. It is a most modest sum. I would like to see some of the people opposite live on it. Let us be clear: the pension is a post-retirement income support payment. It is not a family payment or a subsidy or a supplement that helps with other costs. For millions of Australian pensioners, it represents their entire household income. The mob opposite, with such rank disrespect for the political word and promises they made, would cut the indexation rate. Then, in the height of arrogance, they come to parliament every question time and lie about lying.


Gough Whitlam recognised this fundamental principle in the 1970s. He announced a commitment to maintain a pension rate at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Gough Whitlam's vision was for an Australia where all aged people can live in comfort and dignity. Whitlam recognised that the government have a responsibility to help pensioners keep up with the cost of living, but the government disagree. This recalcitrant, conservative and extreme right-wing mob only have one plan for Australia's retirees: to push pensioners below the poverty line. They think that pensioners do not drive cars. They think that pensioners should have to pay more for their medicines and to go to the GP. They think that pensioners should pay more for the diagnostic imaging which may well help prolong their lives. They think that pensioners do not deserve the modest concessions they receive. They certainly do not think that pensioners deserve the security and certainty of a fair pension.


After 12 long years of neglect under the previous conservative government, it took another Labor government in 2009 to increase this benchmark to 27.7 per cent of male total average weekly earnings and to introduce a new pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. We sit for every question time. When confronted with these facts, the Prime Minister constantly says, 'I'm doing pensioners a favour,' and he is cutting their indexation. I hope the Prime Minister keeps lying to himself and keeps misleading the parliament on what he is doing, because the Australian electorate can work him out. They knew 12 months ago that they had doubts about him. Twelve months on, those doubts have been confirmed.


We have inequality in our society and it is being compounded by the failure of the Abbott government to create opportunities for the overwhelming number of our lower income, fixed income and middle-income Australians. Now the government are undoing the good work we did and they are lying about it. This is the Prime Minister who is used to making excuses for lying. He actually said, 'Don't listen to what I say; make sure you get it in writing.' This is the letter he gave in writing to Australians. This is a letter to pensioners—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Greg, do not say anything; you might learn something. This letter to pensioners is lying about pension cuts. It proves that what he writes is as worthless as what he says. I will repeat that: this letter to pensioners lies about the pension cuts and proves that what he writes is as worthless as what he promises in an election. One point two million dollars of taxpayer money for a letter is not worth the paper it is printed on. What an extraordinary display of contempt for Australian pensioners and Australian taxpayers from this slippery Prime Minister.


Let me say again for the people of Australia: the Abbott government are cutting the pension and now they are trying to gag debate on the future of the Australian safety net. They want to drop the guillotine on bills that threaten the decency and generosity of Australian society. We will oppose these pension cuts, where 3.7 million pensioners will be up to $80 a week worse off within 10 years. The Parliamentary Budget Office has confirmed this fact. Regarding the veterans' pension, the government make me frustrated beyond all belief when they talk about their love of the flag and their love of veterans. It only extends as far as a parade, a salute and an RSL function. When it comes to actually standing up for veterans, that is a different issue. These are patriots to the very superficial level that we see. A $65 million cut to war pensions is little service or recompense from this government.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs currently provides 140,000 service pensions and 84,000 war widow/widower pensions. All of these people will be up to $80 a week worse off within 10 years. Then look at the deeming rates. They are not content with going after the full pensioners; they have also had enough time in their busy diary to go after part-pensioners too. Part-pensioners face a double hit through reductions in their part-pensions because of the government's plan to reduce the deeming rates. As a result, if a pensioner has some shares or a small fixed term deposit in a bank, they will be punished by further reductions in their part pension.


We have the world's oldest retirement age. This, again, goes back to the out-of-touch nature of this arrogant government. Increasing the pension age—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Flinders. The worst sort of workplace injury he will ever suffer is a paper cut, yet he wants everyone else to work to 70. Increasing the pension age to 70 is an attack on the Australians who do the real heavy lifting. We on this side of the House know the real Australians who do the real work. Many of us have spent our working life representing tradespeople, labourers, cleaners, nurses and others who make a living with their skilled hands, strong minds and strong backs. Many Australians started work at 15, not playing in Liberal student politics until they had to finish. 


It is disgraceful that this government wants to force Australians to work until they are 70. Look at the mob sitting opposite trying to interject pathetically. They want you to work until you are 70, but they have not thought about how to lift workers compensation beyond 65. The usual Liberal, no idea. I think Alicia Silverstone would play Greg Hunt in the movie of 'Clueless'! 


At the same time, they are freezing superannuation, abolishing the low-income superannuation contribution, undermining the ability—



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I love this mob opposite. They will give a tax holiday to people who have over $2 million in their superannuation retirement, and they will introduce a new tax on 3½ million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year. We could not have written this script. We could not have believed they would be so mean-spirited, but there they are at again.


We believe that Australia should have the world's best retirement savings system not the world's oldest retirement age. They do not know anything about pensioners' cost of living, otherwise they would not have axed the $1.3 billion in funding for seniors concessions, money which assisted seniors and pensioners for electricity and water bills. 


Look at Greg Hunt over there. He says he is a great man on bills. I tell you what, you have taken away—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order!




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Flinders—thank you.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  I request that the opposition leader refer to members by their titles.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Okay. I was going to call him the Minister for the Environment, but no-one would believe that, but I thank you for your direction. They have taken away from electricity and water bills, transport costs and council rates. All Australians will pay $7 extra every time they go to the doctor.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Member for Flinders, we will talk about what you have done right up to the next election, don't you worry about that. 


When we learn about this GP tax, we learn more about the hidden costs of this GP tax—and the more we learn, the worse it gets. This will probably be useful for our Prime Minister if someone could send this transcript to him—he did not have a clue about diagnostic imaging today. Medicare provides around 23 million diagnostic imaging and pathology services. The Australian Diagnostic Imaging Association estimates that the GP tax will reduce funding to these services by $188 million in 2015-16—it is a 10 per cent cut, Prime Minister—and rebates for general patients who were previously bulk-billed for pathology tests and imaging due to the abolition of the bulk-billing incentive from 1 July next year. The abolition of the greatest permissible gap safety net, a safety net which moderates the cost of high cost items, has gone too. 


As a consequence of the GP tax, some patients will be forced to fork out hundreds if not thousands of dollars up-front to pay for MRI, X-rays, CAT scans and mammograms. This will apply to many cancer patients and to holders of low-income healthcare and pensioner concession cards. They are ripping out $1.3 billion of the pockets of Australians by increasing the cost of medicine. 


Then there is the family tax benefit B changes. I thought these people opposite said that they were the great friends of families. Heaven forbid. Please, do not be our friends in future! Just stay right away! More than 700,000 single income and single parent families are going to lose their family tax benefit B over three years as a result of this savage mugging by the Abbott government just because their youngest child turned six. Because of Tony Abbott, a single income family on $65,000 with two children aged eight and 14 is going to lose over $6,000 per year by 2016. These payments help families struggling to make ends meet keep up with the cost of living. As John Howard said when he heard about this raid on family tax benefit B: 'Family tax benefit B are not welfare payments. They are just a recognition through the tax payment system of the undeniable fact, as all of us in the room have been parents know, that it costs money to have children.' I do not often agree with the former Prime Minister, but even a stopped clock can be right twice a day!


Then we look at their attack on young job seekers. 




Mr Hunt:
  That's an original one.




Mr SHORTEN:
  Are you still here? Under Tony Abbott's budget, more than 100,000 young people under 30 who are looking for a job will be forced to wait six months before receiving any income support. Labor have said that the changes to Newstart are perhaps the single most heartless measure in a very ugly, brutal budget, sentencing young people to a potentially endless cycle of poverty when they should be getting a hand to find a job. It is just a blame-shifting, cost-shifting measure that puts the price of unemployment on to the unemployed and their families.


The human rights committee chaired by Liberal Senator Dean Smith agrees. They have concluded that Mr Abbott's proposed six-month Newstart waiting period for people under 30 'breaches the right to social security and the right to an adequate standard of living'. Labor have clearly and consistently called this policy for what it is. It is a vicious, victim-blaming measure that does nothing to address youth unemployment or the challenges of finding work at a time when youth unemployment has soared to 13.4 per cent, around double the national average. Now is not the time for the Abbott government to turn its back on young Australians.


We know in this place, the Prime Minister's literary propaganda aside, that reducing pensions and attacking the poor and vulnerable does not help this country grow. It is long overdue in this country that we have a debate that the link between a more equal society and economic growth is inextricable and it is true. This is a government who talk about growth yet they would create greater inequality in our society. You cannot have fair dinkum, sustainable growth unless you have measures which create more equality in our society. I say it again: if the Liberals want to go after the pensioners, the vulnerable and the families, they are going to have to come through Labor. 


We say to the government today: you have drawn the battlelines for the next election. Labor have always pioneered advances in social services. We have always believed in the betterment of the people and we have been most interested in the great welfare of the middle-class, the lower income people, fixed income people and the most vulnerable in our society.


The current Liberal Party does not deserve the name 'Liberal'. At the next election Australians will be asked to choose between a party that protects the pension and a party that cuts it, between a party that stands up for families and a party that forgets them, between a movement that will always fight for them and a Prime Minister who lied to gain their vote at the last election.

Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! The Leader of the Opposition knows he should not use those words. I request him to withdraw.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I withdraw, and the Prime Minister who passed himself off at the last election in return for your vote undertook to do one thing and he has broken that contract and done something else.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I requested the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw. 




Mr SHORTEN:
  I did withdraw.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I apologise. I did not hear you.




Mr SHORTEN:
  But it has not changed what I just said in terms of this Prime Minister, who passed himself off at the last election as promising to do one thing and instead, after the election, did exactly the opposite. But that is okay, Prime Minister. We say to the Prime Minister about his unfair changes in this bill, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Australians want to know that they are part of a society which values all of its citizens. Australians want a society which includes the homeless, includes the unemployed, includes the lonely and includes our older Australians. Australians do not want a government that would weaken and break the relationship between any of our individuals and communities in which they live. Australians do not want policies which add to the insecurity, add to the misery and add to the want of many Australians.


There is a clear choice and that is the contest. I promise the government that Labor is up for this fight. We will fight you changes. We will defeat your changes and at the next election there will be a reckoning between you and the Australian people.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:16):  I rise today to speak about the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill 2014. This bill seeks to encourage students who have been inadvertently overpaid while on various government payments—including Austudy payment, fares allowance, youth allowance for full-time students and apprentices, and ABSTUDY living allowance—to enter into an arrangement to repay their debt and to act in a responsible manner. The way this bill seeks to encourage people to do the right thing is to make those who are repaying their debt, or have at least made an arrangement with the Department of Human Services to pay their debt at some time, exempt for the imposition of interest to that debt.


This bill does not set out to apply interest to each and every cent owed to the government by students who have been overpaid. This bill applies to the small percentage of people who finish their studies and either stop making automatic repayments through the social security system or those who have made no attempt to meet their obligation under the act to repay overpayments in a timely fashion according to their ability to do so.


While discussing this bill with my staff I found that two of them had been affected by an overpayment at least once during their studies at university, but both repaid their debt by paying a small amount from their regular Centrelink payment. Surely this is not too much to expect and not too difficult to organise. Both staff members told me it took just one phone call to make the arrangement and it was a set-and-forget payment. The government took $10 per fortnight from their usual payment to repay the debt.


 All this bill proposes is that students take responsibility for their obligations. We hear a lot about rights these days but with rights come responsibilities. In this country it is your responsibility to repay the government if you receive money from the taxpayers to which you were not entitled. Taxpayers are very generous to students in Australia. They pay for the majority of their tuition costs and only expect a modest repayment of just four per cent and then only when a student's income reaches more than $53,000 per year. As well as that, the taxpayer provides most students with a living allowance called Austudy, youth allowance or ABSTUDY which does not have to be paid back at all. If you are on the highest rate of Austudy payment as a single parent, that amounts to more than $14,000 per year. In return all the taxpayer asks is that students who are overpaid respect the support they are being given by the social security system and repay their debt.


I should like to point out to students that their bank will never be as generous when it comes to money they owe the bank, and that lesson is best learnt now by being a responsible member of the society that has supported them. For those few who continue to shirk their responsibility, their debt will be subject to an interest charge which is the same rate as applied to all debts owed to the Australian Taxation Office, the 90-day bank accepted bill rate plus an additional seven per cent, which is currently around 10 per cent. So I encourage students who have been overpaid to do the right thing—pick up the phone and make a payment arrangement and avoid any interest charges.


These moves were first proposed by the now opposition during their chaotic stint in government in the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and the 2013-14 budget, but were removed when the budget passed in March 2014. Accordingly, we should expect the full co-operation of those opposite in supporting a slightly amended version of their own policy. However, given their current track record of rejecting common sense decisions, it would appear as though common sense is in short supply on the other side of the chamber, even though it was their proposal in the first place.


In order for students with Centrelink debts to have time to make a payment arrangement with the Department of Human Services, the application of interest to a debt will not start until 1 January 2015. The quicker this bill passes both houses and is signed into law, the more time students will have to make arrangements before interest is applied. I therefore call on the opposition to support this bill to ensure a quick passage for the sake of the students.


This bill also makes changes to the Student Start-up Scholarship by making the scholarship a repayable loan. The $1,025 loan is totally voluntary and is available twice a year at the start of each semester to help with the cost of books, stationery, laboratory fees and other equipment which students need to successfully complete their studies. This loan is similar to the old Student Financial Supplement Scheme except in one very big way. There is no requirement for a student to trade in 50 per cent of their Austudy payment in order to access these loans 


Those students on the Student Financial Support Scheme used to have to repay the full amount of their loan including 50 per cent of their Austudy money, and it had to be repaid at the same time as HECS-HELP was being repaid. So a student who has an outstanding HELP and SFSS debt and earns $1,025 a week has to repay six per cent of their income to cover their debt.


However, under this new scheme, no repayments for the student start-up loan will have to be made until after the student or former student has repaid the HELP debt in its entirety. In this case, courtesy of our taxpayers, the students are getting a pretty good deal—a low-interest, long-term loan in order to ensure students have their tuition heavily discounted, their educational needs met as well as a living allowance. 


For the 2014-15 tax year, this financial year, if a student earns less than $53,345 per annum, they are not obligated to make any repayments on HELP or SFSS. Interestingly, after the member for Lilley became Treasurer, what was the income a student had to earn before beginning to repay their student debt? I will tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: it was just $39,825 per annum. This government, the coalition government, is giving students an extra $13,520 in earnings before they have to begin to repay their debt. While the Labor Party continue to oppose their own advice on the restructuring of the higher education sector, they stand damned by their own track record of being harder on students than the coalition government is.


In summary, the coalition has increased spending in the higher education sector in actual dollar terms. The coalition is the highest spending government on education in Australian history. With this bill, all we are seeking to do is make students responsible for their obligations to the taxpayers who generously support them and provide a level of support to students so that they can continue their studies to go on to become vital members of our society. I support this bill.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2014-10-22,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (18:24):  Well, here we are again to debate some of the government's harshest budget cuts—cuts that will leave millions of Australian families worse off; cuts that will leave many, many young people destitute; and cuts that will see the standard of living of Australian seniors attacked. This is not the first time that these matters have been debated in this House. Indeed, not one of the measures in these three bills has not been through the House before. You might ask, 'Well, why is this?' It is because, thanks to Labor, the government has not been able to get any of these cruel cuts through the Senate. Each of these measures has already been rejected by the parliament, and I can assure each and every Australian listening that we intend to do everything in our power to reject them again.


These three pieces of legislation are a direct attack on ordinary Australians, an attack on the fair go in this country. We should not allow this government to get away with it. It is not only the cruelty of this budget that has Australians so offside; what has also got people offside is the sheer incompetence of how the government has gone about it. 


Just today, again we see the Minister for Social Services in TheGuardian making a very frank admission that the government cannot get these cruel cuts through the parliament. Even so, here we are debating these savage measures, and the government is clearly determined tonight to ram them through, even though the government must know that it does not have the numbers in the Senate and it certainly must have heard from the Australian parliament that the Australian people think that these measures stink.


The minister told TheGuardian today that he would consider any reasonable offer from the crossbench to salvage his cruel cuts—a frank admission from the minister himself that he is fresh out of ideas about how he is going to get this legislation through the parliament. I will be telling the minister loud and clear tonight that there is only one reasonable offer that will come from the Labor Party, and that is one I will offer him right now: he needs to dump this cruel budget, and dump it once and for all.


The first of these bills, the Social Services and Other Legislation (Seniors Supplement) Bill, seeks to abolish the seniors supplement. When before the last election did any of the Liberals or Nationals opposite tell the 300,000 seniors in this country that they were going to have their almost $900 a year supplement axed completely? When did they tell them this before the last election? Of course this measure also goes to 29,000 veterans. All of these people have worked hard all of their lives. They do not deserve to be punished by this government for their hard work. For many of these people, this payment is critical to help them with their bills and other rising cost-of-living pressures. Yet on 24 June this year this Prime Minister said that this payment was a cash splash. That is the disrespect and disregard that this Prime Minister has for senior Australians.


On other legislation, of course, the government is proposing to slash the indexation arrangements of the pension. This will see $23 billion—that is how much it is; it has been announced by the Treasurer that this is how much will come out of the pockets of pensioners by 2023. And it will see pensioners left $80 a week worse off within ten years of the change, according to the Australians Council of Social Services. This is despite the Prime Minister coming in here day after day denying that he is cutting the pension, denying that it is a broken promise—even though he said the day before the last election there would be no changes to the pension. No wonder pensioners are angry. And they are angry: it does not matter where I go around Australia, pensioners are angry—angry at having their very modest retirements cut. They also extraordinarily angry that the Prime minister stood there the day before the last election, looked them in the eye and said there would be no cuts, no changes to their pension.


Labor are out there campaigning against these cuts—and the Council on the Ageing are out there talking with pensioners and seniors across the country—and making sure that we do everything we possibly can to stop this cut to the pension. As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned just a few moments ago, we saw the Prime Minister stoop to an extraordinary low just last week, writing a misleading letter to Australia's 2.3 million pensioners—and spending $1.2 million of taxpayers' money for the privilege. Of course, he did not tell the truth in the letter. He did not tell pensioners that he is in fact going to cut the indexation of their pension.


The bills that we are debating tonight are a full-scale attack on the living standards of Australian families. In these bills we see the most extraordinary cuts to family benefits and parenting payments—and they are being slashed at the same time the government is proposing a new GP tax and a new fuel tax. These bills tonight contain billions of dollars of cuts to families. I will just go through a few of them. Nearly $2 billion will be cut from family tax benefits as a result of a freeze to the rates of family payments for two years. Nearly $2 billion is going to come out of the pockets of low- and middle-income families. According to the Department of Social Services, a freeze to the low-income free area for family tax benefit part A alone—just this one measure—will see 370,000 families around $750 a year worse off in 2016-17. So make sure when you are going to the ballot box at the next election, which will probably be in 2016, that you remind those families that you are taking $750 out of their pockets through that measure alone.


On top of that, another $2 billion is being taken out as a result of the decision to cut family tax benefit part B when the youngest child turns six. This measure alone is going to leave families around $3,000 a year worse off —$3,000 a year. That is what you are taking out of the pockets of these families. This is going to see so many families so much worse off. Unsurprisingly, we have heard very little about that from those opposite. It will be very interesting to see whether any one of those members opposite speaking on these bills tonight tries to defend these extraordinary cuts to families. The Department of Social Services revealed at Senate estimates that, if this legislation gets through the Senate, around 700,000 families will lose their family tax benefit part B when their youngest child turns six. So which one of you is going to front up to your single income, single parent families and tell them that they are going to lose $3,000 when their youngest child turns six? I can assure you that we will be fighting this all the way.


These bills will also see a billion dollars cut from end of year supplements. These bills will put more and more pressure on the lowest income families in this country. We have seen the analysis from NATSEM which found that around 1.2 million families will be on average $3,000 a year worse off. In contrast, the top 20 per cent of households will have either no impact or a negligible positive impact. That is the attitude of this government—so arrogant and so out of touch. It does not care that millions of Australians are going to be worse off because of these savage cuts.


We saw today the analysis from NATSEM on the hardest hit electorates. For example, in the electorate of Watson and the electorate of Blaxland, both in Sydney, the average household is going to have to give up $990 each year; whereas, in the Prime Minister's electorate, families will only be worse off by $144 a year. This is no fluke; this is what this conservative government is all about—looking after those at the top end of town and whacking those who are not so well off. This analysis from NATSEM—described by the Prime Minister as `Australia's most respected modelling outfit'—shows that the hardest hit people in the country are those who are already doing it tough. They should be told by this government that, as a result of these bills, the poorest people in Australia must shoulder the burden of the Prime Minister's cuts. In contrast, Labor will stand up for low- and middle-income families who will be so savagely hit by the cuts in this legislation.


But perhaps, as I have said a number of times, the cruellest measures in these bills are the Prime Minister's brutal attacks on young job seekers. These bills will see young people under 30 who are looking for a job forced to wait six months before receiving any income support—and in some cases they will have to wait even longer. So the government is saying to young people, 'You are on your own.' If after six months without income support the young person has not found a job, the measure will require them to go on Work for the Dole. And if after their time on Work for the Dole they have still not found a job they will lose their payments for another six months. What do those opposite think these people are going to live on? Where are they going to get their food from? Who is going to pay the rent?


Every single Australian that you talk to understands how harsh these measures are and what it is going to mean when you push these hundreds of thousands of young people into poverty, crisis and homelessness. In fact, the budget actually includes money for emergency assistance, because the government knows that these young people will have absolutely nothing. I can make it very, very clear to the government that we will not be supporting this measure. It is cruel, it is harsh, and we will not support it at all.


The government are out there trying to suggest that there may be room for a compromise. They do not have it in the legislation, of course. Tonight we are debating the same proposal that has been around for the last six months. The government want to see young people with nothing to live on for six months. I want to make it very clear: there will be no compromise. We will not be providing any support for any compromise by the government that might suggest people should have nothing to live on for a month or some other period that the government might pull out of their hat.


Also as a result of this legislation the government want to push young people under 25 onto the lower Youth Allowance. Once again this is a huge cut—$2,500 a year. We will not support this punitive measure. How on earth does the government think these young people are going to survive on these considerably reduced levels of support? How is it fair to say to a young person, 'You're going to lose 20 per cent of your income support, whereas somebody on $200,000 will pay around 0.2 per cent through a reduction in their income. That is why Australians understand that this budget is grossly unfair. They look at the reality of these bills—of who will pay the price. The price will be paid by the poorest Australians. It will be paid by those families who are doing it the toughest. 


For months, Labor have been campaigning against this government's savage budget. We will continue to stand side by side with pensioners, with young people, with families. Our message to them is: we will continue to stand with you and we will vote against these savage cuts. We will continue to fight this cruel budget every day from now until the next election.

According to estimates—which is the best we can do—3,500 recipients have transitioned from interim farm household allowance payments. Payments to farmers who had been in receipt of interim farm household allowance and had applied for farm household allowance continued without interruption until their applications had been assessed by Centrelink. Further specific inquiries on this should be directed to the department that actually administers this, which is the Department of Human Services.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:40):  In addressing the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Senior Supplement Cessation) Bill 2014 and related bills, I will put in context why we are having this conversation and moving in these circles. In 2013, we went to the election with a four-pillar promise. We said we would axe the bad taxes—the carbon and mining taxes. We said we would stop the boats, that we would build the roads and the infrastructure of the 21st century, and that we would fix the budget mess. The carbon tax and the mining tax are gone. Tick. We have had one successful boat this year. We have announced $150 billion worth of roads and over $800 billion worth of approvals through the Department of the Environment to get this economy moving. The fourth pillar is to fix the budget mess, and that is taking a long time. And it will take a long time.


First of all, I will take up the point made by the member for Jagajaga and state emphatically: this is a lot of money. The savings we are trying to put through with these bills is a lot of money. By my calculations, over the forward estimates it is about $8.7 billion. That is a tremendous amount of money. But then consider that social security is, at the moment, $146 billion per year. In the next four years we will be spending nearly $600 billion on social security payments. To put it in context, we are talking about $8 billion versus $600 billion—over half a trillion dollars. What we are trying to get through here is about 1.5 per cent of that. 


We have an economy growing at around four per cent, but our social security and health costs are rising at nine per cent and over. We have real issues here. The thing that gets to me the most is that rather than discuss the numbers the opposition always want to argue about the words. Was it a budget emergency? They say it was not an emergency. I say: is it an emergency as you are going over the cliff, or is it an emergency as you are getting close to the cliff? I have a real issue with the way we talk about numbers in this place. People in the street, people at the Herbert Hotel, the Great Northern Hotel and the Shamrock Hotel do not know what a billion dollars is. People in my family do not know what a billion dollars is. It is almost impossible to get your head around that concept. So what business are we actually in? The vast majority of people are paying things off for their whole lives. So the mere concept of paying off debt is hard to get across. Are we really in the debt collection business and the paying money back business? I do not think we got elected to pay back debt. I think we got elected by the people of Australia to fix the thing. I think that this government is here to fix stuff. I think that is what we have to try to get across here: that something is broken.


These bills are not just about the last six years. These bills go back a lot further than the last six years, because we have got structural issues in our budget and in the way we spend money which go back an awfully long time. I have a friend who is a stay-at-home mum. The family have five kids under 15. Her husband works and has a car supplied by the company. He earns 120 grand. She gets nearly $1,800 a fortnight in family tax benefit part A. That is just short of $47,000 net a year. No wonder she is a stay-at-home mum. That is a $70,000 job. That is what we are paying her to stay at home. That sort of stuff has to end. She said to me, 'We're paying enough tax.' I said, 'I don't think you're paying any. You're not paying any tax.' We have to look at the way the money is going out. 


I have a real issue when it comes to the way that this has been portrayed by the other side. When you are in business, if you have a business that is struggling—and when I took over a business in Townsville, it was losing $150,000 a year and I was given the imprimatur to do whatever I had to do to get that business turned around—you do not just sit there and say, 'It's all too hard,' and just expect to keep on getting paid. What you have to do when things are tight is you have to look around and fight and scratch and punch and kick to get money in the door. That is what you have to do, and that is what we have to do to try and get this budget back into order. We have to fix the thing. 


What Labor did, what the member for Lilley and the member for Rankin, his offsider, did was that they took the family car, kept it for six years and then gave it back to us, and it is dinged up, it has blown a head gasket, it has got bald tyres, it has got dings all over it and it has got a busted windscreen. We can keep on driving the thing until it stops completely—we can just keep on putting a little bit of petrol in all the time until it stops completely—or we can fix it. We can put new tyres on it, restructure it and get the windscreen fixed and then we will still have a good motor car. It is the same with the economy. It is the same with these bills here.


We have a very generous social security system. Like I said, nearly $600 billion over the next four years is going out in social security, and we are asking for $8 billion in savings to go through—1½ per cent. I do not think that is too bad. We are in the fixing business. Governments—and I am not just talking about the last six years; I am talking about governments before that too—have known that we have an ageing population for a long time. This government is the first one to really address it. This government is the first one to even really talk about it. We do generation papers and all that sort of stuff, but we do not do anything about it. This government has said, 'Jeez, you know.' The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech said that, when he was at school, there were 7.5 taxpaying workers per person over 65. Today there are five—and there are more people in the workforce today than at any other time in Australia's history. By 2050, there will be 2.5 taxpaying workers per person over 65. That is a lot of weight to carry.


The hullabaloo about raising the age pension age to 70 from their 67 was just ridiculous. When the pension came in in 1908-09, it was at age 65 and it was fully means-tested. For every 10 quid you had over 100 quid, in cash and assets, including your home, you lost a pound off your pension for the year. The average life expectancy of the Australian male in 1908-09 was 62, so you had been dead for three years before you even got the pension! If we applied that today, you would not get the age pension until you were 84 years old. That is the challenge we have got. Instead of having a very small number of the population actually get to pension age, to where they are completely and utterly unable to work, we have people on average living nearly 19 years over the age of 65. That is a massive challenge for us here, and if we do not address it now, if we just keep on going the way we are, it is never going to get back. We are never going to catch up, and it is never going to be sustainable.


The other thing I hate is: did we take this to an election? I submit that, by saying that we had to fix the budget, that we had real issues in the budget, that should have said enough. We are not taking out a system 8 in the Lotto each week to pay down the budget debt. We are trying to fix the thing. It is both sides. You have to look at your spending and you have to look at the way you bring money in. But I submit to the Labor Party, on the great Hawke and Keating thing, was the floating of the dollar taken to an election? No, it was not. Was HECS taken to an election? No, it was not. The member for Jagajaga, with pious righteousness and sanctimony, standing there and talking about single mums, was the one who stuck it to the single mums in the last parliament. Did she take it to an election? No, she did not. Was it a structural reform for the betterment of people? No, it was not. It was a grab to get back to surplus. That is what it was. I have not even spoken about the carbon tax—I think we have done that to death.




Mr Hunt:
  Hey!




Ms RISHWORTH:
  Greg's upset!




Mr EWEN JONES:
  About the fact that they did not take it to an election. We have finished with it. But they did not take it to an election. They give us a gobful about not taking things to an election, about explicitly ruling it out. But I have a warning, especially to those guys who were not here in the last parliament. In the last parliament, as part of the deal making that went on, the member for Denison was able to get the then Prime Minister Gillard to agree to savage cuts in pokies and all the sort of stuff that went around that. The member for Shortland and the then member for Robertson and other people were taken to their local RSLs and sports clubs and so on, and they were belted. But the then member for Robertson stood up there and she stuck to the line. She did the right thing and she took her punishment well. I was talking to her one night and I said, 'The hard part about that is (a) it's state legislation and (b) you didn't take it to an election to do it.' She said, 'Oh, but it's so bad, Ewen. These people are killing themselves.' And then, when the then member for Fisher became the Speaker and they did not need Wilkie anymore, out it went, overnight. No-one was crossing the floor. It was no longer the greatest moral challenge of all time. They just did it.


So, when you go there, the changes to the age pension will not come in until after the next election. That gives the Labor Party enough time to come up with what they are going to do at the next election. That comes with enough time to sit down and say what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it. That is the important thing here. We got brought in because they could not handle the chequebook. That is the reason we are on this side and they are on that side. It is not anything to do with social conscience. It is not anything to do with the budget or anything like that; it is because they cannot handle the money. We have to handle the money, and it is as simple as that. If we do not get this thing into order—if we do not ask people to do more for what they are getting—we will never get this thing back in line and we will turn into the archetypal Greece or Ireland because we are not getting it under control.


I have three children. I have a 21-year-old, my daughter is going to turn 20 at the end of this week and I have a 12-year-old. When I am old, grey and out of this place, I want to be able to say to them that I did my best, that we did not just pass it on to them to fix it up for us because we did not have enough ticker to actually front the thing. Previous parliaments have not addressed the basic structural issues around our budget. To the credit of the Treasure, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister, we have actually looked at this thing and said, 'If we don't pull this thing into order, we're in all sorts of strife.'


So we are asking for an awful lot of money out of these bills. It is $8.7 billion, and that is going to hurt some people, but what is the option? Tell me what the option is and how you are going to pay for it. Tell me how we get these things done, because at the end of the day we are still spending $146 billion this year in social security payments. Social security payments are 35 per cent of the budget. It cannot keep on going the way it is. So I say to those members opposite: get on board, let's be serious about this and let's fix this thing, because that is the business we are in. We are fixing it so the next people who get this vehicle can actually do something. Every cent you pay back in debt is money you cannot spend on stuff you want to do. I thank the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:54):  On 13 May this year, about five months ago, the Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, handed down the worst budget in living memory. It went down very badly indeed. It was a budget based on a confected budget emergency, and there is a booklet that seems to have gone missing—a blue booklet called 'Real solutions'. I never see any members of the government come into the chamber with that, yet I recall numerous occasions in the last parliament when they put it under their arm like a bible. It was the manual. It would get the country back on deck. But so much of what we have seen in the legislation and the budget which this government announced in May cannot possibly and is not found in the missing blue book. You know: the book the then Leader of the Opposition used to hug so close to his chest. He put it in front of him like he had steak knives as well!—'Buy this and vote for me.' It has gone missing entirely.


I am always amused by those opposite, including the member for Herbert, who criticise us on our side as if none of us have business experience at all. I ran a business for more than 20 years. It grew from the time I was about 26 years of age into a medium-size firm in the Brisbane CBD. I grew that business, so don't come in here and say none of us have any idea, as if somehow those in the government alone know what it is like to be in business. Many of us on this side of the chamber know because we ran businesses ourselves.


A budget that clearly the government thinks is about lifters or leaners is a budget of broken promises and really cruel cuts: $50 billion in health and hospitals, $30 billion in schools. It is a budget that abandoned needs based funding and Americanised our universities. They are on about liberating our students with debt and $100,000 university degrees. It is a budget that fundamentally attacked the universality of Medicare. That is what it is about. There were massive cuts to family support and pensions, slashing $534 million in PM&C's Indigenous portfolio alone, on top of that cutting legal aid funding for Indigenous people, Indigenous language programs and on and on. There were $653 million in cuts to the aged-care sector. On top of that we have the cuts to the dementia and severe behaviour supplement—a one-two punch to the head of the aged-care sector.


So we have here legislation before the chamber which we will oppose and which again is about cuts, so many of which were never mentioned in that famous—or infamous—blue book they carried around everywhere. We will stand up on this side of the chamber for families, for fairness, for veterans, for older Australians, for those in the country in the cities and for those people from all over the country, from the Torres Strait to Tasmania. We will stand up for Labor values. We will. We would support sensible budget saves and we have done so. In fact, in the last few weeks we have demonstrated that. But we will not support savage cuts to family income.


Those cuts impact on electorates around the country, many held by Labor. Independent modelling produced by the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling revealed that families and residents in my electorate of Blair are worse off by about $406 per year as a consequence of the budget. I admit that Blair sits in about the middle of the electorate table, but the NATSEM modelling reveals that 15 of the 16 hardest hit electorates in Australia are held by the Australian Labor Party, those on this side of the chamber.


We fought the measures in the bills we are debating today when this stuff came before the house in a couple of omnibus bills. We fought these measures in the public, we fought in the Senate and we won. We won the argument with the public and saw the government backflip on this issue. We saw the government split bills, introducing four new bills to the House, and we supported responsible saves of about $2.7 billion which we told the government we would support back in May after the budget. But, in their arrogance—indeed, in their ignorance—they did not have the grace and humility to negotiate and talk to the opposition about this issue.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  You don't listen.




Mr NEUMANN:
  Not listening is exactly what this government is about—not listening to the public and eventually compelled to undertake what I said back in early October. But we will not support cuts of the order of about $8 billion to $10 billion which this government is proposing in the splitting of various bills, because what they are about here is pension indexation changes, kicking families off family tax benefit B when their youngest child turns six, freezing family tax benefit payments, and forcing job seekers to live without any income support income for up to six months. Imagine a 28-year-old carpenter in Raceview in Blair living with his partner and they have two kids. He loses his job and she is a stay-at-home mum. They are in a position where he loses his job and he is off without any income. What is he going to do? Where is he going to go? It goes to show how callous and harsh this government is.


Australians must really wonder what this government is all about when they look at what it has done. I heard the member for Herbert talk about the budget. He went on and on about the budget. The pre-election fiscal outlook demonstrated the figures, not that trumped up MYEFO we saw at the end of last year, and then the budget reveals where things were up to. What this government did when they got in was they virtually doubled the deficit. What they did was change the economic assumptions; gave $9 billion to the Reserve Bank; forewent all those revenue measures that we put in, which they had opposed; and got rid of the carbon pricing mechanism, which was bringing in billions of dollars as well. So what they have done is then decide they going to spend across the forward estimates about $22 billion in a Paid Parental Leave scheme to actually pay millionaires up to $50,000 to have children. This is what they are doing. Claiming there is a budget crisis is not consistent with the actions of this government. It is not. We had a AAA credit rating and we had low interest rates. This country was not in a budget crisis when the coalition came to power. That is the reality. What this government is doing is taking people off that income support that they really and truly need.


A recent Melbourne Institute report found that while 23 per cent of working age people received welfare payments in 2001, this had dropped to 18.5 per cent by 2011. But if you listened to the member for Herbert you would think there was a massive explosion of people on welfare in the country compared to what it was a decade or so ago. It is not true. It does not work out that way at all. The reality is very different.  The government cannot find economists anywhere to support their hysterical claims about a budget emergency and out-of-control welfare spending. AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver said this:


Australia is not facing a budget or public debt crisis right now. Our budget deficit and net public debt are low by OECD standards. Our bond yields are low and foreign investors are happily buying our bonds.


That was from The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 July 2014. Saul Eslake, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, compared Australia's budgetary position with that of the UK in 2010, which he had described as 'a crisis'. He said that to apply similar terms to Australia:


 … was to abuse the English language.


So we had some Orwellian language from those opposite in relation to this issue. Even when members opposite come to visit my electorate of Blair they cannot get the record straight. We had Senator Barry O'Sullivan debating me before the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce forgetting his talking points and admitting there was no budget crisis, which was reported very well and accurately, I might add, by The Queensland Times, who had pictures of him looking in despair about the whole issue. It did not go down very well with the business community in Ipswich, can I tell you. He clearly lost the argument in relation to that.


The government should be forced to abandon the legislation that is before the chamber, but they will not. They are not deterred by their commitment to cut pensions and slash support for low-income families. They are simply not. But I think, as I mentioned before, the situation in relation to young people being forced to go without any financial support for six months if they were young job seekers is one of the cruellest things I have ever seen. The Prime Minister has now reintroduced these cruel cuts which we defeated previously.


What they are trying to do as well in the legislation before the chamber is end the seniors supplement from 20 September 2014. This is a $999.4 million cut in support of 300,000 older Australians. These are people who currently get the seniors supplement available to Commonwealth seniors health card and DVA gold card holders. It is paid annually currently at a single rate of $886.60 for singles and $668.20 for each member of a couple. In my electorate the latest figures I can discover is that there are 953 Commonwealth seniors health card holders. That is nearly 1,000 people in my electorate alone. That is replicated everywhere. I would love those people opposite to go and do their listening posts in street stalls and see the old people as they going to their shopping centres—going into Woolworths and Coles and IgA et cetera—and say to them: 'Look, I am just reducing your capacity to buy that bread, butter and cheese. I am taking away your income.' Those types of supplements, as many older people in my electorate have told me, help them to meet their rates bills, electricity bills and other necessities. Some people have told me that that is the money they use for a bit of recreation as well. These are people who have worked hard all their lives and those opposite are supposed to be on the side of those who put away and save and who want to do the best in terms of financial dignity and respect in retirement.


But as people walked into those polling booths on 7 September 2013 they had not an inkling, those nearly 1000 voters in Blair, that my LNP opponent was going to, if she won, sit opposite and get rid of their seniors supplement. They had not an inkling because my opponent in that election did not tell them. They did not tell I guarantee that none of the people over there told any of the electors who were going into vote on election day that that was going to happen. There was not a peep from the then Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, that they would do it. 


In fact, I had a look at this. I do not even remember any election ads from the coalition about this. In fact, there was something in the coalition's election policy. I had a bit of a look. It is mentioned It is listed as a benefit in the coalition's election policy in relation to this issue—the holding of a Commonwealth seniors health card. The policy document of the coalition simply states that holders receive payment of the senior supplement. Unfortunately, these holders did not learn anything about this until after the election. It was missing; there was not anything in the coalition's policies about the supplement not being available in the event of an Abbott government—not mentioned at all. We oppose this. We do not believe the Prime Minister should punish those Australians who have worked hard all of their lives to prepare their retirements.


And with the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill 2014, I cannot see any empirical evidence as to why students should suffer in the way they are doing. We are seeing the application of interest rates on certain debts in relation to student assistance payments, interest being charged at 90-day bank accepted bill rates plus seven per cent interest. I cannot understand why they are doing this. There is no evidence that this needs to be done. There is the replacement of the existing Start-up Student Scholarship with new income contingent student loans; there is no evidence that this will work. There has been no review that I can see, and no real legitimate policy reason given for that. In the circumstances, we oppose this. (Time expired)

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (19:08):  I will sum up the three bills seriatim, beginning with the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Seniors Supplement Cessation) Bill. This bill will reintroduce the senior supplement budget measure, which was originally introduced in an earlier budget bill. From 20 September 2014 the measure will cease payment of the senior supplement for holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card or the Veterans' Affairs gold card. However, other benefits will remain available to cardholders, such as discounts on medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In conjunction with this change to the seniors supplement, the bill will ensure that cardholders who formerly received the clean energy supplement in association with their card will receive the renamed energy supplement maintained at current levels through the permanent removal of indexation.


Secondly, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill will reintroduce two measures relating to student entitlements that were originally announced by the previous government. The Senate removed the two measures from the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 in March 2014. The first measure will allow for an interest charge to be applied to debts incurred by recipients of certain student payments, but only if the debtor does not have or is not honouring an acceptable repayment arrangement. The aim of this measure is to encourage debtors to repay their debt in a timely fashion where they have the financial capacity to do so. The second measure in the bill replaces the current Student Start-up Scholarship with an income contingent loan, the student start-up loan. The student start-up loan is to help students with the costs of study, including the purchase of textbooks, computers and internet access. The loans will be available on a voluntary basis. They will be repayable under similar arrangements to the Higher Education Loan Program debts, and only after those HELP debts have been repaid. Both measures will be implemented from 1 January 2015.


Thirdly, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 4) Bill 2014 reintroduces several of the 2014 budget measures that were previously introduced in other budget bills. Our welfare system must be fair, but it must also be sustainable. The budget measures introduced by this bill help us to make our welfare system strong for the future. The amendments include changes to make payments more sustainable by maintaining certain rates, free areas and thresholds at current levels for up to three years. There are refinements to the family payment system to improve targeting to families most in need of support, and several changes to working aid and student payments that will target assistance towards supporting the most vulnerable Australians while encouraging those who are able to work or study to do so. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (19:23):  (In division) Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am on the record as getting advice from the clerks because, at the moment, there is not a precedent that they have been able to ascertain for having the member in the chamber even though the doors had been locked. I am getting that advice and, when I do get that advice, I will let the chamber know.




Ms BURKE:


Mr Deputy Speaker, the precedent that I am referring to is at footnote 378 on page 279 of Practice.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I make the ruling that the member for Capricornia's vote will not be counted, and that is where the decision ends.




Ms BURKE:
  So that is in order?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Capricornia was given bad advice but she did not sit in a member's seat. Member for Watson, the precedent that you are talking about is when a member is sitting in their seat and they disregard a ruling from the chair and move to the back of the chamber. This is a different situation and the member for Capricornia's vote will not be counted.




Ms BURKE:


Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My understanding is that the member for Capricornia pushed in after the direction had been given that the doors be locked. At that point she pushed her way into the chamber. That is of a similar gravity to someone moving to the back because it is still occurring after the call has been given for the doors to be locked and the tellers to be appointed. The principle under which that precedent exists applies in the exact same way: someone moved to the back of the chamber in a disorderly fashion. The member for Capricornia should not be able to be counted out of the ballot as though she had not broken any rules; she did.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Capricornia actually got through the doors and she had the opportunity to sit down in her seat. She was advised not to; that was her prerogative, and she stayed at the back of the chamber. That is where she opted to stay. She should have actually sat down in her seat, because any other members would have done the same thing. She did not do that; she stayed at the back of the chamber. Her vote is not counted, therefore. Her vote will be recorded as having not voted at all. I thank the member for Watson for trying to clarify that.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-10-22,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:40):  In addressing the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Senior Supplement Cessation) Bill 2014 and related bills, I will put in context why we are having this conversation and moving in these circles. In 2013, we went to the election with a four-pillar promise. We said we would axe the bad taxes—the carbon and mining taxes. We said we would stop the boats, that we would build the roads and the infrastructure of the 21st century, and that we would fix the budget mess. The carbon tax and the mining tax are gone. Tick. We have had one successful boat this year. We have announced $150 billion worth of roads and over $800 billion worth of approvals through the Department of the Environment to get this economy moving. The fourth pillar is to fix the budget mess, and that is taking a long time. And it will take a long time.


First of all, I will take up the point made by the member for Jagajaga and state emphatically: this is a lot of money. The savings we are trying to put through with these bills is a lot of money. By my calculations, over the forward estimates it is about $8.7 billion. That is a tremendous amount of money. But then consider that social security is, at the moment, $146 billion per year. In the next four years we will be spending nearly $600 billion on social security payments. To put it in context, we are talking about $8 billion versus $600 billion—over half a trillion dollars. What we are trying to get through here is about 1.5 per cent of that. 


We have an economy growing at around four per cent, but our social security and health costs are rising at nine per cent and over. We have real issues here. The thing that gets to me the most is that rather than discuss the numbers the opposition always want to argue about the words. Was it a budget emergency? They say it was not an emergency. I say: is it an emergency as you are going over the cliff, or is it an emergency as you are getting close to the cliff? I have a real issue with the way we talk about numbers in this place. People in the street, people at the Herbert Hotel, the Great Northern Hotel and the Shamrock Hotel do not know what a billion dollars is. People in my family do not know what a billion dollars is. It is almost impossible to get your head around that concept. So what business are we actually in? The vast majority of people are paying things off for their whole lives. So the mere concept of paying off debt is hard to get across. Are we really in the debt collection business and the paying money back business? I do not think we got elected to pay back debt. I think we got elected by the people of Australia to fix the thing. I think that this government is here to fix stuff. I think that is what we have to try to get across here: that something is broken.


These bills are not just about the last six years. These bills go back a lot further than the last six years, because we have got structural issues in our budget and in the way we spend money which go back an awfully long time. I have a friend who is a stay-at-home mum. The family have five kids under 15. Her husband works and has a car supplied by the company. He earns 120 grand. She gets nearly $1,800 a fortnight in family tax benefit part A. That is just short of $47,000 net a year. No wonder she is a stay-at-home mum. That is a $70,000 job. That is what we are paying her to stay at home. That sort of stuff has to end. She said to me, 'We're paying enough tax.' I said, 'I don't think you're paying any. You're not paying any tax.' We have to look at the way the money is going out. 


I have a real issue when it comes to the way that this has been portrayed by the other side. When you are in business, if you have a business that is struggling—and when I took over a business in Townsville, it was losing $150,000 a year and I was given the imprimatur to do whatever I had to do to get that business turned around—you do not just sit there and say, 'It's all too hard,' and just expect to keep on getting paid. What you have to do when things are tight is you have to look around and fight and scratch and punch and kick to get money in the door. That is what you have to do, and that is what we have to do to try and get this budget back into order. We have to fix the thing. 


What Labor did, what the member for Lilley and the member for Rankin, his offsider, did was that they took the family car, kept it for six years and then gave it back to us, and it is dinged up, it has blown a head gasket, it has got bald tyres, it has got dings all over it and it has got a busted windscreen. We can keep on driving the thing until it stops completely—we can just keep on putting a little bit of petrol in all the time until it stops completely—or we can fix it. We can put new tyres on it, restructure it and get the windscreen fixed and then we will still have a good motor car. It is the same with the economy. It is the same with these bills here.


We have a very generous social security system. Like I said, nearly $600 billion over the next four years is going out in social security, and we are asking for $8 billion in savings to go through—1½ per cent. I do not think that is too bad. We are in the fixing business. Governments—and I am not just talking about the last six years; I am talking about governments before that too—have known that we have an ageing population for a long time. This government is the first one to really address it. This government is the first one to even really talk about it. We do generation papers and all that sort of stuff, but we do not do anything about it. This government has said, 'Jeez, you know.' The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply speech said that, when he was at school, there were 7.5 taxpaying workers per person over 65. Today there are five—and there are more people in the workforce today than at any other time in Australia's history. By 2050, there will be 2.5 taxpaying workers per person over 65. That is a lot of weight to carry.


The hullabaloo about raising the age pension age to 70 from their 67 was just ridiculous. When the pension came in in 1908-09, it was at age 65 and it was fully means-tested. For every 10 quid you had over 100 quid, in cash and assets, including your home, you lost a pound off your pension for the year. The average life expectancy of the Australian male in 1908-09 was 62, so you had been dead for three years before you even got the pension! If we applied that today, you would not get the age pension until you were 84 years old. That is the challenge we have got. Instead of having a very small number of the population actually get to pension age, to where they are completely and utterly unable to work, we have people on average living nearly 19 years over the age of 65. That is a massive challenge for us here, and if we do not address it now, if we just keep on going the way we are, it is never going to get back. We are never going to catch up, and it is never going to be sustainable.


The other thing I hate is: did we take this to an election? I submit that, by saying that we had to fix the budget, that we had real issues in the budget, that should have said enough. We are not taking out a system 8 in the Lotto each week to pay down the budget debt. We are trying to fix the thing. It is both sides. You have to look at your spending and you have to look at the way you bring money in. But I submit to the Labor Party, on the great Hawke and Keating thing, was the floating of the dollar taken to an election? No, it was not. Was HECS taken to an election? No, it was not. The member for Jagajaga, with pious righteousness and sanctimony, standing there and talking about single mums, was the one who stuck it to the single mums in the last parliament. Did she take it to an election? No, she did not. Was it a structural reform for the betterment of people? No, it was not. It was a grab to get back to surplus. That is what it was. I have not even spoken about the carbon tax—I think we have done that to death.




Mr Hunt:
  Hey!




Ms RISHWORTH:
  Greg's upset!




Mr EWEN JONES:
  About the fact that they did not take it to an election. We have finished with it. But they did not take it to an election. They give us a gobful about not taking things to an election, about explicitly ruling it out. But I have a warning, especially to those guys who were not here in the last parliament. In the last parliament, as part of the deal making that went on, the member for Denison was able to get the then Prime Minister Gillard to agree to savage cuts in pokies and all the sort of stuff that went around that. The member for Shortland and the then member for Robertson and other people were taken to their local RSLs and sports clubs and so on, and they were belted. But the then member for Robertson stood up there and she stuck to the line. She did the right thing and she took her punishment well. I was talking to her one night and I said, 'The hard part about that is (a) it's state legislation and (b) you didn't take it to an election to do it.' She said, 'Oh, but it's so bad, Ewen. These people are killing themselves.' And then, when the then member for Fisher became the Speaker and they did not need Wilkie anymore, out it went, overnight. No-one was crossing the floor. It was no longer the greatest moral challenge of all time. They just did it.


So, when you go there, the changes to the age pension will not come in until after the next election. That gives the Labor Party enough time to come up with what they are going to do at the next election. That comes with enough time to sit down and say what they are going to do and how they are going to pay for it. That is the important thing here. We got brought in because they could not handle the chequebook. That is the reason we are on this side and they are on that side. It is not anything to do with social conscience. It is not anything to do with the budget or anything like that; it is because they cannot handle the money. We have to handle the money, and it is as simple as that. If we do not get this thing into order—if we do not ask people to do more for what they are getting—we will never get this thing back in line and we will turn into the archetypal Greece or Ireland because we are not getting it under control.


I have three children. I have a 21-year-old, my daughter is going to turn 20 at the end of this week and I have a 12-year-old. When I am old, grey and out of this place, I want to be able to say to them that I did my best, that we did not just pass it on to them to fix it up for us because we did not have enough ticker to actually front the thing. Previous parliaments have not addressed the basic structural issues around our budget. To the credit of the Treasure, the Minister for Finance and the Prime Minister, we have actually looked at this thing and said, 'If we don't pull this thing into order, we're in all sorts of strife.'


So we are asking for an awful lot of money out of these bills. It is $8.7 billion, and that is going to hurt some people, but what is the option? Tell me what the option is and how you are going to pay for it. Tell me how we get these things done, because at the end of the day we are still spending $146 billion this year in social security payments. Social security payments are 35 per cent of the budget. It cannot keep on going the way it is. So I say to those members opposite: get on board, let's be serious about this and let's fix this thing, because that is the business we are in. We are fixing it so the next people who get this vehicle can actually do something. Every cent you pay back in debt is money you cannot spend on stuff you want to do. I thank the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:54):  On 13 May this year, about five months ago, the Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, handed down the worst budget in living memory. It went down very badly indeed. It was a budget based on a confected budget emergency, and there is a booklet that seems to have gone missing—a blue booklet called 'Real solutions'. I never see any members of the government come into the chamber with that, yet I recall numerous occasions in the last parliament when they put it under their arm like a bible. It was the manual. It would get the country back on deck. But so much of what we have seen in the legislation and the budget which this government announced in May cannot possibly and is not found in the missing blue book. You know: the book the then Leader of the Opposition used to hug so close to his chest. He put it in front of him like he had steak knives as well!—'Buy this and vote for me.' It has gone missing entirely.


I am always amused by those opposite, including the member for Herbert, who criticise us on our side as if none of us have business experience at all. I ran a business for more than 20 years. It grew from the time I was about 26 years of age into a medium-size firm in the Brisbane CBD. I grew that business, so don't come in here and say none of us have any idea, as if somehow those in the government alone know what it is like to be in business. Many of us on this side of the chamber know because we ran businesses ourselves.


A budget that clearly the government thinks is about lifters or leaners is a budget of broken promises and really cruel cuts: $50 billion in health and hospitals, $30 billion in schools. It is a budget that abandoned needs based funding and Americanised our universities. They are on about liberating our students with debt and $100,000 university degrees. It is a budget that fundamentally attacked the universality of Medicare. That is what it is about. There were massive cuts to family support and pensions, slashing $534 million in PM&C's Indigenous portfolio alone, on top of that cutting legal aid funding for Indigenous people, Indigenous language programs and on and on. There were $653 million in cuts to the aged-care sector. On top of that we have the cuts to the dementia and severe behaviour supplement—a one-two punch to the head of the aged-care sector.


So we have here legislation before the chamber which we will oppose and which again is about cuts, so many of which were never mentioned in that famous—or infamous—blue book they carried around everywhere. We will stand up on this side of the chamber for families, for fairness, for veterans, for older Australians, for those in the country in the cities and for those people from all over the country, from the Torres Strait to Tasmania. We will stand up for Labor values. We will. We would support sensible budget saves and we have done so. In fact, in the last few weeks we have demonstrated that. But we will not support savage cuts to family income.


Those cuts impact on electorates around the country, many held by Labor. Independent modelling produced by the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling revealed that families and residents in my electorate of Blair are worse off by about $406 per year as a consequence of the budget. I admit that Blair sits in about the middle of the electorate table, but the NATSEM modelling reveals that 15 of the 16 hardest hit electorates in Australia are held by the Australian Labor Party, those on this side of the chamber.


We fought the measures in the bills we are debating today when this stuff came before the house in a couple of omnibus bills. We fought these measures in the public, we fought in the Senate and we won. We won the argument with the public and saw the government backflip on this issue. We saw the government split bills, introducing four new bills to the House, and we supported responsible saves of about $2.7 billion which we told the government we would support back in May after the budget. But, in their arrogance—indeed, in their ignorance—they did not have the grace and humility to negotiate and talk to the opposition about this issue.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  You don't listen.




Mr NEUMANN:
  Not listening is exactly what this government is about—not listening to the public and eventually compelled to undertake what I said back in early October. But we will not support cuts of the order of about $8 billion to $10 billion which this government is proposing in the splitting of various bills, because what they are about here is pension indexation changes, kicking families off family tax benefit B when their youngest child turns six, freezing family tax benefit payments, and forcing job seekers to live without any income support income for up to six months. Imagine a 28-year-old carpenter in Raceview in Blair living with his partner and they have two kids. He loses his job and she is a stay-at-home mum. They are in a position where he loses his job and he is off without any income. What is he going to do? Where is he going to go? It goes to show how callous and harsh this government is.


Australians must really wonder what this government is all about when they look at what it has done. I heard the member for Herbert talk about the budget. He went on and on about the budget. The pre-election fiscal outlook demonstrated the figures, not that trumped up MYEFO we saw at the end of last year, and then the budget reveals where things were up to. What this government did when they got in was they virtually doubled the deficit. What they did was change the economic assumptions; gave $9 billion to the Reserve Bank; forewent all those revenue measures that we put in, which they had opposed; and got rid of the carbon pricing mechanism, which was bringing in billions of dollars as well. So what they have done is then decide they going to spend across the forward estimates about $22 billion in a Paid Parental Leave scheme to actually pay millionaires up to $50,000 to have children. This is what they are doing. Claiming there is a budget crisis is not consistent with the actions of this government. It is not. We had a AAA credit rating and we had low interest rates. This country was not in a budget crisis when the coalition came to power. That is the reality. What this government is doing is taking people off that income support that they really and truly need.


A recent Melbourne Institute report found that while 23 per cent of working age people received welfare payments in 2001, this had dropped to 18.5 per cent by 2011. But if you listened to the member for Herbert you would think there was a massive explosion of people on welfare in the country compared to what it was a decade or so ago. It is not true. It does not work out that way at all. The reality is very different.  The government cannot find economists anywhere to support their hysterical claims about a budget emergency and out-of-control welfare spending. AMP Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver said this:


Australia is not facing a budget or public debt crisis right now. Our budget deficit and net public debt are low by OECD standards. Our bond yields are low and foreign investors are happily buying our bonds.


That was from The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 July 2014. Saul Eslake, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, compared Australia's budgetary position with that of the UK in 2010, which he had described as 'a crisis'. He said that to apply similar terms to Australia:


 … was to abuse the English language.


So we had some Orwellian language from those opposite in relation to this issue. Even when members opposite come to visit my electorate of Blair they cannot get the record straight. We had Senator Barry O'Sullivan debating me before the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce forgetting his talking points and admitting there was no budget crisis, which was reported very well and accurately, I might add, by The Queensland Times, who had pictures of him looking in despair about the whole issue. It did not go down very well with the business community in Ipswich, can I tell you. He clearly lost the argument in relation to that.


The government should be forced to abandon the legislation that is before the chamber, but they will not. They are not deterred by their commitment to cut pensions and slash support for low-income families. They are simply not. But I think, as I mentioned before, the situation in relation to young people being forced to go without any financial support for six months if they were young job seekers is one of the cruellest things I have ever seen. The Prime Minister has now reintroduced these cruel cuts which we defeated previously.


What they are trying to do as well in the legislation before the chamber is end the seniors supplement from 20 September 2014. This is a $999.4 million cut in support of 300,000 older Australians. These are people who currently get the seniors supplement available to Commonwealth seniors health card and DVA gold card holders. It is paid annually currently at a single rate of $886.60 for singles and $668.20 for each member of a couple. In my electorate the latest figures I can discover is that there are 953 Commonwealth seniors health card holders. That is nearly 1,000 people in my electorate alone. That is replicated everywhere. I would love those people opposite to go and do their listening posts in street stalls and see the old people as they going to their shopping centres—going into Woolworths and Coles and IgA et cetera—and say to them: 'Look, I am just reducing your capacity to buy that bread, butter and cheese. I am taking away your income.' Those types of supplements, as many older people in my electorate have told me, help them to meet their rates bills, electricity bills and other necessities. Some people have told me that that is the money they use for a bit of recreation as well. These are people who have worked hard all their lives and those opposite are supposed to be on the side of those who put away and save and who want to do the best in terms of financial dignity and respect in retirement.


But as people walked into those polling booths on 7 September 2013 they had not an inkling, those nearly 1000 voters in Blair, that my LNP opponent was going to, if she won, sit opposite and get rid of their seniors supplement. They had not an inkling because my opponent in that election did not tell them. They did not tell I guarantee that none of the people over there told any of the electors who were going into vote on election day that that was going to happen. There was not a peep from the then Leader of the Opposition nor the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, that they would do it. 


In fact, I had a look at this. I do not even remember any election ads from the coalition about this. In fact, there was something in the coalition's election policy. I had a bit of a look. It is mentioned It is listed as a benefit in the coalition's election policy in relation to this issue—the holding of a Commonwealth seniors health card. The policy document of the coalition simply states that holders receive payment of the senior supplement. Unfortunately, these holders did not learn anything about this until after the election. It was missing; there was not anything in the coalition's policies about the supplement not being available in the event of an Abbott government—not mentioned at all. We oppose this. We do not believe the Prime Minister should punish those Australians who have worked hard all of their lives to prepare their retirements.


And with the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill 2014, I cannot see any empirical evidence as to why students should suffer in the way they are doing. We are seeing the application of interest rates on certain debts in relation to student assistance payments, interest being charged at 90-day bank accepted bill rates plus seven per cent interest. I cannot understand why they are doing this. There is no evidence that this needs to be done. There is the replacement of the existing Start-up Student Scholarship with new income contingent student loans; there is no evidence that this will work. There has been no review that I can see, and no real legitimate policy reason given for that. In the circumstances, we oppose this. (Time expired)

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies—Minister for Social Services) (19:08):  I will sum up the three bills seriatim, beginning with the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Seniors Supplement Cessation) Bill. This bill will reintroduce the senior supplement budget measure, which was originally introduced in an earlier budget bill. From 20 September 2014 the measure will cease payment of the senior supplement for holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card or the Veterans' Affairs gold card. However, other benefits will remain available to cardholders, such as discounts on medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In conjunction with this change to the seniors supplement, the bill will ensure that cardholders who formerly received the clean energy supplement in association with their card will receive the renamed energy supplement maintained at current levels through the permanent removal of indexation.


Secondly, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Student Measures) Bill will reintroduce two measures relating to student entitlements that were originally announced by the previous government. The Senate removed the two measures from the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 in March 2014. The first measure will allow for an interest charge to be applied to debts incurred by recipients of certain student payments, but only if the debtor does not have or is not honouring an acceptable repayment arrangement. The aim of this measure is to encourage debtors to repay their debt in a timely fashion where they have the financial capacity to do so. The second measure in the bill replaces the current Student Start-up Scholarship with an income contingent loan, the student start-up loan. The student start-up loan is to help students with the costs of study, including the purchase of textbooks, computers and internet access. The loans will be available on a voluntary basis. They will be repayable under similar arrangements to the Higher Education Loan Program debts, and only after those HELP debts have been repaid. Both measures will be implemented from 1 January 2015.


Thirdly, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 4) Bill 2014 reintroduces several of the 2014 budget measures that were previously introduced in other budget bills. Our welfare system must be fair, but it must also be sustainable. The budget measures introduced by this bill help us to make our welfare system strong for the future. The amendments include changes to make payments more sustainable by maintaining certain rates, free areas and thresholds at current levels for up to three years. There are refinements to the family payment system to improve targeting to families most in need of support, and several changes to working aid and student payments that will target assistance towards supporting the most vulnerable Australians while encouraging those who are able to work or study to do so. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) (19:23):  (In division) Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am on the record as getting advice from the clerks because, at the moment, there is not a precedent that they have been able to ascertain for having the member in the chamber even though the doors had been locked. I am getting that advice and, when I do get that advice, I will let the chamber know.




Ms BURKE:


Mr Deputy Speaker, the precedent that I am referring to is at footnote 378 on page 279 of Practice.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I make the ruling that the member for Capricornia's vote will not be counted, and that is where the decision ends.




Ms BURKE:
  So that is in order?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Capricornia was given bad advice but she did not sit in a member's seat. Member for Watson, the precedent that you are talking about is when a member is sitting in their seat and they disregard a ruling from the chair and move to the back of the chamber. This is a different situation and the member for Capricornia's vote will not be counted.




Ms BURKE:


Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. My understanding is that the member for Capricornia pushed in after the direction had been given that the doors be locked. At that point she pushed her way into the chamber. That is of a similar gravity to someone moving to the back because it is still occurring after the call has been given for the doors to be locked and the tellers to be appointed. The principle under which that precedent exists applies in the exact same way: someone moved to the back of the chamber in a disorderly fashion. The member for Capricornia should not be able to be counted out of the ballot as though she had not broken any rules; she did.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Capricornia actually got through the doors and she had the opportunity to sit down in her seat. She was advised not to; that was her prerogative, and she stayed at the back of the chamber. That is where she opted to stay. She should have actually sat down in her seat, because any other members would have done the same thing. She did not do that; she stayed at the back of the chamber. Her vote is not counted, therefore. Her vote will be recorded as having not voted at all. I thank the member for Watson for trying to clarify that.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (19:53):  Last week it was widely reported that an Australian company, Virtus Health, has joined Silicon Valley giants Facebook and Apple in offering women employees the option of subsidised egg freezing in order to facilitate delayed motherhood. For this particular company, which specialises in IVF, it is undoubtedly a cost-effective employee benefit option and it has no doubt garnered a degree of publicity as an Australian first.


But I wanted to rise tonight to sound a note of caution about the idea of social freezing becoming a workplace trend. There are all manner of implications for young women in the workforce when employers provide this costly service as a form of workplace entitlement. As we all know, employee entitlements tend to reflect workplace ethos and culture. It would be naive to think that this option is offered up as a benign choice and employees would not feel a certain pressure to comply with the notion of deferring children.


At the outset, I want to stress that a woman's reproductive health decisions are uniquely her own. But for the majority of women, raising children will be part of their life's story, and that is a good thing. It is fundamental to our society and it is crucial for our economic future, especially as the population ages.


But I fear that the whole concept of boss-sponsored delayed motherhood implies a very definite preferment for women who prioritise their job above their family. It also implies that freezing your eggs is a perfectly workable and viable alternative that will provide young women with the flexible option of taking up motherhood at a time that better suits them.


The truth is, as Dr Gino Pecoraro, obstetrician and obstetrics and gynaecology spokesperson for the Australian Medical Association says: 


On the whole we're very good at freezing eggs, but we're not so great at thawing them.


In fact, the chance of a live birth, even from eggs harvested from a woman 38 or younger, is between two to 12 per cent per egg, and IVF is not the easy solution that some of the headlines seem to suggest.


The chance of a live birth per started IVF treatment cycle in the 30-34 age group is roughly 25 per cent, and only 6.6 per cent for women aged 40-44. For women aged over 45, the success rate is just 1.2 per cent. We need to be honest about these figures and what they mean, because many young women only see the headline that Apple is paying $20,000 to freeze employees eggs, and assume that it just works: that assisted reproductive technology will allow them to beat their body clock.


The reality is, for many women it will not. There is a finite window on when conceiving and carrying a pregnancy can be successful for a woman. And the cruel reality is it is a much smaller time frame than that for a man who wants to be a father.


This is a complex issue—worthy of much more time than I have in this debate–but I wish to touch on some workplace implications. It is generally agreed that more needs to be done to increase female work participation but the answer to increasing it is not freezing eggs and delaying motherhood, because there is no perfect time to have children. There will always be financial obligations and there will always be financial wish lists without the added pressure of workplace expectations;


But I believe that delaying motherhood can potentially mean that future financial burdens are even greater. Starting a family later also means returning to the workforce at an older age, when it is potentially harder to secure employment. This could well lead to financial difficulties supporting the child or children.


As a society we ought to be looking at ways to recognise and accommodate the demands of motherhood, rather than avoiding them. Asking women to delay childbirth and to even offer them a financial incentive to freeze their eggs is not the answer to increased female participation in the workforce. Let's look at flexible work hours, telecommuting, home office arrangements, better maternity leave provisions and flexible leave arrangements. But more importantly: let's change our attitude to women with families; recognise just how hard it is to balance work and family commitments; and celebrate the unique contribution that women can and do make to the workplace.


When a hip and trendy employer sends the message that it is optimal to work through your child-bearing years, we should question it. Yes, it may be optimal for the company. It may indeed be the best choice for some women. But for the majority of women who do want a family, it can lead to something far worse than a pay gap or a career temporarily put on hold: the pain and regret of being unable to have a longed-for child.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2014-10-22,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (09:30):  Australia can sometimes be a cruel and selfish country. Too many people are happy with, or at least prepared to turn a blind eye to, the government's asylum seeker policy. Some people actually think the government's May budget was fair, and, frankly, how many more episodes of animal cruelty are needed before the government shuts down the live export trade? To that end at least the previous government did improve things a little by introducing the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. Even after ESCAS has been running for over two years there has not been a single charge laid against any exporter despite the repeated revelations of systemic cruelty in the live export industry. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce claims that ESCAS has been an incredible success. Minister, it is not an incredible success when the atrocities keep happening, nor is it an incredible success when cruelty is inflicted again and again on Australian animals and no-one is held to account.


This is the reason why, in January, I travelled to Darwin at the invitation of the live export industry and accepted an offer to travel on a cattle ship to Indonesia. Of course the industry quickly reneged on the invitation and came up with every excuse under the sun as to why it could not go. Clearly this is an industry with something to hide. This is also why, in February this year, I introduced the Live Animal Export Prohibition (Ending Cruelty) Bill 2014, which would put an end to live animal exports from 2017 and would put in place improved animal welfare safety safeguards in the interim. This is my fourth legislative attempt to end the cruelty, and it is a terrible shame that the government did not care enough to list the bill for debate.


Live exports are systemically cruel, not in Australia's economic self-interest and lack popular support. It is being left to organisations like Animals Australia to keep bringing the atrocities to people's attention, even though it is in the government's power to remedy things virtually immediately. Instead the government chooses to do nothing to end the cruelty, preferring instead to celebrate every growth in this vile trade. Such inaction is actually not in the government's best interest because it will continue to face broad public condemnation so long as the cruelty continues, nor is inaction in the industry's best interest because it will not survive over the longer term unless it is seen to be operating ethically. Inaction certainly, and most importantly, is not in the animals' best interest because, after, all they are the ones who are suffering terribly.

Mr Joyce:
  The Minister for Agriculture has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:


(1) The Australian Government has not received any allegations of Australian companies importing illegally logged timber from Indonesia since the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012 came into force in November 2012.


(2) Yes. The report raises some important issues about deforestation in Indonesia. This is obviously a matter for the Indonesian Government to manage. However, it is important to recognise that some forest clearing is sanctioned by the Indonesian government for economic development purposes.


The Australian Government continues to support the sustainable management of south-east Asian tropical rainforests. In support of this, the Minister for the Environment, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, will host an Asia-Pacific Rainforest Summit on 12 November 2014. The summit will bring together ministers from forest nations and donor countries, corporate leaders and senior officials from key non-government organisations. They will focus on practical actions to reduce forest loss, while recognising the legitimate development aspirations of rainforest nations and communities.


(3) The Australian Government continues to implement the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012 and the associated Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment Regulation 2013.


Any allegations of Australian companies trading in illegally logged timber or timber products will be treated seriously. On referral to the government, any allegations will undergo preliminary inquiry to ascertain the facts and to determine if they need to be further investigated. Matters will proceed to a formal investigation if they are found to potentially breach the legislation. This will be carried out in accordance with the Australian Government Investigation Standards. Ultimately, a matter may be referred to the Australian Federal Police if it is a serious crime or requires criminal investigation. 


Penalties for a breach of the legislation are ultimately at the discretion of a court. However, the maximum penalties that can be applied for a breach are:


five years imprisonment, and/or


AUD$85,000 for an individual, and/or


AUD$425,000 for a corporation or body corporate.


The Illegal Logging Prohibition Amendment Regulation 2013 is scheduled to come into effect on 30 November 2014. The Regulation requires importers and domestic processors to carry out 'due diligence' to manage the risk that the timber they are dealing with has been illegally logged. The Government is working to ensure that affected businesses are aware of the new requirements and have the necessary information to help them understand and comply with the Regulation.
