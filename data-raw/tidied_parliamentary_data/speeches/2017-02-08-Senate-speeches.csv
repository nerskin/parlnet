"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (09:31):  I am delighted to continue my comments on this bill and to draw to the chamber's attention that it is always easy in 2017 to say, 'The North West Shelf is there. Gorgon, Wheatstone and Ichthys are there. The Queensland projects are there.' They were not always there.


I draw attention to the chamber that back in the 1970s Sir Charles Court, the absolute dynamo of Western Australia and Australian industry, negotiated with the federal government that there be a fairer sharing of the royalties and the income that would come from the possibility of a North West Shelf. Remember, Woodside had made no investment. There was a prospectivity but there was no wealth. It is easy in this year to look back and say, 'Look how much money we have all made out of it,' and, 'We're rushing towards being the world's biggest exporter of LNG,' but in the 1970s there was nothing there. A huge risk was taken. Quite correctly, Sir Charles Court said to the Prime Minister of the day, 'We in Western Australia are going to take the risks. We're going to be doing the work. You will enjoy the royalty benefit of the LNG that might come'—might come!—'from the success of a North West Shelf.' As a result of that, a decision was taken at the time that should there be any gas and condensate found there would be no tax at all to the company on condensate to give them an incentive. That was done so that in the possibility of there being some success from that exploration they would at least have a motivation and an incentive. As we know, along came Prime Minister Rudd, and he put paid to what had been a long-established principle.


The importance of this bill before us is that it takes into account the sharing of royalty income between the Commonwealth government and the state, or states. As we know, on the seabed hydrocarbons move. They might be in state waters. If they are within or around an island they may be in Commonwealth waters. As extraction takes place the hydrocarbons move. This is part of the reason for the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill coming before us.


I am delighted that Senator Moore yesterday courteously supported this bill on behalf of her party. She made some very good points about resources and their contribution, and about the efforts in Western Australia of the member for the Pilbara, Mr Grylls, who would be absolutely torpedoing future investment—in that case in the iron ore industry—as a result of ill-founded and poorly thought out claims made for his own cheap, political advantage.


As a result of the efforts of Charles Court and others the decision was taken at that time that there should be some preference for domestic gas supply. Why would that be? Simply because at that time the risk was on the people of Western Australia. Charles Court negotiated what was called a take or pay agreement—in other words, should Woodside proceed and should they find gas, then there would be an automatic market for that gas. At that time, of course—as I know myself—in WA there was no reticulated supply of gas. So the people of Western Australia and indeed Alcoa, the aluminium company themselves, took an undertaking that they would purchase in advance significant proportions of that natural gas. So today we have a scenario in place in WA where at least 15 per cent of all new LNG supply is guaranteed for domestic gas.


Mr President, I would humbly request through you that I have some silence or at least quiet if that is possible.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes. Could I just invite all senators if they are holding conversations and if they do not need to be in the chamber to hold those conversations outside the chamber so that we can hear Senator Back in silence. It is disruptive.




Senator BACK:
  Thank you very much. I would have liked to have contributed to how the UN went from my time in 2013. Maybe we can continue that discussion at a later stage.


I was just concluding on the observation that in Western Australia now, as a result of the risk taken by the Western Australian community through the then-Premier Charles Court, that the risk associated with the development of North West Shelf Gas was taken by the people of WA and Alcoa. Of course, today it is wonderful. We have a Pilbara to Bunbury gas pipeline. Gas is reticulated everywhere. If states like Victoria and South Australia and Queensland do not get their act together in terms of gas exploration and extraction, there is already talk of there being huge storage facilities either offshore Victoria or on land to provide gas for Victoria from elsewhere. I had a discussion recently with our new ambassador to Japan, the Hon. Richard Court, son of Sir Charles. He and I discussed the prospect of whether there could indeed be a gas pipeline across the Nullarbor so that we could supply these other states who seem to be most intransigent when it comes to guaranteeing a supply of product that will guarantee to keep the lights on in those states. South Australia is already in a parlous state with its ill-founded decision to move towards a wind turbine dominated supply. My good colleague Senator Hume is kind enough to sit here and support me in this contribution. Already Victoria has discontinued or is discontinuing coal-fired power and Victoria will find itself in the same position that South Australia is in today.


I want to draw to attention in relation to this whole question of the offshore gas that is the subject of this bill just how important is the scale of the operations that have been going on offshore WA and in Queensland onshore with the supply being exported from Gladstone. The two big projects of which the Chevron company is the major promoter, Gorgon on Barrow Island and Wheatstone at Exmouth, are together a $100 billion project, part of $200 billion of investment in Australia in LNG. Let me put it into perspective, if I may. In today's dollars the entire Snowy Mountains scheme is $8 billion. We quite rightly are very proud of the Snowy Mountains scheme, the time that was undertaken and the use of people displaced out of Europe. Snowy Mountain is of course a phenomenal project and is even today delivering hydroelectricity for which we should all have enormous hope in the future.


But the Snowy Mountains scheme was an $8 billion project in 2016 dollars. Between them, Gorgon and Wheatstone are a $100 billion project. It is important to reflect on this, for those who seem for some reason or other to be dismissive of LNG and its contribution to the Australian economy. Let me share something with the chamber and with those who might be interested. I mentioned there was $200 billion of investment in LNG. That is a third of all investment coming into this country. In terms of revenue for government, oil and gas production and exploration in 2011-12 put $30 billion into the Australian economy, contributing two per cent. But as we move to being the world's largest exporter of LNG in 2018-19, that figure of $30 billion will increase to $65 billion of revenue by 2020. That represents 3½ per cent of Australia's GDP. 


As for all the allegations that the resources sector does not seem to make its contribution in company taxes et cetera, in 2011-12 the industry paid to the Australian government $8.8 billion in income tax, corporate taxes and resource royalties. But the news gets even better. By 2020—in only three years time—that $8.8 billion paid directly into the Australian economy increases to $12.8 billion; that is nearly $13 billion of income tax, corporate tax and royalties paid into our economy. What does that build? For example, that contribution would build six new state-of-the-art major teaching hospitals in cities or towns around Australia. I am often told, 'It doesn't contribute much by way of jobs.' There have been 103,000 jobs created. I see the minister for resources nodding his head. He now has, on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, the responsibility and the accountability to take that case for industry into this place. Over 100,000 high-paying jobs have been created, principally for Australians. I know of your support, Acting Deputy President Sterle, for the resources sector in our home state of Western Australia. 


But it gets better than that. Yes, it is true that Gorgon, in terms of its establishment and construction, is coming to a close. It has three gas trains. Trains 1 and 2 are up and running now; train 3 will be by the end of this year. I was privileged, along with Mr Gary Gray, Ms Melissa Price from the electorate of Durack and others, to be on Barrow Island for the first shipment of LNG to leave Western Australia from the Gorgon project. At Wheatstone, there are two trains. One of them will be operating in full by the middle of this year; the other one will be by about the middle of next year. What is interesting is that, for the next 40 years, an LNG ship will leave Western Australian waters every 72 hours. 


Yes, it is the case that there is a petroleum resource rent tax. It is designed so that the costs of establishment—the exploration and bringing into production these huge projects—can be accounted for up-front and so that there is encouragement to invest and to continue to invest in this country. Yes, it is the case that there is then a delay in some of the returns to the federal government by way of royalties. But let me make two points. The first is that in Western Australia particularly—I cannot speak with any experience about Queensland—a lot of the gas reserves, whilst they are enormous, are marginal in terms of cost. I hope the minister is taking careful notes. Because they are marginal this is the incentive to go ahead and invest on the North West Shelf—Woodside with Pluto and Chevron with Gorgon and with Wheatstone—and the new facilities offshore: Scarborough and Browse. These are terms with which you are very familiar, Mr Deputy President Sterle.


The other point I want to make is that Australia is a very high-cost location into which investment can be made. Even the Gulf of Mexico is infinitely cheaper than Australia. The South China Sea and offshore Brazil are very attractive locations. I say to my colleagues who are making decisions at this time in terms of the review of the petroleum resource rent tax, 'For heaven's sake, do not bite the hand that feeds you.' I go back to the comment I made a moment ago. With just one company, Chevron, there will be an LNG ship every 72 hours for 40 years. We are all aware of the excellence of the North West Shelf—the work undertaken by Woodside at Rankin and North Rankin and more recently at Pluto. Woodside have the opportunity with Sunrise in the Timor Sea. They have the opportunity on the Browse Basin.


I come now to the outlook for the future and I refer to the new concept of floating LNG. We know of the enormous vessel—the largest vessel ever built by the Shell company in Korea—Shell Prelude. How is the Prelude project different? Shell have combined in the one floating structure their hundreds of years of expertise in shipping, the construction of LNG facilities and the conduct, maintenance and operation of LNG. This will be on their project offshore WA. Where is the excitement for us? This is a world first and it is in our patch. We have followed the rest of the world—Stavanger in Norway, Houston in Texas and Aberdeen in Scotland. This time around we are the first. Australia, Australians and Western Australians have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor in terms of the operation and conduct of the new Shell Prelude project. In the event that it succeeds we will see more floating structures. Why? Because, unlike a fixed structure, if and when supply runs out, you can move that vessel, that whole LNG platform, to a new location and continue well into the future.


How exciting is this in our world? We have the capacity with our TAFE and higher education institutions in WA and indeed nationally to lead the world in this new floating LNG technology. Coming back to the bill that is before us, you can now understand the importance of this place legislating to ensure that, wherever that floating LNG structure is placed, we know in advance what the sharing will be in terms of revenue through royalties to the state and to the federal government.


In the few minutes left available to me I make a plea on behalf of Western Australia. These projects in the Pilbara are a long distance from Perth. We know that the community of WA has to invest heavily in roads, housing, schools and communities to support the people who run and operate these projects. In a scenario in which the royalty income comes back to the federal government for the benefit of all Australians there must be a provision for the people of the state who spend the money so that the overall community of Australia can benefit. That is the critically important point. We must think nationally but we must act locally so that we continue to attract, continue to see and continue to enjoy the benefits that will come to us over many years. 


The final point to be made is that today is the day on which the Woodside company will be launching their first ever LNG-powered PSV—a platform supply vessel—in Fremantle. It is more the pity that we cannot be there to enjoy it. It is the first time in the southern hemisphere. Of course, the big ships that operate backwards and forwards are themselves powered by LNG. It is a good luck story. I support this bill and I commend it to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:50):  I and my colleagues in the chamber will support the second reading of this bill. I will be moving a second reading amendment that I will refer to shortly. We know that the structure of this bill is largely technical in nature. It aims to clarify the apportionment arrangements relating to certain petroleum deposits that straddle state and Commonwealth jurisdictions. That is in schedule 1 of the bill. Also, it aims to ensure the capacity of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, to refund fees paid to it where necessary. I will not go into the technical aspects of that, but these seem like sensible technical amendments.


It does give an important opportunity both at this stage and at the committee stage of this bill to discuss broader issues in terms of the crisis we face in this country in terms of energy security and also the issue of gas suppliers. We know from Manufacturing Australia that what they are paying for gas is just extraordinary. There is a constant debate in this country about whether there should be a gas reservation policy. We know that the Palaszczuk government in Queensland has recently announced changes so that any new leases or tenements need to have a proportion reserved for domestic use. I know that many economists and, I dare say, the minister responsible will say that is the case. I mean that the minister in this place, Senator Canavan, would say that gas reservation does not work, but something has to be done to give security of supply and security in terms of prices and downward pressure on prices for manufacturers in this country and in my home state, where energy prices are sky-high and actually impeding investment in manufacturing and the jobs that are created in the manufacturing sector.


We have already seen since the GFC manufacturing in this country shrink from 12 per cent to just over six per cent of GDP and 200,000 jobs have been lost. We now have a situation in this country where as a percentage of our GDP manufacturing hovering just above six per cent is just bumping above Botswana and Rwanda, two countries in Africa that have never had a manufacturing base like we have had. We have seen a massive shrinking of it, and that has profound implications for our economy. It is a shadow of what Germany's GDP base of manufacturing is: 22 per cent, which is a jobs and industrial powerhouse for Europe.


I am concerned about ensuring that we get the balance right and that communities are heard in terms of CSG explorations. In my home state, on the Limestone Coast it is not CSG but it does involve drilling, and there are genuine concerns about fracking and the impact it can have on prime agricultural land. But there are gas suppliers in this country that do not pose the same environmental and community concerns, and we need to be able to unleash those. That is why I will be moving a second reading amendment in respect of retention leases. I do so to flag the issue. I do not propose to divide on that, but I would be grateful if the minister could indicate views on that. I will in good faith sit down, negotiate and discuss this issue further with Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg in respect of these issues.


This is an issue that relates to having competitive tension in the retention lease approval process. Currently, a company can retain a lease if recovery of petroleum or gas from the licence area is not yet commercially viable but is likely to become viable within 15 years. Every five years a company has to either commercialise the licence area or show that the licence area is still not commercially viable. On the face of it, the current rules are saying 'Use it or lose it,' but if you drill down into this—pun intended—it does not actually do that. It is a pretty weak set of proposals under the current legislative framework. It does not actually require that competitive tension. 


It is my understanding that, under the current regime, there is theoretical competitive tension, in that another company can put forward a development proposal, but in practice there are major impediments to do so. That is because a company cannot get hold of the seismic surveys, the seismic work, that another company may have done, which could have cost many millions of dollars. I think we need to find a way around that. A new company may come in and say: 'We want to develop this gas resource. We will look at the seismic surveys.' They do it commercial-in-confidence. If they end up taking over that lease, they need to contribute fairly to the cost of the seismic surveys done by the previous company. That is a way around the impasse that currently exists. This is something that needs to be dealt with. Currently, a company has to make a binding commercial proposal, but they cannot do so because they cannot access the key information in terms of the seismic surveys and the like. This is the sort of thing that we need to do. 


I do not have the figures in front of me, but if I happen to get a text from my office in the next 30 seconds, it might tell me how much gas is in the Bass Strait. In the Bass Strait, there are leases that a number of major oil companies have had for a number of years. My understanding is that the reserves are very significant. If we could tap those resources, it would, at least for the next few years, make a very big difference to gas prices in this country and to energy security in this country. It would also relieve, to a significant extent, the issue of communities having legitimate concerns about CSG and the impact on prime agricultural land. We do not have the same environmental and community concerns in the Bass Strait, given the history of the Bass Strait and given that it is gas—not petroleum—drilling we are talking about. 


That is something that ought to be considered. That is why I will move the second reading amendment standing in my name, which will be dealt with at the conclusion of the second reading debate of this bill. Even if my amendment is not supported, this issue will not go away. There are too many manufacturers and too many jobs at stake to ignore the gas that is in the Bass Strait. Some local Australian companies would like to get access to that gas and have a go at developing it, but they cannot because the current rules act as a massive barrier.


I am very grateful to my office. Unusually, they are listening to what I am saying! They tell me that there is seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bass Strait. That is a big figure. It is a big figure like the Australia Post CEO's salary! Seven trillion cubic feet is a significant amount of gas that would make a real dent in the issues of energy security, which I know Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg are concerned about. This is a discussion I have had in good faith. I am flagging this amendment, not so much to make a political point but to say that this is an issue that cannot be ignored. 


In relation to Senator Hanson-Young's amendment in respect of drilling in the Great Australian Bight, I and my colleagues will support that amendment. This parliament cannot bind future parliaments, but right now, based on the evidence that I heard at the Senate inquiry that I instigated in the previous parliament, I strongly support what Senator Hanson-Young has proceeded with. The precautionary principle should weigh heavily on our minds. It seems that there are not sufficient safeguards in the current framework. NOPSEMA has made the right call initially, but my concern is that drilling in that area, given the potential risks, is something that we should not countenance. I think an alternative such as accessing that seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bass Strait will make a significant impact on this country's energy security. 


I have had another text from my office, and the caveat is that the figure of seven trillion is a total of the proven, probable and possible. Even allowing for various risk factors in regard to that, there is a hell of a lot of gas in the Bass Strait that could be unleashed. It seems to me that, because of commercial considerations, new entrants cannot have access to that gas under the current rules that are stacked against them. We should have a 'use it or lose it' approach, as they have in other countries. We need to use it, given the crisis that Australian manufacturing has in respect of jobs and in respect of energy prices. That is something that I will prosecute in good faith with Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg because that could be a short- to medium-term solution for the energy problems we are facing in this country.


I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion, add ""but calls on the Government to make further amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to improve competitive tension in the retention lease approval process in order to facilitate the earliest possible commercialisation of the exploration license area and increase the gas supply to the Australian market"".

Senator CANAVAN

 (
Queensland
—
Minister for Resources and Northern Australia
) (
10:00
):  I thank all contributors to this debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill. It is an important, albeit rather technical, change to our offshore regulatory framework. The bill contains amendments which will ensure the ongoing validity of apportionment agreements that are made under section 54 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. These amendments will deal with areas where there may be multiple petroleum pools rather than a single pool.


The apportionment agreements allow for the Commonwealth and state governments, or territory governments, to come to an agreement where a petroleum pool might straddle two jurisdictional areas and allow us to provide certainty, particularly to those investors that may be seeking to develop that resource, so they can understand how we will split the benefits of the resource between investors and the Commonwealth or state and territory governments. These amendments will allow for governments to make these agreements where there may be uncertainty about whether a particular resource is simply a single petroleum pool or may in the future, after further geological information becomes available, in fact be a multiple pool. The bill underscores the government's ongoing commitment to investment in our offshore petroleum sector. It is critical that the legislation is appropriate to encourage that investment, and it is critical that we provide certainty to investors to allow those investments to occur.


I should note that while the Senate committees were looking at this bill there were some questions about the potentially retrospective application of the bill. We have made an addendum to the explanatory memorandum, and returned information to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, to indicate that there will be no detriment because these agreements are entered into on a voluntary basis and, indeed, the only agreement under section 54 at the moment is that relating to the Torosa field, which is why we are moving these amendments in this bill. At this stage, I would like to table the addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The addendum responds to those concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The bill also, in a different schedule, amends the act to ensure that there is a clear regulation making power to support regulations that provide for the refund and remittal of environmental plan levies and safety case levies in certain circumstances. I commend this bill to the chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle

Question negatived.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be now read a second time.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:10):  I moved a second reading amendment calling on the government:


… to make further amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to improve competitive tension in the retention lease approval process in order to facilitate the earliest possible commercialisation of the exploration licence area and increase the gas supply to the Australian market.


That was opposed by the government, but I understand that the minister will set out his reasons. I apologise for the fact that Senator Moore indicated that the opposition was supporting the second reading amendment. I am very grateful for that support. To Senator Moore I say: I didn't hear it. I put that down to the Elvis Costello concert I went to in 1977, where I lost a bit of my hearing and I have never got it back. I am very grateful for the support of the opposition in relation to this, because it is a commonsense second reading amendment. I would be grateful if the government would indicate what its views are on this, because there is particularly in Bass Strait seven trillion cubic feet, potentially, of gas that could really do something to alleviate our energy crisis in this country.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2017-02-08,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:12):  I am happy to clarify the government's position on this. I apologise for not getting the opportunity before the second reading amendment was moved. It is a very important issue that Senator Xenophon has raised, and the government recognises that. We of course did not support your second reading amendment, Senator Xenophon. We do already have a review of our offshore petroleum resource management process in place, which includes and encompasses an examination of the retention lease framework. Consultation on that review was completed late last year, around November. I am working with my department to respond to that sometime this year, and I am more than happy to work with Senator Xenophon on that issue.


It is a very important issue. There is a balance that we need to strike in that framework, a balance that needs to attract investment and give those investors, those companies, security that they will be able to make a return on what are very high costs and very risky investments in exploring frontier areas in sometimes very deep waters. They do need to be given a fair opportunity to make a return on those investments. Otherwise, no-one would turn up to make them. We are not going to have the resource unless someone originally explores for it. While our framework is under review, we have to strike an appropriate balance between the competitive tension that Senator Xenophon and also making it attractive for people to invest here and be able to make a return.


I will respond to a couple of other points that Senator Xenophon raised in his contribution—the specific ones regarding Bass Strait, and also the Great Australian Bight. If I can say respectfully, Senator Xenophon, it is a little disappointing to me that you are trying to have your cake and eat it too in this debate. Yes, there is a substantial resource in Bass Strait; there is no doubt about that. There is a lot of gas left in Bass Strait. What there is not a lot of left, or there is not as much of what was there before, is oil, or condensate. We must not forget that one of the prime reasons that the Gippsland basin was developed was because of that condensate, that oil resource. That was the economics behind the development of the resource. The gas in some senses was a by-product. That has often been the history of gas developments around the world—that gas is often the secondary product that is created from an oil play. That is why gas can often be quite cheap. Manufacturing industries are often located near oil developments where gas is a by-product and a cheap by-product. That is certainly what happened in Victoria historically, and the Victorian manufacturing industry has benefitted from that resource.


The reality right now is that there is not as much oil in the Bass Strait as there once was. So the average costs of developing that resource are now high because there is less of that product to sell and there are fewer products to sell from the development of those resources. The average cost of developing that gas is higher. It is not necessarily the panacea that Senator Xenophon makes out.


While we are looking at our offshore management processes—and I am very open to suggestions to improve competition to develop that resource—it perhaps will not be as easy as Senator Xenophon makes out. The resource is there but, obviously, it comes down to at what cost we can develop that resource and whether that cost can be paid by the gas customers.


That brings me to the Great Australian Bight, which will no doubt come up further in this debate. On Senator Xenophon's point, on one hand you would like to develop the Bass Strait and get that gas out of there but on the other hand you are saying that you want to have a complete ban before even our environmental regulators can look into whether we can develop that resource in an environmentally sustainable way and also protect the manufacturing interests that Senator Xenophon spoke of. I do not doubt your sincerity, Senator Xenophon, in wanting to see a strong manufacturing industry in this country but it does need energy to survive.


There is no doubt there is excitement around the potential resource that exists in the Great Australian Bight. It is a very prospective resource—perhaps one of the best and most prospective in the world. I spoke to Chevron in the United States a few weeks ago and this is one of their top priorities around the world in terms of prospectivity. Again, Senator Xenophon, the reason people are excited about the resource is not the gas; it is the oil that is potentially there. We do not know the resource yet. It needs to be explored. But it will probably be the oil that attracts investment. There will be gas too, no doubt, if there is oil and that gas will then be able to be provided to those manufacturing interests you want to represent.


There is no doubt there are environmental issues. We must seek to protect the Great Australian Bight. That is very important. That is why we have an independent regulator. That is their job. That is why the experts should be left to look at this and assess this. If we were to support the approach from the Australian Greens, which Senator Xenophon says he supports, it would completely cut out the independent regulator from this process and completely stop the potential for jobs and opportunities for the South Australian economy in particular. So the government do not support that approach. We would like to see our resources developed for the benefit of our country, including the manufacturing industries of our nation. That needs to be done in an environmentally sustainable way and in a sensible way that takes expert advice from the people who know what they are talking about. We will balance the issues and interests that we need to to make sure we have both a strong economy and a protected environment.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:18):  Thank you, Minister, for your response. I reject absolutely and vehemently that I am trying to have my cake and eat it too in relation to that. There is a world of difference between the reserves. With the Great Australian Bight prospective oil reserves there is the depth of the drilling that will have to take place, what the seas are like there—how rough they can be—and some of the environmental studies. I know that NOPSEMA has leaked—I know that the regulator has looked at this—the potential environmental impact and the economic effect of that impact on aquiculture and on tourism. The environmental clean-up costs would be quite significant. There is a world of difference between those reserves and the Bass Strait reserves, which are gas. The drilling issues are very different and the depths are quite different. There is a world of difference between those.


The point I was making with the second reading amendment was that a company can say, 'It is not commercially viable for us to develop the Bass Strait reserve,' and they do so because it may not fit in with their global plans, but there could be some other companies, including local Australian companies that I and my office have spoken to, that say, 'We actually want to give this a go but we need access to the seismic surveys.' There is a problem with the current system, and I know that the minister will work on this in good faith and assiduously. If there were an alternative plan and they could have access to the seismic surveys—and there were a mechanism, a formula, for them to pay for those seismic surveys—and they ended up making a successful bid then that would be a game changer in relation to having those other companies having access to those reserves.


I do not want to take it any further than that but there is a distinction between the two reserves and there are risks to the environment. There are the proven and/or probable gas reserves in the Bass Strait and there are risks involved with drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight. I hope we can access that gas in the Bass Strait sooner rather than later because of the impact that will have on industry security, our nation's economy and the manufacturing sector.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:20):  As I suggested, I am happy to work with Senator Xenophon on those specific issues and with specific companies. Certainly my mind has been exercised on these issues. I stress again that there needs to be a balance here. Under the provisions of the act some seismic information is made public at different times to try to help the process Senator Xenophon mentioned, but, as I said, this is always a balancing act that I am happy to work with the senator on.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-02-08,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (10:21):  First of all I would like to clear something up for Hansard. I have just come from the PM's office and I was in a bit of a rush. I should have been voting on this side of the floor. The reason being is I do not agree with this bill, and I am going to tell you why. When you read the two legislative purposes put forward by the government, which are to clarify the apportionment definitions of petroleum deposits and to allow the environmental management authority to refund fees paid to it by big oil and gas companies, on paper it seems simple. However, this legislation will affect hundreds of billions of dollars of capital investment in Australia's LNG export industry and many hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue for Australian taxpayers.


If our LNG industry was healthy, if the Australian taxpayer was getting a fair share of the royalties through the PRRT and if the east coast of Australia, including Tasmania, was not looking at shortages or significant increases in the cost of gas for industries and households then I would be inclined to support the government's legislation. However, there are a number of alarming signs that this government has failed to properly manage our natural resources, especially LNG and petroleum products. The government has put out mixed and contradictory messages on LNG. There are clear signs that our national energy supplies are at risk and, therefore, I do not trust this government's legislation. Until I receive more information from the government about the effects of this legislation and they take steps to ensure our gas, petroleum and other energy sources remain relatively cheap in comparison to our overseas competitors and gas supplies are secured for future generations in Tasmania, I will not support this legislation. 


The Parliamentary Library research brief on this legislation states:


The Commonwealth imposes a profit-based tax, the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), on certain petroleum projects. Section 3 of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 provides that, for the purposes of the PRRT, petroleum from a petroleum pool is taken to be recovered from different jurisdictional areas according to any apportionment agreement made under the OPGGS Act. Items 2 and 3 of Schedule 1 make minor consequential amendments to section 3 of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act, to ensure that apportionment agreements under proposed subsection 54(1E) of the OPGGS Act, which are based on specified parts of the seabed, are also recognised as authoritative under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act.


I would like to speak generally about how our petroleum resource rent tax, the PRRT, which is supposed to collect a fair share of the wealth this nation produces by virtue of our gas and petroleum resources. Unfortunately, it looks as if the system that Australia uses to collect taxes from the big multinationals who make lots of money mining our resources is broken profoundly. I wrote about this problem in my latest newsletter, which I recently sent to Tasmanians, where I said:


Did you know that in 2019 Australia is likely to surpass the Middle East Country of Qatar to become the world's biggest exporter of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG)?


But as one of the world's most trusted news magazines (The Economist) says in November last year, 'The benefits to the (Australian) Government have not been quite as entrancing.' Our Energy Minister in March last year, Mr Josh Frydenberg, forecast that Australia's LNG exports from—


the Northern Territory's—


Gorgon Project alone would be worth $440B to the National economy.


Yet The Economist reveals in its article that the petroleum resources rent tax … is forecast to fall from $1.2B in 2014-15 to $800m in 2020!


You and I, indeed all ordinary Australians - own the mineral and oil wealth that's under and in Australian soil. Our State and Federal Governments manage our natural resources on our behalf and future generations' behalf. Where's all the profit from our gas, minerals and oil going?


It is not going back into our kids. It is not going back into our health.


According to The Economist magazine and a study by the International Transport Workers' Federation suggests that 'Governments of rival exporters such as QATAR, Malaysia and Nigeria, received two or three times as much revenue as Australia in 2014, as a proportion of the value for gas produced.'


In the words of Donald Trump – ""this is a lousy deal."" Not only should our Governments collect a fairer share of the wealth generated by our natural resources – all Australians, as owners of our natural resources, should enjoy some of the cheapest natural gas, electricity, fuel and power prices in the world.


Australia's been blessed—


my goodness, haven't we been blessed!—


with enough natural resources to provide free power to all our aged pensioners. And yet as soon as the issue of budget repair comes up – politicians want to sink the boot into our aged pensioners, while ignoring the obvious places for financial reform and budget repair.


Our new energy minister, Mr Josh Frydenberg, has spoken eloquently on this legislation's debate in the other place, where he said:


These new projects combined represent around $200 billion in capital investment and will deliver significant economic and employment benefits over their multi-decade lives.


They will see Australia's LNG exports more than triple from 25 million tonnes per annum in 2014-15 to around 75.2 million tonnes per annum in 2020-21, making Australia the world's largest LNG exporter.


Before I give any support for government legislation relating to Australia's LNG exports, Minister Frydenberg has to more than just boast about making Australia the world's largest LNG exporter. He and his Liberal mates have to explain why they have allowed such generous LNG deals to be signed with big multinationals. There is no use in being the world's largest exporter when we have become the world's largest soft touch on LNG, and our grandchildren are being denied hundreds of billions in royalty and tax payments, which are instead lining the pockets of overseas corporate executives and their shareholders.


Why is it that credible studies reported in The Economist indicate that the governments of Qatar, Malaysia and Nigeria, who all have similar quantities of LNG exports, are receiving two or three times more in petroleum taxes or royalties than Australia is? Do the politicians and government bureaucrats who sign us up to those dud LNG deals do an Andrew Robb and go and get plum jobs with the people they were negotiating with, as soon as they retire from politics? Did those big multinational companies that were given sweetheart deals, most likely by both major political parties in this place, give big political donations to the Labor, Liberal and National parties? The LNG deals this country has entered into in the last two decades need close scrutiny, with the questions I have asked in mind. Perhaps it is time for a Senate committee inquiry, because I want to know why our kids are missing out on these profits, especially when you have the incredible situation of a Liberal energy minister boasting in his second reading speech:


… Australia's LNG exports more than triple from 25 million tonnes per annum in 2014-15 to around 75.2 million tonnes per annum in 2020-21, making Australia the world's largest LNG exporter.


At the same time, the ABC reported in December last year that the Liberal industry minister, Greg Hunt, will meet with Australia's energy executives to discuss a looming gas shortage credited for job losses and spiralling consumer costs. He then tries to blame the domestic shortage of gas in Australia on fracking bans that some states have placed on onshore gas mining activities—give me a break! Do you think we are a pack of idiots out there? Everyone knows it is the Liberal government's policy of selling all our gas to overseas markets, without ensuring we have enough gas for domestic use, that has caused the domestic gas shortage crisis that will cripple Australian business. Another report in The Australian, also in December last year, said:


Manufacturing Australia chairman Mark Chellew, who has called for 'urgent' action in response to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission report into the east coast gas market released earlier this year, said the sector faced an 'alarming' set of circumstances.


'My view is that this is the greatest public policy failure since federation,' he said. 'The significant problem is that Australia has allowed its gas to be sold offshore without significant gas being available for the domestic economy. That, coupled with our renewable energy target has led to electricity prices spiking and very, very high natural gas prices.'


Mr Chellew warned the problem was set to become significantly worse, with new supply contracts potentially needing to be met by imported gas in only two years' time.


National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union Daniel Walton said the idea of a national gas shortage was 'pure garbage' and renewed calls for a domestic gas reservation policy.


'We have plenty of gas already for both our own needs and for export. The only problem is we've allowed multinational gas exporters to completely set the terms,' …


'Australia gets the world's worst deal from multinational gas exporters: no special access to our own gas and pathetic tax revenue.'


And that is where we are at.


If we are going to be serious about securing our gas security, we must put in place a domestic gas reserve policy of at least 20 per cent and possibly more. That would be another great question a Senate committee could look at when examining the state of our LNG industry—does Australia need a gas reserve policy and at what level should it be set at? We should look at the lessons from America, which made a gas reserve policy of 100 per cent after the GFC. It had the impact of driving down the cost of energy by a factor of three in America, which then threw a lifeline to the manufacturing industry. That, along with robotics and innovation, has led the resurgence in America's economy and caused a growth in its jobs and national wealth. But it all started with an American gas reserve policy of 100 per cent, which forced down energy prices following the GFC and gave conventional energy security for America.


I know that the Prime Minister and his Liberal colleagues understand why we need energy security and why we need the cheapest possible energy prices in the OECD at the very least and in the world at best. Last week I put out a public statement in which I welcomed parts of Prime Minister Turnbull's National Press Club speech, especially his prediction that electricity prices and energy security will be the defining political issues in the year ahead. That was two years and five months after I made my first Senate speech, which indicated that energy security and prices should influence all Australian political decision-making. On Wednesday, 3 September 2014, I told the Senate, in my first speech, with regard energy power:


In this place as a senator I will do my best to vote in and protect Tasmania's and Australia's best interests. In order to help determine what is in my state's and nation's best interests, I will ask this simple question: how will this legislation or proposal affect our food security, water security, energy security, national security and job security?


In a deregulated world and free-trade economic environment, if we are to create national wealth, generate more high-tech jobs and protect Australian workers' wages then the only solution is for our governments to deliver the cheapest electricity and power in the world to our pensioners, families, industry and entrepreneurs.


I am glad that Prime Minister Turnbull has, on energy at least, finally seen the light and begun to understand the strong link between Australian standards of living, business innovation, economic prosperity, job growth and energy cost security. Eventually, if he continues on this course, the PM will realise that our stupid RET system has artificially increased Australia's energy costs by $3 billion a year and wrecked our nation's energy security while destroying business innovation, economic prosperity, job growth and living standards, with no benefit to the environment. No-one in their right mind could ever say that forcing our businesses, families and pensioners to artificially pay more for their power in comparison with our international competitors will ever stop global climate change.


As I mentioned before, this bill makes amendments to the regulation of offshore petroleum. Some of the gas and oil is under the control of the states and some is under the control of the federal government. It is very easy to get confused who owns what, and the Parliamentary Library has cleared that confusion up through a report they gave me.


In closing, I note that item 3 proposes to insert subsection 688C(1)(a) to provide a clear power for the government to make regulations to provide for remittals or refunds to big business of part of the environmental plan levy. Given that the government has already given sweetheart deals to the larger energy companies that will benefit generously from extracting oil and gas from Australia's many well-endowed gas and oil basins, I have grave reservations in supporting legislation which makes it easier for the government to give more money back to the multinationals.


Indeed, I will not be agreeing to the government's legislation, which makes it easier for the government to give even more money back to the multinationals while they justify cuts to aged pensioners and family benefits and payments as so-called budget repair. It is rubbish. Those pensioners and families are also owners. We are all owners of Australia's natural resources, which this government has failed to manage wisely. As a result, it is aged pensioners and working families who are supposed to miss out on entitlements—well, not on my watch. I oppose this legislation for the reasons I have outlined, and I look forward to speaking with the government. Do you have a response?

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2017-02-08,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:36):  I thank Senator Lambie for her contribution. There is a lot in what Senator Lambie said that I agree with completely. She spoke about the need for our nation to secure its energy resources, to provide cheaper energy to households and pensioners and also to industry and businesses so they can be competitive and provide jobs. In terms of our objectives of what we want, we and Senator Lambie are very much of one mind. But I would like to talk about a few points Senator Lambie has raised.


You mentioned how this legislation helps solve these problems, and that is the core issue; you have hit the nail on the head on that: how will this legislation help us solve these energy issues? Well, it is not a panacea, and I am not here and the government is not here to say that this is the solution for all issues. It is a relatively technical and small change to our framework that will give certainty to investors coming here to develop these resources.


Where I absolutely agree is that we need to encourage more gas supply in our nation; we need to develop gas so that those manufacturers, the energy providers, can continue to provide energy to our country in a cheap and affordable way, and we have traditionally been given those God given resources that Senator Lambie mentioned. So, when investors come here and there is a resource and there is uncertainty about whether it comes under state laws or state jurisdiction or Commonwealth jurisdiction, unless we can make clear to them where the dividing lines are and how we will coordinate between state and Commonwealth governments, clearly those investors will be warded away or at least be less likely to come here to our country.


This bill simply provides clarity for those investors and helps ensure that Commonwealth and state governments can come to agreements to make that happen. So, as I mentioned earlier, while there are elements of this bill that will be retrospective, it relates only to one agreement so far under section 54, which relates to the Tarosa fields in the Browse Basin, where there is this uncertainty between Commonwealth and state governments. And that is retrospectivity. It will not cause detriment, because, indeed, that agreement was made with the expectation that we would be making these changes to legislation to clarify these issues.


On the other specific point Senator Lambie made, about refunds and remittals, this is a practice that the government has already done, where either environmental plans or safety cases do not proceed or there is some withdrawal such that we refund or remit the levies in those cases. We are making sure that those powers do exist, and we are also ensuring, in the case of environmental levies, where those refunds have been paid in the past, that they are valid. In the explanatory memorandum we explained that the total amount of those refunds adds up to $500,000 over the time—it was a few years back, but I could get you the date, Senator Lambie, if you need it. But it is not an enormous amount of money in the context of the PRRT that we do raise, as you say.


That brings me just briefly to the other points, which are beyond the scope of this bill. But on the issues you raised about the PRRT, I hear what you are saying, and the government hears these issues and concerns. That is why, just before Christmas, we announced a review into the PRRT framework. You are right: it is our resource, and we need to maximise it and ensure that we get the maximum benefit to all Australians from that resource. At the same time, we need to attract people to come here and invest. You mentioned some other countries, like Malaysia and Qatar. In many of those other nations, governments themselves develop their resources. They have government-owned companies which develop their resources. That is why they have different arrangements and different returns. They take on the risks of that development and they potentially get the returns as well. We do not do that here; we seek for the private sector to develop those resources, and over the past few years that has certainly accorded us well, treated us well, because many of these investments have experienced cost blowouts and they will not make the returns perhaps that the original investors would have thought. We will still have the development and have the jobs, but if we had been making those investments it would have been Australian taxpayers on the hook for those losses.


Those losses, and the oil price falls, have certainly impacted the prospects for the government to receive its petroleum resource rent tax. It is a profits based tax, so it is calculated waiting for profit to accumulate. That is why it takes some years for the capital of a big project like Gorgon to be paid back, and then the government will take its share of the profits. That is the system we have had in this country going back to the 1980s, and it was recently extended by the former Gillard Labor government to onshore gas resources as well.


Notwithstanding that, we are genuinely, in good faith, conducting a review to ensure that we do have the greatest return to Australians from that resource. I hope and am willing to work with you, Senator Lambie, through that review on the legitimate issues you have raised. I understand your concerns, but I would just implore you that the specific provisions we are changing in the act here, in this bill, will help encourage, in a small way, investment in our energy sector. And they are important, and that is why they should be supported.

 (Tasmania) (10:42):  First of all, you probably need to look at your priorities, okay? We do not have a gas reserve policy here in Australia, and we are about to hit a crisis down on the east coast which is going to cost gas users a lot more money. How do you explain that? Where are your priorities? Should you have not looked at a gas reserve policy and started to put legislation through on that first, before looking after your mates? That is exactly what you are doing.

  That would be wonderful. And what I want to know is whether you have any intentions, and your time line, of putting in a gas reserve policy in this country.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2017-02-08,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:42):  We have no plans to produce a gas reserve policy in this country, for a couple of reasons. One is that we need to make sure we attract investment in our energy resource. But where we do agree, Senator Lambie, is that we need more gas. We need to develop more gas. And I would be concerned that restricting the market for that gas only restricts the returns or the profitability of that development and then potentially limits and reduces investments. So, we need to be very careful about going down that path.


You mentioned the United States. Well, the United States does not have a gas reservation policy. What it does have is a large domestic market which has traditionally soaked up all the gas that has been developed in the United States. It is in fact, right now, building LNG terminals on its south coast, and very soon it will be a major exporter of LNG into possibly our region, the Asia-Pacific region, from its resources. You are right that they have been able to tap and extract relatively low-cost resources. They have not faced the same moratoriums or bans we have in this country and various state governments have allowed the development, and that has allowed them to get costs down, to get to a scale that has been very competitive. I am not sure whether you were in the chamber earlier when Senator Xenophon was contributing, but it is also the case that a lot of their shale gas or shale resources also produce a fair amount of tight oil and a wet resource as well, which helps them lower their costs and become more competitive. The coal seam gas we have developed in this country so far does not have those oil resources partnered with it, so, generally speaking, it is of a higher average cost.


We are seeking the same objective, Senator Lambie, but a gas reservation policy, I think, requires very careful consideration. The Western Australian government has had such a policy for some time; it does not seem to have greatly increased the amount of domestic gas available in that state. I think we can look at other ways and better ways, particularly the unnecessary and illogical moratorium on even conventional gas that is coming into the Victorian parliament. That is what we should focus on; that is most prospective; and that is where we can get a solution to this issue.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (10:45): You think we can call it a gas reserve policy, but I desperately want to make sure that this is quite clear on Hansard: the United States banned the export of LNG; they did that back in 2009. So it is a reserve ban. I will re-ask the question: does the country intend to ban 20 per cent, 30 per cent? Are you looking at a ban or putting a reserve on our gas being exported?

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:45):  We have no intention, as I mentioned, of introducing such a gas reservation policy. We have been very successful in this country in developing our gas resources, where state and/or Commonwealth governments—if they are in offshore waters—have allowed that resource to be developed. In Queensland, where I am from, we have attracted record amounts of investment in the LNG industry and in the other part of the country where the chair is from there has been even greater investment in offshore resources. 


But, of course, where state governments decide they will not develop the resource at all and no-one can come in or where we have senators in this place seeking to ban the development of offshore areas like the Great Australian Bight—that will ward off investment. That will turn away investment and we will not have the resource developed and we will not have the gas for our manufacturing sector that you and I both want. That is what we should be focused on. We need to be focused on unlocking the supply, not seeking to send it in a certain direction. We need to be unlocking the incentives for people to invest in that supply, not putting on state-wide bans, which even ban conventional gas developments—conventional gas techniques which have been around for decades, if not centuries. That is illogical and is harming our manufacturing interests in this country. That is something we do not support; we think it is counterproductive. I do not think the reservation policy that Senator Lambie has put forward is a solution to those issues.

My second point is this: do you support a price on the volume of gas rather than on profit—basically, instead of taxing them on profit, will you do it on volume?

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2017-02-08,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:48):  As I mentioned in my comments on the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, that is a profits-based tax that has been around since the 1980s. We are looking at that tax at the moment and doing a review; and so it would be inappropriate for me to forecast or to suggest right now what changes we would make. Suffice to say, any move to a volume-based tax would not necessarily achieve what we want. Of course, a volume-based tax would simply be on the production and have no relation to the profit that is received on a particular development. It could potentially harm particularly marginal developments—but if those developments that might not make a lot of profit—very unfairly and choke off the very investment that we want to achieve. 


It is generally felt that a tax based on profits is more efficient. That is why the Commonwealth government moved to this regime in the 1980s and that is why the former Gillard Labor government extended that to onshore areas a few years ago. That regime means that we take our share once there are profits there and that, of course, helps encourage private investors to come here knowing that they can make a profit and a return, which they legitimately should be allowed to do, and then just pay a share back to the Commonwealth government. There are whole lot of details about how that tax system and regime work, notwithstanding the general idea that a profits-based tax is the best way forward. That is what this review is looking at. I am happy to engage the senator with this review and on those particular details.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (10:50):  The review is being handled by the Treasury department and I do not have the details of exactly what they have engaged in so far. It was announced just before Christmas—I believe in the last sitting week we were here. They have issued a discussion paper—is that the term?—or certainly an initial scoping paper and they are seeking submissions right now. As I said to Senator Lambie, I am happy to engage with her about that. While I do not wish to predict the outcomes from that, there has been a regime in place in this country based on profits-based tax for some time. We can disagree, Senator Lambie, about the success or lack of success, but we have attracted some of the world's biggest capital investment projects in this nation under that regime. The Gorgon development is one of the world's biggest capital projects which is going on right now. The Inpex project in Darwin likewise is one of the biggest in the world. These generate enormous amounts of investment for our country and they have created tens of thousands of jobs for people across Australia—particularly for areas in Northern Australia, it has been game changing. 


While we need to do better to get gas into southern markets, those issues are largely related to the state governments not allowing the development of their resource. Whereas in Northern Australia, the Western Australian government, the Queensland government and the Northern Territory government have welcomed the gas industry with open arms. They have said, 'Let's come here and invest here.' Guess what? By being open, by being accommodating and by facilitating investment, you get investment. That is what has happened. If we had that attitude in southern Australia, I think we might have different outcomes. It has been a success attracting those major investments. They are hugely important to Senator Back's area, to my own state and to Senator Scullion's territory as well. That is a major success for our country that we should be very proud of.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (10:52):  I want to pick up on the current debate that is being had here between the minister and Senator Lambie. Firstly, I want to point out that one of the biggest concerns that the Australian Greens have with this bill and the reason we are moving the amendments that were circulated in the committee stage is that we fundamentally believe that the Liberal Party, the coalition, and the Labor Party have been bought by these big oil and gas companies. We know they have been bought because these companies keep handing over thousands and thousands of dollars in election donations. One of the donations that was revealed last week was made by Chevron—a big multinational foreign company that wants to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight. Chevron gave $8,800 to the South Australian Labor Party a week before the Senate committee looking into mining and drilling for oil in the Great Australian Bight met. One week before that hearing, the Labor Party received thousands of dollars worth of donations from Chevron. Then only the day after that inquiry, guess who received the next lot of donations? The Liberal Party. Chevron gave another $8,800 to the South Australian Liberal Party. 




Senator LAMBIE:
  Oh dear! 




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Join the dots. This is dirty money playing a role in dirty politics. You have a bill before this chamber today that is all about setting up the regulatory framework that the big oil and gas mining companies desperately want. It is about setting up the regulatory system that they want, retrospectively. They have bought favour with both of the major parties, and it is at the cost of the Australian community. We now have lobbyists running around this place, knocking on the doors of ministers and shadow ministers, saying, 'Oh please, let us start drilling for oil in what is meant to be a marine protected area, a Commonwealth marine protected area, in the Great Australian Bight.' The public is rightly worried that the money being donated by these massive big oil and gas companies is having influence over the policy decisions of both the major parties. 


The example of Chevron connected directly to the time frames of Senate investigation and inquiry and, I must say, questions from senators in this place to Chevron, who were basically asking Chevron to sit in a Senate hearing and tell the world how wonderful they are. If that is not cash for comment, what is it? Chevron's cash for comment is what we saw in the Senate hearing: $8,800 and then another $8,800 to the state parties; $15,000 to the federal Labor Party; and $11,000 to the federal Nationals. This big multinational company is buying favour with Australian political parties to get the policies they want. The Australian public are sick of it. Dirty money leads to dirty politics. Our democracy is not for sale, people! Our democracy means that is a place where policies are debated on merit, debates are had with integrity, and members of parliament stand for what they say, not because someone has paid them. 


South Australians in particular are very concerned about what is potentially listed for the Great Australian Bight. We know that the risks are huge. They have not been mitigated. There is not even a proper response plan from these big companies, who just want to come in and drill for oil in the middle of a whale sanctuary: big profits for them; big risk for South Australians. It is putting our tourism industry at risk and our fishing industry at risk and providing no jobs for South Australians. The jobs are going to be imported from overseas. 




Senator Canavan:
  What a load of rubbish!




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  The companies have said, black and white, that they cannot guarantee any real job creation in South Australia as a result of this proposal. But I tell you what: the fishing industry and the tourism industry are scared. What if there is an oil spill? What happens to our clean, green tourism reputation in South Australia if a spill occurs? Don't say, 'Oh, it can't possibly happen.' We saw what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. It will not just be a spill in the Great Australian Bight, which is one of the roughest parts of the sea in the world. The modelling shows it will spread further than just the South Australian coast. It will hit Victoria. It will hit Tasmania. It could even possibly get up to the New South Wales east coast. This is the evidence that has been presented, yet here in this place today rather than us having a discussion about how we keep these companies more accountable, we are rolling over. We have the Labor Party and the Liberal Party, the government here, rolling over and saying: 'Oh, you want changes to the regulatory framework. Oh, you need it done retrospectively? Oh, yes, that's right, you did donate to our election campaign—how many years in a row?' That is what is going on here. 


Giant multinational oil companies should never been given permits to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight, especially considering the lack of foresight, transparency and planning that has been presented. All of this is being done behind closed doors. Only last week we found out that big amounts of cash were being handed to both the government, the coalition, and the Labor Party. No wonder Chevron think they are on a winner here. Chevron's cash for comment. That is what we have seen in the last few months, folks, and this bill is no exception. On that note, Chair, I refer to the official amendments on sheet 7956 and seek leave to move those amendments.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (10:59):  The Labor Party are not supporting the Greens amendments, and we have made that clear, but we could not let the previous comments made by Senator Hanson-Young in this debate go without some response. This is not a debate about political donations, Senator Hanson-Young.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  No, but it should be. You're both as bad as each other.




Senator MOORE:
  You must have got the agenda wrong. You must have found the wrong place to make yet another personal attack on other parties. We want a debate—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  It's just a bit of a coincidence—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Senator Moore, resume your seat. Senator Moore will be heard in silence, and I ask that you direct your comments through the chair.




Senator MOORE:
  We are, as you all know in this place, more than happy to have a debate on the issue of political donations, and our policy is really clear. But Senator Hanson-Young comes in here in a debate about a bill around offshore petroleum and strongly puts her case in terms of the environmental issues. She has every right to make those arguments, and I have no doubt we will listen to them just as we will in the Senate inquiry—those things will be before the inquiry. But to colour this debate by making statements about publicly declared donations to the parties and then to draw that inference just to get a quick point in this debate does not value the issues about which we are talking.


I am not going to go down the long discussed history of who gets what from whom in political processes in this place. We have heard a lot about who has received large donations from which companies and from which individuals. There is a time to have that debate. But again, rather than looking at the key issues of this particular debate, which is what we are looking at, we have had it taken aside just for a cheap line, and I think it has been heard by a number of people. Linking one company to cash for comment does not progress the debate. So we will put on record that we are not supporting the amendments. We are more than happy for the debate to continue. We want to ensure that there is effective processing of environmental concerns when looking at our energy future in this nation. But yelling abuse across this chamber will not achieve that and will just ensure that, again, the real issues are not considered.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Minister for Resources and Northern Australia) (11:02):  I indicate that the government will also not be supporting Senator Hanson-Young's amendments. I also find her suggestions objectionable and contemptible. To say that individual senators before a committee are influenced by those sorts of things, you would think you would have some evidence, Senator Hanson-Young, apart from just these slurs and suggestions you put out there. Let's be clear what Senator Hanson-Young is suggesting.




Senator Hanson-Young:
  You wouldn't want anyone to know, would you?




Senator Moore:
  It's public.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Back
):  Order!




Senator CANAVAN:
  She is suggesting not only that some donations affect individual senators, but she is going on to make the allegation that we will develop a resource, the Great Australian Bight, because of some donation to a political party, when she well knows that those decisions on developing the Great Australian Bight are made by an independent regulator, by independent public servants with expertise in these areas. So she is also slurring those public servants, who are reputable individuals who do their job, day in, day out, and do not deserve the slurs from individual senators that Senator Hanson-Young is subjecting them to. Surely it is enough, Senator Hanson-Young, as Senator Moore said eloquently, for all of us to debate these issues on the substance and the merits, which we can do with those officials. We can debate with those officials and disagree with them, but I think it is contemptible to impugn motives to public servants who are just doing their job and cannot be in here to defend themselves on those allegations in that way. So I utterly reject those suggestions from Senator Hanson-Young.


As Senator Moore said, we could side track here and go into a whole debate about how many donations the Greens get from different individuals and different organisations and do the same thing, but that would be a complete distraction, because the issues before us here are quite simple, quite technical and do not relate to the Great Australian Bight, which Senator Hanson-Young's amendment does. That brings me to your amendment, Senator Hanson-Young, and we reject that for similar reasons. We reject that because we have an independent regulator here that is established to look at these things. They should be allowed to do their job. I love how the Greens, when a certain umpire calls a decision in their favour, use the authority of that particular organisation to buttress their claims and say, 'Such-and-such has said this, so therefore you can't do that.' But when an independent umpire says something different to what the Greens expect or want, they will disagree with it. You cannot have it both ways. We have a very robust environmental regulatory framework in this country. It will seriously look at all of the matters that Senator Hanson-Young has put forward, and it was doing that. As Senator Hanson-Young knows, BP are not progressing with their environmental plan. But the regulator will, for future companies involved in the Great Australian Bight, look at these things seriously.


As I said in response to Senator Xenophon, the Australian government would very much like to develop the resources in the Great Australian Bight. They have potential to be game-changing for our nation to secure our nation's energy needs. It is what we need. We do not produce a lot of oil in this country—as you know, Senator Hanson-Young—and it is an issue for us to respond to. The Great Australian Bight has the prospect—just the prospect—that it could help solve those issues. So those developments are very exciting for our country and should be exciting for South Australian senators because they are a major resource for your state and could be a game changer for it—it certainly needs something to develop its economy. But that is in the future. We need to step through those environmental plans properly, which we will do. We have a very robust framework in this country with a very good record on both safety and environmental matters. We stand behind that framework, and we certainly defend the integrity of those public servants that operate it for us.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:06):  Can I just intervene on this matter? I have been sitting here quietly waiting for the next bill to come along but I do really think it is important to repudiate the assertion that Labor senators would be influenced by an $8,000 contribution from a company—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  Prove that you didn't. It seems pretty dirty to me. Prove it.




Senator KIM CARR:
  and this would be described, as the senator has just done, as 'dirty money'. I think it has to be stated unequivocally that Labor senators' integrity should not be challenged in that way, and such a suggestion should be repudiated in the most forceful terms. I am particularly impressed by the Greens' gall in these matters; they have more front than Myer when it comes to the question of donations. Up until recently the largest single individual donation was actually received by the Greens. I know Malcolm Turnbull has changed the rules in that regard with his $1.75 million donation. But on several occasions now Mr Graeme Wood has been the largest single donor in this nation's history—to the Greens.


When it comes to the question of Chevron, let me make it very clear, because the Greens have been trying to campaign on this question for some time—in regard to the CSIRO; in regard to the development of Bass Strait. I support the development of our resources, particularly given how significant the development of those resources is to the future prosperity of this nation and to millions of blue-collar workers across this country. The CSIRO is engaged in research, properly, ethically, and in accordance with the most strict guidelines to ensure that information is publicly available and is not compromised because of that investment by Chevron. It is an appropriate use of public resources to establish where our resources actually are and what the questions are in regard to the strictest environmental standards necessary to exploit them. The suggestion that somehow or other and $8,000 donation changes the dynamic in that regard is preposterous, and I suggest to you that to challenge the integrity of the Labor senators on that basis is totally out of order.

On top of that, both of you have been doing dud deals between yourselves for years—dud deals in taking political donations. And you do not think the Australian people are wondering why they should vote for you? If you were half-serious about political donations you would be putting them up live. If you get them one day and that cheque is cleared then get them up there and show the people. You do not wait 18 months or 12 months. If you were half serious about showing that you are all clear in this matter, then get them up there live and let the Australian people decide whether or not you are being paid by cheque book or whether you are actually doing it for them and their future.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (09:31):  I am delighted to continue my comments on this bill and to draw to the chamber's attention that it is always easy in 2017 to say, 'The North West Shelf is there. Gorgon, Wheatstone and Ichthys are there. The Queensland projects are there.' They were not always there.


I draw attention to the chamber that back in the 1970s Sir Charles Court, the absolute dynamo of Western Australia and Australian industry, negotiated with the federal government that there be a fairer sharing of the royalties and the income that would come from the possibility of a North West Shelf. Remember, Woodside had made no investment. There was a prospectivity but there was no wealth. It is easy in this year to look back and say, 'Look how much money we have all made out of it,' and, 'We're rushing towards being the world's biggest exporter of LNG,' but in the 1970s there was nothing there. A huge risk was taken. Quite correctly, Sir Charles Court said to the Prime Minister of the day, 'We in Western Australia are going to take the risks. We're going to be doing the work. You will enjoy the royalty benefit of the LNG that might come'—might come!—'from the success of a North West Shelf.' As a result of that, a decision was taken at the time that should there be any gas and condensate found there would be no tax at all to the company on condensate to give them an incentive. That was done so that in the possibility of there being some success from that exploration they would at least have a motivation and an incentive. As we know, along came Prime Minister Rudd, and he put paid to what had been a long-established principle.


The importance of this bill before us is that it takes into account the sharing of royalty income between the Commonwealth government and the state, or states. As we know, on the seabed hydrocarbons move. They might be in state waters. If they are within or around an island they may be in Commonwealth waters. As extraction takes place the hydrocarbons move. This is part of the reason for the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill coming before us.


I am delighted that Senator Moore yesterday courteously supported this bill on behalf of her party. She made some very good points about resources and their contribution, and about the efforts in Western Australia of the member for the Pilbara, Mr Grylls, who would be absolutely torpedoing future investment—in that case in the iron ore industry—as a result of ill-founded and poorly thought out claims made for his own cheap, political advantage.


As a result of the efforts of Charles Court and others the decision was taken at that time that there should be some preference for domestic gas supply. Why would that be? Simply because at that time the risk was on the people of Western Australia. Charles Court negotiated what was called a take or pay agreement—in other words, should Woodside proceed and should they find gas, then there would be an automatic market for that gas. At that time, of course—as I know myself—in WA there was no reticulated supply of gas. So the people of Western Australia and indeed Alcoa, the aluminium company themselves, took an undertaking that they would purchase in advance significant proportions of that natural gas. So today we have a scenario in place in WA where at least 15 per cent of all new LNG supply is guaranteed for domestic gas.


Mr President, I would humbly request through you that I have some silence or at least quiet if that is possible.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes. Could I just invite all senators if they are holding conversations and if they do not need to be in the chamber to hold those conversations outside the chamber so that we can hear Senator Back in silence. It is disruptive.




Senator BACK:
  Thank you very much. I would have liked to have contributed to how the UN went from my time in 2013. Maybe we can continue that discussion at a later stage.


I was just concluding on the observation that in Western Australia now, as a result of the risk taken by the Western Australian community through the then-Premier Charles Court, that the risk associated with the development of North West Shelf Gas was taken by the people of WA and Alcoa. Of course, today it is wonderful. We have a Pilbara to Bunbury gas pipeline. Gas is reticulated everywhere. If states like Victoria and South Australia and Queensland do not get their act together in terms of gas exploration and extraction, there is already talk of there being huge storage facilities either offshore Victoria or on land to provide gas for Victoria from elsewhere. I had a discussion recently with our new ambassador to Japan, the Hon. Richard Court, son of Sir Charles. He and I discussed the prospect of whether there could indeed be a gas pipeline across the Nullarbor so that we could supply these other states who seem to be most intransigent when it comes to guaranteeing a supply of product that will guarantee to keep the lights on in those states. South Australia is already in a parlous state with its ill-founded decision to move towards a wind turbine dominated supply. My good colleague Senator Hume is kind enough to sit here and support me in this contribution. Already Victoria has discontinued or is discontinuing coal-fired power and Victoria will find itself in the same position that South Australia is in today.


I want to draw to attention in relation to this whole question of the offshore gas that is the subject of this bill just how important is the scale of the operations that have been going on offshore WA and in Queensland onshore with the supply being exported from Gladstone. The two big projects of which the Chevron company is the major promoter, Gorgon on Barrow Island and Wheatstone at Exmouth, are together a $100 billion project, part of $200 billion of investment in Australia in LNG. Let me put it into perspective, if I may. In today's dollars the entire Snowy Mountains scheme is $8 billion. We quite rightly are very proud of the Snowy Mountains scheme, the time that was undertaken and the use of people displaced out of Europe. Snowy Mountain is of course a phenomenal project and is even today delivering hydroelectricity for which we should all have enormous hope in the future.


But the Snowy Mountains scheme was an $8 billion project in 2016 dollars. Between them, Gorgon and Wheatstone are a $100 billion project. It is important to reflect on this, for those who seem for some reason or other to be dismissive of LNG and its contribution to the Australian economy. Let me share something with the chamber and with those who might be interested. I mentioned there was $200 billion of investment in LNG. That is a third of all investment coming into this country. In terms of revenue for government, oil and gas production and exploration in 2011-12 put $30 billion into the Australian economy, contributing two per cent. But as we move to being the world's largest exporter of LNG in 2018-19, that figure of $30 billion will increase to $65 billion of revenue by 2020. That represents 3½ per cent of Australia's GDP. 


As for all the allegations that the resources sector does not seem to make its contribution in company taxes et cetera, in 2011-12 the industry paid to the Australian government $8.8 billion in income tax, corporate taxes and resource royalties. But the news gets even better. By 2020—in only three years time—that $8.8 billion paid directly into the Australian economy increases to $12.8 billion; that is nearly $13 billion of income tax, corporate tax and royalties paid into our economy. What does that build? For example, that contribution would build six new state-of-the-art major teaching hospitals in cities or towns around Australia. I am often told, 'It doesn't contribute much by way of jobs.' There have been 103,000 jobs created. I see the minister for resources nodding his head. He now has, on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, the responsibility and the accountability to take that case for industry into this place. Over 100,000 high-paying jobs have been created, principally for Australians. I know of your support, Acting Deputy President Sterle, for the resources sector in our home state of Western Australia. 


But it gets better than that. Yes, it is true that Gorgon, in terms of its establishment and construction, is coming to a close. It has three gas trains. Trains 1 and 2 are up and running now; train 3 will be by the end of this year. I was privileged, along with Mr Gary Gray, Ms Melissa Price from the electorate of Durack and others, to be on Barrow Island for the first shipment of LNG to leave Western Australia from the Gorgon project. At Wheatstone, there are two trains. One of them will be operating in full by the middle of this year; the other one will be by about the middle of next year. What is interesting is that, for the next 40 years, an LNG ship will leave Western Australian waters every 72 hours. 


Yes, it is the case that there is a petroleum resource rent tax. It is designed so that the costs of establishment—the exploration and bringing into production these huge projects—can be accounted for up-front and so that there is encouragement to invest and to continue to invest in this country. Yes, it is the case that there is then a delay in some of the returns to the federal government by way of royalties. But let me make two points. The first is that in Western Australia particularly—I cannot speak with any experience about Queensland—a lot of the gas reserves, whilst they are enormous, are marginal in terms of cost. I hope the minister is taking careful notes. Because they are marginal this is the incentive to go ahead and invest on the North West Shelf—Woodside with Pluto and Chevron with Gorgon and with Wheatstone—and the new facilities offshore: Scarborough and Browse. These are terms with which you are very familiar, Mr Deputy President Sterle.


The other point I want to make is that Australia is a very high-cost location into which investment can be made. Even the Gulf of Mexico is infinitely cheaper than Australia. The South China Sea and offshore Brazil are very attractive locations. I say to my colleagues who are making decisions at this time in terms of the review of the petroleum resource rent tax, 'For heaven's sake, do not bite the hand that feeds you.' I go back to the comment I made a moment ago. With just one company, Chevron, there will be an LNG ship every 72 hours for 40 years. We are all aware of the excellence of the North West Shelf—the work undertaken by Woodside at Rankin and North Rankin and more recently at Pluto. Woodside have the opportunity with Sunrise in the Timor Sea. They have the opportunity on the Browse Basin.


I come now to the outlook for the future and I refer to the new concept of floating LNG. We know of the enormous vessel—the largest vessel ever built by the Shell company in Korea—Shell Prelude. How is the Prelude project different? Shell have combined in the one floating structure their hundreds of years of expertise in shipping, the construction of LNG facilities and the conduct, maintenance and operation of LNG. This will be on their project offshore WA. Where is the excitement for us? This is a world first and it is in our patch. We have followed the rest of the world—Stavanger in Norway, Houston in Texas and Aberdeen in Scotland. This time around we are the first. Australia, Australians and Western Australians have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor in terms of the operation and conduct of the new Shell Prelude project. In the event that it succeeds we will see more floating structures. Why? Because, unlike a fixed structure, if and when supply runs out, you can move that vessel, that whole LNG platform, to a new location and continue well into the future.


How exciting is this in our world? We have the capacity with our TAFE and higher education institutions in WA and indeed nationally to lead the world in this new floating LNG technology. Coming back to the bill that is before us, you can now understand the importance of this place legislating to ensure that, wherever that floating LNG structure is placed, we know in advance what the sharing will be in terms of revenue through royalties to the state and to the federal government.


In the few minutes left available to me I make a plea on behalf of Western Australia. These projects in the Pilbara are a long distance from Perth. We know that the community of WA has to invest heavily in roads, housing, schools and communities to support the people who run and operate these projects. In a scenario in which the royalty income comes back to the federal government for the benefit of all Australians there must be a provision for the people of the state who spend the money so that the overall community of Australia can benefit. That is the critically important point. We must think nationally but we must act locally so that we continue to attract, continue to see and continue to enjoy the benefits that will come to us over many years. 


The final point to be made is that today is the day on which the Woodside company will be launching their first ever LNG-powered PSV—a platform supply vessel—in Fremantle. It is more the pity that we cannot be there to enjoy it. It is the first time in the southern hemisphere. Of course, the big ships that operate backwards and forwards are themselves powered by LNG. It is a good luck story. I support this bill and I commend it to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:50):  I and my colleagues in the chamber will support the second reading of this bill. I will be moving a second reading amendment that I will refer to shortly. We know that the structure of this bill is largely technical in nature. It aims to clarify the apportionment arrangements relating to certain petroleum deposits that straddle state and Commonwealth jurisdictions. That is in schedule 1 of the bill. Also, it aims to ensure the capacity of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, to refund fees paid to it where necessary. I will not go into the technical aspects of that, but these seem like sensible technical amendments.


It does give an important opportunity both at this stage and at the committee stage of this bill to discuss broader issues in terms of the crisis we face in this country in terms of energy security and also the issue of gas suppliers. We know from Manufacturing Australia that what they are paying for gas is just extraordinary. There is a constant debate in this country about whether there should be a gas reservation policy. We know that the Palaszczuk government in Queensland has recently announced changes so that any new leases or tenements need to have a proportion reserved for domestic use. I know that many economists and, I dare say, the minister responsible will say that is the case. I mean that the minister in this place, Senator Canavan, would say that gas reservation does not work, but something has to be done to give security of supply and security in terms of prices and downward pressure on prices for manufacturers in this country and in my home state, where energy prices are sky-high and actually impeding investment in manufacturing and the jobs that are created in the manufacturing sector.


We have already seen since the GFC manufacturing in this country shrink from 12 per cent to just over six per cent of GDP and 200,000 jobs have been lost. We now have a situation in this country where as a percentage of our GDP manufacturing hovering just above six per cent is just bumping above Botswana and Rwanda, two countries in Africa that have never had a manufacturing base like we have had. We have seen a massive shrinking of it, and that has profound implications for our economy. It is a shadow of what Germany's GDP base of manufacturing is: 22 per cent, which is a jobs and industrial powerhouse for Europe.


I am concerned about ensuring that we get the balance right and that communities are heard in terms of CSG explorations. In my home state, on the Limestone Coast it is not CSG but it does involve drilling, and there are genuine concerns about fracking and the impact it can have on prime agricultural land. But there are gas suppliers in this country that do not pose the same environmental and community concerns, and we need to be able to unleash those. That is why I will be moving a second reading amendment in respect of retention leases. I do so to flag the issue. I do not propose to divide on that, but I would be grateful if the minister could indicate views on that. I will in good faith sit down, negotiate and discuss this issue further with Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg in respect of these issues.


This is an issue that relates to having competitive tension in the retention lease approval process. Currently, a company can retain a lease if recovery of petroleum or gas from the licence area is not yet commercially viable but is likely to become viable within 15 years. Every five years a company has to either commercialise the licence area or show that the licence area is still not commercially viable. On the face of it, the current rules are saying 'Use it or lose it,' but if you drill down into this—pun intended—it does not actually do that. It is a pretty weak set of proposals under the current legislative framework. It does not actually require that competitive tension. 


It is my understanding that, under the current regime, there is theoretical competitive tension, in that another company can put forward a development proposal, but in practice there are major impediments to do so. That is because a company cannot get hold of the seismic surveys, the seismic work, that another company may have done, which could have cost many millions of dollars. I think we need to find a way around that. A new company may come in and say: 'We want to develop this gas resource. We will look at the seismic surveys.' They do it commercial-in-confidence. If they end up taking over that lease, they need to contribute fairly to the cost of the seismic surveys done by the previous company. That is a way around the impasse that currently exists. This is something that needs to be dealt with. Currently, a company has to make a binding commercial proposal, but they cannot do so because they cannot access the key information in terms of the seismic surveys and the like. This is the sort of thing that we need to do. 


I do not have the figures in front of me, but if I happen to get a text from my office in the next 30 seconds, it might tell me how much gas is in the Bass Strait. In the Bass Strait, there are leases that a number of major oil companies have had for a number of years. My understanding is that the reserves are very significant. If we could tap those resources, it would, at least for the next few years, make a very big difference to gas prices in this country and to energy security in this country. It would also relieve, to a significant extent, the issue of communities having legitimate concerns about CSG and the impact on prime agricultural land. We do not have the same environmental and community concerns in the Bass Strait, given the history of the Bass Strait and given that it is gas—not petroleum—drilling we are talking about. 


That is something that ought to be considered. That is why I will move the second reading amendment standing in my name, which will be dealt with at the conclusion of the second reading debate of this bill. Even if my amendment is not supported, this issue will not go away. There are too many manufacturers and too many jobs at stake to ignore the gas that is in the Bass Strait. Some local Australian companies would like to get access to that gas and have a go at developing it, but they cannot because the current rules act as a massive barrier.


I am very grateful to my office. Unusually, they are listening to what I am saying! They tell me that there is seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bass Strait. That is a big figure. It is a big figure like the Australia Post CEO's salary! Seven trillion cubic feet is a significant amount of gas that would make a real dent in the issues of energy security, which I know Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg are concerned about. This is a discussion I have had in good faith. I am flagging this amendment, not so much to make a political point but to say that this is an issue that cannot be ignored. 


In relation to Senator Hanson-Young's amendment in respect of drilling in the Great Australian Bight, I and my colleagues will support that amendment. This parliament cannot bind future parliaments, but right now, based on the evidence that I heard at the Senate inquiry that I instigated in the previous parliament, I strongly support what Senator Hanson-Young has proceeded with. The precautionary principle should weigh heavily on our minds. It seems that there are not sufficient safeguards in the current framework. NOPSEMA has made the right call initially, but my concern is that drilling in that area, given the potential risks, is something that we should not countenance. I think an alternative such as accessing that seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Bass Strait will make a significant impact on this country's energy security. 


I have had another text from my office, and the caveat is that the figure of seven trillion is a total of the proven, probable and possible. Even allowing for various risk factors in regard to that, there is a hell of a lot of gas in the Bass Strait that could be unleashed. It seems to me that, because of commercial considerations, new entrants cannot have access to that gas under the current rules that are stacked against them. We should have a 'use it or lose it' approach, as they have in other countries. We need to use it, given the crisis that Australian manufacturing has in respect of jobs and in respect of energy prices. That is something that I will prosecute in good faith with Minister Canavan and Minister Frydenberg because that could be a short- to medium-term solution for the energy problems we are facing in this country.


I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:


At the end of the motion, add ""but calls on the Government to make further amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to improve competitive tension in the retention lease approval process in order to facilitate the earliest possible commercialisation of the exploration license area and increase the gas supply to the Australian market"".

Senator CANAVAN

 (
Queensland
—
Minister for Resources and Northern Australia
) (
10:00
):  I thank all contributors to this debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill. It is an important, albeit rather technical, change to our offshore regulatory framework. The bill contains amendments which will ensure the ongoing validity of apportionment agreements that are made under section 54 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act. These amendments will deal with areas where there may be multiple petroleum pools rather than a single pool.


The apportionment agreements allow for the Commonwealth and state governments, or territory governments, to come to an agreement where a petroleum pool might straddle two jurisdictional areas and allow us to provide certainty, particularly to those investors that may be seeking to develop that resource, so they can understand how we will split the benefits of the resource between investors and the Commonwealth or state and territory governments. These amendments will allow for governments to make these agreements where there may be uncertainty about whether a particular resource is simply a single petroleum pool or may in the future, after further geological information becomes available, in fact be a multiple pool. The bill underscores the government's ongoing commitment to investment in our offshore petroleum sector. It is critical that the legislation is appropriate to encourage that investment, and it is critical that we provide certainty to investors to allow those investments to occur.


I should note that while the Senate committees were looking at this bill there were some questions about the potentially retrospective application of the bill. We have made an addendum to the explanatory memorandum, and returned information to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, to indicate that there will be no detriment because these agreements are entered into on a voluntary basis and, indeed, the only agreement under section 54 at the moment is that relating to the Torosa field, which is why we are moving these amendments in this bill. At this stage, I would like to table the addendum to the explanatory memorandum relating to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The addendum responds to those concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The bill also, in a different schedule, amends the act to ensure that there is a clear regulation making power to support regulations that provide for the refund and remittal of environmental plan levies and safety case levies in certain circumstances. I commend this bill to the chamber.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:26):  Labor supports this Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016 because it provides certainty for industry that safe harbour provisions under Australian Consumer Law are aligned with new country of origin labelling requirements. This will help protect enterprises, particularly Australian food manufacturers, make claims under the new mandatory labelling requirements that came into effect on 1 July 2016. This issue called for a bipartisanship approach in taking steps to resolve a longstanding problem, and that is what has happened. That said, sometimes on the way to this resolution we in the opposition have been bemused by the antics of some members of the government, especially the Deputy Prime Minister. 


The basic problem these reforms address was set out clearly in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry, tabled in October 2014. The committee recommended that labelling standards should be changed to make it easier for consumers to identify the sources of food products and the places where they are processed—the perfectly reasonable proposition that people know where their food has come from. The wording on many labels, 'Made in Australia using local and imported ingredients', clearly did not do that. 


As senators will remember, however, what actually spurred the government into action was a food contamination scare in February 2015, after the report had been received. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services announced that two brands of frozen berries sold in supermarkets had been linked to multiple cases of hepatitis A. The company that produced both brands obtained its berries from Chile and China, and processed them in China's Shandong province. Pictures emerged of excrement-clogged factories in Shandong, and in the subsequent media frenzy and consumer panic the careful wording of the Victorian announcement was usually ignored.


What the Victorian department said was that ingesting frozen berries was the only common link between the hepatitis cases. It did not claim that ingesting contaminated berries had caused all the cases. This fine distinction vanished completely when the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, the agriculture minister, Mr Joyce, and the then industry minister, Mr Macfarlane, called a media conference. They announced that a working party of ministers would consider the House of Representatives' report on food labelling. Mr Joyce blithely ignored the fact that the report had been presented to the government before the contamination scare, without being acted upon. He said, 'It's great to be part of a government that's actually going to do something.' On Channel 9's Today program he spoke more directly to the fears that the contaminated berries scare had aroused in consumers. He said, 'Buy Australian and save yourself a pain in the guts.'


Labor agrees that the best way of ensuring that packaged food is of acceptable quality is to buy Australian. I do it for a lot of other reasons as well—that is why I have been wearing this 'Made in Australia' badge for many, many years. We in the Labor Party have supported the adoption of the new system of food labels. It must be acknowledged that there are still other issues to be resolved, some of which have been raised in the original House of Representatives report. The gold kangaroo in a green triangle, above a filled-in or partly filled-in gold bar code, can tell consumers how much, if any, of the product has been grown and processed in Australia. This kind of labelling does not provide information about anywhere else the product might have come from. If the new system had applied at the time of the frozen berries scare, consumers would have been none the wiser about the origin of the berries that became a matter of contention. Nonetheless, the system is better than what it replaced, because when the Government was not diverted by trying to score points on this issue, as it did during the berries scare and again in the election campaign, it has actually done the right thing. It consulted stakeholders in the food industry and the state and territory governments. That is what we urged the governments to do when we offered support for the reform of food labelling in February last year. 


The bill now before the Senate, like the new labelling requirements that came into force in July, is a result of those consultations. The new labelling requirements have been endorsed by state ministers for consumer affairs, the Food and Grocery Council, AUSVEG, the National Farmers' Federation and the consumer advocacy group Choice. These bodies have also supported the present bill, which alters the 'safe harbour' provisions of the Australian consumer law for businesses making country-of-origin claims. Safe harbour provisions are intended to give businesses certainty about the claims they can make without infringing consumer law. If a business makes a country-of-origin claim for its product, and that claim is alleged to be false or deceptive, the business has an automatic defence if it can show that the product meets the conditions laid down in the safe-harbour provisions.


Under the existing law, for a business to rely on this protection either the goods have to be substantially transformed in the place that is claimed as the country of origin or at least 50 per cent of the total costs of production must have occurred in that country. This bill strengthens the safe-harbour protections for food products by declaring the meaning of 'substantial transformation.' It removes the 50 per cent cost of production test, which is redundant now that food labels show the proportion of Australian ingredients. These are sensible changes that complement the new labelling system.


Labor continues to support this reform process, but we remind the government that the process of reform does not end with this bill. The government could go further and give full consideration to the bipartisan House of Representatives report that was originally tabled in 2014. We also urge the government to end its neglect of biosecurity and of Australia's manufacturing sector, of which food processing is such an important part, especially in regional areas.


Buying Australian will always be the best way for consumers to have confidence in the quality of food products. The maintenance of a vigorous manufacturing sector is the best way of ensuring that Australians will have high-skill, high-wage jobs and that the economy becomes less reliant on the vagaries of commodity exports.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-02-08,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:34):  I rise today to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. The Greens have been leading the way on country-of-origin labelling law for years. We want to see labelling laws that work for Australians—that work for Australian farmers, manufacturers and consumers. Since 1998 we have been working with the industry to develop our proposal to make country-of-origin labelling mandatory for all packaged and unpackaged food sold in Australia. The Greens' proposal since that time would simplify country-of-origin labels to three basic claims: something has to be either made in Australia, grown in Australia or manufactured in Australia. 


We want to encourage companies to highlight any significant local ingredients. This bill does not do that, but it does go some way to simplifying the system that we currently have. That is important, because we know that Australians want to do the right thing when they are buying their food. When they are standing there in the supermarket aisle and trying to choose between this tin of tomatoes and that one, they want to be able to know what it means. When we are at the supermarket and see 'made in Australia from local and imported ingredients', no wonder many of us feel confused. To make an informed choice the community needs clear information about where their food is coming from. How much of the product is local? Was it all made in Australia, and does that change depending on what season it is made in? 


The amendments that we are discussing today are primarily intended to simplify the tests used to justify claims like 'made in' by clarifying what 'substantial transformation' means and removing the confusing 50 per cent production cost test, which becomes redundant for food products with the introduction of labels showing the percentage of Australian ingredients. This legislation is putting in place a system so that if a business makes a country-of-origin claim for a product and it is alleged to be misleading, deceptive or false, that business has an automatic defence to the allegation if it can show that the product meets the safe harbour defence for that claim. The bill also creates a new safe harbour defence for products labelled in accordance with information standards, so that businesses can have more certainty about the labelling they can make without breaking the law. So, as far as these changes go, we support the legislation before the chamber today. However, I would like to quickly mention the important work of the Australian Greens on country-of-origin labelling and the ongoing fight for transparency and the consumer right to know, particularly in regard to food and agriculture products. Clearer food labelling is good for public health, the environment and local farmers. It gives them the extra tool to enable them to compete in our globalised marketplace. The Greens recognise that food-labelling laws should not be dictated by global food and beverage giants or the big corporations in the city. If you are a local Australian farmer working with your local co-op, you do not have the clout or power that those global corporations have. But that does not mean that your concerns should be considered to be less significant than the claims that are being put by the global manufacturers.


If we are better informed about where our food is coming from, we can trust that it is going to be top-quality produce that we know we can rely on from Australian food producers. We can be clear about where internationally sourced ingredients have come from so that you can make an informed choice. You can decide that, no, you do not want to be buying produce from somewhere that you are a bit suspicious of. You can make the choice and say, 'No. I would prefer to pay that little bit extra'—to be supporting Australian farmers, to be supporting food production that you know is being well regulated and manufactured, with food being grown in a sustainable way. You know you can be supporting that farm production where you can be sure that there can be a spotlight on it, if required, to make sure it is being done in a sustainable and healthy way.


Having good country of origin labelling will also encourage people to consume more fresh produce. By thinking more about the origins of the food, we automatically eat in a way that is healthier and more ethical. So, again, if you are deciding about a cheap tin of tomatoes that you have suspicions about because of where it has come from, you can decide maybe it would be better to buy the fresh tomatoes that you know have come from the market garden only tens of kilometres away. You know that you can have more confidence in the health and sustainability of how that food is being produced.


Also, by giving consumers information about where their food has come from and by encouraging locally produced produce to be squarely compared with other produce, it means it is much more likely that consumers are going to decide that, yes, it is worth paying what may be just a little bit extra to buy that Australian produce. That means it is going to be contributing to reducing the pollution that causes global warming. If we are buying more locally produced produce we are not flying ingredients and food from the other side of the world and paying the transport costs involved in that. Having really good food labelling helps us to better understand how far our food ingredients have travelled to our plates.


One of the examples I often use is: when I am buying lentils and you have two packets of lentils on the shelves and you have to get out your glasses to look at the difference between these lentils. With the lentils grown in Canada, I think, 'Fine. Terrific. People in Canada, go ahead and eat those lentils.' For people in the US, it would be appropriate to eat those lentils. If, on the other hand, you look the next little bit along the shelf and you have exactly the same product that is made in Australia, I will always go for that made-in-Australia product. For those sorts of choices, by giving information to consumers, you have the ability to be really supporting our local food-growing industries. So our farmers and our food producers will be the beneficiaries then of that strong, local demand.


This bill is a step in the right direction, but clearly there is further to go to make sure that our food is labelled clearly and more efficiently. As well as supporting this bill before the house today, we call on our colleagues to support the Greens plan for country-of-origin labelling so that we can create more sustainable local jobs and allow everybody to make more informed choices about choosing the food that they eat.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (11:42):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. This bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, altering country-of-origin labelling and safe harbour provisions under Australia consumer law. The main change that this bill makes is for the labels for most food that is grown, produced or made in Australia to include a logo—a kangaroo in a triangle symbol—as well as a bar chart and text statement to show the proportion of Australian ingredients. Australians are entitled to know exactly where their food comes from. Labor supports this amendment. Buying Australian is the best way to secure quality food. Labor remains willing to work with Mr Turnbull and his colleagues to improve our country-of-origin labelling requirements.


However, perhaps the Liberals should think more broadly about their neglect of biosecurity and Australian manufacturing, which is putting jobs at risk and taking our economy backwards. Come to think of it, this is not the only thing going backwards under this government. 2017 began for Malcolm Turnbull much the same as 2016 ended, with scandal, humiliation, disappointment and division. After what was a pretty unimpressive year, I think it is fair to say that Mr Turnbull and his Liberals really needed to put their tails between their legs and hit the reset button over the summer break. And there has been more. Of course, we had Senator Bernardi defecting from his government, the Liberal Party, yesterday. But here we are in the first parliamentary sitting week of 2017 and the government is still fumbling around, unable to figure out where they stand, what they stand for and which way is up. To be fair, there are some people out there who were inclined to cut Mr Turnbull some slack last year. He was finding his feet after limping across the 2016 election finish line, but it has been almost 18 months now since the Prime Minister knifed Mr Abbott in the back. Enough is enough. If Malcolm Turnbull has anything resembling a policy agenda or a plan for 2017, now would be a really good time to tell us about it.




Senator Smith:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President: government senators are generally very generous to Senator Polley when she makes contributions in the Senate, but we are talking about the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016, which is a government bill, and I encourage the senator to come back to the issue before the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Smith. I am listening very carefully, and Senator Polley is addressing aspects of the bill.




Senator POLLEY:
  After a very, very mediocre 2016, you would think that Mr Turnbull would have kicked off 2017 with a new agenda, a plan—a first draft, even. But, unfortunately, this was not the case. Mr Turnbull addressed the Press Club last Wednesday, and things just seemed to go from bad to worse for the Prime Minister after that speech, culminating, as we know, with Senator Bernardi defecting from the Liberal Party yesterday. So the circus continues.


I have to say it is a good thing for Mr Turnbull that there is not an election this year, because, having achieved so little since becoming Prime Minister, most of us are scratching our heads wondering what the point of this government is and what the good reason was for sending us to a double dissolution at the last election. We are all still wondering that. Support for Mr Turnbull's government is freefalling, their popularity is slipping, and I personally think that one good reason for that is that they are so out of touch. We know that everything they touch is stuffed up, so how can we rely on them to handle even a piece of legislation like this? In stark contrast to Labor, the Liberals have kicked off this year with no direction, no plan and, above all, no narrative. Mr Turnbull has said over and over that his government is a government of the 21st century, that it is agile and innovative and that there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian, but the only thing that resonates with people in Australia—particularly in my home state of Tasmania—the thing that they are utterly disappointed with, is this dithering and dysfunctional government. Mr Turnbull is a Prime Minister who gave hope to so many in the community, but there are so many people now who are utterly disappointed.




Senator Smith:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President: I challenge Senator Polley to mention the words 'competition', 'consumer' or 'country of origin bill' just once in her contribution. She is a quarter of the way through now.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Smith. Senator Polley has indeed mentioned the bill. I am sure she is putting in some background and will get to the point, but I remind senators that they need to speak about the bill before us.




Senator POLLEY:
  I am speaking about the bill and—as you said, Deputy President—I am putting it in the context of a government that is so out of touch and so dysfunctional. I know that this is a veiled attempt from those on the other side to give Mr Turnbull some cover. As I said in my speech last night, I am ashamed to sit in this chamber with a government that has attacked some of the most vulnerable people in the community—the people who this government has been hurting most in this country over the last summer period, with the dysfunction of the Centrelink robo-debt recovery crisis and the fact that this government is putting ordinary, everyday Australians who need a helping hand into the hands of debt collectors.



Senator Smith interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  Then they came in here last night—and now we have them interjecting—trying to say that we support the rorting of Centrelink. There is nothing further from the truth, and that is such an insult to everyone in this chamber. There is not an Australian—except those who may be caught rorting—who does not believe that only those people who deserve to get Centrelink payments should have access to them. But, no, they continued to send out letters to innocent Australians—and we know, and the government are now very much aware, that 40 per cent of those letters were inaccurate. I spoke last night about the Tasmanians who have been caught up in this dysfunctional government's shambolic attempt to rein back money from those people who can least afford it. Once your name is on the debt collectors' database, it is extremely difficult to have it removed. 




Senator Payne:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President: the chamber has a number of conventions by which it is expected senators might operate. Call me conservative and old-fashioned perhaps, but speaking to the subject of the bill at hand, which relates to country-of-origin labelling, is hardly an unreasonable expectation. Senator Polley is not speaking in relation to the country-of-origin bill, in any way, shape or form, and I seek that you draw her attention to that and ask her to respond in relation to the bill.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister. Senator Polley, I am sure that you are going to get back to the bill. You started off on the bill and I am sure you are heading back to the bill.




Senator POLLEY:
  I think it is very important that the Australian people be made aware of the significant dysfunction of this government, so, therefore, it does not really matter what legislation comes before—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The minister on a point of order.




Senator Payne:
  Madam Deputy President, as you would be aware, ample opportunity for senators to engage in that sort of debate in this chamber is given throughout the day. This is a debate on a particular bill in relation to country-of-origin labelling. Senators are expected to be relevant to the bill in front of the chamber. The senator is not, in any way, shape or form, being relevant to the bill, and I seek your support to ensure that she is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister, you have made your point—as has the whip—on a number of occasions. I spoke to Senator Polley, as you heard. She was back on her feet for about two seconds before you intervened again.




Senator POLLEY:
  This government is starkly out of touch with the community and has no plans for the future. We have a Prime Minister who has no vision and no economic plan whatsoever, but the government does not want to hear about it. The Australian people already know; what I am trying to do is put context into the legislation that is before us. We have these scandals that have been perpetrated by those on that side of the chamber. One of their colleagues, Senator Bernardi—who came into this Senate chamber at the same time as I did, in the 2005 class—obviously has little confidence in this government being able to bring any sort of legislation through this chamber.


But I do not want to be distracted from the issues that are confronting the Australian people and the fact that the government have failed to address the issues that have been raised with them in relation to the robo-debt system, with 170,000 letters and notices having gone out to everyday Australians. They do not want to hear about that, but I am going to continue, because, Madam Deputy President, you very well know that in the past those opposite have spoken many times on pieces of legislation and given context to the government's inability to govern this country. The government's shambolic system has wrongly targeted a 76-year-old Queenslander—




Senator Payne:
  Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The senator is directly flouting your request to her to return to the legislation, which is of course undermining your authority in the chair.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will determine whether my authority is being undermined, thank you, Minister. Senator Whish-Wilson?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Madam Deputy President, I might be able to add some information to this point of order. Seven minutes ago Senator Polley tweeted, 'About to speak in the Senate about the Turnbull government's shocking start to the year.' That is quite amazing considering she is 10 minutes into a speech, but I think she has put on public record that she is not speaking about the matter at hand.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. Senator Polley, please continue your remarks, but if you could be more focused on the bill everyone in the chamber would appreciate that.




Senator POLLEY:
  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy President. Yes, it is an important piece of legislation that has come before us and it is a start in terms of the government being able to work with those in this chamber to bring about these changes. There is no doubt that, just as there has been a debacle over the Centrelink robo-debt issue, consumers are concerned about the origin of the food they are consuming. When we are talking about the quality of food and having global recognition for clean, green produce, there is no better place to represent this country than my home state of Tasmania. 


I understand that the government are a bit twitchy and a bit concerned that anyone might be critical of them. Not only with respect to this piece of legislation but also from the agenda on today's Order of Business, we can see that the government are struggling. In anticipation of other people wanting to make a contribution to this debate, I will conclude my remarks.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith?




Senator Smith:
  Madam Deputy President, I cannot help myself: it is worth noting that the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill accounted for less than one minute of Senator Polley's 12-minute speech.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:55):  I indicate my support for the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. This has really been a long and winding road. Back in 2008, in my first few months in the Senate, I managed to convince my then colleague Senator Bob Brown, the Leader of the Australian Greens, and Senator Barnaby Joyce from the Nationals to co-sponsor a bill on truth in country-of-origin labelling. We produced a minority report—it was effectively a dissenting report—when the major parties effectively said, 'We don't want to go down this path.' I think it says something about the nature of the issue when you can have both the Greens and the Nationals on a unity ticket co-sponsoring legislation, co-writing a minority report about the need for truth in labelling in this country. It has been a long time coming, but we have seen some real improvements in the system. However, I believe there is scope for more significant improvements, and I will speak to amendments in relation to that. 


It is very clear that Australians want to buy Australian. In fact, a survey published in The Sydney Morning Herald a couple of days ago indicated overwhelmingly that Australians favour Australian made goods, things made here in Australia, and that sentiment is even stronger when it comes to the food that we eat. Multiple surveys have shown that Australians want to buy Australian products, products which use ingredients grown in Australia and which contribute to the Australian economy through jobs and the clean, green produce that Australia is so justifiably famous for. We know this through surveys going back many years. Back in 2005 an Auspoll survey found that 97 per cent of Australians wanted to have clear information on the country of origin of their foodstuffs. A 2009 survey found that 82.5 per cent of supermarket shoppers checked most of the time whether their foodstuffs, including fruit and vegetables, were Australian in origin. In other words, consumers are aware of this. We must have clear, simple, straightforward country-of-origin labelling laws so that consumers can make an informed choice when they are rushing through the supermarket. If they have toddlers or other children with them and they are in a mad rush, they want to get in and out of the supermarket, but they want to be able to make an informed choice as easily as possible. 


I also think it is important to put into perspective that the 50 per cent production cost test, the substantial transformation test, has inherently been a failure. You can claim a product was made in Australia even though the majority of ingredients could have come from overseas. I am very grateful to my friend and constituent Ron Gray, a former citrus grower from Loxton in the Riverland, who has been a tireless campaigner on the issue of food labelling and the impact that poor food labelling has had on the citrus industry, which has shrunk over the years rather than expanded, as it should have, with so much of our citrus juice coming from Brazilian concentrate. Ron Gray made the point that the laws were actually killing off the citrus industry. You could have a fruit juice with 70 per cent Brazilian concentrate and a minority of Australian juice and you add the water and do the packaging, and that easily passes the 50 per cent substantial transformation test—and that is a disgrace. Ron Gray told me not so long ago, as he was winding up his citrus production in Loxton, that he sent fruit to a processing plant in Mildura across the border. The money he received for that fruit barely covered the cost of the transport. In other words, he got a zero net return for his fruit. That is a disgrace, and I hope this bill goes some way to rectifying it.


We know that in 2012, the inquiry by Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector, chaired by former senator, Senator Colbeck, showed a number of anomalies that occur with food labelling in this country. Seafood labelling is an issue that is particularly prone to abuse. There are serious concerns about our current labelling regime, which allow foreign imports to be classified as 'Made in Australia'.


In its submission to this bill, the Australian Made Campaign Limited stated that overall it 'supports the removal of the 50 per cent cost test'. However, it noted some concerns that 'it may result in adverse consequences for some Australian suppliers of inputs'. It noted:


This will occur where a manufacturer opts to source cheaper inputs offshore, knowing that it will not affect their capacity to make a Made in Australia claim. An example of this is a manufacturer of soft gel capsules who currently purchases gelatin from an Australian manufacturer because it assists them to meet the 50 per cent threshold. The local packaging industry may also be impacted adversely by this change.


These are issues that ought to be fairly raised in the committee stages of this bill.


This issue was recognised in the committee report, and I think there is a need for greater guidance as to what does or does not constitute substantial transformation. The committee noted the concerns of the AMCL and that there was currently no mechanism by which manufacturers could obtain a definitive answer regarding country-of-origin claims and that this could result in companies being hesitant to make a claim for fear that competitors would challenge its validity. Whilst not making a submission on this bill, the consumer group CHOICE stated:


Unfortunately, the new system looks less useful for consumers wanting information about any of the 195 countries that are not Australia. For example, claims such as 'Made in Australia from imported ingredients' will still have you wondering where your food comes from …


That is one of the big flaws of this bill.


It is also important to ensure there is a mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims. There is no such mechanism in the current bill. It is something that needs to be prosecuted or explored in the committee stages. I will be moving a second reading amendment standing in my name, which adds, at the end of the motion, 'but the Senate calls on the government to undertake an analysis of the benefits of establishing an administrative mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims'. If we do not do that, this bill will only to half a job. It will be nowhere near as effective as it ought to be to give the truth in labelling and to give certainty to our food manufacturing sector.


We are seeing the decimation of manufacturing jobs in this country. In our auto sector, when Holden closes down on 20 October in South Australia and when Toyota closes down at about the same time and as car makers close down in Victoria, there will be tens of thousands of jobs lost. We need to have a plan B, and the food-processing sector has enormous potential to absorb a significant number of those job losses. It is also important, in the definition of 'substantial transformation', that we have an administrative mechanism similar to what exists in the United States, which will give manufacturers the ability to obtain a ruling on country-of-origin claims. That is something that, as I said, with the second reading amendment, needs to be explored.


I believe that this bill, on balance, does advance the issue of certainty in food labelling, but there is one other issue that I raised in my additional comments to this bill. There ought to be a mechanism for manufacturers to regularly disclose the percentage and country of origin of specific ingredients to the department of industry, for publication on its website. A lot of manufacturers will say, 'We can't do this. It's too complex. It's too difficult because we have to change our labels all the time.' There is a thing called the internet. If they are required to publish online to the department so that, every six months, consumers can establish exactly what the percentage of whatever ingredients are in there is from Australia or elsewhere then that will empower consumers. It will also give a lot of useful information to the media that can be publicised about which manufacturers are making every possible effort to deal with these issues. That is why I will be moving an amendment in that regard. If there is political will, it can and should be done to really strengthen the framework of this bill.


There is one final issue I wish to raise—that is, the Food Standards Amendment (Fish Labelling) Bill 2015. Senator Lambie famously kissed a barramundi—




Senator Lambie:
  It was very sweet!




Senator XENOPHON:
  a very sweet barramundi, in the context of raising awareness of that bill—as well as the awareness of a number of other crossbenchers! This bill relates to the labelling of seafood products. What is interesting is that if you buy seafood in a supermarket, it tells you which country it comes from. But if you buy seafood that has been cooked and prepared in the fish and chip shop or restaurant right next to the supermarket, you have no idea where it comes from; there is no requirement to label it.


The Northern Territory moved on this a number of years ago and it has been a great success. It has boosted jobs in the Territory, and we heard in evidence to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee that literally thousands of jobs will be created in our agriculture and seafood industries if this bill will—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You could say who brought it into the supermarkets.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I think that was the coalition. Was that you?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Well, I am not looking for personal praise.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I will acknowledge Senator Macdonald's passionate advocacy for the seafood sector.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I will sing my own praises later!




Senator XENOPHON:
  He will sing his own praises—I am sure I wouldn't do justice for him!


What is interesting here is that it was a unanimous decision of the committee. It was a decision of crossbenchers, of the coalition and of the opposition to support this law. They actually said that we should just get on with it. The committee recommended that, with the bill being passed into law, the Commonwealth encourage the states and territories to comply with and enforce the revised standard.


This bill does not deal with that. It is something I have had discussions on with the Deputy Prime Minister, with the relevant minister and with Minister Nash. And I have been very disappointed that it has not been advanced. So, that is another reform that needs to be brought about.


With those comments, I support this bill, but I urge my colleagues to seriously consider the amendment for greater transparency every six months—which would not carry an unreasonable administrative burden—to get a commitment from the government to actually advance this, because if it does not then I think you will find that consumers will still feel that they are not getting the information they deserve. That is why this bill is so important, particularly in the context of Australians wanting to know what they are eating and where it comes from and also in the context of the impact it has on Australian jobs and our food processing sector and on Australian agriculture.


I move the second reading amendment standing in my name, which I foreshadowed in relation to the issue of standards and getting appropriate rulings from an administrative mechanism for food manufacturers:


At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate calls on the Government to undertake an analysis of the benefits of establishing an administrative mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on Country of Origin Labelling claims"".

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-02-08,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:08):  I rise to briefly speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016 and in doing so I ask the same question everyone else is asking: why has this legislation taken so long, and why is it still incomplete to the standard it is required to be at? This is a classic example of why this parliament needs to better prioritise the legislative agenda and why Australia's media should report on the issues that are really important to average Australians. 


This is a significant issue that deserves more attention than trendy issues like same-sex marriage. I am fed up with the amount of time and attention that is now being given to the same-sex marriage debate in this place and in mainstream media. A solution to same-sex marriage, Indigenous recognition, and euthanasia for the terminally ill is simple: we hold a referendum and two plebiscites on the day of the next federal election and hear what Australians have to say on these important issues of the conscience, without the exorbitant and onerous costs and without the interference of mainstream media. I believe there is an opportunity to put a private member's bill before the Senate which gives the people, at the next federal election, an opportunity to have their say on those three very important social and moral issues: same-sex marriage, Indigenous recognition, and euthanasia for the terminally ill. End of story—now let's get on with running this country and talking about matters which concern people in rural and regional areas, especially like where I am, on the north-west coast of Tasmania.


Stronger country of origin labelling has been an issue that has been around since Adam was a boy, and neither the Liberal-Nationals nor Labor can claim the moral high ground in this situation. The definitive report on this matter, according to the Parliamentary Library study, was the Blewett review. The library report says: 


On 23 October 2009 the Chair of the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council announced that former Australian Health Minister, Dr Neal Blewett AC, would head up the Panel which would undertake a comprehensive examination of food labelling law and policy.


On 28 January 2011 the review panel officially presented the final report entitled Labelling Logic to the Chair of the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council.


The Blewett Review noted that there was a general level of consumer uncertainty about 'claims to the 'Australian-ness' of a product' and acknowledged that a Newspoll survey conducted in April 2010 reported that '63 per cent of respondents incorrectly identified the originating source of a product where the term 'Made in Australia' was used'. The Blewett Review concluded:


The confusion is compounded by the 'Australian owned' claim and by a flood of `Australian Made' logos... At the heart of the confusion is the 'Made in Australia' claim and the efforts of manufacturers to 'highlight the Australian-ness of their foods'.


The Blewett Review made a number of recommendations of direct relevance to country of origin in relation to food specifically:


that mandatory country of origin labelling requirements for all food products be provided for in a specific consumer product information standard for food under the CCA rather than in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code)


that Australia's existing mandatory country of origin labelling requirements for food be maintained and be extended to cover all primary food products for retail sale and


that for foods bearing some form of Australian claim, a consumer-friendly, food-specific country of origin labelling framework, based primarily on the ingoing weight of the ingredients and components (excluding water), be developed.


Government response to the review


Of the three above recommendations in relation to country of origin by the Blewett Review, the Government did not support two of them and merely 'noted' another (the recommendation to extend mandatory country of origin labelling requirements to all primary food products for retail sale).


So I, like many other Australians, am trying to work out why a government would spend all this money on a report which was basically ignored. Why? Was it a case of political donations unduly influencing good government policy? I note that a lot of effort has been put into the description of a 'Made in Australia' logo with a little kangaroo. I have to say, I think most of us do love Skippy.


I am more interested in making sure that a logo which screams 'Made in Tasmania' is given more attention. The Tasmanian brand is better than Australia's. My home state of Tasmania is renowned right around the world for its fresh produce. Our salmon is some of the best in the world, and our dairy products are second to none. And if you have not had a tender, medium rare Cape Grim steak yet, I tell you what, you have not lived. People travel from all over the world to Tasmania to experience the clean, green produce that only Tasmania can provide. Tasmanian producers are passionate, innovative and hardworking people. They pour their hearts and souls into their own products, because a lot of these products are niche. Our air is the most pure in the world, and our soil is the richest. Our biosecurity measures are top notch, to ensure we maintain that clean, green image. But we need to do more to protect the Tasmanian brand.


This bill achieves greater protections by creating clarity around whether a product is entirely made, produced, grown or packaged in Australia or whether it is only partially 'made' in Australia. Under the new bill, the public is empowered to make their own decision and will not feel misled by claims such as 'Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients', when food is only minimally processed in Australia, as they have felt in the past.


This bill requires corporations to be transparent and upfront with the consumer and therefore it protects our farmers and our producers. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association also supports strong country-of-origin labelling and says that this bill increases the information available to the consumer, allowing them to make more informed decisions.


Just before I finish, I have to say that I did not realise that the labelling in the supermarkets to let you know where the fish comes from is due to Senator Macdonald. I always pay credit where credit is due: kudos to you, Senator Macdonald. That is a great job, and I mean that. People need to know where their seafood is coming from. If we have got that far, maybe we can now get to the fish and chip shops and the restaurants so people know exactly where the seafood is coming from.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:15):  I might start where Senator Lambie finished—and Senator Xenophon made mention of this too. That is, some years ago when I was the minister for fisheries—I did not do it all by myself—but the department in conjunction with other regulatory authorities implemented the arrangement that all fish sold in supermarkets had to be labelled, whether it was Australian or from another country. I think I am like many Australians these days, who go into a supermarket and can see where the seafood comes from. I can say, 'Do I want to buy Australian king prawns, which look lovely but it $36 a kilo? Am I conscious of my pocket and so I will take the imported poorer-looking prawns from Vietnam at about $28 a kilo?' That is my choice as a consumer. That is the way it should be. I agree with Senator Lambie and Senator Xenophon on that.


Senator Xenophon quite rightly mentioned the arrangement in the Northern Territory—states and territories can make their own rules on labelling—where the government, to its credit, did do that in restaurants, and it worked. It has been difficult to get agreement from all the authorities in Australia. I would like to pay tribute to the current minister for fisheries, Senator Ruston, who I know is very keen to ensure that Australians know what they are buying when they go to a fish and chip shop or, more importantly, to a restaurant or to a club or pub. With those last two, the issue sometimes becomes a little more difficult for reasons which might be obvious.


Clearly, pubs and clubs sell meals as an adjunct to their main purpose of selling booze or poker machines—they supply food, good food, but it is mass produced and it often comes from the cheapest source. People do not go to a pub or a club to buy the very best food. If they want to do that, they go to a restaurant but they come to the pub for a beer, a bit of mateship and perhaps a go at the pokies. I accept it is difficult for pubs and clubs and other institutions to do that, but in this day and age with blackboards and computers it is easy to print off a new menu for every meal. It is not the issue that some people might think it might be—the cost that some of these businesses think it might be. I think pubs, clubs and restaurants, particularly restaurants, would benefit from this. 


If I go into a restaurant and I see Australian fish there, I know it will be quite expensive, but I can go down the menu and say, 'Oh, there is nice Vietnam barramundi which is a little less expensive.' It is up to me. I am not wealthy, but I know what I would do: I would always, for taste and quality, go for the Australian one and pay five or 10 dollars more at a restaurant. Restaurant owners may well find that a lot of Australians would do that. A lot of people—people particularly who go to restaurants—would say: 'Look, now that I know it is Australian, I am going to pick that piece.' I know Senator Ruston is working on this—and it is not easy. Even for the clubs and pubs it would be so easy for them to put on their blackboards that you can have imported basa and chips at $10 a meal or you can have Australian barramundi at $15 a meal. I do not think that it will stop people going to pubs and clubs or choosing a meal. They might say, 'Well, I'd rather have another beer and the meal that is $10 cheaper, and so I'll have the imported basa with my beer and it'll allow me to have another beer.' That is their choice. The pubs and clubs might find that the reverse actually happens: people might go in and say, 'Would I rather have a bit of Australian fish—better, nicer and it is also helping Australian fishermen—or will I have another beer?' 


I think that is an argument that Senator Ruston is yet to win—it is not for me to speak for her, but I have spoken to her quite a lot. Like Senator Lambie, not in Tasmania but up in my neck of the woods of Queensland, I often speak to fishermen and all they want is a fair go. They simply want Australians to be able to recognise their food and, if they choose to pay a little bit more, to be able to buy it. Often you go to fish and chip shops and it is difficult to work out what sort of fish it is because it is usually covered in very thick—unfortunately for me—too tasty batter which hides the fish a bit. It would be good if we could at least have the choice. I would be happy; I think every Australian consumer and the Australian fishing industry would be happy. Retailers might just find that they are taking more across the counter because Australians would go for Australian fish even at a greater cost. So I urge support for that issue, as I do privately with Senator Ruston and the government. As I say, I have confidence in Senator Ruston continuing to support that issue. 


As this is a debate, can I just mention to Senator Lambie that I certainly agree with her—it is an awful day when we are agreeing with each other so much, Senator Lambie—that this parliament should be prioritising its agendas better. Quite frankly, I am sick of hearing about same-sex marriage. I am sick of hearing about Donald Trump, who I did not elect and who has got nothing to do with me. I am absolutely sick of it. I am sick of hearing the lies about the Barrier Reef—the absolute lies. I am sick of that. Can't we prioritise and get onto the issues that the majority of Australians actually believe in? Senator Lambie—and, again, it is for the minister to explain it better than I—there is a reason why we do not have these plebiscites at elections—and I appreciate the 'cost' argument. If you do it at an election, it becomes part of the political process and people might say, for example: 'Oh, yes, I believe in same-sex marriage so I am going to vote for it But, hang on, that is the one the Labor Party and the Greens are supporting. I don't like the Labor Party and the Greens so I am going to vote no, because I don't want to do anything to support the Labor Party and the Greens.' It gets tied up in the regular election cycle. So I think the vote you would get at a plebiscite held at the same time as an election would be skewed. It would be flawed because it would become part of the process. 


I also agree with you that had we had some assistance from this chamber in what would, I think, be one month's time when we would have had a plebiscite on same-sex marriage that the day after that plebiscite it would be over and finished—whatever way it went. I do not want to restart that argument, but I would vote against same-sex marriage. However, if the majority of Australians said yes then I would come into this chamber and vote yes. I made that very clear. In one month's time that issue could have been resolved—but it will not be. 




Senator Rice:
  Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Would you bring the senator's attention to the bill that is under discussion at the moment, which is about country-of-origin food labelling. I do not think that waxing lyrically about his views on equal marriage is relevant to the bill under consideration. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Rice. Senator Macdonald, there were a number of points of order this morning when another senator was speaking. I know that you have largely spent the time on the bill, but if you could get back to the bill that would be appreciated. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Deputy President. If I can say to Senator Rice, who has just wandered into the chamber: this is a debate in which Senator Lambie in her very sensible contribution mentioned priorities and same-sex marriage. I do not think you took the point of order then, did you? 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I remind you to make your remarks through the chair. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Deputy President—and a timely warning. But did the senator who has just made the point of order make the same point of order when Senator Lambie was talking about same-sex marriage? Senator Lambie has raised the matter in this debate, and because this is a debate in the parliament of Australia I was simply responding—




Senator Rice:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President. This is a continuation of a discussion which is not about the bill at hand. Senator Lambie indeed did mention same-sex marriage, quite inappropriately, I thought. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Rice, you have quite correctly raised a point of order, which I have made a recommendation on. I remind all senators that we are here to speak about the bill before us and that that is what should largely occupy their discussion and their speech. Often they give background, so I am sure Senator Macdonald will get back to the bill in question. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Deputy President. Again, I repeat that this is a debate in the chamber. I am simply answering something another senator raised and agreeing with that senator that this chamber should prioritise its work; it should move onto important issues—issues that are really important to all Australians; and it should not be diverted by periphery issues such as same-sex marriage, which would have been over and done with in a month's a time had this chamber not denied Australians the opportunity of expressing their views. 


Can I again congratulate the government on bringing forward this bill about country-of-origin labelling for Australian produced products. Under the current regime, the definition of what is made in Australia or the country of origin is somewhat confusing and some of the tests that were in place were even more confusing and less helpful. This bill addresses those issues. It provides businesses with increased certainty about what activities constitute and do not constitute substantial transformation, which is the test for what is made in Australia and what is not. It will make it clear that importing ingredients and undertaking minor processes that merely change the form or appearance of the imported good, such as dicing or canning, are not sufficient to justify the 'made in' wherever claim. The 50 per cent production cost test that currently applies is an unnecessary burden on business and it means little to consumers. The test is difficult to administer, given the complexities of sourcing components through the global supply chain and the variability due to currency fluctuations. These tests in the former bill will become redundant for food products, with the introduction of labels showing the percentage of Australian ingredient. 


Senators will be aware that the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016, which was made under the previous bill, came into effect on 1 July and is being separately tabled in a disallowable instrument in this parliament. That standard, which is the one we have been waiting for for some years, requires mandatory country-of-origin labelling for food that is sold, offered or displayed for sale in Australia. Unfortunately, it does not, for various reasons, impose labelling requirements on food sold outside Australia. This new label will help Australians, almost at a glance, work out how much of the particular product is Australian made or sourced.


Through the information standard, most Australian foods will need to carry a label with a clearly defined box containing a kangaroo-in-the-triangle logo to indicate that the food is grown, produced or made in Australia. It will also have—and this is the bit I like—a bar chart that indicates the proportion of Australian ingredients in the food and the box will also have a statement summarising the visual information. That bar chart will show us at a glance, as we go to the supermarket, how much of a product really is Australian.


I do not see that as a protectionist policy, because many people—and I accept this—will buy their food on price. Many people who do not have big incomes or who are on welfare or who have big families will say, 'I choose that because it's cheaper,' but they will do it in the full knowledge of just how much of the particular product is really Australian and how much is not. I think that is a wonderful step forward. It has been, as one other senator in this debate commented, a long time coming.


I know in our party—and, I suspect, in the other parties as well—we have had debates over many years. I am sure the Labor Party would have been through this because they did nothing in the six years they were in government. But they would have come across the same complexities that we have confronted over the last 20 years that I have been here, and we have been talking about it all that time. It is a difficult situation to get right without pricing the product out of the reach of anyone through complexity of regulation. It has been difficult. I guess some will say, 'It's not perfect; we can do better.' I know the government is always keen to get any views on this. I think the place where we have landed is pretty good. I think you will find that most Australians will appreciate the ability to make an informed choice now on what food they buy.


I conclude by agreeing with the committee that Senator Xenophon said has looked at this and has recommended the bill be passed. I also agree, as I explained before, with Senator Xenophon and Senator Lambie that we have to do something about seafood not in supermarkets. Thanks to a very good minister several years ago, that is already in place in the supermarkets. But in fish and chip shops, hotels, clubs and restaurants, I think we can do it without placing an unrealistic burden on those retail institutions. I wish Senator Ruston all the best as she takes that argument forward. Clearly, I support the bill. I think it is a real step forward for Australia.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-02-08,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (12:34):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to support the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. Before speaking further, though, I want to make clear that I support Senator Macdonald's comments supporting freedom of choice because that is what is at the heart of this bill: informed freedom of choice. I also support his comments on the Great Barrier Reef.


This bill, though, seeks to clarify and improve consumer law by amending schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The bill is primarily intended to simplify the tests used to justify a country of origin 'made in' claim by clarifying what the phrase 'substantial transformation' really means and by removing the 50 per cent production cost test. This bill tightens the definition of what is really Australian made in the country-of-origin food labelling requirements. It makes 'country of origin' or 'Australian made' legitimate.


I understand that this bill forms part of the government's broader country-of-origin labelling package, previously agreed by the states, along with the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016 which commenced last year. Currently, the definition of 'Australian made' is based on having at least 50 per cent Australian production cost, which leads to misleading labelling of foreign foods as 'made in Australia' when in fact they may have only been minimally processed in Australia. Under this bill, the country-of-origin labelling requirements for food will be strengthened and moved to an information standard under the Australian Consumer Law. The new labels for food will include a bar chart to indicate the proportion of Australian ingredients in the food. As part of this process, foods grown, produced or made in Australia will be identified by the traditional kangaroo-in-a-triangle Australian made symbol.


I congratulate the government for adopting this measure, as this is exactly the approach Pauline Hanson's One Nation Political Party has been advocating as policy for many years. As a One Nation senator for Queensland, I am strongly committed to supporting Australian grown, packaged and manufactured goods and products, and our party is strongly committed to identifying and promoting genuinely Australian made products and exposing bogus Australian-sounding imports as frauds. Of course, this bill is just the latest in a long line of excellent One Nation policies adopted by the government. There is another one and that is coal-fired power. What a remarkable change in just three months. Sadly, our own Queensland Premier says 'no more coal-fired power stations'. So I can only express my hope that this bill is but the next of many more One Nation policies that the government will choose to adopt in the future.


However, one pressing issue regarding food imports that this bill does not consider is the allowing of contaminated foodstuffs into Australia and the blending of imported foodstuffs with Australian produce in bonded warehouses prior to importation. This wholly inappropriate practice, which may only be revealed on the label of foodstuffs as 'contains mix of Australian and imported ingredients', needs to be prohibited. Perniciously, in the case of peanuts for example, I understand that this blending prior to import inspection is done because the much cheaper imported ingredients contain levels of contaminants that do not meet Australian health standards.


Peanuts are notorious for absorbing any available cadmium from the soil in which they grow. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the human body and is a major cause of adult kidney failure. Thanks to the clean unpolluted Australian environment, Australian grown peanuts contain no cadmium, while Chinese peanuts, as a result of their proximity to polluting Chinese heavy industries, may be heavily contaminated with this poison. Because of the serious health risk that they pose, contaminated Chinese peanuts should be considered a prohibited import. Reprehensibly, in order to maximize profits, unscrupulous importers have sought to subvert Australia's food health standards and import restrictions by importing these cheap, cadmium contaminated Chinese peanuts and, I understand, blending them with cadmium free Australian peanuts in bonded warehouses, prior to customs inspections. Food that is imported into Australia is regulated by the Imported Food Control Act 1992 and the Imported Food Control Regulations 1993. Together, these statutes provide for the Food Inspection Scheme. Currently all imported peanuts are classified as a risk food as a result of the danger of cadmium contamination.


Even though all food products ultimately offered for sale in Australia must meet our health standards, experts have argued that in some areas, such as heavy metal contamination, health regulations may reflect 1950s 'acceptable' contamination limits and are seriously out of date. Thus, while schedule 19 of the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code sets the maximum allowable level of cadmium that may be contained in peanuts as 0.5mg/kg, given that virtually any cadmium—any cadmium—consumed remains in the body for life, most medical experts today argue that there are no truly safe levels of cumulative toxins like cadmium, and therefore the safest course is to avoid any food exposure at all.


Accordingly, whilst it goes beyond the scope of the bill currently under consideration, I strongly urge the government to outlaw practices such as the blending of Australian and imported goods prior to food safety testing, and to declare peanuts containing cadmium a prohibited import. This will eliminate a very real and totally unnecessary threat to the health of Australians.


For the information of the Australian people, to my knowledge only Dick Smith brand peanut butter is made with exclusively Australian peanuts, which are of course cadmium free. Until such time as this issue is addressed and cadmium contaminated peanuts are declared a prohibited import, I urge all Australians who value their kidneys to read the country-of-origin label on peanuts and eat only safe Australian grown peanuts, and consider buying only Dick Smith brand peanut butter.


While supportive of this legislation, I believe we as a parliament need to address the core issue for bringing back Australian food production, both in quality and quantity, and bringing back manufacturing. After 42 years of de-industrialisation under Liberal/National coalitions and under Labor/Greens coalitions, we must re-industrialise our country. To re-industrialise we must face up to the core issue: comprehensive tax reform at the state and federal levels, instead of window-dressing.


Further, to continue with Senator Macdonald comments on the fishing industry, it is my understanding that this island on which we live is the largest in the world and yet we import almost three-quarters of the seafood we eat. All that Australian farmers, fishermen and manufacturers want is a fair go. Ultimately, this bill gives people an informed freedom of choice. Notwithstanding the issues of toxins and tax, I otherwise commend this legislation to the Senate.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-02-08,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:42):  In 1993, or around then, I came to this building in Canberra to lobby friends in the National Party for country-of-origin labelling, because the then Hawke/Keating Labor government allowed the importation of pig meat from places such as Denmark and Canada. My brother, Peter, and I had a 100-sow piggery, feeding about 1,000 pigs a day and I found it quite frustrating that they would import pig meat into Australia, process it into ham, and brand it 'Manufactured in Australia' or 'Product of Australia'. It was so misleading. All I wanted was a fair go to see that the Australian people knew what they were buying—whether it was grown in Australia, processed in Australia, imported, processed here from Australian and imported blends et cetera.


Since 1993 it has been a long, frustrating road, I can assure you. We all know that the wheels of parliament do not go very fast. During the berry contamination issue about 18 months ago, where many Australians contracted hepatitis because of some imported berries, I stood up in the joint party room—Senator Sinodinos was there—and said to the then Prime Minister, 'Mr Abbott, we need a country-of-origin food labelling system so that people can clarify what they are buying and eating.' To his full credit, Mr Abbott said, 'Let's get on with it.' That is where we have come to right along this road of country-of-origin labelling.


It will be good to see the Australian kangaroo and the green triangle—a very well-known label that is very familiar, I would say, to all shoppers in Australia. It will have 'Grown in Australia' and the bar code underneath will be completely orange. You will know that the food you are about to eat for the can of whatever you are purchasing was grown, processed and packaged here in Australia. It will show the blends that will come forward—what percentage is actually made from imported ingredients and from Australian ingredients. I must agree with Senator Macdonald as far as the fishing industry goes. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you were on a committee with us in the Northern Territory. What a great thing it is that Northern Territorians know exactly where their fish is coming from—70 per cent imported. I think that is where we need to make progress as well, on that very issue. All we are asking is that people know what they are eating and where it comes from.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:26):  Labor supports this Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016 because it provides certainty for industry that safe harbour provisions under Australian Consumer Law are aligned with new country of origin labelling requirements. This will help protect enterprises, particularly Australian food manufacturers, make claims under the new mandatory labelling requirements that came into effect on 1 July 2016. This issue called for a bipartisanship approach in taking steps to resolve a longstanding problem, and that is what has happened. That said, sometimes on the way to this resolution we in the opposition have been bemused by the antics of some members of the government, especially the Deputy Prime Minister. 


The basic problem these reforms address was set out clearly in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry, tabled in October 2014. The committee recommended that labelling standards should be changed to make it easier for consumers to identify the sources of food products and the places where they are processed—the perfectly reasonable proposition that people know where their food has come from. The wording on many labels, 'Made in Australia using local and imported ingredients', clearly did not do that. 


As senators will remember, however, what actually spurred the government into action was a food contamination scare in February 2015, after the report had been received. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services announced that two brands of frozen berries sold in supermarkets had been linked to multiple cases of hepatitis A. The company that produced both brands obtained its berries from Chile and China, and processed them in China's Shandong province. Pictures emerged of excrement-clogged factories in Shandong, and in the subsequent media frenzy and consumer panic the careful wording of the Victorian announcement was usually ignored.


What the Victorian department said was that ingesting frozen berries was the only common link between the hepatitis cases. It did not claim that ingesting contaminated berries had caused all the cases. This fine distinction vanished completely when the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, the agriculture minister, Mr Joyce, and the then industry minister, Mr Macfarlane, called a media conference. They announced that a working party of ministers would consider the House of Representatives' report on food labelling. Mr Joyce blithely ignored the fact that the report had been presented to the government before the contamination scare, without being acted upon. He said, 'It's great to be part of a government that's actually going to do something.' On Channel 9's Today program he spoke more directly to the fears that the contaminated berries scare had aroused in consumers. He said, 'Buy Australian and save yourself a pain in the guts.'


Labor agrees that the best way of ensuring that packaged food is of acceptable quality is to buy Australian. I do it for a lot of other reasons as well—that is why I have been wearing this 'Made in Australia' badge for many, many years. We in the Labor Party have supported the adoption of the new system of food labels. It must be acknowledged that there are still other issues to be resolved, some of which have been raised in the original House of Representatives report. The gold kangaroo in a green triangle, above a filled-in or partly filled-in gold bar code, can tell consumers how much, if any, of the product has been grown and processed in Australia. This kind of labelling does not provide information about anywhere else the product might have come from. If the new system had applied at the time of the frozen berries scare, consumers would have been none the wiser about the origin of the berries that became a matter of contention. Nonetheless, the system is better than what it replaced, because when the Government was not diverted by trying to score points on this issue, as it did during the berries scare and again in the election campaign, it has actually done the right thing. It consulted stakeholders in the food industry and the state and territory governments. That is what we urged the governments to do when we offered support for the reform of food labelling in February last year. 


The bill now before the Senate, like the new labelling requirements that came into force in July, is a result of those consultations. The new labelling requirements have been endorsed by state ministers for consumer affairs, the Food and Grocery Council, AUSVEG, the National Farmers' Federation and the consumer advocacy group Choice. These bodies have also supported the present bill, which alters the 'safe harbour' provisions of the Australian consumer law for businesses making country-of-origin claims. Safe harbour provisions are intended to give businesses certainty about the claims they can make without infringing consumer law. If a business makes a country-of-origin claim for its product, and that claim is alleged to be false or deceptive, the business has an automatic defence if it can show that the product meets the conditions laid down in the safe-harbour provisions.


Under the existing law, for a business to rely on this protection either the goods have to be substantially transformed in the place that is claimed as the country of origin or at least 50 per cent of the total costs of production must have occurred in that country. This bill strengthens the safe-harbour protections for food products by declaring the meaning of 'substantial transformation.' It removes the 50 per cent cost of production test, which is redundant now that food labels show the proportion of Australian ingredients. These are sensible changes that complement the new labelling system.


Labor continues to support this reform process, but we remind the government that the process of reform does not end with this bill. The government could go further and give full consideration to the bipartisan House of Representatives report that was originally tabled in 2014. We also urge the government to end its neglect of biosecurity and of Australia's manufacturing sector, of which food processing is such an important part, especially in regional areas.


Buying Australian will always be the best way for consumers to have confidence in the quality of food products. The maintenance of a vigorous manufacturing sector is the best way of ensuring that Australians will have high-skill, high-wage jobs and that the economy becomes less reliant on the vagaries of commodity exports.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-02-08,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:34):  I rise today to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. The Greens have been leading the way on country-of-origin labelling law for years. We want to see labelling laws that work for Australians—that work for Australian farmers, manufacturers and consumers. Since 1998 we have been working with the industry to develop our proposal to make country-of-origin labelling mandatory for all packaged and unpackaged food sold in Australia. The Greens' proposal since that time would simplify country-of-origin labels to three basic claims: something has to be either made in Australia, grown in Australia or manufactured in Australia. 


We want to encourage companies to highlight any significant local ingredients. This bill does not do that, but it does go some way to simplifying the system that we currently have. That is important, because we know that Australians want to do the right thing when they are buying their food. When they are standing there in the supermarket aisle and trying to choose between this tin of tomatoes and that one, they want to be able to know what it means. When we are at the supermarket and see 'made in Australia from local and imported ingredients', no wonder many of us feel confused. To make an informed choice the community needs clear information about where their food is coming from. How much of the product is local? Was it all made in Australia, and does that change depending on what season it is made in? 


The amendments that we are discussing today are primarily intended to simplify the tests used to justify claims like 'made in' by clarifying what 'substantial transformation' means and removing the confusing 50 per cent production cost test, which becomes redundant for food products with the introduction of labels showing the percentage of Australian ingredients. This legislation is putting in place a system so that if a business makes a country-of-origin claim for a product and it is alleged to be misleading, deceptive or false, that business has an automatic defence to the allegation if it can show that the product meets the safe harbour defence for that claim. The bill also creates a new safe harbour defence for products labelled in accordance with information standards, so that businesses can have more certainty about the labelling they can make without breaking the law. So, as far as these changes go, we support the legislation before the chamber today. However, I would like to quickly mention the important work of the Australian Greens on country-of-origin labelling and the ongoing fight for transparency and the consumer right to know, particularly in regard to food and agriculture products. Clearer food labelling is good for public health, the environment and local farmers. It gives them the extra tool to enable them to compete in our globalised marketplace. The Greens recognise that food-labelling laws should not be dictated by global food and beverage giants or the big corporations in the city. If you are a local Australian farmer working with your local co-op, you do not have the clout or power that those global corporations have. But that does not mean that your concerns should be considered to be less significant than the claims that are being put by the global manufacturers.


If we are better informed about where our food is coming from, we can trust that it is going to be top-quality produce that we know we can rely on from Australian food producers. We can be clear about where internationally sourced ingredients have come from so that you can make an informed choice. You can decide that, no, you do not want to be buying produce from somewhere that you are a bit suspicious of. You can make the choice and say, 'No. I would prefer to pay that little bit extra'—to be supporting Australian farmers, to be supporting food production that you know is being well regulated and manufactured, with food being grown in a sustainable way. You know you can be supporting that farm production where you can be sure that there can be a spotlight on it, if required, to make sure it is being done in a sustainable and healthy way.


Having good country of origin labelling will also encourage people to consume more fresh produce. By thinking more about the origins of the food, we automatically eat in a way that is healthier and more ethical. So, again, if you are deciding about a cheap tin of tomatoes that you have suspicions about because of where it has come from, you can decide maybe it would be better to buy the fresh tomatoes that you know have come from the market garden only tens of kilometres away. You know that you can have more confidence in the health and sustainability of how that food is being produced.


Also, by giving consumers information about where their food has come from and by encouraging locally produced produce to be squarely compared with other produce, it means it is much more likely that consumers are going to decide that, yes, it is worth paying what may be just a little bit extra to buy that Australian produce. That means it is going to be contributing to reducing the pollution that causes global warming. If we are buying more locally produced produce we are not flying ingredients and food from the other side of the world and paying the transport costs involved in that. Having really good food labelling helps us to better understand how far our food ingredients have travelled to our plates.


One of the examples I often use is: when I am buying lentils and you have two packets of lentils on the shelves and you have to get out your glasses to look at the difference between these lentils. With the lentils grown in Canada, I think, 'Fine. Terrific. People in Canada, go ahead and eat those lentils.' For people in the US, it would be appropriate to eat those lentils. If, on the other hand, you look the next little bit along the shelf and you have exactly the same product that is made in Australia, I will always go for that made-in-Australia product. For those sorts of choices, by giving information to consumers, you have the ability to be really supporting our local food-growing industries. So our farmers and our food producers will be the beneficiaries then of that strong, local demand.


This bill is a step in the right direction, but clearly there is further to go to make sure that our food is labelled clearly and more efficiently. As well as supporting this bill before the house today, we call on our colleagues to support the Greens plan for country-of-origin labelling so that we can create more sustainable local jobs and allow everybody to make more informed choices about choosing the food that they eat.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (11:42):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. This bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, altering country-of-origin labelling and safe harbour provisions under Australia consumer law. The main change that this bill makes is for the labels for most food that is grown, produced or made in Australia to include a logo—a kangaroo in a triangle symbol—as well as a bar chart and text statement to show the proportion of Australian ingredients. Australians are entitled to know exactly where their food comes from. Labor supports this amendment. Buying Australian is the best way to secure quality food. Labor remains willing to work with Mr Turnbull and his colleagues to improve our country-of-origin labelling requirements.


However, perhaps the Liberals should think more broadly about their neglect of biosecurity and Australian manufacturing, which is putting jobs at risk and taking our economy backwards. Come to think of it, this is not the only thing going backwards under this government. 2017 began for Malcolm Turnbull much the same as 2016 ended, with scandal, humiliation, disappointment and division. After what was a pretty unimpressive year, I think it is fair to say that Mr Turnbull and his Liberals really needed to put their tails between their legs and hit the reset button over the summer break. And there has been more. Of course, we had Senator Bernardi defecting from his government, the Liberal Party, yesterday. But here we are in the first parliamentary sitting week of 2017 and the government is still fumbling around, unable to figure out where they stand, what they stand for and which way is up. To be fair, there are some people out there who were inclined to cut Mr Turnbull some slack last year. He was finding his feet after limping across the 2016 election finish line, but it has been almost 18 months now since the Prime Minister knifed Mr Abbott in the back. Enough is enough. If Malcolm Turnbull has anything resembling a policy agenda or a plan for 2017, now would be a really good time to tell us about it.




Senator Smith:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President: government senators are generally very generous to Senator Polley when she makes contributions in the Senate, but we are talking about the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016, which is a government bill, and I encourage the senator to come back to the issue before the Senate.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Smith. I am listening very carefully, and Senator Polley is addressing aspects of the bill.




Senator POLLEY:
  After a very, very mediocre 2016, you would think that Mr Turnbull would have kicked off 2017 with a new agenda, a plan—a first draft, even. But, unfortunately, this was not the case. Mr Turnbull addressed the Press Club last Wednesday, and things just seemed to go from bad to worse for the Prime Minister after that speech, culminating, as we know, with Senator Bernardi defecting from the Liberal Party yesterday. So the circus continues.


I have to say it is a good thing for Mr Turnbull that there is not an election this year, because, having achieved so little since becoming Prime Minister, most of us are scratching our heads wondering what the point of this government is and what the good reason was for sending us to a double dissolution at the last election. We are all still wondering that. Support for Mr Turnbull's government is freefalling, their popularity is slipping, and I personally think that one good reason for that is that they are so out of touch. We know that everything they touch is stuffed up, so how can we rely on them to handle even a piece of legislation like this? In stark contrast to Labor, the Liberals have kicked off this year with no direction, no plan and, above all, no narrative. Mr Turnbull has said over and over that his government is a government of the 21st century, that it is agile and innovative and that there has never been a more exciting time to be an Australian, but the only thing that resonates with people in Australia—particularly in my home state of Tasmania—the thing that they are utterly disappointed with, is this dithering and dysfunctional government. Mr Turnbull is a Prime Minister who gave hope to so many in the community, but there are so many people now who are utterly disappointed.




Senator Smith:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President: I challenge Senator Polley to mention the words 'competition', 'consumer' or 'country of origin bill' just once in her contribution. She is a quarter of the way through now.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Smith. Senator Polley has indeed mentioned the bill. I am sure she is putting in some background and will get to the point, but I remind senators that they need to speak about the bill before us.




Senator POLLEY:
  I am speaking about the bill and—as you said, Deputy President—I am putting it in the context of a government that is so out of touch and so dysfunctional. I know that this is a veiled attempt from those on the other side to give Mr Turnbull some cover. As I said in my speech last night, I am ashamed to sit in this chamber with a government that has attacked some of the most vulnerable people in the community—the people who this government has been hurting most in this country over the last summer period, with the dysfunction of the Centrelink robo-debt recovery crisis and the fact that this government is putting ordinary, everyday Australians who need a helping hand into the hands of debt collectors.



Senator Smith interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  Then they came in here last night—and now we have them interjecting—trying to say that we support the rorting of Centrelink. There is nothing further from the truth, and that is such an insult to everyone in this chamber. There is not an Australian—except those who may be caught rorting—who does not believe that only those people who deserve to get Centrelink payments should have access to them. But, no, they continued to send out letters to innocent Australians—and we know, and the government are now very much aware, that 40 per cent of those letters were inaccurate. I spoke last night about the Tasmanians who have been caught up in this dysfunctional government's shambolic attempt to rein back money from those people who can least afford it. Once your name is on the debt collectors' database, it is extremely difficult to have it removed. 




Senator Payne:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President: the chamber has a number of conventions by which it is expected senators might operate. Call me conservative and old-fashioned perhaps, but speaking to the subject of the bill at hand, which relates to country-of-origin labelling, is hardly an unreasonable expectation. Senator Polley is not speaking in relation to the country-of-origin bill, in any way, shape or form, and I seek that you draw her attention to that and ask her to respond in relation to the bill.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister. Senator Polley, I am sure that you are going to get back to the bill. You started off on the bill and I am sure you are heading back to the bill.




Senator POLLEY:
  I think it is very important that the Australian people be made aware of the significant dysfunction of this government, so, therefore, it does not really matter what legislation comes before—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The minister on a point of order.




Senator Payne:
  Madam Deputy President, as you would be aware, ample opportunity for senators to engage in that sort of debate in this chamber is given throughout the day. This is a debate on a particular bill in relation to country-of-origin labelling. Senators are expected to be relevant to the bill in front of the chamber. The senator is not, in any way, shape or form, being relevant to the bill, and I seek your support to ensure that she is.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister, you have made your point—as has the whip—on a number of occasions. I spoke to Senator Polley, as you heard. She was back on her feet for about two seconds before you intervened again.




Senator POLLEY:
  This government is starkly out of touch with the community and has no plans for the future. We have a Prime Minister who has no vision and no economic plan whatsoever, but the government does not want to hear about it. The Australian people already know; what I am trying to do is put context into the legislation that is before us. We have these scandals that have been perpetrated by those on that side of the chamber. One of their colleagues, Senator Bernardi—who came into this Senate chamber at the same time as I did, in the 2005 class—obviously has little confidence in this government being able to bring any sort of legislation through this chamber.


But I do not want to be distracted from the issues that are confronting the Australian people and the fact that the government have failed to address the issues that have been raised with them in relation to the robo-debt system, with 170,000 letters and notices having gone out to everyday Australians. They do not want to hear about that, but I am going to continue, because, Madam Deputy President, you very well know that in the past those opposite have spoken many times on pieces of legislation and given context to the government's inability to govern this country. The government's shambolic system has wrongly targeted a 76-year-old Queenslander—




Senator Payne:
  Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The senator is directly flouting your request to her to return to the legislation, which is of course undermining your authority in the chair.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will determine whether my authority is being undermined, thank you, Minister. Senator Whish-Wilson?




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Madam Deputy President, I might be able to add some information to this point of order. Seven minutes ago Senator Polley tweeted, 'About to speak in the Senate about the Turnbull government's shocking start to the year.' That is quite amazing considering she is 10 minutes into a speech, but I think she has put on public record that she is not speaking about the matter at hand.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. Senator Polley, please continue your remarks, but if you could be more focused on the bill everyone in the chamber would appreciate that.




Senator POLLEY:
  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy President. Yes, it is an important piece of legislation that has come before us and it is a start in terms of the government being able to work with those in this chamber to bring about these changes. There is no doubt that, just as there has been a debacle over the Centrelink robo-debt issue, consumers are concerned about the origin of the food they are consuming. When we are talking about the quality of food and having global recognition for clean, green produce, there is no better place to represent this country than my home state of Tasmania. 


I understand that the government are a bit twitchy and a bit concerned that anyone might be critical of them. Not only with respect to this piece of legislation but also from the agenda on today's Order of Business, we can see that the government are struggling. In anticipation of other people wanting to make a contribution to this debate, I will conclude my remarks.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith?




Senator Smith:
  Madam Deputy President, I cannot help myself: it is worth noting that the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill accounted for less than one minute of Senator Polley's 12-minute speech.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:55):  I indicate my support for the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. This has really been a long and winding road. Back in 2008, in my first few months in the Senate, I managed to convince my then colleague Senator Bob Brown, the Leader of the Australian Greens, and Senator Barnaby Joyce from the Nationals to co-sponsor a bill on truth in country-of-origin labelling. We produced a minority report—it was effectively a dissenting report—when the major parties effectively said, 'We don't want to go down this path.' I think it says something about the nature of the issue when you can have both the Greens and the Nationals on a unity ticket co-sponsoring legislation, co-writing a minority report about the need for truth in labelling in this country. It has been a long time coming, but we have seen some real improvements in the system. However, I believe there is scope for more significant improvements, and I will speak to amendments in relation to that. 


It is very clear that Australians want to buy Australian. In fact, a survey published in The Sydney Morning Herald a couple of days ago indicated overwhelmingly that Australians favour Australian made goods, things made here in Australia, and that sentiment is even stronger when it comes to the food that we eat. Multiple surveys have shown that Australians want to buy Australian products, products which use ingredients grown in Australia and which contribute to the Australian economy through jobs and the clean, green produce that Australia is so justifiably famous for. We know this through surveys going back many years. Back in 2005 an Auspoll survey found that 97 per cent of Australians wanted to have clear information on the country of origin of their foodstuffs. A 2009 survey found that 82.5 per cent of supermarket shoppers checked most of the time whether their foodstuffs, including fruit and vegetables, were Australian in origin. In other words, consumers are aware of this. We must have clear, simple, straightforward country-of-origin labelling laws so that consumers can make an informed choice when they are rushing through the supermarket. If they have toddlers or other children with them and they are in a mad rush, they want to get in and out of the supermarket, but they want to be able to make an informed choice as easily as possible. 


I also think it is important to put into perspective that the 50 per cent production cost test, the substantial transformation test, has inherently been a failure. You can claim a product was made in Australia even though the majority of ingredients could have come from overseas. I am very grateful to my friend and constituent Ron Gray, a former citrus grower from Loxton in the Riverland, who has been a tireless campaigner on the issue of food labelling and the impact that poor food labelling has had on the citrus industry, which has shrunk over the years rather than expanded, as it should have, with so much of our citrus juice coming from Brazilian concentrate. Ron Gray made the point that the laws were actually killing off the citrus industry. You could have a fruit juice with 70 per cent Brazilian concentrate and a minority of Australian juice and you add the water and do the packaging, and that easily passes the 50 per cent substantial transformation test—and that is a disgrace. Ron Gray told me not so long ago, as he was winding up his citrus production in Loxton, that he sent fruit to a processing plant in Mildura across the border. The money he received for that fruit barely covered the cost of the transport. In other words, he got a zero net return for his fruit. That is a disgrace, and I hope this bill goes some way to rectifying it.


We know that in 2012, the inquiry by Senate Select Committee on Australia's Food Processing Sector, chaired by former senator, Senator Colbeck, showed a number of anomalies that occur with food labelling in this country. Seafood labelling is an issue that is particularly prone to abuse. There are serious concerns about our current labelling regime, which allow foreign imports to be classified as 'Made in Australia'.


In its submission to this bill, the Australian Made Campaign Limited stated that overall it 'supports the removal of the 50 per cent cost test'. However, it noted some concerns that 'it may result in adverse consequences for some Australian suppliers of inputs'. It noted:


This will occur where a manufacturer opts to source cheaper inputs offshore, knowing that it will not affect their capacity to make a Made in Australia claim. An example of this is a manufacturer of soft gel capsules who currently purchases gelatin from an Australian manufacturer because it assists them to meet the 50 per cent threshold. The local packaging industry may also be impacted adversely by this change.


These are issues that ought to be fairly raised in the committee stages of this bill.


This issue was recognised in the committee report, and I think there is a need for greater guidance as to what does or does not constitute substantial transformation. The committee noted the concerns of the AMCL and that there was currently no mechanism by which manufacturers could obtain a definitive answer regarding country-of-origin claims and that this could result in companies being hesitant to make a claim for fear that competitors would challenge its validity. Whilst not making a submission on this bill, the consumer group CHOICE stated:


Unfortunately, the new system looks less useful for consumers wanting information about any of the 195 countries that are not Australia. For example, claims such as 'Made in Australia from imported ingredients' will still have you wondering where your food comes from …


That is one of the big flaws of this bill.


It is also important to ensure there is a mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims. There is no such mechanism in the current bill. It is something that needs to be prosecuted or explored in the committee stages. I will be moving a second reading amendment standing in my name, which adds, at the end of the motion, 'but the Senate calls on the government to undertake an analysis of the benefits of establishing an administrative mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims'. If we do not do that, this bill will only to half a job. It will be nowhere near as effective as it ought to be to give the truth in labelling and to give certainty to our food manufacturing sector.


We are seeing the decimation of manufacturing jobs in this country. In our auto sector, when Holden closes down on 20 October in South Australia and when Toyota closes down at about the same time and as car makers close down in Victoria, there will be tens of thousands of jobs lost. We need to have a plan B, and the food-processing sector has enormous potential to absorb a significant number of those job losses. It is also important, in the definition of 'substantial transformation', that we have an administrative mechanism similar to what exists in the United States, which will give manufacturers the ability to obtain a ruling on country-of-origin claims. That is something that, as I said, with the second reading amendment, needs to be explored.


I believe that this bill, on balance, does advance the issue of certainty in food labelling, but there is one other issue that I raised in my additional comments to this bill. There ought to be a mechanism for manufacturers to regularly disclose the percentage and country of origin of specific ingredients to the department of industry, for publication on its website. A lot of manufacturers will say, 'We can't do this. It's too complex. It's too difficult because we have to change our labels all the time.' There is a thing called the internet. If they are required to publish online to the department so that, every six months, consumers can establish exactly what the percentage of whatever ingredients are in there is from Australia or elsewhere then that will empower consumers. It will also give a lot of useful information to the media that can be publicised about which manufacturers are making every possible effort to deal with these issues. That is why I will be moving an amendment in that regard. If there is political will, it can and should be done to really strengthen the framework of this bill.


There is one final issue I wish to raise—that is, the Food Standards Amendment (Fish Labelling) Bill 2015. Senator Lambie famously kissed a barramundi—




Senator Lambie:
  It was very sweet!




Senator XENOPHON:
  a very sweet barramundi, in the context of raising awareness of that bill—as well as the awareness of a number of other crossbenchers! This bill relates to the labelling of seafood products. What is interesting is that if you buy seafood in a supermarket, it tells you which country it comes from. But if you buy seafood that has been cooked and prepared in the fish and chip shop or restaurant right next to the supermarket, you have no idea where it comes from; there is no requirement to label it.


The Northern Territory moved on this a number of years ago and it has been a great success. It has boosted jobs in the Territory, and we heard in evidence to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee that literally thousands of jobs will be created in our agriculture and seafood industries if this bill will—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You could say who brought it into the supermarkets.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I think that was the coalition. Was that you?




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Well, I am not looking for personal praise.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I will acknowledge Senator Macdonald's passionate advocacy for the seafood sector.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I will sing my own praises later!




Senator XENOPHON:
  He will sing his own praises—I am sure I wouldn't do justice for him!


What is interesting here is that it was a unanimous decision of the committee. It was a decision of crossbenchers, of the coalition and of the opposition to support this law. They actually said that we should just get on with it. The committee recommended that, with the bill being passed into law, the Commonwealth encourage the states and territories to comply with and enforce the revised standard.


This bill does not deal with that. It is something I have had discussions on with the Deputy Prime Minister, with the relevant minister and with Minister Nash. And I have been very disappointed that it has not been advanced. So, that is another reform that needs to be brought about.


With those comments, I support this bill, but I urge my colleagues to seriously consider the amendment for greater transparency every six months—which would not carry an unreasonable administrative burden—to get a commitment from the government to actually advance this, because if it does not then I think you will find that consumers will still feel that they are not getting the information they deserve. That is why this bill is so important, particularly in the context of Australians wanting to know what they are eating and where it comes from and also in the context of the impact it has on Australian jobs and our food processing sector and on Australian agriculture.


I move the second reading amendment standing in my name, which I foreshadowed in relation to the issue of standards and getting appropriate rulings from an administrative mechanism for food manufacturers:


At the end of the motion, add ""but the Senate calls on the Government to undertake an analysis of the benefits of establishing an administrative mechanism to give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on Country of Origin Labelling claims"".

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-02-08,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:08):  I rise to briefly speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016 and in doing so I ask the same question everyone else is asking: why has this legislation taken so long, and why is it still incomplete to the standard it is required to be at? This is a classic example of why this parliament needs to better prioritise the legislative agenda and why Australia's media should report on the issues that are really important to average Australians. 


This is a significant issue that deserves more attention than trendy issues like same-sex marriage. I am fed up with the amount of time and attention that is now being given to the same-sex marriage debate in this place and in mainstream media. A solution to same-sex marriage, Indigenous recognition, and euthanasia for the terminally ill is simple: we hold a referendum and two plebiscites on the day of the next federal election and hear what Australians have to say on these important issues of the conscience, without the exorbitant and onerous costs and without the interference of mainstream media. I believe there is an opportunity to put a private member's bill before the Senate which gives the people, at the next federal election, an opportunity to have their say on those three very important social and moral issues: same-sex marriage, Indigenous recognition, and euthanasia for the terminally ill. End of story—now let's get on with running this country and talking about matters which concern people in rural and regional areas, especially like where I am, on the north-west coast of Tasmania.


Stronger country of origin labelling has been an issue that has been around since Adam was a boy, and neither the Liberal-Nationals nor Labor can claim the moral high ground in this situation. The definitive report on this matter, according to the Parliamentary Library study, was the Blewett review. The library report says: 


On 23 October 2009 the Chair of the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council announced that former Australian Health Minister, Dr Neal Blewett AC, would head up the Panel which would undertake a comprehensive examination of food labelling law and policy.


On 28 January 2011 the review panel officially presented the final report entitled Labelling Logic to the Chair of the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council.


The Blewett Review noted that there was a general level of consumer uncertainty about 'claims to the 'Australian-ness' of a product' and acknowledged that a Newspoll survey conducted in April 2010 reported that '63 per cent of respondents incorrectly identified the originating source of a product where the term 'Made in Australia' was used'. The Blewett Review concluded:


The confusion is compounded by the 'Australian owned' claim and by a flood of `Australian Made' logos... At the heart of the confusion is the 'Made in Australia' claim and the efforts of manufacturers to 'highlight the Australian-ness of their foods'.


The Blewett Review made a number of recommendations of direct relevance to country of origin in relation to food specifically:


that mandatory country of origin labelling requirements for all food products be provided for in a specific consumer product information standard for food under the CCA rather than in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code)


that Australia's existing mandatory country of origin labelling requirements for food be maintained and be extended to cover all primary food products for retail sale and


that for foods bearing some form of Australian claim, a consumer-friendly, food-specific country of origin labelling framework, based primarily on the ingoing weight of the ingredients and components (excluding water), be developed.


Government response to the review


Of the three above recommendations in relation to country of origin by the Blewett Review, the Government did not support two of them and merely 'noted' another (the recommendation to extend mandatory country of origin labelling requirements to all primary food products for retail sale).


So I, like many other Australians, am trying to work out why a government would spend all this money on a report which was basically ignored. Why? Was it a case of political donations unduly influencing good government policy? I note that a lot of effort has been put into the description of a 'Made in Australia' logo with a little kangaroo. I have to say, I think most of us do love Skippy.


I am more interested in making sure that a logo which screams 'Made in Tasmania' is given more attention. The Tasmanian brand is better than Australia's. My home state of Tasmania is renowned right around the world for its fresh produce. Our salmon is some of the best in the world, and our dairy products are second to none. And if you have not had a tender, medium rare Cape Grim steak yet, I tell you what, you have not lived. People travel from all over the world to Tasmania to experience the clean, green produce that only Tasmania can provide. Tasmanian producers are passionate, innovative and hardworking people. They pour their hearts and souls into their own products, because a lot of these products are niche. Our air is the most pure in the world, and our soil is the richest. Our biosecurity measures are top notch, to ensure we maintain that clean, green image. But we need to do more to protect the Tasmanian brand.


This bill achieves greater protections by creating clarity around whether a product is entirely made, produced, grown or packaged in Australia or whether it is only partially 'made' in Australia. Under the new bill, the public is empowered to make their own decision and will not feel misled by claims such as 'Made in Australia from local and imported ingredients', when food is only minimally processed in Australia, as they have felt in the past.


This bill requires corporations to be transparent and upfront with the consumer and therefore it protects our farmers and our producers. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association also supports strong country-of-origin labelling and says that this bill increases the information available to the consumer, allowing them to make more informed decisions.


Just before I finish, I have to say that I did not realise that the labelling in the supermarkets to let you know where the fish comes from is due to Senator Macdonald. I always pay credit where credit is due: kudos to you, Senator Macdonald. That is a great job, and I mean that. People need to know where their seafood is coming from. If we have got that far, maybe we can now get to the fish and chip shops and the restaurants so people know exactly where the seafood is coming from.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:15):  I might start where Senator Lambie finished—and Senator Xenophon made mention of this too. That is, some years ago when I was the minister for fisheries—I did not do it all by myself—but the department in conjunction with other regulatory authorities implemented the arrangement that all fish sold in supermarkets had to be labelled, whether it was Australian or from another country. I think I am like many Australians these days, who go into a supermarket and can see where the seafood comes from. I can say, 'Do I want to buy Australian king prawns, which look lovely but it $36 a kilo? Am I conscious of my pocket and so I will take the imported poorer-looking prawns from Vietnam at about $28 a kilo?' That is my choice as a consumer. That is the way it should be. I agree with Senator Lambie and Senator Xenophon on that.


Senator Xenophon quite rightly mentioned the arrangement in the Northern Territory—states and territories can make their own rules on labelling—where the government, to its credit, did do that in restaurants, and it worked. It has been difficult to get agreement from all the authorities in Australia. I would like to pay tribute to the current minister for fisheries, Senator Ruston, who I know is very keen to ensure that Australians know what they are buying when they go to a fish and chip shop or, more importantly, to a restaurant or to a club or pub. With those last two, the issue sometimes becomes a little more difficult for reasons which might be obvious.


Clearly, pubs and clubs sell meals as an adjunct to their main purpose of selling booze or poker machines—they supply food, good food, but it is mass produced and it often comes from the cheapest source. People do not go to a pub or a club to buy the very best food. If they want to do that, they go to a restaurant but they come to the pub for a beer, a bit of mateship and perhaps a go at the pokies. I accept it is difficult for pubs and clubs and other institutions to do that, but in this day and age with blackboards and computers it is easy to print off a new menu for every meal. It is not the issue that some people might think it might be—the cost that some of these businesses think it might be. I think pubs, clubs and restaurants, particularly restaurants, would benefit from this. 


If I go into a restaurant and I see Australian fish there, I know it will be quite expensive, but I can go down the menu and say, 'Oh, there is nice Vietnam barramundi which is a little less expensive.' It is up to me. I am not wealthy, but I know what I would do: I would always, for taste and quality, go for the Australian one and pay five or 10 dollars more at a restaurant. Restaurant owners may well find that a lot of Australians would do that. A lot of people—people particularly who go to restaurants—would say: 'Look, now that I know it is Australian, I am going to pick that piece.' I know Senator Ruston is working on this—and it is not easy. Even for the clubs and pubs it would be so easy for them to put on their blackboards that you can have imported basa and chips at $10 a meal or you can have Australian barramundi at $15 a meal. I do not think that it will stop people going to pubs and clubs or choosing a meal. They might say, 'Well, I'd rather have another beer and the meal that is $10 cheaper, and so I'll have the imported basa with my beer and it'll allow me to have another beer.' That is their choice. The pubs and clubs might find that the reverse actually happens: people might go in and say, 'Would I rather have a bit of Australian fish—better, nicer and it is also helping Australian fishermen—or will I have another beer?' 


I think that is an argument that Senator Ruston is yet to win—it is not for me to speak for her, but I have spoken to her quite a lot. Like Senator Lambie, not in Tasmania but up in my neck of the woods of Queensland, I often speak to fishermen and all they want is a fair go. They simply want Australians to be able to recognise their food and, if they choose to pay a little bit more, to be able to buy it. Often you go to fish and chip shops and it is difficult to work out what sort of fish it is because it is usually covered in very thick—unfortunately for me—too tasty batter which hides the fish a bit. It would be good if we could at least have the choice. I would be happy; I think every Australian consumer and the Australian fishing industry would be happy. Retailers might just find that they are taking more across the counter because Australians would go for Australian fish even at a greater cost. So I urge support for that issue, as I do privately with Senator Ruston and the government. As I say, I have confidence in Senator Ruston continuing to support that issue. 


As this is a debate, can I just mention to Senator Lambie that I certainly agree with her—it is an awful day when we are agreeing with each other so much, Senator Lambie—that this parliament should be prioritising its agendas better. Quite frankly, I am sick of hearing about same-sex marriage. I am sick of hearing about Donald Trump, who I did not elect and who has got nothing to do with me. I am absolutely sick of it. I am sick of hearing the lies about the Barrier Reef—the absolute lies. I am sick of that. Can't we prioritise and get onto the issues that the majority of Australians actually believe in? Senator Lambie—and, again, it is for the minister to explain it better than I—there is a reason why we do not have these plebiscites at elections—and I appreciate the 'cost' argument. If you do it at an election, it becomes part of the political process and people might say, for example: 'Oh, yes, I believe in same-sex marriage so I am going to vote for it But, hang on, that is the one the Labor Party and the Greens are supporting. I don't like the Labor Party and the Greens so I am going to vote no, because I don't want to do anything to support the Labor Party and the Greens.' It gets tied up in the regular election cycle. So I think the vote you would get at a plebiscite held at the same time as an election would be skewed. It would be flawed because it would become part of the process. 


I also agree with you that had we had some assistance from this chamber in what would, I think, be one month's time when we would have had a plebiscite on same-sex marriage that the day after that plebiscite it would be over and finished—whatever way it went. I do not want to restart that argument, but I would vote against same-sex marriage. However, if the majority of Australians said yes then I would come into this chamber and vote yes. I made that very clear. In one month's time that issue could have been resolved—but it will not be. 




Senator Rice:
  Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Would you bring the senator's attention to the bill that is under discussion at the moment, which is about country-of-origin food labelling. I do not think that waxing lyrically about his views on equal marriage is relevant to the bill under consideration. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Rice. Senator Macdonald, there were a number of points of order this morning when another senator was speaking. I know that you have largely spent the time on the bill, but if you could get back to the bill that would be appreciated. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Deputy President. If I can say to Senator Rice, who has just wandered into the chamber: this is a debate in which Senator Lambie in her very sensible contribution mentioned priorities and same-sex marriage. I do not think you took the point of order then, did you? 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I remind you to make your remarks through the chair. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Deputy President—and a timely warning. But did the senator who has just made the point of order make the same point of order when Senator Lambie was talking about same-sex marriage? Senator Lambie has raised the matter in this debate, and because this is a debate in the parliament of Australia I was simply responding—




Senator Rice:
  A point of order, Madam Deputy President. This is a continuation of a discussion which is not about the bill at hand. Senator Lambie indeed did mention same-sex marriage, quite inappropriately, I thought. 



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Rice, you have quite correctly raised a point of order, which I have made a recommendation on. I remind all senators that we are here to speak about the bill before us and that that is what should largely occupy their discussion and their speech. Often they give background, so I am sure Senator Macdonald will get back to the bill in question. 




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you, Deputy President. Again, I repeat that this is a debate in the chamber. I am simply answering something another senator raised and agreeing with that senator that this chamber should prioritise its work; it should move onto important issues—issues that are really important to all Australians; and it should not be diverted by periphery issues such as same-sex marriage, which would have been over and done with in a month's a time had this chamber not denied Australians the opportunity of expressing their views. 


Can I again congratulate the government on bringing forward this bill about country-of-origin labelling for Australian produced products. Under the current regime, the definition of what is made in Australia or the country of origin is somewhat confusing and some of the tests that were in place were even more confusing and less helpful. This bill addresses those issues. It provides businesses with increased certainty about what activities constitute and do not constitute substantial transformation, which is the test for what is made in Australia and what is not. It will make it clear that importing ingredients and undertaking minor processes that merely change the form or appearance of the imported good, such as dicing or canning, are not sufficient to justify the 'made in' wherever claim. The 50 per cent production cost test that currently applies is an unnecessary burden on business and it means little to consumers. The test is difficult to administer, given the complexities of sourcing components through the global supply chain and the variability due to currency fluctuations. These tests in the former bill will become redundant for food products, with the introduction of labels showing the percentage of Australian ingredient. 


Senators will be aware that the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016, which was made under the previous bill, came into effect on 1 July and is being separately tabled in a disallowable instrument in this parliament. That standard, which is the one we have been waiting for for some years, requires mandatory country-of-origin labelling for food that is sold, offered or displayed for sale in Australia. Unfortunately, it does not, for various reasons, impose labelling requirements on food sold outside Australia. This new label will help Australians, almost at a glance, work out how much of the particular product is Australian made or sourced.


Through the information standard, most Australian foods will need to carry a label with a clearly defined box containing a kangaroo-in-the-triangle logo to indicate that the food is grown, produced or made in Australia. It will also have—and this is the bit I like—a bar chart that indicates the proportion of Australian ingredients in the food and the box will also have a statement summarising the visual information. That bar chart will show us at a glance, as we go to the supermarket, how much of a product really is Australian.


I do not see that as a protectionist policy, because many people—and I accept this—will buy their food on price. Many people who do not have big incomes or who are on welfare or who have big families will say, 'I choose that because it's cheaper,' but they will do it in the full knowledge of just how much of the particular product is really Australian and how much is not. I think that is a wonderful step forward. It has been, as one other senator in this debate commented, a long time coming.


I know in our party—and, I suspect, in the other parties as well—we have had debates over many years. I am sure the Labor Party would have been through this because they did nothing in the six years they were in government. But they would have come across the same complexities that we have confronted over the last 20 years that I have been here, and we have been talking about it all that time. It is a difficult situation to get right without pricing the product out of the reach of anyone through complexity of regulation. It has been difficult. I guess some will say, 'It's not perfect; we can do better.' I know the government is always keen to get any views on this. I think the place where we have landed is pretty good. I think you will find that most Australians will appreciate the ability to make an informed choice now on what food they buy.


I conclude by agreeing with the committee that Senator Xenophon said has looked at this and has recommended the bill be passed. I also agree, as I explained before, with Senator Xenophon and Senator Lambie that we have to do something about seafood not in supermarkets. Thanks to a very good minister several years ago, that is already in place in the supermarkets. But in fish and chip shops, hotels, clubs and restaurants, I think we can do it without placing an unrealistic burden on those retail institutions. I wish Senator Ruston all the best as she takes that argument forward. Clearly, I support the bill. I think it is a real step forward for Australia.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-02-08,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (12:34):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to support the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. Before speaking further, though, I want to make clear that I support Senator Macdonald's comments supporting freedom of choice because that is what is at the heart of this bill: informed freedom of choice. I also support his comments on the Great Barrier Reef.


This bill, though, seeks to clarify and improve consumer law by amending schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. The bill is primarily intended to simplify the tests used to justify a country of origin 'made in' claim by clarifying what the phrase 'substantial transformation' really means and by removing the 50 per cent production cost test. This bill tightens the definition of what is really Australian made in the country-of-origin food labelling requirements. It makes 'country of origin' or 'Australian made' legitimate.


I understand that this bill forms part of the government's broader country-of-origin labelling package, previously agreed by the states, along with the Country of Origin Food Labelling Information Standard 2016 which commenced last year. Currently, the definition of 'Australian made' is based on having at least 50 per cent Australian production cost, which leads to misleading labelling of foreign foods as 'made in Australia' when in fact they may have only been minimally processed in Australia. Under this bill, the country-of-origin labelling requirements for food will be strengthened and moved to an information standard under the Australian Consumer Law. The new labels for food will include a bar chart to indicate the proportion of Australian ingredients in the food. As part of this process, foods grown, produced or made in Australia will be identified by the traditional kangaroo-in-a-triangle Australian made symbol.


I congratulate the government for adopting this measure, as this is exactly the approach Pauline Hanson's One Nation Political Party has been advocating as policy for many years. As a One Nation senator for Queensland, I am strongly committed to supporting Australian grown, packaged and manufactured goods and products, and our party is strongly committed to identifying and promoting genuinely Australian made products and exposing bogus Australian-sounding imports as frauds. Of course, this bill is just the latest in a long line of excellent One Nation policies adopted by the government. There is another one and that is coal-fired power. What a remarkable change in just three months. Sadly, our own Queensland Premier says 'no more coal-fired power stations'. So I can only express my hope that this bill is but the next of many more One Nation policies that the government will choose to adopt in the future.


However, one pressing issue regarding food imports that this bill does not consider is the allowing of contaminated foodstuffs into Australia and the blending of imported foodstuffs with Australian produce in bonded warehouses prior to importation. This wholly inappropriate practice, which may only be revealed on the label of foodstuffs as 'contains mix of Australian and imported ingredients', needs to be prohibited. Perniciously, in the case of peanuts for example, I understand that this blending prior to import inspection is done because the much cheaper imported ingredients contain levels of contaminants that do not meet Australian health standards.


Peanuts are notorious for absorbing any available cadmium from the soil in which they grow. Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the human body and is a major cause of adult kidney failure. Thanks to the clean unpolluted Australian environment, Australian grown peanuts contain no cadmium, while Chinese peanuts, as a result of their proximity to polluting Chinese heavy industries, may be heavily contaminated with this poison. Because of the serious health risk that they pose, contaminated Chinese peanuts should be considered a prohibited import. Reprehensibly, in order to maximize profits, unscrupulous importers have sought to subvert Australia's food health standards and import restrictions by importing these cheap, cadmium contaminated Chinese peanuts and, I understand, blending them with cadmium free Australian peanuts in bonded warehouses, prior to customs inspections. Food that is imported into Australia is regulated by the Imported Food Control Act 1992 and the Imported Food Control Regulations 1993. Together, these statutes provide for the Food Inspection Scheme. Currently all imported peanuts are classified as a risk food as a result of the danger of cadmium contamination.


Even though all food products ultimately offered for sale in Australia must meet our health standards, experts have argued that in some areas, such as heavy metal contamination, health regulations may reflect 1950s 'acceptable' contamination limits and are seriously out of date. Thus, while schedule 19 of the Australian New Zealand Food Standards Code sets the maximum allowable level of cadmium that may be contained in peanuts as 0.5mg/kg, given that virtually any cadmium—any cadmium—consumed remains in the body for life, most medical experts today argue that there are no truly safe levels of cumulative toxins like cadmium, and therefore the safest course is to avoid any food exposure at all.


Accordingly, whilst it goes beyond the scope of the bill currently under consideration, I strongly urge the government to outlaw practices such as the blending of Australian and imported goods prior to food safety testing, and to declare peanuts containing cadmium a prohibited import. This will eliminate a very real and totally unnecessary threat to the health of Australians.


For the information of the Australian people, to my knowledge only Dick Smith brand peanut butter is made with exclusively Australian peanuts, which are of course cadmium free. Until such time as this issue is addressed and cadmium contaminated peanuts are declared a prohibited import, I urge all Australians who value their kidneys to read the country-of-origin label on peanuts and eat only safe Australian grown peanuts, and consider buying only Dick Smith brand peanut butter.


While supportive of this legislation, I believe we as a parliament need to address the core issue for bringing back Australian food production, both in quality and quantity, and bringing back manufacturing. After 42 years of de-industrialisation under Liberal/National coalitions and under Labor/Greens coalitions, we must re-industrialise our country. To re-industrialise we must face up to the core issue: comprehensive tax reform at the state and federal levels, instead of window-dressing.


Further, to continue with Senator Macdonald comments on the fishing industry, it is my understanding that this island on which we live is the largest in the world and yet we import almost three-quarters of the seafood we eat. All that Australian farmers, fishermen and manufacturers want is a fair go. Ultimately, this bill gives people an informed freedom of choice. Notwithstanding the issues of toxins and tax, I otherwise commend this legislation to the Senate.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (12:42):  In 1993, or around then, I came to this building in Canberra to lobby friends in the National Party for country-of-origin labelling, because the then Hawke/Keating Labor government allowed the importation of pig meat from places such as Denmark and Canada. My brother, Peter, and I had a 100-sow piggery, feeding about 1,000 pigs a day and I found it quite frustrating that they would import pig meat into Australia, process it into ham, and brand it 'Manufactured in Australia' or 'Product of Australia'. It was so misleading. All I wanted was a fair go to see that the Australian people knew what they were buying—whether it was grown in Australia, processed in Australia, imported, processed here from Australian and imported blends et cetera.


Since 1993 it has been a long, frustrating road, I can assure you. We all know that the wheels of parliament do not go very fast. During the berry contamination issue about 18 months ago, where many Australians contracted hepatitis because of some imported berries, I stood up in the joint party room—Senator Sinodinos was there—and said to the then Prime Minister, 'Mr Abbott, we need a country-of-origin food labelling system so that people can clarify what they are buying and eating.' To his full credit, Mr Abbott said, 'Let's get on with it.' That is where we have come to right along this road of country-of-origin labelling.


It will be good to see the Australian kangaroo and the green triangle—a very well-known label that is very familiar, I would say, to all shoppers in Australia. It will have 'Grown in Australia' and the bar code underneath will be completely orange. You will know that the food you are about to eat for the can of whatever you are purchasing was grown, processed and packaged here in Australia. It will show the blends that will come forward—what percentage is actually made from imported ingredients and from Australian ingredients. I must agree with Senator Macdonald as far as the fishing industry goes. Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you were on a committee with us in the Northern Territory. What a great thing it is that Northern Territorians know exactly where their fish is coming from—70 per cent imported. I think that is where we need to make progress as well, on that very issue. All we are asking is that people know what they are eating and where it comes from.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  We all know in this place that those of us in parliament are, quite rightly, the subject of full accountability and transparency. My contribution today, unfortunately, reflects the fact that I do not think the same standards are being applied to Australia's judiciary. I am very concerned about this, and I want to draw it to the attention of the chamber. 


I will conclude my comments with a reference to the Nagle case in the High Court of Australia between the Rottnest Island Authority and Nagle in the 1990s, but I want to lead off this discussion with the regrettable incidents that led to the Lindt cafe siege on 15 December 2014. The gentleman involved, Man Monis, had been the subject of the courts: in 2009, the New South Wales court, because he had been writing letters to the families of deceased soldiers and others; in 2011, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sydney; and in 2014 he goes to the High Court of Australia on a postal service related matter. In May 2014, the man is granted bail by Magistrate Joan Baptie in New South Wales, despite her acknowledging that he may endanger the safety of victims, individuals and the community and that he may interfere with witnesses or evidence. She grants the man bail because she thought there were 'significant flaws in the Crown's case'. In October 2014, this man is again charged, this time with 40 sexual assault charges against six women. He applies for bail; Magistrate Dorelle Pinch gives him bail. He is due back in court on 12 December, which is deferred to February 2015. In the meantime, he causes the Lindt cafe siege and the death of two innocent people.


I go to 2 November 2016. In Queensland, Magistrate Trevor Morgan is in the Pine Rivers judiciary. Three young women are apprehended on the roof of the office of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton. This is the magistrate's comment to them in finding them guilty:


… if one of my daughters was caught doing like you did, I'd probably be very proud of her.


He fines them $100, despite more than $10,000 of legal and police costs. What happens on 29 November, two weeks later? At least one, if not more, of those young women are down here in Parliament House vandalising furniture and disrupting question time in the other place.


I go to the Gargasoulas incident in Bourke Street in Melbourne, on 20 January. Again, this is not an incident I want to speak about in great detail. What do we find there? This gentleman, with a long history of domestic violence, had been granted bail over and above the pleas and objections of the police. He was due to appear in court on that same day, 20 January, but what did he do? We all saw it, so I will say it: he allegedly committed a heinous crime in which, to date, six people have been killed.


Only the other day, when I was in Queensland for a Senate hearing, I heard about the tragic death of Teresa Bradford on 31 January, only a week ago. In November 2016, her estranged husband is placed into custody because of what would be alleged to be a horrific attack on her, and yet, in the middle of January, the gentleman is granted bail, again over the urgent pleas of the police. She is not warned of the fact that he has been let out on bail. On 31 January she is murdered and he suicides in front of their four children. 


I ask the question: what is bail all about? The act instructs the court to start with the presumption that an accused person should be granted bail unless there is a justified reason to refuse it. What might the reasons be? The nature and the seriousness of the crime; the character of the defendant; past criminal record; association; ties with the community; the defendant's record in regard to previous commitments to bail; the strength of the evidence—where are the words relating to the victim in all of this and in the cases that I have referred to? 


Nagle was a most interesting case, and it led to the rewriting of public liability practice in this country. In 1977, Mr Nagle was an employee at Rottnest Island in Western Australia. As you, Senator Sterle, would know as well as I do, there is a place called The Basin there. Tens of millions of people have swum at The Basin; it is probably the safest spot to swim. The man goes to The Basin on a Saturday morning. Instead of going straight into the water he walks 50 metres over sharp rocks and dives into the water and comes out a quadriplegic. It was absolutely tragic, and I am not suggesting the Australian community should not support him. I was the chief executive at Rottnest Island when he brought an action against the island authority on the public liability basis that there should have been a sign to say there were rocks. You know, as I know, the island is a rock—as Senator Cash also well knows. We won the case in the Supreme Court in 1989. There was an appeal to the appeals court in Perth. We won that in 1991, and yet it went to the High Court of Australia in 1993 and it was lost. I begged and pleaded to be allowed to be a witness before the High Court of Australia, as the chief executive of the island authority, and was not allowed to do so. So we went from being zero per cent culpable to 100 per cent culpable in that case. It cost the island authority millions of dollars in legal costs and in the public liability space, and it changed things completely. It is the reason why playgrounds were pulled out of schools and removed by local governments around Australia—because, on the basis of the Nagle case, public liability payments were made. The then governor of the state, Sir Francis Burt, a person known to Senator Cash and her family, had been the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He said to me, 'Chris, I'll tell you two things. Firstly, it will be seen as the worst judgement in the history of the High Court. Secondly, it won't help you, but over time they will pull out the planks in the platform.' 


I was talking on one occasion to retired High Court judge Sir Ronald Wilson as we walked along the Canning River in Mount Pleasant, and I said to him, 'Sir Ronald, if you were still on the High Court of Australia, we wouldn't have lost the case.' And he said, 'Chris, why would you say that?' I said, 'Because the information available to me, Sir Ronald, is that the justices of the High Court took the basin at Rottnest to be akin to the gap in Sydney, and in their minds' eyes you would obviously expect signs at the gap in Sydney.' He said to me, 'That can't be right.' I happened to be walking with him again some weeks later and he drew my attention to that conversation. He said, 'I've actually made some inquiries, Chris, and do you know you were right?' He said, 'I'm not saying the judgement swung on that, but in the minds' eyes of those justices from the eastern states of Australia, the basin was like the gap in Sydney.' 


And so we had a circumstance then where not only did we go from being zero per cent culpable to 100 per cent culpable, but the High Court got it wrong. But there is no right of appeal to the High Court of Australia. And, as I said, we were not allowed to appear as witnesses. We were not allowed to present evidence. The very first movie ever made in the state of Western Australia was that of people swimming at the basin. The concept of putting a sign on a limestone rock called 'the island' saying 'there might be rocks here' is a nonsense. The sign, for example, might not be illuminated at night; it might not be able to be read by people who cannot read English; it might be too high for children, or too low for others.


It did interest me, incidentally, that witnesses were permitted only the other day when the matter of our past colleague former Senator Bob Day was dealt with in the High Court of Australia. Then former Senator Anne McEwen had a representation of witnesses to the High Court of Australia. Our QC at the time was Michael Murray QC, who went on to become, if I am not wrong—through you, Chair, to Senator Cash—a Supreme Court judge himself. Michael Murray said to me in preparing for the case, 'Tell me why you cannot comprehend that this man has either made a mistake or that he should have known that he was amongst rocks.' I said to him, 'Michael, if I was walking across Subiaco football oval I might reasonably expect to be hit on the head by a football, but I wouldn't expect to be hit by a train. And yet if I walked over sharp rocks barefooted'—which I have done incidentally—'for 50 metres, it must surely be in my mind's eye that I am amongst rocks.' The judiciary needs to be far more transparent and far more accountable.

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:03):  The communities should have some confidence that the services have improved, because the administration of the choices of which programs you have and how you make sure you write those contracts on the ground has very little to do with the actual outcomes. The ANAO only deals with the bureaucratic process of selecting the programs and ensuring that those programs are on the ground. It makes very little commentary or evaluation of the success or otherwise of the programs on the ground. This is a historical document. Since then, Senator, you would know we have already released revised guidelines, we have given a stronger role to the regional staff in the network and we have established a strengthened Assessment Management Office. We have accepted those recommendations of the ANAO report, and they have all, by and large, already been adopted, because it was historical. (Time expired)

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:00):  First of all, I would like to acknowledge that it is a very comprehensive report. It is a historical report. It is a report about matters that took place 2½ years ago. I am sure the Auditor-General would not appreciate the senator both misleading the Senate and verballing him when he says that the report said that there is no evidence to show improved outcomes. The report says nothing of the sort. You cannot continue to just say things and expect people to believe them. He says we cut out of Indigenous funding $536 million. I actually had to write to Linda Burney and I am not sure, brother, if I am going to have to write to you. But we have said time and time again in this place that that is simply not correct.




Senator Cameron:
  On a point of order, the senator should refer to people in the other place by their proper title.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, that is correct, Senator Cameron. I will remind senators that you do need to refer to members of the other place by their correct titles.




Senator SCULLION:
  My apologies for that, Mr President. I cannot recall from this place what the name of her electorate is. I thought Ms Linda Burney would have cut it. I am genuinely not—




Senator Wong:
  Just call her Ms Burney.




Senator SCULLION:
  Ms Burney, thank you for that.


If I could just correct the record again, the cuts at that time were less than five per cent. It was half of that number. In fact, the amount of money that you have quoted, listed in your speech, is the half of the total amount of the cut that was used to provide this report, to put that in context, Senator. This is bureaucratic report, a very important report for bureaucrats about what box was ticked and what box was not ticked. One of the most important omissions in this report, which we will be talking about in the months to come, is the omission of how we actually judge the outcomes on the ground. This is about how the bureaucracy behaved. What is really important to me is what actually happens to the people on the ground and how we make that assessment. (Time expired)

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (14:05):  Senator Dodson, that is exactly what happened here. When the ANAO made their recommendation, they said: 'Well, you weren't given the right information. You didn't get enough information, Minister, as you said last night.' They did not take into consideration the other information we had in making these decisions. That information came from communities, came from the people receiving the services, came from the organisations that represented those communities. If the ANAO had come and seen me and said, 'What were the other issues you had to actually make those determinations?' we would have said, 'Because of the change in our approach of working with communities instead of doing something to communities.' So yes, this is a fundamental change about how governments have done things for decades and decades. I can assure you this is the best way to do things with communities, by ensuring that they have a bigger input into this process than the administrative processes of Canberra.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) and the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to questions without notice asked by Senators Dodson and McCarthy today relating to the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and to the shortwave radio service provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 


I have listened carefully to the answers from the ministers, particularly Senator Scullion, and I am disappointed, I must say, because when I look at page 15 of the audit report, at point 1.2 he would see that the report refers to the 2014-15 budget report that reported that the Australian government, by the adoption of the IAS, would save $534.4 million over five years by rationalising Indigenous programs, grants and activities. The five per cent he referred to was a five per cent cut over the programs in order to sustain them in the shemozzle that was going on in the implementation. I am disappointed, and in relation to some of the other matters he raised I would also turn him to page 23 of the audit report to see what is said there. 


I am disappointed that he is not taking the findings of the ANAO report to heart in a thoughtful and considered way. Senator Scullion said that the findings should be viewed as historical in nature, but Professor Langton said: 


One would think there'd be a policy response instead of lame denials. 


I agree with Professor Langton on this issue. His answers did not articulate to me a way forward beyond the current policy settings that have led to the problems that the audit office has shone light upon. The minister has focused his grand hopes for a new world order on a proposed multi-year program of evidence and evaluation activities in a contracted program at outcomes level. This new program will take, as I am informed, $10 million a year from the IAS—the Indigenous Advancement Strategy—over five years to evaluate the program. I am informed this is not new money. This is money that has been taken from addressing the issues on the ground and diverted, probably to the consultancy industry, to do the evaluations. It is patching up some of the failings by the minister's department in failing to have appropriate evaluation processes in place in the first instance. 


The minister argued in his press release on 3 February:


Evaluation at the contract, program and outcome level will ensure we not only know where the money is being spent, but we will know what works and why.


The Audit Office clearly shows that you, Minister, have not had any real sense of the answer to these questions. You are now putting funds into finding answers to some of the questions you should already have known the answers to—that is, where the money is being spent, what works and why.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and their organisations have many answers as to what works, and they have a collective resource of knowledge as to why it works. That comes through again and again in the views expressed by the informed academics, by community organisations and by the people whose lives are grounded in the reality in which they live.


The answer is to engage the community and their organisations on the grounds of a genuine partnership. This is the rhetoric of the IAS, the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, coming out of the department, and I have heard it. In your answer, it is not the reality. It is not the lived reality of our people, who have suffered through the IAS fiasco. It is not the case today, and it was not the case in the period of the audit review. I agree wholeheartedly with the minister that it is important for the government and the taxpayers but more important for the communities in whose name the money is being spent. (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:09):  I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate. No government, and no side of politics, can claim to have found policy nirvana in the area of Indigenous affairs as long as Indigenous Australians continue to experience a life which is nowhere near in line with that of their fellow Australians. There is work that we all need to do to get closer to better policy outcomes for Indigenous Australians, but this government is making a real effort to get closer to that situation, and I commend the minister's efforts, including through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, to make those gains and those improvements.


The Indigenous Advancement Strategy has greatly improved the transparency and accountability of Indigenous affairs funding. As a result of the coalition government's IAS reforms, we now know, for the first time, how much money is being spent across the Indigenous Affairs portfolio and what outcomes we can expect for the investment of taxpayers' money. That sounds like an extraordinary thing to say in 2017—that it is only now that we know how much money is being spent on Indigenous advancement—but that is an important reform achieved by this government.


The IAS introduced reforms that were long overdue and essential to ensure that our investment in Indigenous affairs was getting to where it would be the most effective. Importantly, frontline service delivery was maintained and outcomes were improved through the introduction of the IAS. Through the 2014 grant funding round, the percentage of Indigenous organisations funded increased from 30 per cent to 45 per cent.


But, as I said, we can always do better. That is why—and I think this is very crucial—the government plans to allocate $10 million a year over the next four years to strengthen the evaluation of the IAS programs. That is one of the key pieces of feedback we have had in recent years, and I note particularly the excellent work done by Sara Hudson at the Centre for Independent Studies and the importance that she and other scholars in this area place on the evaluation of the effectiveness of programs, because we need to ensure that money being spent in this area is actually improving the lives of Indigenous Australians. This evaluation will ensure that we know what works and, importantly, why.


The IAS has three key priorities. The first is getting children to school, the second is getting adults to work, and the third is making communities safer. These are three objectives that I am sure all senators share. The IAS is focused on these priorities because that is what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have said they want the government to deliver. We have listened, we are learning, and that is the feedback we have received. These are fundamental to improving the outcomes for First Australians.


Already the Indigenous Advancement Strategy is making a difference. Around 60 First Australians are being placed into jobs every single day. The Remote School Attendance Strategy is helping approximately 14,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children get to school. Through our Indigenous Procurement Policy, millions of dollars in Commonwealth contracts are going to Indigenous businesses every year. This is a really important strategy to help encourage Indigenous entrepreneurship and allow them to start businesses that will help lift them out of poverty.


The government's IAS brought together 150 programs and activities into five broad streams. It consolidated some of the 1,800 staff from across eight different departments and agencies into the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and created a regional network which is now working in partnership with Indigenous communities across urban, regional and remote Australia. These reforms have enabled a far more strategic and flexible approach to the government's investment in Indigenous affairs to achieve better outcomes on the ground while also relieving the administrative burden and red tape from organisations servicing Indigenous communities. The IAS has delivered on this government's commitment to doing things with Indigenous Australians, including by increasing the percentage of Indigenous organisations funded, as I said earlier, from 30 per cent to 45 per cent under the grant funding round.


As I said at the beginning of my contribution to this discussion, no government can claim to have found the perfect solution to any of the problems that the Indigenous community faces, but this government is making a very good effort to get closer to that situation, and we are seeing very real gains from this government's Indigenous affairs policies. I hope to see that continue over the coming years.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:13):  The responses to my questions to Senator Fifield as Minister for Communications in relation to the ABC's removal of its short-wave radio services across northern Australia and indeed the Pacific confirm what a total disaster and disgrace this decision has been. The minister admits that consultation has been totally inadequate. The next question is: what are you going to do about it?


The removal of short-wave services to the people of the remote regions of northern Australia is a life-and-death issue. It matters. It matters to the people on the ground, from our communities, our cattle stations and along the coastlines to our fishing communities and the truckies who travel the roads in those most remote regions. If ever there was a case that showed the huge city-country divide, this decision certainly wins the gold medal.


In terms of short-wave radio, in the responses by the minister, he said the ABC made this decision and that it is in no way related to funding—that the ABC has base funding confirmed for the next three years. However, in the discussions I, along with our shadow communications minister, Mark Dreyfus, had with the managing director of the ABC, Michelle Guthrie, she said that it was related to funding and that, as a result of contractual relationships and discussions with Broadcast Australia, this was a decision the ABC had to make.


I say to the Senate that the decision to remove a very vital service to the people of northern Australia and giving only seven weeks notice—in the first week of December, going into Christmas and New Year, when people could not give their full attention to responding urgently to this issue in an adequate way—that on 31 January this service would be turned off is totally appalling. Having the Minister for Communications confirm that the consultation which the ABC says it took was not adequate means that there must be movement now to look into this and to reinstate the service to the people of northern Australia and all those in the Pacific who rely on this very critical service. 


I acknowledge also the work of my colleagues Warren Snowdon MP, Luke Gosling MP, Mark Dreyfus MP, Stephen Jones MP and even the Leader of the Opposition in writing to the Prime Minister, urging him to act, saying that we need this service. We are not there yet.


Now, Minister Fifield said in his response that the ABC has relented slightly by donating certain equipment. Well, hello, that equipment will not work. We do not have the technology in the Northern Territory, compared to our brothers and sisters in the cities of Australia. We want to have that technology, but we are not there yet. We rely solely on the short-wave radio service beyond so many kilometres of the main cities of Darwin and Alice Springs. This is a completely disastrous decision. The VAST services which the ABC says is what the digital move is towards will not work for us—not yet. We want to be there, but we are not there yet. 


The best thing that this government can do is provide the moneys necessary to get short-wave radio back up and running in northern Australia and in the Pacific so that these people in remote and regional parts of Australia do not lose the communication that they so very much deserve.

Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (15:19):  I am grateful also for the opportunity to speak on the matters that have been brought to the attention of the Senate through the questions from senators McCarthy and Dodson. I appreciate the perspective they bring, coming from the communities they do, having spent a bit of time with those communities myself, particularly in the Northern Territory last year, and seeing firsthand some of the issues they face in that region.


I start with the answers from the Minister for Communications that Senator McCarthy was referring to. It is an interesting juxtaposition, I suppose you could say, with regard to what this question was getting at. On the one hand, the opposition demand the independence of the ABC, which the minister referred to in his answer—that the ABC has legislated independence—but, on the other hand, they demand that there be an intervention. I accept that there are concerns and issues around what is taking place with the cessation of the short-wave service. But you cannot have it both ways. The ABC Board, as the minister said, had gone through the process they needed to go through and had made a decision. In view of the reference to the ageing technology of the short-wave service and the cost of maintaining it, is it the best deal that the Northern Territory community can get? That is a question that I think remains unanswered.


In addressing this, I just wonder whether it is the ALP's plan to take back control of operational decisions made by the ABC Board. Is Senator McCarthy, in asking that question, insisting that Senator Fifield intervene; and, if so, is that what the Labor Party would do if they were returned to the treasury bench? On the point about budgetary constraints made by Senator McCarthy, Senator McCarthy said she spoke to the managing director of the ABC and claims that Ms Guthrie made claims that it was related to budget cuts, and I will be very interested in exploring that exact issue with her at Senate estimates in a couple of weeks time. But the minister said that this matter was not related to that. It is always interesting to hear what people have to say about these things, and, as I said, I will be interested to hear what Ms Guthrie has to say about it when we get the chance to speak to her about it.


The Minister for Communications did outline the transitional arrangements that the ABC is assisting with, including the provision of VAST satellite services to a number of organisations, including all Royal Flying Doctor Service bases, which I think is a vital and important part of making sure that communications still operate. The RFDS provide an incredibly important service right throughout that community affected. Also for all of the four-wheel drive radio clubs in the affected region, which will allow the rebroadcast of emergency or warning messages, which I think is important.


The minister did stress that this was not a decision taken lightly by the ABC. Indeed, he also expressed his views about the community reaction around the consultation process, so I think that must be taken into account. But, going back to the original point, we also need to take into account the independence of the ABC board and how they make their decisions. So I believe it is not entirely fair to come in here and say: 'Fix it! Go and fix it!' when there are legislated mechanisms around how the ABC make these decisions.



Turning briefly to the answers that Senator Dodson made a contribution on a little bit earlier, I think I can only reinforce the points made by Senator Paterson. The key one is around the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and the point that when we have knowledge about services being provided and the funds being provided it allows us to understand properly where we need to go from the current point in time. I think the point was made by Senator Paterson and indeed by the minister that there is always room for improvement, which I think is a very mature acknowledgement for any government minister or any senator to make. I think it is the right one. I do not think there is anyone sitting here saying, 'Yep, it's absolutely perfect.' I think Senator Paterson referred to it as policy nirvana with regard to this particular portfolio. It is important to note that this is about giving us that knowledge so that we know from here where to go. There is work to be done. I just think that we need to get some reason into our debates in this place and not demand what we cannot have. (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:24):  I also rise to take note of the answers provided to Senators McCarthy and Dodson by Senators Fifield and Scullion on the cessation of ABC's short-wave radio and the poor management of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy grants. What these senators on my left were asking were simple questions—which I think could have been given very clear answers, but were not—on critical services that apply to rural and regional Australia and also to Indigenous Australians. They were very simple questions and they both were at the heart of clear problems with the Abbott-Turnbull government's cuts to vital services and lack of consultation. We see that very clearly.


The cessation of the short-wave radio service is yet another example of Prime Minister Turnbull's confusion over innovation and reality. The ABC and the government have displayed a complete lack of understanding of the services in communications that are available to people in remote outback Australia. People have been told that they should subscribe to the new viewer access satellite TV, satellite phones and internet services. But this advice completely misses the point that these services are scratchy at best and are not available to people on the move. As Minister Scullion surely knows and as I would hope Minister Fifield knows, it can take many hours to travel from one end of one property to another, and if the weather is inclement satellite services may not even work across that journey. It is as though the ministers expect the people of remote Northern Territory to travel the countryside in a massive bus akin to the one in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, with a huge, outrageous satellite on the top. It is not the reality of what we would expect.


Because of the campaigning of Senator McCarthy and our colleagues in the lower house, Mr Gosling and Mr Snowdon, the government was forced to at least make a comment on this issue. But late in the peace, just a few weeks before the short-wave service was to be cut, Minister Scullion made a late attempt to save face with his constituents in the outback. But his worth in cabinet must be questioned because all his colleague Minister Fifield can do is blame the ABC for a decision that this government made to cut that back. Both ministers have a very shorty memory about their budget cuts to the ABC, but they are trying to hide the fact that under their watch $254 million have been cut from the ABC's budget. Now all they can say about these services is, 'It's the ABC's decision.' Of course the ABC has to make decisions around budget cuts when the cuts are coming from this government.


It is also important to note that this cut to short-wave services—as I think Senator McCarthy made reference to—does not just affect Australians. Millions of people in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and right across the breadth of the South Pacific rely also on short-wave radio for information on natural disasters—this is an area which we know has a number of these—and news about the world. At a time when China, New Zealand, the UK and Germany are expanding their short-wave services into the Pacific, the Turnbull government sleeps at the wheel and completely lacks any understanding of the availability of digital satellite technology in remote communities across the Pacific and across the top of Australia. Do the minister and the Prime Minister seriously believe that people in remote villages on Pacific islands have access to digital radios? Come on. It is a critical time for Australia and the Pacific, with the referendum in Bougainville coming up, with the withdrawal of RAMSI in the Solomon Islands and with the push by China and other people to increase their influence. And yet this government cuts off our direct line to the people. For what? A total saving for the ABC of $1.8 million. It is outrageous.


The ABC and the government have claimed that another reason for ending the short-wave service is a lack of understanding about the number of listeners. And yet there is evidence from Papua New Guinea that over 20 per cent of that population listen to Radio Australia either on the day of that survey or the day before. Minister Fifield spent a lot of time blaming the ABC board for this decision. I think it is time that the ministers in this government stood up and represented the people in those communities and listened to the people in those communities about their needs. (Time expired)

  Responsibility for ensuring that miners comply with their rehabilitation obligations rests primarily with state and territory governments, and not with the Commonwealth.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:46):  I table the explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Representation) Bill 2017 reflects the Australian Government's ongoing commitment to the long-term sustainable use and development of Australia's fisheries resources. The Australian Government continues to work with all


fisheries users—commercial, recreational and Indigenous to ensure ecologically sustainable 


development and achieve the maximum benefit to the Australian community of this important and publicly owned resource.


Our fisheries management framework is internationally recognised as one of the best in the world. In 2015 no fish stock managed solely by the Commonwealth was subject to overfishing, ensuring the sustainability of Australia's fisheries for the benefit of present and future generations of Australians.


Commonwealth fisheries legislation primarily regulates the commercial harvest of fish stocks in Commonwealth fisheries to ensure catch rates and fish stocks are at sustainable levels. However in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of recreational fishing occurring in Commonwealth waters.


By recognising and taking the interests of all users into account in the Commonwealth fisheries management framework, the government can enhance regulatory certainty and improve access to Commonwealth fish stocks consistent with their optimal use as a public resource.


As significant stakeholders in Commonwealth fisheries it is important that recreational fishers' interests can be readily identified and taken into consideration by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).


Recreational fishers have an interest in a number of fish stocks managed by the Australian Government. Considering their interests as part of the fisheries management framework is important both for ensuring sustainable fish stocks and for optimising the benefits of our fisheries resources for the Australian community. Proposed amendments will address this, ensuring that legislation keeps pace with the changes in use of Commonwealth waters and thus stays effective in ensuring sustainable management of the resource.


Fishing by Indigenous Australians should also be recognised as a sector in its own right in fishery management regimes, including for any traditional customary fishing rights. It is important that governments recognise and understand the strong relationship Indigenous people have with fishery resources and ensure the fisheries management frameworks appropriately accommodate sustainable cultural fishing through greater and more meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities.


The amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 will ensure that the interests of all fisheries users are adequately represented, and taken into consideration in fisheries management decisions.


This Bill provides greater certainty to stakeholder groups regarding the extent to which their interests should be identified, represented and considered by AFMA. It also allows for greater membership of all interested parties on management advisory committees.


The inclusion of a new objective in both Acts ensures that legislation keeps pace with the changes in use of Commonwealth managed fish stocks, particularly given the increasing presence of recreational fishers in Commonwealth waters. It improves transparency and provides formal mechanisms for recreational and Indigenous fishers to voice their views regarding proposed changes in management decisions.

















2






The inclusion of an additional objective is consistent with representations from recreational fishers and Indigenous advisory bodies. Submissions by these sectors to the recent Productivity Commission Inquiry into the Regulation of Australian Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture Sectors called for legislative recognition of the two sectors as well as greater involvement in AFMA's decision-making framework.


In addition to a new objective, the Bill amends the eligibility criteria for the appointment of AFMA Commissioners. The criteria will be expanded to include the addition of expertise in matters relating to recreational and Indigenous fishing.


Broadening the eligibility criteria of AFMA Commissioners to include expertise in matters relating to recreational and Indigenous fishers will enhance the capacity of the AFMA Commission to respond to future challenges in fisheries management.


Finally, the Bill increases the maximum number of members on AFMA's Management Advisory Committees from seven to 10. It also includes a requirement for AFMA to actively seek, as far as practicable, recreational fishing members on relevant Management Advisory Committees. These amendments will ensure that there is greater opportunity for key fisheries stakeholders to be appropriately represented on Management Advisory Committees.


Importantly, the Bill strengthens the voice of recreational fishers and Indigenous stakeholders in regard to the management of Commonwealth fisheries without compromising the Commonwealths world class fisheries management framework.



The PRESIDENT:  In accordance with standing order 111, further consideration of this bill is now adjourned to 20 March this year.

Leave granted.




Senator LAMBIE:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard and to continue my remarks.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I rise to present to the Australian Senate a Private Senators' Bill – the Criminal Code Amendment (Prohibition of Full Face Coverings in Public Places) Bill 2017.


The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Criminal Code Act 1995 to increase security in all public places covered under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and promote civil harmony and assimilation in a climate of increasing public safety issues. 


This Private Senators' Bill will make it an offence to wear full face coverings in a public place under Commonwealth jurisdiction, as well as forcing another person or child to wear a full face covering - unless otherwise authorised or excused by law.


In Australia, the threat from organised crime and terrorism is real. Members of our military are overseas helping fight a war that has been declared on Australia and our democratic allies by organised extremists because of who we are and our love for democracy. Gone are the easy days of the past where we knew and trusted our neighbours and left our backdoors unlocked. 


In this time of heightened security the safety and feelings of safety for members of the Australian public and a guarantee of open communication between citizens must be paramount. 


There is a clear national security need to bring in a nationwide ban on all identity concealing garments, unless the wearer has a reasonable and lawful excuse to wear those garments.


And while some small groups of people may make an argument that their right to express their religious feelings or views by wearing identity concealing garments is being limited, the security and the safety of the community must always come first. 


Moreover, the community must feel safe. Full face coverings such as helmets, masks, balaclavas and other facial coverings worn in public without good reason, often cause unnecessary fear with the Australian general public. Therefore, the security and safety will be enhanced with the introduction of this Bill.


I remind the people who argue that this Bill impacts on the religious freedoms of some groups of people living in Australia that linking the restrictions on facial coverings to the National Terrorism Threat Level is a reasonable and balanced approach to maintaining and enhancing public security. Especially at a time when our security agencies are certain that further deadly public attacks by extremists and enemies of Australia will happen.


Therefore the right to feel safe in public places for the general public in a secular, democratic society, in a time of extreme threat from terrorism - must always outweigh the right for expression of religious freedom.


Australians are not the only people who have expressed concerns and feel unsafe when citizens wear full face coverings without good reason in public. 


As a secular State, France has already banned face coverings in public spaces, including masks, helmets, balaclavas, burqas and niqabs. In France, the law defines public space to include the street, museums, shops, public transportation, parks, banks and even during the course of employment within the public sector. According to Parliamentary Library research, Belgium and Turkey have also successfully implemented similar laws. 


Even a number of Muslim countries have 'banned the burqa' as it were, recognising the security risk it poses. 


Egypt, Chad, Tunisia, Morocco, Cameroon, and Niger have bans on burqas and Senegal is currently considering whether to impose one. 


My Private Senators' Bill links the prohibition of full face coverings to the National Terrorism Threat Level, to be activated when the terrorism threat level reaches 'Probable'. 


By doing this, the public can feel at ease knowing the Government is doing everything it can to protect its citizens in the face of the growing threat of terrorism. 


Full face coverings conceal the identity of the wearer, disrupting the authorities' ability to track down a perpetrator in the event of a crime. 


Prohibiting the use of full face coverings also acts as a deterrent to those who contemplate committing a crime. This prohibition promotes public safety by making it easier to identify everyone. 


This legislation will enable all Australians who want to go peacefully about their business, to feel safe in public spaces. It does so by enacting commonsense security provisions. 


I emphasise that the primary purpose of this Bill is public safety. When people have the intention of committing a crime, in many cases, they attempt to conceal their identity so they have the best chance of evading the law. 


While this Bill takes into account exceptions for full face coverings in the genuine pursuit of entertainment, work, and artistic purpose; the right of the Australian public to be and feel safer when the official terrorism threat is at the third highest level or probable, must be the primary consideration of the Government. 


Debate adjourned.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government is committed to ensuring that children right across Australia have access to a dentist when they need it. Under the scheme, on average, only $312 of the rebate has been reclaimed per child each year. In light of this, the government had previously set the cap at $700 per child over a two-year period, which would still allow children to visit a dentist regularly. However, following consultation with the Australian Dental Association, the Minister for Health has decided to reinstate the cap at $1,000. We are also providing $11 million over two years to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to deliver dental outreach services to rural and remote communities. The government is delivering on its commitment to improve the dental health of all Australians though the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and contribute to better public dental services through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories.

Senator McGRATH:
  Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The government takes a zero tolerance approach to corruption in all its forms. The establishment of a national integrity commission would not better guarantee protections against corruption. A robust multi-agency approach is preferable to creating an entirely new agency. No single overarching body should be responsible for tackling corruption. By dispersing responsibility accountability increases. We have strong laws and a robust multi-agency approach to combating corruption. A range of agencies play a role in preventing, detecting and responding to corruption, including the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, the AFP hosted Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre and the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.

  If there is any lesson that we could learn from the huge disruption that is going on right around the world and indeed here in Australia to 'politics as usual', it is that people are fed up with the level of representation they are getting.

We have seen evidence of corruption at a state level, particularly in New South Wales but not limited to New South Wales. We have seen the role of these national anti-corruption watchdogs in ensuring that they keep a check on government, politicians and the bureaucracy. It is time for action now. It is not time for more inquiries, not time for more talk but time for action. Let's establish a national anti-corruption watchdog. Let's get on with the business of cleaning up politics.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:29):  It is the start of a new Senate year, and what a start it has been. We have seen a government that is divided and falling apart. It is the Seinfeld government: it is a government that has recalled parliament, brought us back here today, for the simple reason that it was on the calendar—there is nothing to actually do. There is no legislation, there is no purpose and there is no point. All we are doing here is pretending that this is a government that has some kind of control.  They started off on the first day with some terrible polling numbers—54-46. None of us in this business follow polling; there is only the one poll that matters, the one on election day. But that news suddenly got surpassed by Senator Bernardi quitting the Liberal Party—quitting a party that it appeared he was running; quitting a party which, in the seven months since the last election, had done everything he asked for. He could not point to any policy difference, but he left—a complete vote of no confidence in Malcolm Turnbull. 


On top of that, what have we seen this past week? This is something that has frustrated me: we are hearing politician after politician and senator after senator talk about the establishment and talk about the insiders. Let us be clear: if you are an old, white, rich, male senator you are the establishment. You are the system. We are hearing these government ministers talking about the establishment and saying, 'We will make Australia great again,' running their Trump lines. They are the government. People like George Christensen from the other place and Senator Bernardi and others go out and talk about making Australia great again, but they have been running this country for over a term now. They have set the rules. They have set the policies. We hear all about insiders and outsiders, and we have commentator after commentator going on shows like Sky News talking about how they have been silenced and they do not have a voice anymore. If you have your own nightly television show you are not being silenced this country. Maybe no-one is watching, but if you have two to three hours on either radio or television every single day you are not someone whose voice has been silenced. 


There is this whole debate about where things are heading. You have a government that is folding on 18C and the rights of individuals. Why? Because of the power of right-wing shock jocks. You have a government that has fallen over already on the issue of marriage equality. It cannot come to a position. In the paper on the weekend we read that a handful—and perhaps even more than a handful—of backbenchers and others want to see marriage equality happen in this country, but they have been silenced. Their voices are not being heard in the Liberal Party. 


It is madness that we put so much focus on and so much effort into going after people on Centrelink benefits and yet the government talks about $50 billion worth of tax cuts for Australia's largest companies, over $7 billion of which will go to the four largest banks. We talk about inequality, and it is growing. We also talk about housing affordability—in a place like Sydney the median house price is $1.2 million.




Senator Williams:
  Move to Inverell. Go to the country.




Senator DASTYARI:
  Nothing says 'average' like $1 million. Senator Williams says go to Inverell. I would love to, the only problem is you have cut so many regional services and regional jobs that, unfortunately, people do not actually have the opportunity or ability to move to these places. Perhaps if you actually believed in rail and perhaps if you were prepared to do something about climate change or even the jobs of the future there would be more opportunity and hope—and perhaps if you could even get the NBN up properly out there. Oh, that is right; Tony Windsor made sure you could! It is a government that has already fallen apart. It is a government that is spiralling out. It is a government that goes from one crisis to another, and for the nation the sooner we are rid of this mob the better.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:34):  I am delighted to participate in this debate, because I entirely agree that there is no leadership from Mr Turnbull. You have no better display of that than today's debacle—the latest debacle, I should I say; I will come to the other one that we have been talking about, Centrelink, in a minute. But today there is the debacle of the government's announcement of their latest omnicuts, in the guise of, 'Here we are we, we are providing better child care for you and we are providing better paid parental leave for you.' But they are sneaking a whole lot of their other zombie budget cut measures back in. These are the budget cut measures that this Senate has been resisting ever since they started showing up in the Abbott budget of 2014. Remember that awful budget, which was overwhelmingly rejected by the community? They tried to force young people off income support, off Newstart, for six months. This government think they can get away with reducing the period to five weeks—four weeks plus the normal one-week wait period. Clearly this Senate has been resisting that and not supporting it. Now they bring it back, supposedly to pay for child care. Even if you accept the premise that child care is all fixed, they are saying, 'We will look after your kids while they need child care, but as soon as they reach the age of being more independent and they look for work and become unemployed, we will not support them.' 


Then you look at what they are trying to do to age pensions and portability. They are trying to reduce that to six weeks. Then they will have you believe that they have fixed things by improving the changes they are making to family tax benefits, but young families will still be worse off. Where is the leadership?


'That's right: we're leading by picking on the most vulnerable members of our community, those that are struggling, those that are trying to buy a home, those that are on low incomes. We will still decrease your family tax benefit: if you are on family tax benefit A, by about $8 a fortnight; if you are on family tax benefit B, which is where there are a lot of low-income families, we will reduce it by over $13 a fortnight.' This is not leadership; it is demonising people. It is demonising the most vulnerable members of our community. 


Then let's get to Centrelink. What great leadership there! How to lead a complete debacle! Again, it is subjecting people that are trying to rely on our social security safety net to scare tactics, to debt notices, to potentially having to open the door to debt collectors, and to errors in Centrelink which they do not even count. 


Today during senators' statements, I read out the accounts of three people who have been affected by this. Great leadership by the Turnbull government: how to pick on and make vulnerable people even more vulnerable; how to make sure that they have more mental health issues. That is what is happening and that is what is being fed to our offices. I am sure those on the government benches have been getting those phone calls—in fact, some of their own are so affected and so concerned that they have been making statements about their concerns. Great leadership, Mr Turnbull!


Where is his leadership in taking the issues to President Trump? It is completely lacking; it is not there. He is failing Australians, and particularly failing those that rely on our social security safety net and families that are struggling to get ahead. We know they are struggling to buy their homes; we know they are facing greater costs of living; we know that inequality in this country is increasing. So he is leading the charge to increase inequality in this country. That is the only thing he is leading on. That is not the way. 


By victimising and picking on the most vulnerable in the community, he increases inequality and makes it even harder for people to find work. By keeping young people in poverty and off Newstart for five weeks, he actually makes it harder for them to find work. That is what the evidence shows. 


So I support this matter of public importance because the Prime Minister is not— (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:39):  What a great opportunity it is this afternoon to continue to talk about the inability of the Turnbull government to provide any sort of stable leadership of this great nation. What we do know is that Christmas has come and gone but the Christmas presents this government keeps presenting to us and giving us day after day and week after week are stuff-ups. They have had a ghastly start to the year. Mr Turnbull would be feeling, I would say, quite insecure. What we have seen this week in this chamber is Senator Cory Bernardi deserting the Liberal Party. This is one of theirs saying there is no leadership and that they are not giving the leadership that this country so richly deserves. 


We do not see this government going out and creating the jobs that it gave a commitment to during the last election; instead, we see them infighting amongst themselves. We have seen no economic strategy. The Prime Minister has no plans for the future of this country, not when it comes to economics—not at all. We have not seen any of those jobs that they promised at the last election. But what we have seen is the absolutely disgusting Centrelink robo-debt debacle which has impacted on everyday Australians.


We all remember the census failure. We know that the ATO was offline for a week. We know that the GP tax and freezing the Medicare levy to GPs has had an enormous impact. And we know that this month is ovarian cancer awareness month. But if you cannot get in to see your GP—and I gave a speech this morning in relation to women making sure that if they do have the symptoms and signs they should go to a GP and should get a second opinion. All I can say is this government has done nothing but cut health. They have cut funding to our schools. We know they want to bring in $100,000 degrees. 


It does not matter what media you pick up over the last four or five weeks—in fact, it is probably over the last 18 months, since the Prime Minister has taken over the reins of leadership of the Liberal Party. I would just like to quote from TheSydney Morning Herald journalist Tom Switzer who said on Monday that the Prime Minister 'came to power on a wave of personal popularity, but has lacked conviction' and 'has not lived up to expectations'. 


It is the Prime Minister's economic management that has disappointed people the most. We know Mr Turnbull did promise a lot when he knifed Tony Abbott. But he has delivered nothing. In an article in The Australian—not actually a paper that is renowned for supporting this side of the chamber—political editor Dennis Shanahan said:


The senator’s actions are pure disruption and division. He has damaged the Coalition, hurt the Liberal Party and further splintered the choice for conservative voters, …


Bernardi, once again, has destabilised Malcolm Turnbull’s leadership, …


… … …


… Bernardi has reopened all the political wounds within the Liberal Party, the Coalition and conservative MPs themselves.


It just keeps going. There is another quote I want to give, from The Daily Telegraph today—and this is all because of Senator Bernardi, who has joined so many others throughout this country. This government is a failure. The Prime Minister is a failure. He has failed the Australian people. The editor's piece in The Daily Telegraph this morning said that Cory Bernardi was 'wrong to leave the party'. It said that Bernardi 'could have made all of the points he did yesterday and been influential in arguing them without leaving the Liberal Party'.


He made very clear the reasons he left the Liberal Party. This is not a government that is living up to the expectations of even their own supporter base. Their attack—when it comes to GPs and having them out campaigning against this government—and we remember what happened with the pathology industry when they came out against them and then they had to come to a quick deal so they would not go out and lose the financial support that they normally get.


But there is one economic plan that this Prime Minister keeps repeating every single opportunity he can, and that is his big plan to give the $50 billion tax cut to the big end of town. We know that he supports the banks. Why does he support the banks? Because they bankrolled the Liberal Party. He is not the only one who bankrolled the Liberal Party; it is also the big banks. But he did not want to have a royal commission into the banks, and they were critical about the royal commission into child sexual exploitation. What have we seen from that? We believe that this government is a failure. The Australian people see them as a failure. Mr Malcolm Turnbull has not delivered on one economic promise. (Time expired)

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:44):  I have to say that Senator Polley has distracted me. I had a whole speech here, prepared with dot points. My staffers researched it, and now I have to abandon it—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  Senator Polley, on a point of order?




Senator Polley:
  I have done nothing at all to distract the senator. What I have done is to put on record the failings of this government.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I hope the clock was stopped for that. Let me address some of Senator Polley's points. I have been observing this for about 12 months now, particularly during these opportunities pursuant to standing order 75 to listen to the topics that have been chosen by the Australian Labor Party. When you listen to their contributions, there is nothing. There is no contribution. It is just a hollow vessel—complaining, whining and whingeing. I had a bearing like that in the back of my ute a couple of weeks ago. Give it a shot of grease and the noise went away. That is what you and the Labor Party need, Senator Polley: you need a bucket of grease, because all you do is whinge and whine. It is all negative. There is no alternative; there is no 'You don't get it right with education—here's what you should do.' 



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  There is nothing. In question time we never get a question on education. When Kim Carr—when Senator Carr wakes up on the odd occasion we get one on science about once every 18 months. We do not get anything on the economy—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, on a point of order?




Senator Polley:
  I would like to draw to the senator's attention that he should use people's titles in this chamber. He is Senator Carr.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind Senator O'Sullivan to observe the standing orders and refer to senators by their correct titles.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I will make every effort. I have made the point before: you always know that you are on the money when the members of the Labor Party stand up to interrupt your delivery. Let's talk about what this government has done, because, unlike yourselves, I am prepared to make a positive contribution. I am not frightened to lay down the programs, initiatives and achievements of this government. They have been enormous. This has been one of the most active governments on delivery for the Australian people that we have seen in my adult lifetime. Let's just run through a few things from my home state of Queensland—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I cannot even hear myself think with Senator Polley going off like polly with a cracker. Our Commonwealth government has just lodged about $10 billion into the upgrade of the Bruce Highway in my home state of Queensland. It will affect dozens upon dozens of communities and, more importantly, the economies of those rural and provincial communities and, in fact, some big, proud cities—Townsville, where the good senator's office is; Cairns; Rockhampton; Bundaberg. The investment by our government is going to almost flood-proof the Bruce Highway. It is going to upgrade it for all those billions of dollars of trade and development that occurs up and down our coastline. We are going to have an efficient method—do not go, Senator Polley, you should listen to some of this—of delivery of goods to our ports to underpin our great terms of trade. We already heard today about the wonderful terms of trade figures that came out on the weekend. 


This government delivered the Range Crossing. Under Labor they seesawed, they hummed and haaed for six years. Not one thing did they do towards the development of that terrific initiative to build the Range Crossing so that all the products of our trade-exposed nation—over 70 per cent of what we produce, including 66 per cent of the beef sector, a commodity now worth about $10.5 billion to our economy, to your welfare, to underpinning the wealth of this nation, comes down the Range Crossing. Who was it that built the Range Crossing? That would be this government. That is not taking into account the half a billion dollars spent on the Warrego Highway or the half a billion that is now pledged and is in the planning phase to put beef roads all over the state to create a trunk road network up there that will just enhance this $10.5 billion.


Labor wants to talk about comparisons. Let's talk about things like the live export trade. Let me ask you, Senator Macdonald—I know you do not have a calculator, but I suspect you might get this one—in 2011 how many cattle were exported to Indonesia and other places, the live cattle that underpin the massive beef industry of northern Australia? How many were there? I heard you—there were none, because you brought that trade to its knees. There are thousands—in fact, tens of thousands—of families who continue to have that play through their balances sheets, affecting them. There is a generation of farmers who have lost their farms and businesses; industries that disappeared off the face of the planet in the Northern Territory.


What did we do? We reinstated that trade, and now Australia exports more live cattle into the region than anyone else in the world, restoring—though not for the poor people who fell over or were pushed over by Labor policies—confidence in that marketplace and allowing people to build businesses, with the dignity that comes with that, in northern Australia.


Let's just deal with northern Australia. My good friend here, Senator Macdonald, played a very significant and influential part in an inquiry that our government conducted. Where did it end up? What would Labor have done for northern Australia in the whole time they were there? That would be nothing, starting with an 'n' and finishing with a 'g'. Absolutely nothing. But our government put in place a $5 billion—



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  It is good to see you can make a contribution there now that you are no longer the whip, Senator Bilyk. We put a fund of $5 billion in to develop northern Australia, right across the country—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bilyk, on a point of order?




Senator Bilyk:
  Senator O'Sullivan, I may no longer be the deputy whip, but I can certainly still contribute, and you might just want to take note of that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I might point out to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that is the fourth failed point of order made by the colleagues on the other side. It is just meant to disrupt my delivery. It really does grind on them when these achievements are listed one after the other after they have had 10 minutes talking in such a nefarious fashion suggesting that this government has not done anything. We roll these achievements out one after the other. We are a government that has a plan. We are a government that told the people of Australia what we would do. They endorsed us. They put us back in power. That is what they did. They rejected this negative, hollow vacuum of a policy arrangement with the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. They are frightened of the Greens. We have seem that in the decline in the vote for the Greens party. I know that it really gets on your goat over that side when we are able to list one project after another—billions of dollars, even in the tough economic climate that you left us.


So let me say this: when we get a statement 'the inability of the Turnbull government to provide stable, united leadership', well, what an absolute nonsense. Those achievements that I have outlined—and I am certain that Senator Macdonald is going to outline a couple hundred more—cannot happen unless you have a stable, majority government well led right across this nation. This nation has benefited from Turnbull and Abbott. It will continue to benefit because of the stability that we bring to the administration of the Commonwealth of the great nation of Australia.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-02-08,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:54):  The Prime Minister's bad news week will continue when he returns to Sydney. When he goes to his Point Piper mansion on that multimillion dollar street he will have to navigate his way around a giant sinkhole. A giant sinkhole, believe it or not, has opened up. So we have this perfect metaphor. Not only is he falling into a hole in terms of how he is handling his policy work in Canberra; he will literally have to navigate his way around one when he returns to Sydney.


Some people were led to believe that when Malcolm Turnbull became the Prime Minister there would be some good news there—that on climate change and marriage equality things would change, that there would be a trickle-down and, in time, there would be some good outcomes. But on both of these issues he has been gutless. Of course he has continued to be, as he was in his previous job outside parliament, a salesman for the super rich, for privatisation and for profit. That is the driving aspect of this government. That is what they are out to do. That is where the Prime Minister gives leadership—in delivering in that way. He is delivering in a way that brings the hardship, the inequality, the job insecurity, the environmental damage that has now become the hallmark of this government.


I do agree with the analysis that you hear from some that part of Mr Turnbull's problem is that he is locked on to the extreme Right in his party. Yes, that is the case. But it is also the case that the job of the Liberals and Nationals and the job of the Prime Minister is to deliver for their constituency. And their constituency is corporate Australia. Corporate Australia's job, while they are on the earth, is to make profits. How do they increase their profits? They do so by getting this government, the Liberals and Nationals, to weaken environmental standards and labour standards. When workers are not being paid as much and when occupational health and safety conditions are run down, and when you can ignore putting in any standards about clean air and clean water, there will be more profits. That is where this constituency—the big end of town; corporate Australia—is benefiting from the likes of the Prime Minister.


Let's just take industrial relations as an example. This is where you do not see any finesse from the government. It really is a position in which they are out there to smash unions and weaken workers' rights. We saw it so clearly with the Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation. Now, as we have seen this week, we have this disgraceful backflip from Senator Hinch. The government wants to make this very ugly piece of legislation even harsher.


The building code, which is a key part of the ABCC, puts in restrictions on the enterprise bargaining agreements linked with Commonwealth-funded work. This is really worth understanding because it highlights the hypocrisy that you hear from Liberal and National senators and MPs in the other place time and time again. The code prohibits not only union-friendly but: enterprise bargaining agreements from including clauses that encourage the employment of apprentices; requiring employers to look for local workers first; preventing unlimited ordinary working hours; allowing construction workers to have a fair and safe workplace. Remember all those fine speeches that you heard from Minister Cash and from the MPs in the other place? This puts the lie to what they actually stand for. On all those things, how could you disagree with clauses about more apprentices, fair working hours, a safer workplace and more jobs locally? But it goes that far. That is what you end up with. That is what Mr Turnbull is overseeing at every turn.


Then the really big standout: there was Mr Turnbull putting $1.75 million into the Liberal Party to, literally, buy the election. We will be hearing more from Minister Ryan on how they are going to clean up political donations. But the furthest they will go is possibly bringing in a ban on overseas donations, and transparency. If we get that, it is all important; very important. But we need to have caps. We need to have limits on the amount of money that can be spent on elections and, certainly, an end to the damaging corporate donations. At the moment, the culture is changing in Australia. We are getting to a point that the super rich like Malcolm Turnbull can buy elections. But it does not look like he can buy his way out of a sinkhole or a policy hole.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:58):  I intend to use that nomenclature because I still think that should be the case. Sometimes in this chamber there is serious debate that achieves the purpose. More often than not this chamber hears a lot of what can only be described as high farce. And I have to say that this debate today is one of those that is super high farce. First of all, we have Senator Dastyari leading the debate for the Labor Party. Senator Dastyari is a nice enough guy, personally, but why would you put as your party whip someone who got Chinese companies to pay his personal debts? These were not debts to the Labor Party, but his own personal debts. He was dismissed from the front bench for a couple of months and here he is back again leading the Labor Party as a whip. This is the same guy who, when he was General Secretary of New South Wales Labor, looked after Craig Thomson. Remember that crook, that cheat, that guy who I am embarrassed to say was a fellow parliamentarian in the other chamber for a number of years? He told lie after lie and took the hard-earned money of workers and members of the health union, but who stood up for him? Who paid his legal bills? Senator Dastyari, as general secretary of the Australian Labor Party. Yet here he is, promoted to the position of a whip in this chamber and leading the debate. 


He led the debate with the massive comment: 'We haven't done any work today, since the parliament has resumed. We sit around trying to find legislation.' I am not sure where Senator Dastyari was today when we passed, after quite significant debate, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Petroleum Pools and Other Measures) Bill 2016. That debate actually happened, and I do not know where Senator Dastyari was if he is suggesting that we are not debating any legislation in the first full day back in the parliament. Senator Dastyari may not be aware that we are currently dealing with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill. It is a bill that I have spoken on, but I am not sure whether Senator Dastyari has—he must not have, because he seems to think there has been no legislation discussed in this chamber. The chamber red, the agenda for the chamber, is full of important legislation which this government wants to bring forward and which is getting through the chamber. For that we have to thank the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull, the unity of the government and the determination of the government to do positive things for Australia.


I had my staff spend a few hours—it took that long—to get me a list of this government's achievements. I only have 17 minutes today but I have four pages of achievements, so time will permit me to mention only a few of them. Before I start, Senator Dastyari had the hide to talk about Mr Turnbull's leadership. I have had my arguments with Mr Turnbull at times, and because I am in the Liberal Party I am able to do that. Just yesterday I had an argument with him in the party room. But we are allowed to do that in the Liberal Party. We do not get shunned, we do not get sacked and we do not get dismissed if that happens. Senator Dastyari complains about Mr Turnbull but he supports Mr Bill Shorten, the most unimpressive Leader of the Opposition that I have seen in my 26 years in this chamber. I think he is hopeless, I think he shows no leadership at all, I think he is a complete waste of space—as some would say, an oxygen thief—but do not take my word for it; ask the public of Australia. Malcolm Turnbull's approval rating as preferred Prime Minister has gone up, Senator Dastyari, and your leader's has gone down or stayed the same. You have the hide—you have the high farce, I should say—to complain about Mr Turnbull's leadership when you have a leader that the Australian public has no regard for. Long, I might say, may Mr Shorten reign, because as long as Mr Shorten remains your leader—I do not think it will be very long—we are safe. In fact, I am part of the 'keep Bill Shorten' brigade, because the best thing that can happen to our party politically is to make sure that Bill Shorten remains the leader of the alternative government.


I want to be positive about this debate. Senator Dastyari and other Labor speakers say nothing has happened. I know they wish nothing had happened but they will remember, regretfully, as they go home to Sydney every weekend—their union mates belt them around the ears over this—that the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill was passed by this parliament. The Building and Construction Commission bill, admittedly in watered-down form, was passed by this parliament. I know Labor hated that, and I know their union mates who put them in this chamber hated it even more, but these bills have been passed by a government, led by Mr Turnbull, that has shown real leadership and courage. Why did that happen? Because Mr Turnbull had the courage to call a double dissolution. I disagreed with that and I made my views known to Mr Turnbull, but it looks like, in retrospect, perhaps he was right, because those two bills that we went to a double dissolution on have now been passed by the parliament.


I rarely believe what I read in the papers and I believe what I hear on the ABC even less. But from the headlines of TheAustralian this morning, I understand that my colleague Senator Hinch has indicated—as he indicated to a group that I was talking to with him a few weeks or months ago—that he did not quite understand the import of the amendment that he supported in relation to the ABCC bill, which effectively delayed the corruption-fighting element of that bill for two years. If you believe what you read in the paper, Senator Hinch has now agreed to join the government to bring that bill back to what it should have been and stop the corrupt practices of several unions immediately—or in a very short period of time—rather than delaying it for two years.


It would take me more than a day to list the achievements of this government. Although I am a Queensland senator I am passionate about Northern Australia—as Senator O'Sullivan kindly said, it has been a passion of mine for a long time. I will quickly run through some of this government's initiatives.


This is a government that Senator Dastyari says has done nothing. He says that there has been no leadership and that it has achieved nothing. Let me go through this. Under the Beef Roads program, which Senator O'Sullivan mentioned, there are now roads criss-crossing Queensland like never before—since the Fraser years, I have to say. The CRC on northern Australia is about to be announced, I believe, next week. Under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, $5 billion is set aside for cheap loans for infrastructure development in the north. Then there are the water storage proposals. This government has provided $137 million to build the Rockwood dam, a much-needed dam near Rockhampton. There is the Charleston dam near Forsayth. Probably none of you, not even the Queenslanders, would know where Forsayth is. It is a little country town up in the Gulf. There is $10 million for the Charleston dam in that community, which supports a local cattle industry and, I might say, has a very good and productive Indigenous community who will benefit from the dam. 


Then you go to Townsville, where my office is, not far from where I live. We have the eastern rail network, with the whole new proposal to bring trains into the Townsville port quickly and efficiently. We have the Townsville stadium, which this government is going to fund. We have the northern Australian plan, which is being implemented step by step. In addition to that, over the last couple of months when parliament has not been sitting I have been moving around Queensland and visiting aged-care homes. The amount of money that goes into aged-care homes is just enormous. There is always a lot more needed, and I have been making submissions to the minister for some of the homes that I have visited. Gee, there are a lot of things going on. 


Under Minister Ley—all credit to her; she was a wonderful health minister—the health system was really turned around. We are hearing about achievements all the time. In question time we heard about a drug that has been put on the PBS that used to cost $104,000 per treatment and that now costs $38 per treatment. That is just one. I was involved in another initiative of this government for hepatitis—I can almost call it a hepatitis cure. It is another of those drugs that was available if you had a spare $80,000 to buy the treatment. Under this government you now pay $38. This is the leadership of this government, and Senator Dastyari says nothing has happened.


We have actually stopped the boats. I know the Labor Party hate this and they hate the five-word slogan, but, sorry, it is true: we have stopped the boats. We were criticised by all those holier than thou people in Europe when we were doing this a few years ago. What are those holier than thou countries in Europe now doing? They are making a beeline to our door to find out how we did it. We have done it and every other country in the world is now trying to find out how. 


Mr Turnbull showed real leadership in standing up to the President of the United States over the deal that had been made on the illegal maritime arrivals who are now not coming to Australia and never will. But they will go to the United States because of the deal done between Australia and the former President, Mr Obama. The news reports were that President Trump did not want to proceed with the deal. We know the truth of the very robust conversation between Mr Turnbull and President Trump, in which Mr Turnbull was able to ensure that the deal that was made would continue. There we have it: real leadership has been shown at a time when all those opposite can do, particularly the Greens,  is whinge about Mr Trump—a democratically elected leader of another country. He was trying to break an agreement that his country had made with Australia. Thanks to Mr Turnbull—we all owe him a debt of gratitude for this—he was able to ensure that the deal stood.


Jobs have been created at Alcoa's Portland aluminium smelter. There is the new agreement with the French to build submarines in Australia. Senator Dastyari talks about this do-nothing government—but how about, just last year, the biggest ever defence white paper, with record spending planned and budgeted for, reversing the running down of our defence forces by the Labor Party. We have finalised the Western Sydney airport project. We have delivered fairer, more sustainable and more flexible superannuation. We have boosted infrastructure through a 15-year plan. We have delivered on northern Australia as promised. We have established the Register of Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land. We have banned excessive surcharging by credit card companies. We have employment initiatives that connect veterans with jobs. We have ratified the Paris agreement on climate change—I might say that is one that I am not quite sure was a step in the right direction, but it is something this government has done. Senator Dastyari said that this government has done nothing. We have secured Australia's 25th consecutive year of economic growth. Our growth is faster than that of every other G7 economy. We have introduced legislation to enshrine our border protection laws. We have had to do that up against constant interference from the Greens political party. 


We have passed through the lower house the bill to give Australians a say on whether they support same-sex marriage or not. If it had not been for the Greens and the Labor Party in this chamber stopping that legislation, in one month's time we would have had an answer on that. If, as those who want same-sex marriage say, the vote on the plebiscite would have been positive, same-sex couples would have been able to get married the next day. But, thanks to Labor and the Greens, that is one failure that I guess this government has had. Although we tried to get that plebiscite through, thanks to Labor and the Greens that has not happened and we will go through another 10 years of uncertainty. I hope that those who advocate for same-sex marriage thank the Greens and the Labor Party for denying Australians the right to that vote. According to that lobby, it would have passed easily.


We have delivered a personal income tax break to 500,000 middle-income Australians. We have delivered $21 billion of budget repair. We have made bank CEOs answerable to the public through regular appearances before parliamentary committees. We have improved national security. I regret that I only have 45 seconds to go, because I have another two pages of achievements, initiatives and reforms of this government while this ridiculous, comic resolution we are debating today is about no leadership and a government doing nothing.


In my few minutes here I have demonstrated just a few of the many things that this government has achieved under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull and before that under the leadership of Tony Abbott. I ask people listening to this debate to compare the serious debate I have embarked upon to the humour and comic you will get from the other side.

 (Tasmania) (17:16):  I rise today to speak on the matter of public importance titled, 'The inability of the Turnbull Government to Provide stable united leadership for all Australians.' But before I go into that, can I say that was 17 minutes of my life I am never going to get back—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator BILYK:
  I know that Senator Macdonald keeps commenting that he has been here for 26 years, but sometimes it is quality not quantity that is important in life. As Senator Macdonald comes back to Canberra and steps into Parliament House, I have this feeling that he steps through the wardrobe, as though he has gone to Narnia or to another land because most of what he said to me was a fiction.


Senator Macdonald started out bagging poor old Senator Dastyari, who has been the deputy whip for the last couple of days, and I am honoured that he has taken the position from me. I am very happy to have supported him in that. To be honest, he has freed me from the shackles—as you would know, Senator Smith—of being a deputy whip. I am glad that he put his hand up for that position.


It has been a really torrid time for the Turnbull government, which is what we are here to speak about today. It is a government at war with itself. It is fraught with its own internal squabbles. It lacks in policy, it lacks in leadership and it lacks in competence to create a brighter future for Australian people. It was bad enough over the summer break that they lost their health minister, who had 29 or 32—and I am happy to be corrected on the exact number—flights to the Gold Coast to buy property at taxpayers' expense. So Minister Ley is no longer the minister because of that, and Senator Macdonald comes in here and preaches to us about things that have happened on this side. Really, I think that is the pot calling the kettle black. It really is just atrocious.


In the Senate we get Senator Sinodinos, who I quite like as a person. I do get on well with Senator Sinodinos. If anyone in this place has the right to say 'I cannot remember' or 'I cannot recall', obviously it is me, because I have had brain surgery. But Senator Sinodinos does not have that excuse. He stood up in an inquiry and said 32 times—if my memory serves me correctly, but once again I am always happy to be corrected—that he could not recall something and now he has a post on the front bench. That is absolutely atrocious.


What we see with the government and with Mr Turnbull in particular is that they are always forced to cave in to the extreme right of the Liberal Party. They are forced to cave in to the right-wing ideologues like Mr Christensen and Senator Abetz and, until yesterday of course, Senator Bernardi, who was calling most of the shots. Although I do think that Senator Bernadi in his position on the crossbench will still call a lot of the shots. They will want his vote. If Senator Bernardi really stopped and thought about things and listened to the way he was being bagged out by a number of his so-called colleagues, he might not really vote with them all that often. But I am sure he will still pull a lot of the strings.


Over the summer break, I actually started to feel sorry for Mr Turnbull. I thought to myself, 'There he is, looking over the waters in his Point Piper mansion, sipping on his cognac and wondering to himself how it all went so wrong.' A lot of people had a lot of faith in Mr Turnbull when he took over from Mr Abbott, and some people on our side even had some faith in Mr Turnbull because we thought he would be progressive and make some changes. But what do we see? We see that he has actually backflipped on all the key things he said he believed in. He backflipped on marriage equality, on reducing carbon pollution, on an Australian republic, on Gonski and on Safe Schools. They all lie in ashes at his feet since he took over as Prime Minister. This government, as we know, is completely dysfunctional, and part of the problem is that instead of rejecting Mr Abbott's policies, Mr Turnbull has doubled down on them. I have to say that the Australian people are pretty dismayed about that. I have people coming to me saying they have voted Liberal all their life but would not do it at the next election. Senator Macdonald was bagging out Mr Shorten, as he so often does—it is just a diatribe—but if he was to listen to people around Australia talk about Mr Turnbull, he might not be quite so disparaging.

Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (17:21):  Senator Bilyk was certainly on a roll in relation to this matter, and I rise to make my own humble contribution in relation to the inability of the Turnbull government to provide stable leadership for the benefit of all Australians. In the course of the last half an hour or so I have taken the opportunity to listen to Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Macdonald in relation to their very despondent and limited defence of the performance of the Turnbull government. It is quite clear that Senator's Bernardi's defection yesterday is just the latest example in relation to the disunity and chaos of the Turnbull government.


Leadership is perhaps the most important ingredient to any strong and functional government. But leadership requires a leader to have the courage of their convictions, something the current Prime Minister and the current government is totally lacking. Leadership means you say what you mean and you mean what you say. The Turnbull government's version of leadership is in stark contrast to this. It is characterised by turmoil. I note that back in April last year, seven months into the period of the Turnbull government, Ben Eltham, in New Matilda, noted that Mr Turnbull had notched 17 backflips in seven months. I am not going to go through all of those, but it is quite clear that this is a government that flip-flops from policy to policy.


I also want to make the point that during Senator Macdonald's contribution I thought it was very telling that when asked to defend the achievements of the Turnbull government the first thing Senator Macdonald referred to was an attack on the trade union movement. I suppose the most significant issue they can point to as an achievement of this government is the legislation that goes to tying the hands of the trade union movement in order to prevent it from properly representing the interests of their members. That is I think a very telling aspect of Senator Macdonald's contribution.


In the very limited time left to me I want to comment on a couple of policy backflips that I think are most significant in respect of the development of public policy in Australia—firstly, the whole prospect of significant tax reform, which was raised initially by former Prime Minister Abbott and cruelly dashed by incoming Prime Minister Turnbull, who raised expectations about doing something in relation to this matter. There was the prospect, under Prime Minister Abbott, of a tax white paper to have a very holistic look at the system, building on the intergenerational report, the tax discussion paper that so many organisations made very substantial contributions and submissions to, only to find that Prime Minister Turnbull scrapped that whole process and in the course of the lead-up to the election raised the prospect of a corporate tax cut.


Many of the experts are divided as to whether that will actually provide any significant contribution to the Australian economy. In fact, much of the benefit of that goes to the four major banks—benefits which go to foreign investors, and it is debatable as to whether that is actually going to see more investment in Australia. And of course our system of franked credits in Australia means that the benefit to Australian investors of a corporate tax cut is somewhat neutered. So, whether or not this actually delivers anything is a moot point.


We need a government that is going to take a step forward for us. Every day that this government fails to step forward, Australians are forced to take a step backward. We need a government that will stand up for Australians and put them in the best position to tackle an ever-changing world. We need a government that will ensure that Australians have access to affordable health care and a decent wage. We do not need a government that is riddled with scandals, a government that undermines its own policy agenda and a government that attacks current and former leaders. I also note that the member for Petrie today reiterated the Treasurer's solution on housing affordability by telling young Australians to 'get a better job', despite youth unemployment being at almost 10 per cent in his own electorate. This is a government that needs to do more than slogans— (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:26):  Well, what an extraordinary week it has been. The resignation of a Liberal Party senator is something that does not happen every day. But when it happens on the basis of that particular senator leaving—on the grounds of his convictions, his philosophy—the government benches, it shows clearly the failure of leadership under Malcolm Turnbull that this government currently finds itself in.


This government has been led by a man who many thought would bring a change to the Abbott era and actually move Australia a little bit more forward in a united fashion and stand for something. But unfortunately what we have seen is the complete opposite. We have seen an individual who has completely sold out on just about everything he once stood for. If we look at the issue of climate change, if we look at the issue of renewable energy, of same-sex marriage, of the republic, of 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act—all of these issues are something the Prime Minister has backflipped on. So it should not really be a surprise, in some senses, that now a Liberal Party senator is defecting to form his own party. I think it is symptomatic, that a number of Liberal Party senators perhaps want to do a similar thing. They are not doing it, perhaps, at this stage, but I am sure they are talking about it. 


Now, as you would understand and expect, there are very, very few issues, if any, that Senator Bernardi and I would agree on. In fact, having spent some time in New York at the United Nations with Senator Bernardi, it became clear to me that there is very little that we do agree on. But, having said that, I think there is one thing that I do agree with him on, and that is the way this government has lost its way—the failure of the Turnbull leadership to actually govern for Australia and the fact that Senator Bernardi clearly is resigning from the Liberal Party standing up for what he actually believes in. Clearly he can no longer stomach this leader who has simply wishy-washed about for his whole time in office by parroting views he does not believe and backflipping on anything he once stood for.


So, whilst I wish Senator Bernardi well, it does not bode well for the country that senators within the government are resigning. It is a complete show of no confidence in the Prime Minister. And where does it leave this government in its role governing Australia? I think it is time that those opposite recognise that their strategy has not worked under Malcolm Turnbull. I am sure that some on the government side would be thinking Tony Abbott would do a better job. Well, I think there is only one alternative—and the Australian public are becoming more and more aware of it—and that is a Shorten Labor government.

CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS OF FINANCIAL ADVISERS) BILL 2016


Today I introduce a Bill that will amend the Corporations Act. It will raise the education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers by requiring financial advisers to hold a degree, undertake a professional year, pass an exam, undertake continuous professional development and comply with a Code of Ethics. 


In introducing this Bill today, we are implementing our commitment set out in the Government's response to the Financial System Inquiry (FSI). With its introduction, we are also responding to recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Committee (PJC) on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into proposals to lift the professional, ethical and education standards in the financial services industry. 


This Government is committed to ensuring Australia has a financial services regulatory regime that enhances confidence and trust by fostering an environment in which financial firms treat customers fairly. 


Creating a holistic professional standards framework to raise the competency and professionalism of financial advisers is an important part of our commitment.


Raising the professional standards of financial advisers will play a significant role in improving consumer trust in the financial advice industry, which has had repeated instances of inappropriate behaviour.


Reduced trust acts as a barrier to consumers seeking financial advice, which is an extremely poor outcome for both consumers and industry.


We probably shouldn't be surprised then, that right now only one in every five Australians seeks financial advice.


Appropriate financial advice can significantly improve people's financial wellbeing. That's why we simply must improve trust in the industry so that consumers can have confidence in the advice they're seeking – so they can have recourse to the kind of strategic advice, expertise and knowledge that most everyday people don't normally hold. 


Equally important is the sustainable future of the financial advice industry, which is integral to our economy. 


I note that the proposed reforms follow important steps already taken by the Government to improve the transparency and accountability of financial advice.


We have already established a register of financial advisers that allows consumers to verify the credentials of financial advisers and be confident that they are appropriately qualified and experienced. 


We are also progressing reforms to life insurance advice remuneration structures. These reforms are an important step in addressing concerns that remuneration incentives are affecting the quality of advice provided to consumers and encouraging the unnecessary turnover of policies.


The Government has consulted extensively on the measures in this Bill, which build on the model proposed by the PJC on Corporations and Financial Services, chaired by my colleague Senator David Fawcett, and the recommendations of the FSI. This is an excellent example of different segments of industry working together to build a workable model.


I note that both the FSI and PJC reviews identified that the existing professional standards for financial advisers are too low and do not ensure that all financial advisers have the necessary skills to provide high-quality advice to consumers. 


These reviews recognise that the current regulatory framework was not enough to build professionalism in the financial advice industry and has not encouraged this industry to take a greater lead in setting standards.


It is clear that the current framework lacks the incentives to encourage industry to go above and beyond the minimum.


For example, under the current law, advisers can become qualified to provide financial advice after just four days of training, and there are no specific ongoing training requirements beyond that.


There is now widespread support among industry, consumer groups, the Government and Parliament to raise education, training and ethical standards of financial advisers. 


It is clear that the time is right. We must take advantage of this momentum.


The establishment of the standards body will be the first important step on the road to professionalism.


Under this proposed legislation, we will establish a standards body, as a Commonwealth company limited guarantee, to set education standards, professional year and continuing professional development requirements.


The body will also develop an exam and a comprehensive code of ethics for all financial advisers.


Establishing the standards body as a Commonwealth company will balance the body's independence with industry and consumer engagement.


It will also minimise the Government's footprint and allow for the possibility of easily transferring the standards body back to industry once trust and confidence in the sector is restored. 


The Government will have no direct control over the entity's day-to-day operations, but, should the body not comply with its obligations, the responsible Minister may give the body a written direction. 


Such a direction would only occur in very exceptional circumstances. 


The Government will be responsible for all appointments to the board, which will comprise an independent chair, three industry representatives, three consumer representatives, an academic and an ethicist.


Industry will have a key role in the proposed model and will be consulted extensively as the body sets standards.


This is critical because industry must have a stake in the standards-making process if it is to truly professionalise and develop standards above the minimum.


Under the reforms, financial advisers who provide personal advice to retail clients on more complex products will need to meet the new standards.


Financial advisers who are only authorised to provide general advice or personal advice on less complex financial products, such as general insurance, will not be required to comply with the new standards.


The Australian Securities and Investments Commission will continue to set education and training standards for advisers who are only authorised to provide general advice or advice on less complex products.


New financial advisers will require a degree, while existing advisers will need to meet a standard equivalent to a degree set by the standards body.


While the detail will ultimately be set by the new standards body, it is important to note that not all existing advisers will have to return to university and complete a three-year degree program.


Some may not, but a majority are likely to receive credit for the education or training that they have already completed and will only need to gap-fill or undertake bridging courses to meet the standard required.


Existing advisers have from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2024 to meet the new education standards.


While I commend the actions of some licensees who have already introduced a degree requirement for their financial advisers, Government action is necessary in this space to ensure minimum standards apply across the whole industry.


The FSI found that low adviser competence was a factor in many of the recent high-profile instances of consumers receiving inappropriate financial advice and contributed to the low demand for financial advice.


The fact that an adviser could reach accreditation in four days has given the industry a bad image.


That's obviously not good enough and there is clearly room to do better if the industry is to reach its true potential.


A core feature of these reforms is the requirement that all advisers complete an exam set by the new standard body.


Such a requirement already exists in the United States, Britain, Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong.


New advisers will need to complete the exam from 1 January 2019. Existing advisers will have from this date until 1 January 2021 to pass the exam.


Collectively with the other measures in this Bill, the exam will play a significant role in improving professional standards of financial advisers.


It will objectively test and strengthen the practical and ethical knowledge of existing advisers with immediate effect and will help renew confidence in the industry without significant lag times.


From 1 January 2019, all new entrants will need to undertake a professional year set by the new standards body. 


This will involve at least one year of work and training to ensure that new entrants are mentored and assessed before they are fully authorised to provide unsupervised advice to clients.


Under the reforms, new entrants who have completed their degree and passed the exam will be able to provide advice on a supervised basis during the professional year.


The professional year trainee will be required to disclose to clients that they are completing the professional year and that they are not permitted to give advice unsupervised. 


The Register of Financial Advisers will clearly show that the person is completing their professional year and only authorised to give advice under strict supervision.


A supervising adviser will need to ensure that the new financial adviser is appropriately supervised and take responsibility for all advice given by the new financial adviser during the professional year. 


The standards body will develop guidelines on what constitutes 'appropriate supervision'.


Existing advisers will not need to undertake a professional year.


All advisers, both new and existing, will be required to undertake continuing professional development.


The new standards body will determine the requirements for continuing professional development, including the number of hours that advisers need to complete and which courses satisfy the requirements.


This requirement will ensure financial advisers are keeping up‑to-date with relevant training, information, skills and knowledge to remain competent in providing advice to consumers.


Roy Morgan reported in its 2014 State of the Nation report that only 25 per cent of Australians rate financial planners' standards of ethics and honesty as 'very high' or 'high'.


This percentage must improve if the financial services industry is to meet the expectations of consumers. 


In a more recent survey, up to 85 per cent of practicing financial advisers indicated that they support the introduction of a single, unified code of ethics.1


It is clear that financial advisers are hearing these concerns.


On the back of these concerns and the recommendations by the PJC, the Government is requiring all financial advisers to subscribe to a code of ethics by 1 January 2020.


The new standards body will establish a single, uniform code of ethics that will set out principles designed to help financial advisers conduct business honestly and with integrity.


All financial advisers will need to be covered by an ASIC‑approved compliance scheme, which will set out how the Code will be monitored and enforced.


The compliance scheme will set out the arrangements for monitoring compliance, the sanctions for breaching the Code, the process for consumers to make complaints, and the process for resolving disputes between the monitoring body and the financial adviser. 


The compliance scheme will specify which 'monitoring body' is responsible for enforcing compliance – this could be either a professional association or a third party who is independent of the licensee.


It is important to note the significant role that professional associations, independent third parties and licensees will play in implementing these reforms. 


These institutions will be directly responsible for ensuring financial advisers comply with the new standards.


Professional associations are likely to offer training and education services to their members, to assist them to prepare and meet the new standards.


I note that many of these associations, particularly those in Industry Consensus Group, have been instrumental in the development of these reforms. 


I would like to thank Senator David Fawcett and the members of the PJC for their important contributions and I also wish to acknowledge the work of my predecessors. 


It is anticipated that the new standards body will be established by mid-2017. 


The new education, exam, professional year and continuing professional development requirements apply from 1 January 2019. 


Existing advisers will have until 1 January 2021 to pass the exam and 1 January 2024 to meet the degree equivalent requirement.


The provisions relating to the Code of Ethics take effect from 1 January 2020.


In closing, I note that these reforms represent a necessary and valuable change to the current regulatory environment for financial advisers, and are important steps in professionalising the industry.


Not only will they deliver significant benefits to consumers, they will also help maintain trust and confidence in the financial system.

STATUTE UPDATE (A.C.T. SELF-GOVERNMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) REGULATIONS) BILL 2016


Today I introduce into Parliament a Bill that will ensure that relevant Commonwealth law will continue to be applied to the Australian Capital Territory.


The Bill will also - in the spirit of red tape reduction - simplify the legislative framework and reduce the amount of legislation users need to consult. 


The 'Statute Update (A.C.T. Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Regulations) Bill 2016', which I am introducing today, will provide for relevant Commonwealth legislation to more clearly apply to the ACT. 


As it currently stands, text of applicable Commonwealth law relies on the 'ACT Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Regulations' (the Regulations). 


While the text of some Commonwealth law does not refer to the ACT, a court currently reads that it does because the Regulations make modifications to a number of Acts to ensure they are interpreted as applying to the ACT. 


This Bill will repeal certain provisions of the Regulations and modify legislation to remove the complexity associated with the use of the Regulations, simplifying the legislative framework and making it easier for users to interpret and apply the legislation.


The risk of continuing to rely on the Regulations – which are due to sunset in 2018 – are that users of legislation may only consider the Acts, and omit the Regulation's function to include the ACT.


Given the impending sunsetting of the Regulations in 2018, this Bill will make sure the Acts continue to apply to the ACT.


If the Regulations sunset, and the Bill is not passed, the legislation will no longer apply to the ACT.


The function and application of the law itself, will not change. 


The Bill will simply change the text of the applicable Commonwealth law to make clear their application to the ACT. 


Conclusion


The Bill will ensure that Commonwealth Acts continue to operate in the ACT and result in administrative clarity and efficiency. 


I ask both Houses to show bipartisan support for the Bill and its non-controversial measures.


I thank the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and others for the time and effort that went into preparing the Bill.


With this, I commend the Statute Update (A.C.T. Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Regulations) Bill 2016.


TAX AND SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (2016 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2016


This Bill reintroduces measures that were introduced by the Government earlier this year but lapsed when the last Parliament was prorogued.


The Bill, which contains four schedules, amends various taxation laws to improve their flexibility and effectiveness while reducing red-tape on individuals, businesses and community organisations. 


Schedule 1 to this Bill establishes a Remedial Power for the Commissioner of Taxation, to allow for a more timely resolution of certain unforeseen or unintended outcomes in the taxation and superannuation laws. 


Schedule 2 improves the flexibility of the income tax averaging rules for farmers, allowing income averaging to reapply ten years after a farmer has chosen to opt out, rather than permanently excluding them from the benefits of averaging as is currently the case. 


Schedule 3 will amend the luxury car tax to provide tax relief to certain public institutions that import or acquire cars for the sole purpose of public display.


Schedule 4 makes a number of minor amendments across the tax and superannuation laws to provide certainty for taxpayers. 


Schedule 1 of this Bill will establish a Remedial Power for the Commissioner of Taxation to allow for a more timely resolution of certain unforeseen or unintended outcomes in the laws under the Commissioner's administration.


The Government announced on 1 May 2015 that it would provide more certainty and better outcomes for taxpayers and reduce the regulatory burden on them by providing the Commissioner with a Remedial Power.


Taxation laws are very complex. The nature and volume of taxation law can produce unforeseen and unintended outcomes in its application. 


These outcomes can result in taxpayers generating tax liabilities where this was not intended, or taxpayers being subject to record keeping or other compliance requirements that were not intended or are no longer necessary. These outcomes can create significant uncertainty and compliance costs. 


The Commissioner endeavours to interpret the law to give effect to its purpose or object, but instances remain where this is not possible. For example, this can occur when dealing with new scenarios, or scenarios which were not contemplated when the provisions were drafted.


Unintended outcomes may be addressed through changes to the primary law. However, law change is resource intensive and is undertaken to give effect to the full range of government priorities. It can therefore be ill-suited to resolving smaller unintended outcomes. 


The challenge of effecting primary law change is illustrated by the 92 announced changes to the tax and superannuation law that had not been enacted at the time the Government was elected in September 2013. Had the Remedial Power existed, it may have been able to address some of the smaller unintended outcomes and could have allowed constrained legislative resources to deal with more significant primary law change. 


The Remedial Power allows the Commissioner to make a disallowable legislative instrument to modify the operation of a taxation law to ensure the law can be administered to achieve its intended purpose or object. This will help to create flexibility, allowing the Commissioner to resolve smaller unintended outcomes. 


The delegation of this power to the Commissioner must be subject to necessary checks and balances. 


Importantly, Parliament has oversight of all instruments made under this power. Instruments would not take effect until after the expiry of the parliamentary disallowance period. 


Safeguards are built into the Remedial Power itself. The power can only be used where:


the modification is not inconsistent with the purpose or object of the provision;


the Commissioner considers the modification to be reasonable, having regard to both the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision and whether the costs of complying with the provision are disproportionate to achieving the intended purpose or object; and


any impact on the Commonwealth budget would be negligible.


Any modification to the law will not apply to a taxpayer if the taxpayer would be adversely affected. 


The proposed power is to be used as a power of last resort, when unintended consequences cannot be ameliorated by the Commissioner in any other way. 


In the past, there have been instances where there has been a misalignment between the stated purpose of a particular provision and the technical language adopted in the legislation. In these instances the Commissioner has not been able to address these issues or administer the legislation in a way that gives effect to its intended object or purpose. 


This measure provides an avenue for efficient resolution of these issues, as and when they arise and fits well with the existing commitment by the Commissioner to administer taxation legislation in accordance with the stated policy intent. 


The measure will allow a smooth administration of the taxation and superannuation laws, in particular, when dealing with smaller unintended or unforeseen outcomes. This measure will assist in cutting red-tape and provide greater support for taxpayers across Australia. 


Similarly, Schedule 2 amends the law so that farmers can re‑access the benefits of tax averaging ten income years after they decided to opt out of the system for year to year smoothing of primary production income taxation. This change is necessary to ensure the rules do not continue to permanently and unnecessarily exclude eligible farmers from the benefits of income averaging. 


Currently, a farmer who chooses to opt out of income averaging can never re-access the scheme.


Farmers' income is often volatile due to factors outside of their control, such as drought and fluctuating commodity prices. The averaging rules even out a farmer's income tax liability from year to year, so that they pay fairer amounts of tax in relation to taxpayers on comparable but steadier incomes. 


The Government heard from stakeholders in consultation that the current averaging rules are inflexible and do not make sufficient allowance for changing business circumstances. A farmer choosing to opt out of income averaging may later realise that this choice was no longer appropriate for their circumstances. For example, they may not have anticipated future income volatility, acted on the basis of poor advice, or assumed they would experience many years of declining income. Currently, these farmers can never re-access the concession, even where they remain in primary production and face volatilities from market conditions and natural disasters. 


While it makes sense to have rules that prevent farmers from opting in and out of income averaging simply to gain tax benefits, a permanent exclusion is longer than necessary to prevent possible abuse of the concession. 


Over the past four decades, the value of agricultural output has been almost two and a half times more volatile than the average for all the major sectors of the Australian economy. Australian farmers also experience greater volatility in yield and price than most other farmers in the world. The Government recognises the need for Australia's tax system to account for the agriculture sector's operating environment. 


This schedule will benefit farmers as averaging will only recommence when they are eligible for a tax offset. A farmer may always choose to opt out again if it does not suit their circumstances to remain in income averaging. Their choice will be effective for another ten income years.


This change was announced in the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper on 4 July 2015, and is the product of extensive stakeholder feedback and consultation. 


Schedule 3 amends the luxury car tax to provide tax relief to certain public institutions that import or acquire cars for the sole purpose of public display.


Currently, if a public museum or art gallery imports a car for display and it is over the $63,184 threshold, the museum or gallery will have to pay luxury car tax.


This Bill implements the 2015-16 Budget measure allowing public museums and public art galleries that have been endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation as a deductible gift recipient to acquire cars free of luxury car tax. 


Relief from luxury car tax will only be available for cars acquired solely for the purpose of public display. The cars must be exhibited or shown in an environment that is accessible to the general community, for example, display in a museum that is open to the general public.


Finally, Schedule 4 makes a number of amendments to tax and superannuation laws to provide certainty for taxpayers. These amendments make sure that the law operates as intended by correcting technical or drafting defects, removing anomalies, and addressing unintended outcomes.


This furthers the Government's commitment to restore simplicity and fairness to the Australian tax system, and to the care and maintenance of the law. By clarifying the law and repealing unnecessary provisions, these amendments also reduce the regulatory burden and make it easier for Australians to access current law.


These amendments include:


updating the specific listings of deductible gift recipients to reflect name changes as advised by the listed organisations, which ensures these entities continue to attract public financial support for their activities; and


repealing 45 inoperative amending Acts relating to excise, reducing regulatory burden for Australians.


This Bill is aimed at better targeting and strengthening our tax system to ensure it is fair and sustainable. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:48):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Di Natale, Senator Griff, Senator Lambie and Senator Hinch, move:


That item 2 of Schedule 1 of the Dental Benefits Amendment Rule 2016 (No. 2), made under the Dental Benefits Act 2008, be disallowed [F2016L01986].


There is no clearer example of the overwhelming rejection of these cuts than the fact the government have announced they will be dropping them before this place even gets to vote on the motion before us today. That is right: they knew that this place would strike out the cuts to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule which took effect on January 1 this year. Backed into a corner, they announced they would drop the cut and restore funding per child to the original level of support. Make no mistake, the government did not do this because it was the right thing to do or because they wanted to; they did this because they were forced to. Though they had indicated they will drop the cuts, we are yet to see this legislative change. So not only are we proceeding with this motion, we are asking the government to vote for it as a sign of good faith. If they are serious about dropping this cut which will leave 250,000 children worse off then they should vote for this motion today.


As I said, there has been cross-party support for this motion to disallow the government's cuts to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and I thank my fellow senators for their cooperation. We united against the government's attempt to cut the Child Dental Benefits Schedule for a simple reason: they have always been unfair cuts that, at the government's own estimates, left one in four children who used the scheme worse off. The Prime Minister has done nothing but attack successful and established dental programs for both children and adults. Malcolm Turnbull originally planned to abolish the scheme completely, only backflipping after Labor fought to have the cut removed from their omnibus legislation last year. Their latest cuts were yet another attack on the successful program.


To understand why protecting this program has been so vital, it is important to look at why it was established in the first place. Firstly, it is important to recognise that dental care is not just about teeth. Poor dental health is linked to chronic disease. If teeth are not properly cared for, it often leads to much greater health problems. People often think that in children oral health is not as important because baby teeth will be replaced. This could not be more false. The primary teeth play a particularly important role in in a child's development, aiding in speech development and nutrition. In addition, untreated dental pain can impact on a child's ability to pay attention and learn.


That is why the former Labor government took steps to advance our universal system of health care to dental care with the announcement of a dental reform package, the centrepiece of which was the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Labor introduced this scheme because of disturbing evidence that the oral health of children has been declining since the mid-1990s. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2009, the proportion of children who had experienced decay in their baby teeth ranged from 42 per cent for five-year-olds to 61 per cent for nine-year-olds. The proportion of children with permanent teeth affected by decay ranged from five per cent for six-year-olds to 58 per cent for 14-year-olds. Almost 20,000 kids under the age of 10 are hospitalised each year due to avoidable dental issues. By age 15, six out of 10 kids have tooth decay.


This scheme sought to tackle that by providing a capped benefit of $1,000 per child over a two-calendar-year period, targeted at low-income and middle-income families by tying eligibility to those receiving family tax benefit part A or an equivalent Australian government payment. This program was a crucial investment in the long-term health of children because we know that dental health in children is the best predictor for dental health as adults, but also a predictor of overall health. It is a tightly targeted program to ensure that the kids and families who most need help accessing dental services are the ones who get it.


But the Liberals have been determined to axe the scheme ever since they came to government. First, they refused to promote the scheme, leaving many parents unaware of the important dental services that their children could access. In fact, a review by this government's own health department said that the scheme's only failing was the Abbott-Turnbull government's refusal to promote it. In a review of the program, the health department said:


In particular, the Panel noted the success of the CDBS in targeting the oral health of young Australians at an age where preventative measures can be most effective.


The health department made several recommendations to improve awareness of the scheme, which this government has never implemented.


Then, in April last year, the government announced its plan to abolish the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. Parents, dentists and experts were outraged, and Labor was proud to stand with them in the fight for the scheme. When they could not pass through the Senate their plan to abolish the scheme, the government instead applied a cut across the board, cutting the entitlement of every child who was eligible under the program. On New Year's Day, the government cut the cap on CDBS benefits from $1,000 over two years to $700. That is a cut of up to $300 a child, or $600 for a family with two kids. Late last year, the former health minister admitted that the new cap would hurt more than one in four of the children who use the scheme. That is over a quarter of a million kids who would have been worse off.


To understand how nonsensical the decision to cut the scheme was, the government need only have spoken to any dentist. The opposition visited countless dental practices, who reiterated how important the scheme was. In practice after practice dentists said they were seeing kids from families who never before had come to see a dentist, and, as a result of this government's attacks on the Child Dental Benefits Scheme, they feared that these kids would either never see a dentist, or would have to wait years if they were thrown back onto the endless waiting lists of the community dental schemes. Attempting to scrap a proven program to help children access affordable dental care was always in the running for one of the Prime Minister's cruellest cuts. It might have taken over a year, but Labor is pleased that the scheme has been protected and the government has finally dropped their cuts altogether.


Unfortunately though, this announcement does nothing to restore the massive $300 million-a-year cut to adult public dental services that will see 337,000 Australians lose access to dental services. When the government announced in December their latest cut to children's dental services, they also announced a paltry sum of money for adult dental services, after leaving the states and territories in limbo until the 11th hour. As a result of this government's cuts to adult public dental, disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians will lose access to life-changing dental services as a result of long waiting lists, and they will grow across the country.


The funding allocated to the states and territories for public adult services is an insult when the Liberal government have ripped hundreds of millions of dollars out of adult public dental services since 2013. In government, Labor budgeted $391 million a year for the national partnership agreement on adult dental services. The Abbott/Turnbull governments have cut this time and time again. Also, the announcement last year of a further cut means the Liberals are ripping $300 million out of public dental services every year. As a result, every year around 337,000 Australians will miss out on critical public dental services. The states themselves said what an insult the funding that was allocated was. The Queensland health minister said that it was a 75 per cent cut to federal dental funding for Queensland on what was promised in the Member for Warringah's first slash and burn budget, in 2014-15. So there are still serious unresolved questions about the future of adult public dental services funding, and the impact on waiting lists, that this government needs to address.


Looking at today's confirmation, it is both a victory for children's dental health and an embarrassing backflip for this government. Let us remember that it has been only about a month since these cuts took effect on January 1. They kicked off the new year by slashing the amount of dental assistance eligible children could receive under the scheme by $300 a child. They pursued these cuts despite admitting that one in four children who use the scheme would be negatively impacted, leaving a quarter of a million children worse off. What a lousy New Year's present indeed.


You might be asking what has happened to make the government change its mind in such a short amount of time. Why the sudden backflip?


The answer is in this place. They knew that today we would vote and throw out their cuts. So, backed into a corner, they scrambled to claim back some credibility. If those on the other side have seriously had a change of heart about this cut, they should vote for this motion and throw out their own decision. Labor has never given up fighting for this program against Malcolm Turnbull's cuts, and we are pleased to have been able to protect it.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-02-08,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:00):  I also stand to support the disallowance of the government's cuts to funding for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Let me begin by outlining the problem that we have here. Australia is a very wealthy nation, but we have young people, and people right across the board, who are suffering from very poor oral health. When you look at Australia's level of wealth, you see a disproportionately high number of people who suffer from poor oral health—dental disease and so on. Often people assume that having the odd cavity and having problems with dentures and so on is a minor issue, that it is not as important as other health burdens, but increasingly we are starting to understand just how critical it is to have very good oral health. Apart from the obvious things like infections and pain that poor oral health can sometimes cause, and apart from the issues associated with cavities that can be resolved through fillings and so on, having poor oral health has a very significant impact on people's general health and wellbeing. We are learning now that poor oral health is linked to heart disease and to stroke—a whole range of cardiovascular illnesses are a direct consequence of suffering from poor oral health. Indeed, it is associated with adverse outcomes for women who are pregnant. 


It is a very serious problem, and it is not just a matter of the direct health impacts. It has a huge impact on people's wellbeing more generally. If you are missing teeth and do not have dentures, it can be highly stigmatising. If you are sitting there in a job interview, for example, it is automatically a marker that puts you behind the eight ball—likewise if you are looking for a rental property. Having very poor oral health compromises your ability in all these sorts of areas. So it has very serious impacts, both directly through the pain caused by infections and the very serious health impacts of diseases like cardiovascular disease but also through the impact on people's self-esteem—their ability to achieve things in life more generally. It can be highly stigmatising, and people with poor oral health will often find that they do not go out in public because they are worried about what people might think of them. As a GP, I would often see people coming in as a result of a tooth abscess or something similar. They could not afford to go and see dentists, so they would come in knowing they would get Medicare funded treatment. But as a doctor there is not much you can do. You would often give some antibiotics and maybe some pain relief, but what they really needed was specialist dental care. One of the big problems in this country is that for too many people dental care is unaffordable.


So that is the problem. In terms of Australia's approach to dental care, one of the great tragedies, in my view, was that oral health and dental care were excluded from Medicare when Medicare was constructed in the 1970s. We decided for some obscure reason, and people will argue about the history of this, that we would somehow treat the mouth as separate from the rest of the body. So if you have an infection on your forehead, for example, you will get Medicare funded medical care but if you have an infection in your gum or your tooth you will not get Medicare funded dental care; you have to predominantly pay for that dental care out of your own pocket. 


What is the solution to all of that? If we were designing the system again, the Greens would have Medicare funded dental care. We would do what the Child Dental Benefits Schedule attempts to do. There is a bit of history here that is worth reflecting on. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule is effectively Medicare funded dental care for children. If you are a kid and you want to go and see a private dentist, you have $1,000 to spend over two years that can be basically funded through Medicare. If you present your Medicare card the dentist will provide up to $1,000 of treatment. So, it is Medicare funded dental care. I am very proud of it, because it was one of the outcomes of the power-sharing government involving the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents. It is one of the outcomes that we achieved through that period of government—and that period of government is starting to look better every day, when you reflect back on that period and then look at what we are seeing at the moment. It is starting to look more like a golden age of stable government. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule was one of the agreements that we struck with Labor. It was something we put to them and we made it really clear that we wanted to see the start of Medicare funded dental care in this country, and, to the Labor Party's credit, they agreed with the proposal and we now have Medicare funded dental care for 80 per cent of kids. It is the only Medicare funded dental program in Australia. Basically, if you have access to family tax benefit part A—which the families of roughly 80 per cent of kids do—you get $1,000 worth of essential and preventative dental treatment over the two years. 


Basically, this allows kids to go to private dentists. We know that 80 per cent of the dental workforce comprises private dentists. Families can access the scheme through the dentist of their choice. It allows you to have a relationship with your local dentist and also, importantly, allows you to avoid those huge waiting lists in the public dental system, which I will get to in a moment. It is really important for those people in regional communities. If you live out bush, waiting lists make access to public dental services nearly impossible. People in regional communities who otherwise would have had to travel for hundreds of kilometres to go to a public dental clinic are able to go and see their private dentist for their children's treatment. All in all, it was a really significant win. If the Greens were in government, we would make sure we expanded it. We would expand it so that we would have Medicare funded dental care for all people. That is what we took to the 2016 election campaign. 


To the 2016 election campaign, we took a plan to build on the CDBS—or what I think should be called 'Medicare funded dental care for kids'. We would bring in people from disadvantaged backgrounds. And there are ways of doing that—through concessional status and so on, people who have got health care cards—but ultimately we would like to see a universal dental health care system funded through Medicare. The same way you go to your GP, you could go and see your dentist. That is our long-term plan, and that was the plan we took to the election campaign.


Unfortunately, what we have seen is a government that is ideologically opposed—and this is really important; I think this is a ideological attack. It makes no sense on the basis of evidence. This is a good long-term investment. Having people maintain good oral health is good, as I said earlier, for their sense of self-esteem, but it is also good in terms of productivity. Billions of dollars are lost in productivity because of people who have poor oral hygiene. We would go some way into improving the health debate in this country if we recognised that these preventative interventions actually have a long-term pay-off.


But what we saw was the government moving to cut the funding to the CDBS, or Medicare funded dental care for kids, by $300 per child through this regulation. That was basically one-third of the $1,000 that was taken off. It is a direct attack on those kids in regional communities and those people who are unable to access a private dentist because they simply cannot afford the up-front cost or they do not have private health insurance. It was really an attack on those people. I now understand, from a press release from the minister, that they have effectively read the writing on the wall—one of those rare moments of self-awareness from this government—and they are planning to restore the funding back to the $1,000 per child and to restore the scheme as it was originally designed by the Greens. 


I know that the minister has been under some pressure from stakeholders. It is good that the new health minister has listened, and I commend him for that. I would also like to congratulate those stakeholders within the dental community who have put the case to the minister and indeed made their views very clear on this. So, given the minister's announcement, I assume that he will support this disallowance motion—given that he has said he will restore that $1,000.


I have to say, it is very clear that the government has been keen to scrap the Medicare funded dental scheme all along. One of the more disgraceful chapters in this saga was when the government on multiple occasions released fact sheets and sent out information to families and to dentists saying they would no longer be able to receive dental care for their children under the scheme because they had a plan sometime in the future to get rid of it, despite never having the agreement of the Senate. 


So on one hand they are saying one of the issues with the scheme is that it is underutilised; and then on the other hand they are telling people they cannot utilise it because they are going to scrap it. What do you expect? They have undermined it at every turn. They have consistently fought to scrap this scheme. They have done nothing to promote it. In fact they have done the opposite. They have provided misleading information to the community to say the scheme will no longer be funded and therefore you will no longer be eligible. At Senate estimates time and time again we have caught the department out with false and misleading information being sent to individuals. Each time they corrected it, and then they returned to their dark old ways of providing people with misleading information. 


I have to say that, while we are pleased that the government has finally listened—and certainly the new health minister appears to have listened—and while this is an important scheme for children, and 80 per cent of kids have now got access to dental care through a private dental provider funded through Medicare, one of the real concerns here is what this government has done when it comes to funding for public dental health care. 


For those people who do not know, the states and Commonwealth jointly fund public dental health clinics. There are many of them around the country, and they are very important because adults who cannot access this Medicare funded scheme, who cannot afford to pay the up-front cost to go and see a dentist, at least have the comfort of knowing that there is a public dental scheme waiting for them. 


One of the other significant achievements through that period of power sharing government was that we got a massive injection in funding into the public dental scheme. We had a significant injection, which brought down waiting lists, which in some places are up to three years. We have people who are waiting for dentures, who cannot afford to pay for them out of their own pocket, who have to wait for three years on a public dental scheme to be able to get dentures so they can just have a quality of life that most of us take for granted. Just reflect on that. We are not talking about cosmetic dental care here. We are talking about people who have chronic abscesses; some of them simply do not have any teeth and are waiting for dentures, and waiting for years. We went some way to addressing that through working with the Labor Party and Independents to ensure that we got a big injection into the public dental system. 


What have this government done? They have ruthlessly attacked public dental services. In the 2013-14 budget they promised $391 million for 2016-17 public dental services. How much are we seeing now? $107 million per year. So last year the amount was reduced to about $155 million per year, from that $391 million that  was promised. Now they have cut it again and they are saying it is $320 million over three years. That is one-third of what was promised in the 2013-14 budget. They have slashed funding for public dental care. Of all the things, all the priorities, all of the areas where we could make savings—and I could list a huge number of those areas ripe for savings.


We have to decide in this country whether we are going to try and balance the budget on the back of this nation's most vulnerable people, some of the poorest people here, or whether we recognise there is a huge and growing gap between the super-rich and ordinary people and start to recognise what our priorities are. Let's talk about the diesel fuel rebate that goes to the mining industry worth billions of dollars. Let's stop propping up investment in the housing market by subsidising people who want to buy their third, fourth or fifth home. Let's tackle negative gearing and reform the capital gains tax discount.  


They are the sort of areas where we can make changes. How about a levy on the big banks to ensure that they pay for the guarantee that they get from government, rather than trying to squeeze a few million dollars out of health budgets, attacking vulnerable pensioners and doing what we saw in today's changes to family tax benefits, where the government is saying that the only way we are going to be able to help families is by hurting them.


We have some choices to make in this country. We have to decide whether we as a nation want to ensure that we have a more equal, more caring society. That means cracking down on multinational tax avoidance and ending the rorts that exist in the property market that inflate home prices for young people, who are being screwed at the moment, and see them continue to be left out of the property market and basically denied an opportunity to own their own home. They are the sort of measures that we as a nation could take, rather than what this government is proposing to do, which is to cut essential services that I think are the foundation of a decent society.


The good news is that the government has seen the light today on the Medicare-funded dental scheme for kids, the CDBS. We are pleased about that. What we would like to see is a move to restore funding for public dental care. As I said, the Greens have said now for many, many years that we think the mouth should be considered like the rest of the body. Going to the dentist should be just like going to the doctor: produce your Medicare card, which is effectively a universal health insurance scheme that means we all get access to decent health care, which includes decent dental care.


The Senate is rejecting this cut to the CDBS. As Greens, we will continue to fight not just to protect this scheme but to build it up; to make sure it is available not just to children but indeed, one day, to all Australians. We will challenge this government to restore that funding to public dental health care and to start balancing the budget by ensuring that we tackle that big and growing gap between the rich and ordinary people in this country. There are so many areas where we could make savings, where we could ensure that we have a sustainable budget position. You do not do it by balancing the budget on the back of this country's poorest and most vulnerable people.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:17):  The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring that children right across Australia, both in cities and in remote areas, have access to the dentist when they need it. Under the scheme, on average only $312 of the rebate has been claimed per child per year. In light of this, the government has previously set the cap at $700 per child over a two-year period, which would still allow children to visit a dentist regularly. However, following consultation with the Australian Dental Association, the Minister for Health has decided to reinstate the cap at $1,000. We are also providing $11 million over two years to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to delivered dental outreach services to rural and remote communities. The Turnbull government is delivering on its commitment to improve the dental health of all Australians through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and to contribute to better public dental services through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories.

Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (18:18):  I am pleased to be co-sponsoring this motion. Cutting health treatments for children and low-income families is definitely not good policy. Inevitably, it just leads to deferred health costs for the public health system. The money saved today would merely be spent many times over in the future to deal with escalating problems that may have been prevented through early intervention. 


We do not support cutting $300 per child from the Child Dental Benefits Schedule because it is short-sighted and, I feel, poorly considered. Ensuring that children have healthy teeth helps set them up for a healthier adulthood. We know that poor dental health is linked to bigger health problems, such as heart disease, so moves to scale back dental services should not be taken lightly. 


The CDBS scheme has been in operation since January 2014 and provides basic dental services such as cleaning, fillings, X-rays and root canals to eligible children aged between two and 17. The government had originally proposed scrapping the scheme and creating a new one that combined funding for both adults and children; however, several states rejected the proposal over concerns that they were being short-changed and thousands of people would miss out on treatment. In December the government instead announced a modified Child Dental Benefits Schedule that cut the scheme's cap from $1,000 per child over two years to $700 per child, claiming that this reflected user patterns. This could not be further from the truth. Last financial year more than one million children accessed free dental treatment through the scheme. This was slightly more than the previous year, costing $312.7 million in benefits. The government has budgeted for 2.4 million children to use the service each year, representing a substantial saving on paper. Despite this, the government feels the need to rip money out of the scheme to the detriment of the children who do use it. 


The Chief Medical Officer's review of the scheme administration, released in March last year, suggested the government's target of 2.4 million users was optimistic, and that the poor uptake was probably because the program was poorly promoted. Families getting Family Tax Benefit Part A are only made aware of their entitlement through a single letter from Centrelink. The scheme's low profile is compounded by the fact that most services across Australia are delivered privately. The jurisdictions where it was delivered through public dental services enjoy very much greater utilisation of the scheme. For instance, in my home state of South Australia almost 40 per cent of eligible children took up free dental care, the highest rate of use in 2014, and the review noted that the South Australian Dental Service was particularly proactive in accessing the scheme. In New South Wales, where it is almost solely delivered privately, the uptake was closer to 30 per cent. Regardless, the fact that one million children a year use this free dental care is no small thing. Because the scheme is so highly targeted, the children who need it most do use it. The states with the highest degree of use also had the highest number of disadvantaged children. About one in 10 children who used it in 2015 went over the $700 limit proposed by the government in just one year. 


The government has not made a sound case for cutting the dental care subsidy. In fact, it has made no substantive case at all. For this reason we do not agree with this measure and we support the disallowance motion.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:48):  I, and also on behalf of Senator Di Natale, Senator Griff, Senator Lambie and Senator Hinch, move:


That item 2 of Schedule 1 of the Dental Benefits Amendment Rule 2016 (No. 2), made under the Dental Benefits Act 2008, be disallowed [F2016L01986].


There is no clearer example of the overwhelming rejection of these cuts than the fact the government have announced they will be dropping them before this place even gets to vote on the motion before us today. That is right: they knew that this place would strike out the cuts to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule which took effect on January 1 this year. Backed into a corner, they announced they would drop the cut and restore funding per child to the original level of support. Make no mistake, the government did not do this because it was the right thing to do or because they wanted to; they did this because they were forced to. Though they had indicated they will drop the cuts, we are yet to see this legislative change. So not only are we proceeding with this motion, we are asking the government to vote for it as a sign of good faith. If they are serious about dropping this cut which will leave 250,000 children worse off then they should vote for this motion today.


As I said, there has been cross-party support for this motion to disallow the government's cuts to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule, and I thank my fellow senators for their cooperation. We united against the government's attempt to cut the Child Dental Benefits Schedule for a simple reason: they have always been unfair cuts that, at the government's own estimates, left one in four children who used the scheme worse off. The Prime Minister has done nothing but attack successful and established dental programs for both children and adults. Malcolm Turnbull originally planned to abolish the scheme completely, only backflipping after Labor fought to have the cut removed from their omnibus legislation last year. Their latest cuts were yet another attack on the successful program.


To understand why protecting this program has been so vital, it is important to look at why it was established in the first place. Firstly, it is important to recognise that dental care is not just about teeth. Poor dental health is linked to chronic disease. If teeth are not properly cared for, it often leads to much greater health problems. People often think that in children oral health is not as important because baby teeth will be replaced. This could not be more false. The primary teeth play a particularly important role in in a child's development, aiding in speech development and nutrition. In addition, untreated dental pain can impact on a child's ability to pay attention and learn.


That is why the former Labor government took steps to advance our universal system of health care to dental care with the announcement of a dental reform package, the centrepiece of which was the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Labor introduced this scheme because of disturbing evidence that the oral health of children has been declining since the mid-1990s. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2009, the proportion of children who had experienced decay in their baby teeth ranged from 42 per cent for five-year-olds to 61 per cent for nine-year-olds. The proportion of children with permanent teeth affected by decay ranged from five per cent for six-year-olds to 58 per cent for 14-year-olds. Almost 20,000 kids under the age of 10 are hospitalised each year due to avoidable dental issues. By age 15, six out of 10 kids have tooth decay.


This scheme sought to tackle that by providing a capped benefit of $1,000 per child over a two-calendar-year period, targeted at low-income and middle-income families by tying eligibility to those receiving family tax benefit part A or an equivalent Australian government payment. This program was a crucial investment in the long-term health of children because we know that dental health in children is the best predictor for dental health as adults, but also a predictor of overall health. It is a tightly targeted program to ensure that the kids and families who most need help accessing dental services are the ones who get it.


But the Liberals have been determined to axe the scheme ever since they came to government. First, they refused to promote the scheme, leaving many parents unaware of the important dental services that their children could access. In fact, a review by this government's own health department said that the scheme's only failing was the Abbott-Turnbull government's refusal to promote it. In a review of the program, the health department said:


In particular, the Panel noted the success of the CDBS in targeting the oral health of young Australians at an age where preventative measures can be most effective.


The health department made several recommendations to improve awareness of the scheme, which this government has never implemented.


Then, in April last year, the government announced its plan to abolish the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. Parents, dentists and experts were outraged, and Labor was proud to stand with them in the fight for the scheme. When they could not pass through the Senate their plan to abolish the scheme, the government instead applied a cut across the board, cutting the entitlement of every child who was eligible under the program. On New Year's Day, the government cut the cap on CDBS benefits from $1,000 over two years to $700. That is a cut of up to $300 a child, or $600 for a family with two kids. Late last year, the former health minister admitted that the new cap would hurt more than one in four of the children who use the scheme. That is over a quarter of a million kids who would have been worse off.


To understand how nonsensical the decision to cut the scheme was, the government need only have spoken to any dentist. The opposition visited countless dental practices, who reiterated how important the scheme was. In practice after practice dentists said they were seeing kids from families who never before had come to see a dentist, and, as a result of this government's attacks on the Child Dental Benefits Scheme, they feared that these kids would either never see a dentist, or would have to wait years if they were thrown back onto the endless waiting lists of the community dental schemes. Attempting to scrap a proven program to help children access affordable dental care was always in the running for one of the Prime Minister's cruellest cuts. It might have taken over a year, but Labor is pleased that the scheme has been protected and the government has finally dropped their cuts altogether.


Unfortunately though, this announcement does nothing to restore the massive $300 million-a-year cut to adult public dental services that will see 337,000 Australians lose access to dental services. When the government announced in December their latest cut to children's dental services, they also announced a paltry sum of money for adult dental services, after leaving the states and territories in limbo until the 11th hour. As a result of this government's cuts to adult public dental, disadvantaged and vulnerable Australians will lose access to life-changing dental services as a result of long waiting lists, and they will grow across the country.


The funding allocated to the states and territories for public adult services is an insult when the Liberal government have ripped hundreds of millions of dollars out of adult public dental services since 2013. In government, Labor budgeted $391 million a year for the national partnership agreement on adult dental services. The Abbott/Turnbull governments have cut this time and time again. Also, the announcement last year of a further cut means the Liberals are ripping $300 million out of public dental services every year. As a result, every year around 337,000 Australians will miss out on critical public dental services. The states themselves said what an insult the funding that was allocated was. The Queensland health minister said that it was a 75 per cent cut to federal dental funding for Queensland on what was promised in the Member for Warringah's first slash and burn budget, in 2014-15. So there are still serious unresolved questions about the future of adult public dental services funding, and the impact on waiting lists, that this government needs to address.


Looking at today's confirmation, it is both a victory for children's dental health and an embarrassing backflip for this government. Let us remember that it has been only about a month since these cuts took effect on January 1. They kicked off the new year by slashing the amount of dental assistance eligible children could receive under the scheme by $300 a child. They pursued these cuts despite admitting that one in four children who use the scheme would be negatively impacted, leaving a quarter of a million children worse off. What a lousy New Year's present indeed.


You might be asking what has happened to make the government change its mind in such a short amount of time. Why the sudden backflip?


The answer is in this place. They knew that today we would vote and throw out their cuts. So, backed into a corner, they scrambled to claim back some credibility. If those on the other side have seriously had a change of heart about this cut, they should vote for this motion and throw out their own decision. Labor has never given up fighting for this program against Malcolm Turnbull's cuts, and we are pleased to have been able to protect it.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-02-08,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:00):  I also stand to support the disallowance of the government's cuts to funding for the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. Let me begin by outlining the problem that we have here. Australia is a very wealthy nation, but we have young people, and people right across the board, who are suffering from very poor oral health. When you look at Australia's level of wealth, you see a disproportionately high number of people who suffer from poor oral health—dental disease and so on. Often people assume that having the odd cavity and having problems with dentures and so on is a minor issue, that it is not as important as other health burdens, but increasingly we are starting to understand just how critical it is to have very good oral health. Apart from the obvious things like infections and pain that poor oral health can sometimes cause, and apart from the issues associated with cavities that can be resolved through fillings and so on, having poor oral health has a very significant impact on people's general health and wellbeing. We are learning now that poor oral health is linked to heart disease and to stroke—a whole range of cardiovascular illnesses are a direct consequence of suffering from poor oral health. Indeed, it is associated with adverse outcomes for women who are pregnant. 


It is a very serious problem, and it is not just a matter of the direct health impacts. It has a huge impact on people's wellbeing more generally. If you are missing teeth and do not have dentures, it can be highly stigmatising. If you are sitting there in a job interview, for example, it is automatically a marker that puts you behind the eight ball—likewise if you are looking for a rental property. Having very poor oral health compromises your ability in all these sorts of areas. So it has very serious impacts, both directly through the pain caused by infections and the very serious health impacts of diseases like cardiovascular disease but also through the impact on people's self-esteem—their ability to achieve things in life more generally. It can be highly stigmatising, and people with poor oral health will often find that they do not go out in public because they are worried about what people might think of them. As a GP, I would often see people coming in as a result of a tooth abscess or something similar. They could not afford to go and see dentists, so they would come in knowing they would get Medicare funded treatment. But as a doctor there is not much you can do. You would often give some antibiotics and maybe some pain relief, but what they really needed was specialist dental care. One of the big problems in this country is that for too many people dental care is unaffordable.


So that is the problem. In terms of Australia's approach to dental care, one of the great tragedies, in my view, was that oral health and dental care were excluded from Medicare when Medicare was constructed in the 1970s. We decided for some obscure reason, and people will argue about the history of this, that we would somehow treat the mouth as separate from the rest of the body. So if you have an infection on your forehead, for example, you will get Medicare funded medical care but if you have an infection in your gum or your tooth you will not get Medicare funded dental care; you have to predominantly pay for that dental care out of your own pocket. 


What is the solution to all of that? If we were designing the system again, the Greens would have Medicare funded dental care. We would do what the Child Dental Benefits Schedule attempts to do. There is a bit of history here that is worth reflecting on. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule is effectively Medicare funded dental care for children. If you are a kid and you want to go and see a private dentist, you have $1,000 to spend over two years that can be basically funded through Medicare. If you present your Medicare card the dentist will provide up to $1,000 of treatment. So, it is Medicare funded dental care. I am very proud of it, because it was one of the outcomes of the power-sharing government involving the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents. It is one of the outcomes that we achieved through that period of government—and that period of government is starting to look better every day, when you reflect back on that period and then look at what we are seeing at the moment. It is starting to look more like a golden age of stable government. The Child Dental Benefits Schedule was one of the agreements that we struck with Labor. It was something we put to them and we made it really clear that we wanted to see the start of Medicare funded dental care in this country, and, to the Labor Party's credit, they agreed with the proposal and we now have Medicare funded dental care for 80 per cent of kids. It is the only Medicare funded dental program in Australia. Basically, if you have access to family tax benefit part A—which the families of roughly 80 per cent of kids do—you get $1,000 worth of essential and preventative dental treatment over the two years. 


Basically, this allows kids to go to private dentists. We know that 80 per cent of the dental workforce comprises private dentists. Families can access the scheme through the dentist of their choice. It allows you to have a relationship with your local dentist and also, importantly, allows you to avoid those huge waiting lists in the public dental system, which I will get to in a moment. It is really important for those people in regional communities. If you live out bush, waiting lists make access to public dental services nearly impossible. People in regional communities who otherwise would have had to travel for hundreds of kilometres to go to a public dental clinic are able to go and see their private dentist for their children's treatment. All in all, it was a really significant win. If the Greens were in government, we would make sure we expanded it. We would expand it so that we would have Medicare funded dental care for all people. That is what we took to the 2016 election campaign. 


To the 2016 election campaign, we took a plan to build on the CDBS—or what I think should be called 'Medicare funded dental care for kids'. We would bring in people from disadvantaged backgrounds. And there are ways of doing that—through concessional status and so on, people who have got health care cards—but ultimately we would like to see a universal dental health care system funded through Medicare. The same way you go to your GP, you could go and see your dentist. That is our long-term plan, and that was the plan we took to the election campaign.


Unfortunately, what we have seen is a government that is ideologically opposed—and this is really important; I think this is a ideological attack. It makes no sense on the basis of evidence. This is a good long-term investment. Having people maintain good oral health is good, as I said earlier, for their sense of self-esteem, but it is also good in terms of productivity. Billions of dollars are lost in productivity because of people who have poor oral hygiene. We would go some way into improving the health debate in this country if we recognised that these preventative interventions actually have a long-term pay-off.


But what we saw was the government moving to cut the funding to the CDBS, or Medicare funded dental care for kids, by $300 per child through this regulation. That was basically one-third of the $1,000 that was taken off. It is a direct attack on those kids in regional communities and those people who are unable to access a private dentist because they simply cannot afford the up-front cost or they do not have private health insurance. It was really an attack on those people. I now understand, from a press release from the minister, that they have effectively read the writing on the wall—one of those rare moments of self-awareness from this government—and they are planning to restore the funding back to the $1,000 per child and to restore the scheme as it was originally designed by the Greens. 


I know that the minister has been under some pressure from stakeholders. It is good that the new health minister has listened, and I commend him for that. I would also like to congratulate those stakeholders within the dental community who have put the case to the minister and indeed made their views very clear on this. So, given the minister's announcement, I assume that he will support this disallowance motion—given that he has said he will restore that $1,000.


I have to say, it is very clear that the government has been keen to scrap the Medicare funded dental scheme all along. One of the more disgraceful chapters in this saga was when the government on multiple occasions released fact sheets and sent out information to families and to dentists saying they would no longer be able to receive dental care for their children under the scheme because they had a plan sometime in the future to get rid of it, despite never having the agreement of the Senate. 


So on one hand they are saying one of the issues with the scheme is that it is underutilised; and then on the other hand they are telling people they cannot utilise it because they are going to scrap it. What do you expect? They have undermined it at every turn. They have consistently fought to scrap this scheme. They have done nothing to promote it. In fact they have done the opposite. They have provided misleading information to the community to say the scheme will no longer be funded and therefore you will no longer be eligible. At Senate estimates time and time again we have caught the department out with false and misleading information being sent to individuals. Each time they corrected it, and then they returned to their dark old ways of providing people with misleading information. 


I have to say that, while we are pleased that the government has finally listened—and certainly the new health minister appears to have listened—and while this is an important scheme for children, and 80 per cent of kids have now got access to dental care through a private dental provider funded through Medicare, one of the real concerns here is what this government has done when it comes to funding for public dental health care. 


For those people who do not know, the states and Commonwealth jointly fund public dental health clinics. There are many of them around the country, and they are very important because adults who cannot access this Medicare funded scheme, who cannot afford to pay the up-front cost to go and see a dentist, at least have the comfort of knowing that there is a public dental scheme waiting for them. 


One of the other significant achievements through that period of power sharing government was that we got a massive injection in funding into the public dental scheme. We had a significant injection, which brought down waiting lists, which in some places are up to three years. We have people who are waiting for dentures, who cannot afford to pay for them out of their own pocket, who have to wait for three years on a public dental scheme to be able to get dentures so they can just have a quality of life that most of us take for granted. Just reflect on that. We are not talking about cosmetic dental care here. We are talking about people who have chronic abscesses; some of them simply do not have any teeth and are waiting for dentures, and waiting for years. We went some way to addressing that through working with the Labor Party and Independents to ensure that we got a big injection into the public dental system. 


What have this government done? They have ruthlessly attacked public dental services. In the 2013-14 budget they promised $391 million for 2016-17 public dental services. How much are we seeing now? $107 million per year. So last year the amount was reduced to about $155 million per year, from that $391 million that  was promised. Now they have cut it again and they are saying it is $320 million over three years. That is one-third of what was promised in the 2013-14 budget. They have slashed funding for public dental care. Of all the things, all the priorities, all of the areas where we could make savings—and I could list a huge number of those areas ripe for savings.


We have to decide in this country whether we are going to try and balance the budget on the back of this nation's most vulnerable people, some of the poorest people here, or whether we recognise there is a huge and growing gap between the super-rich and ordinary people and start to recognise what our priorities are. Let's talk about the diesel fuel rebate that goes to the mining industry worth billions of dollars. Let's stop propping up investment in the housing market by subsidising people who want to buy their third, fourth or fifth home. Let's tackle negative gearing and reform the capital gains tax discount.  


They are the sort of areas where we can make changes. How about a levy on the big banks to ensure that they pay for the guarantee that they get from government, rather than trying to squeeze a few million dollars out of health budgets, attacking vulnerable pensioners and doing what we saw in today's changes to family tax benefits, where the government is saying that the only way we are going to be able to help families is by hurting them.


We have some choices to make in this country. We have to decide whether we as a nation want to ensure that we have a more equal, more caring society. That means cracking down on multinational tax avoidance and ending the rorts that exist in the property market that inflate home prices for young people, who are being screwed at the moment, and see them continue to be left out of the property market and basically denied an opportunity to own their own home. They are the sort of measures that we as a nation could take, rather than what this government is proposing to do, which is to cut essential services that I think are the foundation of a decent society.


The good news is that the government has seen the light today on the Medicare-funded dental scheme for kids, the CDBS. We are pleased about that. What we would like to see is a move to restore funding for public dental care. As I said, the Greens have said now for many, many years that we think the mouth should be considered like the rest of the body. Going to the dentist should be just like going to the doctor: produce your Medicare card, which is effectively a universal health insurance scheme that means we all get access to decent health care, which includes decent dental care.


The Senate is rejecting this cut to the CDBS. As Greens, we will continue to fight not just to protect this scheme but to build it up; to make sure it is available not just to children but indeed, one day, to all Australians. We will challenge this government to restore that funding to public dental health care and to start balancing the budget by ensuring that we tackle that big and growing gap between the rich and ordinary people in this country. There are so many areas where we could make savings, where we could ensure that we have a sustainable budget position. You do not do it by balancing the budget on the back of this country's poorest and most vulnerable people.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (18:17):  The Turnbull government is committed to ensuring that children right across Australia, both in cities and in remote areas, have access to the dentist when they need it. Under the scheme, on average only $312 of the rebate has been claimed per child per year. In light of this, the government has previously set the cap at $700 per child over a two-year period, which would still allow children to visit a dentist regularly. However, following consultation with the Australian Dental Association, the Minister for Health has decided to reinstate the cap at $1,000. We are also providing $11 million over two years to the Royal Flying Doctor Service to delivered dental outreach services to rural and remote communities. The Turnbull government is delivering on its commitment to improve the dental health of all Australians through the Child Dental Benefits Schedule and to contribute to better public dental services through a national partnership agreement with the states and territories.

"Griff, Sen Stirling",NXT,2017-02-08,"



Senator GRIFF
 (South Australia) (18:18):  I am pleased to be co-sponsoring this motion. Cutting health treatments for children and low-income families is definitely not good policy. Inevitably, it just leads to deferred health costs for the public health system. The money saved today would merely be spent many times over in the future to deal with escalating problems that may have been prevented through early intervention. 


We do not support cutting $300 per child from the Child Dental Benefits Schedule because it is short-sighted and, I feel, poorly considered. Ensuring that children have healthy teeth helps set them up for a healthier adulthood. We know that poor dental health is linked to bigger health problems, such as heart disease, so moves to scale back dental services should not be taken lightly. 


The CDBS scheme has been in operation since January 2014 and provides basic dental services such as cleaning, fillings, X-rays and root canals to eligible children aged between two and 17. The government had originally proposed scrapping the scheme and creating a new one that combined funding for both adults and children; however, several states rejected the proposal over concerns that they were being short-changed and thousands of people would miss out on treatment. In December the government instead announced a modified Child Dental Benefits Schedule that cut the scheme's cap from $1,000 per child over two years to $700 per child, claiming that this reflected user patterns. This could not be further from the truth. Last financial year more than one million children accessed free dental treatment through the scheme. This was slightly more than the previous year, costing $312.7 million in benefits. The government has budgeted for 2.4 million children to use the service each year, representing a substantial saving on paper. Despite this, the government feels the need to rip money out of the scheme to the detriment of the children who do use it. 


The Chief Medical Officer's review of the scheme administration, released in March last year, suggested the government's target of 2.4 million users was optimistic, and that the poor uptake was probably because the program was poorly promoted. Families getting Family Tax Benefit Part A are only made aware of their entitlement through a single letter from Centrelink. The scheme's low profile is compounded by the fact that most services across Australia are delivered privately. The jurisdictions where it was delivered through public dental services enjoy very much greater utilisation of the scheme. For instance, in my home state of South Australia almost 40 per cent of eligible children took up free dental care, the highest rate of use in 2014, and the review noted that the South Australian Dental Service was particularly proactive in accessing the scheme. In New South Wales, where it is almost solely delivered privately, the uptake was closer to 30 per cent. Regardless, the fact that one million children a year use this free dental care is no small thing. Because the scheme is so highly targeted, the children who need it most do use it. The states with the highest degree of use also had the highest number of disadvantaged children. About one in 10 children who used it in 2015 went over the $700 limit proposed by the government in just one year. 


The government has not made a sound case for cutting the dental care subsidy. In fact, it has made no substantive case at all. For this reason we do not agree with this measure and we support the disallowance motion.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:23):  In continuation of my discussion of the presentation on country-of-origin labelling, this legislation before chamber today amends Australian consumer law to simplify the test used to justify a country-of-origin claim of 'made in' and removes the 50 per cent production cost test. It will make clear that importing ingredients and undertaking minor processes that merely change the form of appearance of imported goods, such as dicing or canning, are not sufficient to justify a 'made in' claim.


I am very pleased to see this legislation getting fine-tuned and coming forward. Also, I support what others have said, and what Senator Macdonald has said, about the seafood industry—in allowing them to be identified more clearly. I was on a Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee inquiry into fish labelling/seafood labelling in the Northern Territory. Seventy per cent of the seafood in Australia is imported. We need to go a step further to see that the people who are eating seafood, like all other foods, know exactly where it comes from. Of course, this also promotes the Australian consumption and jobs in Australia. It is well known throughout the world that, if it is grown in Australia and processed in Australia, then it is good, clean food from the best farmers in the world.


I will conclude my contribution in saying that I welcome the country-of-origin labelling. As my colleague Senator Nash knows, we nearly ran out of puff on this issue at some stage. I said to Senator Nash, 'I've been trying for 23 years to get this country-of-origin labelling. I'm giving up. I'm hitting my head against a brick wall. I'm sick of having a bruised forehead and going nowhere.' Thanks to former Prime Minister Abbott for his decision to proceed with this and to my colleagues in the coalition. The inquiry has been a long period of consultation.


There will no doubt be some fine-tuning required later on. These things are complicated. They may have a negative effect on some businesses, with paperwork and labelling and clarification. We can do that later. The most important thing is: 1 July 2018 is the day when everything must be finalised. The Australian people can learn to read the labels—the bar underneath the green triangle with the kangaroo in it—to see how much is actually grown in Australia. And, of course, they will know that the more that bar is filled up the better quality food they can consume with total confidence. One thing that we have in this country—along with many things that we are good at—is great farmers.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:29):  I have a number of questions in respect of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill and in relation to the second reading amendment which was just defeated. I outlined the basis of that amendment in my second reading contribution—in other words, that there be an administrative arrangement to determine whether labelling laws were being complied with. In particular, this matter was raised in the context of the inquiry into this bill. It seems to me that there ought to be an analysis and report on the benefit of an administrative mechanism which would give manufacturers the ability to apply for a ruling on country-of-origin labelling claims. In my additional comments in the Senate committee's report into this bill, I made a recommendation that legislation ought to be introduced to this effect.


What I respectfully put to the minister is that there is a real issue as to how the supply of inputs is determined to be Australian or not. In particular, Australian Made Campaign Limited, whilst it supported the removal of the 50 per cent cost test, noted:


… some concerns that it may result in adverse consequences for some Australian suppliers of inputs. This will occur where a manufacturer opts to source cheaper inputs offshore, knowing that it will not affect their capacity to make a Made in Australia claim. An example of this is a manufacturer of soft gel capsules who currently purchases gelatin from an Australian manufacturer because it assists them to meet the 50% threshold. The local packaging industry may also be impacted adversely by this change.


AMCL raised concerns that there was currently no mechanism by which manufacturers could obtain a definitive answer regarding country-of-origin claims, and this could result in companies being hesitant to make a claim for fear that competitors would challenge its validity. That is contained in the committee report. So that is a particular issue that I would be grateful if the minister could address. Australian Made Campaign Limited is well known and it made a very cogent submission, and there does not appear to be any administrative mechanism to deal with the concerns made by Australian Made Campaign Limited.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:32):  We acknowledge the need to improve the certainty around labelling requirements—that is why we are making these changes to the country-of-origin safe harbour defences, which are meant to address some of the concerns of business. We have revised the safe harbour provisions to clarify and simplify the rules for making claims about where goods are made and to expand the resources available to business. The ACCC will be releasing improved guidance material on country-of-origin labelling under Australian Consumer Law and on its approach to enforcement. We have also developed an online decision tool which assists food businesses to identify and download appropriate labels for their products under the new country-of-origin labelling information standard. The changes proposed by the government have been informed by extensive consultation and by a regulation impact statement. Under an intergovernmental agreement, all these proposals for change must be agreed by the Commonwealth and all states and territories—it is a bit like the GST. The Commonwealth cannot make changes to Australian Consumer Law without going through that lengthy process again.


Lastly, it is important to note that the new arrangements put forward in this bill and the new information standard will be reviewed two years after the end of the transition period. This will provide the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of these reforms in meeting their objectives. Certainly on behalf of the government I am willing to give you undertakings in relation to this review. Obviously we want to monitor this and make it successful. The fact that parties on all sides think that this is a good way to go and that this is a good start is very encouraging to me. I do not believe, at this stage, that we have adequately looked at the costs and benefits of what Senator Xenophon has proposed, but I believe we are giving assistance to industry. Proper guidance in relation to safe harbours, as well as additional resources, should provide some comfort for them as they go through this process.


I have looked at the labelling. I think it looks good and I think it is much easier to understand. We are talking here about substantial transformation; we are not talking about slicing and dicing and making some change in the canning. We are putting a lot of resources, including an advertising campaign, into informing consumers and businesses about how this is going to operate.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:34):  I thank the minister for his answer, but there was a concern from Australian Made Campaign Limited about uncertainty in terms of whether a claim could be made or not. The minister did make reference to some of the matters. Could he give some particularity on the types of resources that would be employed here and on whether the guidance tools—the online mechanisms that he referred to—would have any administrative force or give any protection to manufacturers? It would be short of an administrative mechanism or a natural determination as such—it seems to be a web tool that would give some guidance. What would happen if a manufacturer goes online, ticks all the boxes and it comes up as saying that they have reached this threshold, but then they are involved in a legal dispute, perhaps even with the ACCC? What protection do they have from that?


The other issue—this is not a trick question; this is a genuine question that I seek guidance from the minister on—is what are the fundamental differences on substantial transformation. Given that you say the previous regime, the 51 per cent, does not include slicing and dicing, can you give some detail to crystallise what the key differences are so that there is some greater meaning in terms of what Australian made actually means?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:36):  In relation to the first question, I would have to say that the safe harbour defences are designed exactly for that purpose: to give confidence to companies that, if they are doing the right thing and they are putting the labels on in the right way, they are protected. It is important to understand that. In relation to the second question, the best I can do is refer you to some of the material that is being provided in relation to the various types of products, how they could be packaged and what that would mean.


For example, in the case of ham, the critical ingredients in the brine mix required for curing the pork to form ham or similar products are not available in Australia and must be imported. So, as long as the ham is there, it can be 100 per cent Australian. If it is made in Australia from 96 per cent Australian pork and water with imported brine mix: 'Made or packed in Australia from at least 96 per cent Australian ingredients'. If it is made in Australia from imported pork and brine mix with Australian water accounting for 20 per cent of ongoing weight only: 'Made in Australia from at least 20 per cent ingredients'. If a ham is made in Denmark, imported into Australia and then sliced and packaged in blocks or slices for retail sale in Australia: 'Made in Denmark' or 'Made in Denmark, packed in Australia'. If a ham is made and packed in a single overseas country—for example, Canada—and then imported into Australia for retail sale: 'Made in Canada'. If the ham made in one overseas country—it could be Canada again—and is imported into and packed in another overseas country, for example, the USA, the above label can still be used or 'Made in Canada, packed in the United States of America'.


Making pork into ham is a substantial transformation, as the pork and ham are identified as fundamentally different products. Most brine mixes used to make ham combine critical ingredients—sugars, salts, nitrates, flavours—from different countries. The brine mix is added to local water to form a solution of varying strengths. The solution is then injected into the pork and left to cure for varying periods, turning it into ham. 


There are a whole series of these examples—we can go through them—which will illustrate the proposition. But let me come back to the Australian Made Campaign, because I think that is an important point. In a case like that, I can engage directly with the Australian Made Campaign people and sort out the way forward in terms of the materials we are going to be providing and the use of the online decision tool. As I said before, there will be information campaigns and all the rest of it. There may be elements at the margin where a question may be raised, but if we are going to have a period of providing information we can work much of this out.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:39):  I do want to go through some of these issues. I hope you do not find it tedious, but I think this is important. The Australian Made Campaign Limited raised a number of points. Their submission to the Senate inquiry states:


While we support the changes embodied in the Bill overall, we have ongoing concerns about the lack of objectivity in the key criteria and the absence of definitions of key concepts.


The submission further states:


AMCL has previously expressed our concern that the terms 'significant ingredient' and 'significant component' continue to be undefined in the legislation. While the ACCC has in the past provided some guidance on the meaning of these terms, our experience has been that businesses continue to struggle with practical application of this test.


…      …   …


AMCL strongly recommends that the Bill provide greater clarity around these key concepts. For example, a 'significant ingredient' could be defined as any ingredient excluding preservatives, food processing aids, food colouring, etc. In the absence of a definition within the legislation, extensive guidance is required with examples from a range of industries.


The minister gave a helpful example about ham and brine—and he was making me hungry talking about it!—but I think it is important that we deal with the very reasonable request from the Australian Made Campaign Limited.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:40):  There are a couple of points. Firstly, let me clarify that the ACCC is providing guidance. It is guidance that they are prepared to stand by—that is the important point. I have not interacted with the Australian Made Campaign. I am advised that they were consulted in arriving at examples. Sometimes you have to look at the glass as being half full rather than half empty. We may not get perfection today—




Senator Xenophon:
  Where was the glass made?




Senator SINODINOS:
  Well, whether it was plastic or it was made from proper glass—sand and silica—we will see! The point is this: we can proceed on the basis that most people in this chamber believe is a fair basis on which to go forward. On the way, if issues arise, there is a two-year monitoring period. I do not believe that in that time substantial harm will be done to Australian industry if there has to be some sort of tweaking of the examples we are talking about or their interpretation. The ACCC is fully onside, and I am happy to interact further with the Australian Made Campaign on any outstanding concerns. As I said before, they were consulted in arriving at examples.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:42):  I am not suggesting that the glass is not half full; I just want to make sure it is an Australian glass with Australian water in it. I want to put this to the minister. I support the legislation. I believe it should go further, but I support it. The Australian Made Campaign Limited has reasonable concerns. Their submission states:




Definition of 'substantial transformation'



AMCL's principal concern in this area is that both the current and the proposed definition of 'substantial transformation' are very far from providing a clear and objective criterion against which to assess claims. The phrase 'fundamentally different in identity, nature or essential character' is highly subjective and open to interpretation.


AMCL argue for that simple administrative mechanism.  The minister says that there is a website and that there will be guidelines from the ACCC, but can the minister assure us that the claims that are made about Australian made, with the new substantial transformation test, will be robust? How do you resolve a dispute? If a manufacturer goes to the ACCC saying, 'We want to make this claim,' it is not the ACCC's job to make a determination for them. I do not think that is the way the ACCC operates unless they are able to in the context of this legislation.

I really think it is important for us to bed down what we have got. The only way we can improve on this is to implement it and see how it goes. I think that is really important.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:44):  I thank the minister for his answer and the spirit in which he gave it. I just make the point that reasonable concerns were raised by the Australian Made Campaign Limited, and I do not think they have been addressed adequately. I accept what the minister says—let's give it a go. I think he could have been more rigorous. Before I move my amendment, I want to ask something of the minister. I think Senator Macdonald was going to sing his praises earlier on today, and I was happy for him to do so.


There has been a long saga over seafood labelling. When you buy fresh seafood in supermarkets or at fishmongers, they tell you where it comes from. But in the context of food labelling, if you go to a seafood restaurant or your local takeaway fish and chip shop, even though it might be right next door to the supermarket, 10 metres away, it seems that magically the requirements for labelling disappear. Senators from all sides of the chamber in the last parliament supported reforms based on the Northern Territory reforms to give that information to consumers. This bill does not touch on that.


In the context of labelling for cooked seafood, can the minister indicate, for the many millions of Australians who regularly enjoy their seafood in fish and chip shops, restaurants and takeaway shops, whether the government is planning to bring about reforms based broadly on the very successful Northern Territory laws? By the way, the evidence from the seafood industry is that many thousands of jobs would be created. I think there were 3,000 jobs in one sector alone. The prawn fishers say it would make a very big difference to their job numbers if we had this key reform in seafood labelling laws.

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:46):  I have a couple of points. The first is that I discovered when I inherited the portfolio that my assistant minister is a very capable person. There has been a working group set up to look at options around country-of-origin labelling for seafood, and he has written to key stakeholders seeking their views and further information in relation to consumer access to information for seafood sold in the food-service environment. That is being followed up, and stakeholders have been asked to respond by 9 March, and the working group will then review this information and consider the next steps.


I go back to where I started. This is a process that is Commonwealth and state. Yes, you mentioned what the Territory has done, and the Territory can be an exemplar on many things, I am sure. But we have worked this through with the Commonwealth and with the states. We have had extensive consultation and a regulation impact statement et cetera, so the new arrangements put forward in this bill and the new information standard are going to be reviewed two years after the end of the transition period. And this will be an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of these reforms in meeting their objectives.


In the meantime, I have not had the opportunity as yet to meet with people like the Australian Made Campaign and get it directly from the horse's mouth or pick up whatever recommendations there may be from the assistant minister on seafood.

 (South Australia) (18:48):  I am pleased. I had discussions with Senator Nash and the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Barnaby Joyce, although I am not sure whether he was Deputy Prime Minister at the time that did not seem to go as far as I wanted. Can the minister indicate, as a matter of principle, what is his and his government's view? As a matter of principle, should Australian consumers who go to the supermarket and know where their seafood comes from also have that right and degree of information when they go into a fish and chip shop or a restaurant? Should they know at the very least whether it is local Australian seafood or imported?

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:49):  As a matter of principle I want consumers to have as much information as possible. There is always a bit of a debate about how you provide that information. You can walk into a restaurant and, when you see barramundi on the menu, ask, 'Where is this barramundi from? Is it from the Territory? Is it from overseas?' If you see spaghetti marinara on the menu, you can say, 'Where are the prawns from?' You can do that. If you are telling me you do not necessarily trust what the waiter or the restaurateur will say and you want that somehow with the imprimatur of a third-party, all I can say is that my capable assistant minister is looking into these issues.


All I want to do today is progress the agreement we have got in this chamber and use that as a basis for implementing these reforms, getting them out there and getting an information campaign going. Then we are on the exciting road of more and more information available to people through their labels. And then we are on the exciting road of working out where there are any problems and how we improve on where we are going. This is a journey; it is not a destination.

The answer seemed to be ambiguous.

Application



The amendment made by item 6 applies in relation to reporting periods commencing on or after the day this Schedule commences.


This amendment is fairly straightforward one. One of the complaints made by the Australian Food and Grocery Council and others in the past about mandatory country-of-origin labelling laws is that there are costs involved. Once you label something, if the ingredients change because of seasonal variations or for whatever reason, it is very expensive to change labels. What this amendment seeks to do—a sort of belts and braces approach to the legislation that is before us—in addition to what this bill provides for is to go another step. It basically says that there must be notification online of reporting country of origin imported ingredients to ensure that, at the end of the reporting period—every six months—they must notify the secretary of the department of each ingredient of the food that is not exclusively of Australian origin and the country or countries of origin, and, if there is more than one country of origin of the ingredient during the reporting period, the average proportion by weight of the ingredient from each country of origin over the reporting period. This ensures that it is published online. It means that the information can be published in an easily accessible form and it does not have the burden that the industry has referred to of having to change labels, which can be very costly and, with production lines and the like, is itself quite time consuming.


Effectively, this is using the internet for a purpose to empower consumers. It means that every six months—for instance, for orange juice—if there was a shift from 30 per cent Brazilian concentrate to 70 per cent concentrate or if it was 100 per cent Australian juice, we get to know about it. Right now, this bill, even though it is an improvement on the current laws, does not give that level of detail. It does not give consumers details of where that ingredient comes from and what percentage of it is Australian or indeed imported.


That in essence is what this amendment is about. I can indicate that I will be seeking to divide on this in the absence of any clear commitments from the government that it will progress this issue. But I look forward to the minister's response in respect of this. It is something I foreshadowed a number of months ago in the committee report where I set out these issues.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-02-08,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:54):  The Labor Party does not support Senator Xenophon's amendment to the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill 2016. I indicated to the minister that we would facilitate passage of this bill, so I will not be speaking at length on this question. I do have a serious matter that I do want addressed, and I will just explain to Senator Xenophon: the proposal you have advanced is, I understand, based on a sincere commitment to the strengthening of the regulatory regime, and I appreciate the intent of your sentiments in that regard. However, the moves to make the country of origin labelling more flexible, more digitalised, are of course something that both industry and consumers have more options on, and I think this bill does provide us with an opportunity to genuinely improve the amount of information that is available. I am also highly conscious of the fact that the minister has indicated that in terms of this particular regulation there is a requirement for Commonwealth-state agreement.


We are supporting these reforms, but we do not believe that the arrangements this bill puts in place are perfect. Many further improvements are required. I have been spending more and more time in the food industry's processing plants in this country. Recently I visited the Australian smallgoods food manufacturer Bertocchi. Bertocchi is a major manufacturing employer in Melbourne's north and is making significant investments in plant and new equipment. When those investments are completed there will be something like 700 people on the payroll at Bertocchi. It is the third largest smallgoods manufacturer in the country. This is exactly the sort of investment we need, especially in Victoria, given what is happening with the automotive industry. 


Food manufacturers like Bertocchi work in a highly regulated industry, and changes to labelling have very serious impacts on their costs of doing business. I have spoken to the company about their concerns and the need for greater flexibility. I have raised these concerns with the minister, and I want to thank the minister for facilitating access to the department at senior officer level and through AusIndustry. There are a range of issues that Bertocchi needs assistance on, which can best be provided by direct contact with serious people within the department.


The point here, though, is that the proposal Senator Xenophon has advanced to us today does not solve the problems for Bertocchi. Changes to the country of origin labelling which are already in place are the result of very extensive consultation with industry and consumers as well as state and federal governments, and I do not think we can step outside that process. The circumventing of this process with new reporting requirements, additional reporting requirements, introduced at the 11th hour is not an advisable way to be introducing regulations of this importance, particularly regulations that have such wide-ranging and potentially negative impacts on Australian food manufacturers—and, I might suggest, with limited benefit to consumers.


I note the minister's statements reflected in the explanatory memorandum in regard to the review process after two years. If the changes to the reporting requirement are needed, I think the review process provides us with an opportunity to secure further changes in a well thought out, coherent way. But my question really goes to this: Minister, you have made some assurances, which I appreciate, but I really think it is appropriate that you outline to the chamber what this review mechanism is—what do you have in mind? How will the process be managed? How will you be able to ensure through any such process that the regulatory system will be genuinely flexible and the best practice for Australian manufacturers such as Bertocchi? What precisely do you have in mind in regard to the review? How are you going to fund it, and what actually is the process of engagement with industry?

"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:59):  I have a couple of points to begin with. The first is: in terms of the review process, I had in mind an informal process which involved dealing with the stakeholders. I was not going to set up a formalised working group with a fancy name and give it a big budget because I think this is an ongoing process. As I said before, there will be a review at the end of two years but within the two years there is going to be scope to be talking to people, including the Australian Made Campaign, about how this goes forward. I am happy to look at a more formal process. If that is something the shadow minister and others think would be a good thing, I am happy to discuss that further. 


It will also have to go back to COAG in due course because we have come at this through a Commonwealth-state process. There will be a regulatory impact statement under Australian consumer law; there will be mechanisms. But I am happy to talk about this further. Having opened this can of worms, if you like, it is clear—and the Bertocchi the example that you use is an example of this—that there are issues where more flexibility is required and so we are acting in a way which promotes the needs of Australian enterprises. I accept that. I am willing to consult further on what the review process will be, but it will also involve that Commonwealth-state mechanism in due course.


In relation to what Senator Xenophon has said, again, I appreciate the spirit in which he has made those points. The regulation impact statement which was provided in the explanatory memorandum explored the relative importance to consumers of disclosing the origin of specific ingredients and the burden to business of responding to such a requirement. It concluded that consumers prefer to see origin information on labels, not digitally, and that they value knowing the Australian content of products more highly than the origin of specific ingredients. The regulation impact statement also concluded that it is not currently feasible for businesses in the food industry to make origin information on specific or all ingredients available digitally, especially for small and micro producers. I think this is where my concern is. It is one thing to be talking about a multinational corporation which has all sorts of resources to do all sorts of things and can finance all sorts of overheads, but in the case of the smaller producers in particular—and I think this is where the flexibility point comes in—we have to have some recognition of their particular needs. However, we will be working with the food business to examine mechanisms for improving the digital infrastructure of the food industry over time. From my point of view, it is more the SMEs which are an issue in that regard. We will continue to look at ways through which we can improve consumer access to the information that matters to them.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:02):  I thank the minister for his response and Senator Carr for his contribution. I make this point: companies such as the very successful smallgoods company in Victoria that Senator Carr referred to—and I wish them every success and I hope they grow along with food processing companies across the nation—know what is in their food. They know what they have put in there and they ought to know as a matter of course where that ingredient comes from. That is not a difficult or onerous requirement. I am suggesting that consumers do prefer to see basic information on their labels when they are making a buying decision in the supermarket. But I think it could change the culture of some food processors, particularly multinational processors, if they were required to publish this information. It would not be overly onerous. There could be, for instance, a minimum threshold on the turnover of the business if there is a concern about administrative burdens, but it would actually empower consumers in a significant way to have more information than they otherwise would have. I ask the minister: given there will be a review, will the review include consideration of providing further information online and the feasibility of doing so in the context of that review? In other words, are the terms of the review set? If not, how will that be set? Does the minister have the ability to ensure that this particular issue of providing further information online on a regular basis is something that will be considered as part of the review?

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (19:06):  The Australian Greens will be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. Overall, we still believe that we have some way to go until we have the best country-of-origin labelling that we need in this country. We feel that there is still room for improvement. We are going to be supporting the bill overall because we think that what has been put forward is a step forward and it is an improvement. It is in that spirit as well that we are supporting Senator Xenophon's amendment. We do not think it is perfect; we think it is probably a reasonable amount of work. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating to see how much value it really would be to consumers. 


I do not accept the position being put that it would be too much of a regulatory burden. As Senator Xenophon has pointed out, food manufacturers know where their ingredients come from and, if they do not, they need to know, because they need to have that accountability in the supply chain. So, given that they are paying their bills and know that they bought X-kilograms of walnuts from California or whatever it is, I do not think it is going to be too much for that to be reported in a manner which then gives more transparency and accountability to the Australian consumer and to see that what is on the labels of food that a consumer is buying is reflected and true over a period of time. 


I think we are on a journey in terms of this country-of-origin labelling. If we keep on working at it, we will get there and eventually end up with labelling so that we have that transparency and consumers know what they are buying to eat. It does mean that it is going to place more focus on people knowing what they are eating and, because of that, they will be paying more attention to it. I think it will support people in making healthier and more sustainable food choices. This legislation is heading us in that direction. We have still got a way to go, but I think Senator Xenophon's amendment is perhaps going to be only a small step forward to getting some legislation that meets the requirements of healthy, sustainable food consumption in Australia.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (19:08):  I will briefly make two points. The first is that we all accept the importance of providing this sort of information, given the context in which the recent reforms have come about. It really goes to very basic issues for all of us as human beings, wanting to be assured that what we are eating is, as you say, Senator Rice, safe; it is the best; and, where possible, we are also supporting local industry in a non-distorting way, if I can put it like that. I accept all of that. 


I also accept the need to provide more information rather than less where that is feasible and where we are not providing undue regulatory burdens. I think we agree on that. What you are really saying is that you do not believe the regulatory burden is as great as some people may be making out. We are going to test that in the review period as we look at the further digitisation of the food industry. I think that is going to be very important. As I said before in response to Senator Xenophon, we will be consulting people on the terms of the review, and that will obviously include the Greens as well.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:23):  In continuation of my discussion of the presentation on country-of-origin labelling, this legislation before chamber today amends Australian consumer law to simplify the test used to justify a country-of-origin claim of 'made in' and removes the 50 per cent production cost test. It will make clear that importing ingredients and undertaking minor processes that merely change the form of appearance of imported goods, such as dicing or canning, are not sufficient to justify a 'made in' claim.


I am very pleased to see this legislation getting fine-tuned and coming forward. Also, I support what others have said, and what Senator Macdonald has said, about the seafood industry—in allowing them to be identified more clearly. I was on a Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee inquiry into fish labelling/seafood labelling in the Northern Territory. Seventy per cent of the seafood in Australia is imported. We need to go a step further to see that the people who are eating seafood, like all other foods, know exactly where it comes from. Of course, this also promotes the Australian consumption and jobs in Australia. It is well known throughout the world that, if it is grown in Australia and processed in Australia, then it is good, clean food from the best farmers in the world.


I will conclude my contribution in saying that I welcome the country-of-origin labelling. As my colleague Senator Nash knows, we nearly ran out of puff on this issue at some stage. I said to Senator Nash, 'I've been trying for 23 years to get this country-of-origin labelling. I'm giving up. I'm hitting my head against a brick wall. I'm sick of having a bruised forehead and going nowhere.' Thanks to former Prime Minister Abbott for his decision to proceed with this and to my colleagues in the coalition. The inquiry has been a long period of consultation.


There will no doubt be some fine-tuning required later on. These things are complicated. They may have a negative effect on some businesses, with paperwork and labelling and clarification. We can do that later. The most important thing is: 1 July 2018 is the day when everything must be finalised. The Australian people can learn to read the labels—the bar underneath the green triangle with the kangaroo in it—to see how much is actually grown in Australia. And, of course, they will know that the more that bar is filled up the better quality food they can consume with total confidence. One thing that we have in this country—along with many things that we are good at—is great farmers.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales—Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science) (18:26):  I rise to thank my fellow members on both sides of the chamber who participated in this debate. It is an important part of the country-of-origin labelling reforms championed by the government. I will not labour many of the issues which have been raised. I am aware that some senators have raised issues about going further. Senator Xenophon has raised certain issues. There have been issues in relation to seafood. But I do not intend to delay the Senate too much at this point, except to say that I will consider further some of the comments that have been made. This is a bit of a work in progress. But let's nail this and go on to the next stage. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-02-08,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (19:19):  I rise today to address a deeply troubling challenge facing my home state of Victoria—that of energy affordability and security. All of us in this place know of the recent closure of the Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley and the loss of 800 jobs from the local economy and the devastation that inflicted on the Latrobe Valley community. Last year, in 2016, the Andrews Labor government increased the minerals royalty charge by 300 per cent—which is an extraordinary number—completely disregarding the concerns that this would reduce the viability of energy companies in Victoria and that it would cause significant increases in the cost of power in our state.


Unfortunately, the results have been very clear: Hazelwood workers are out of a job and Victorians are facing increases of up to $300 a year on their energy bills. Hazelwood supplied up to a quarter of Victoria's energy, but its closure makes our state reliant on others, instead of being energy self-sufficient. For a state with the energy resources of Victoria that is entirely unacceptable. This reliance puts our state in a very dangerous position. If observing Australia's energy market over the last year has taught us anything at all, it is that depending on other states for power can leave the lights off and bring business to a grinding halt.


Recent experience in South Australia shows us that states must be able to stand on their own two feet and supply local power for their people and their businesses. I ask: how can a state prosper when it fails to provide reliable power at an affordable price to its citizens? The answer is that it simply cannot. It is impossible. South Australia has unfortunately demonstrated the consequences of high energy costs and of creating an environment that is entirely hostile to investment, to business growth and, ultimately, to employment and to employment opportunities. South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, with Arrium's Whyalla Steelworks the most notable example of those job losses. The Wetherill Labor government's decision to provide unjustifiably high subsidies to wind and solar power suppliers has triggered blackouts and a spike in energy costs that has brought almost the entire state to its knees. It is something we have spoken about in this chamber and that has been spoken about repeatedly in the media.


While South Australia's energy security and economic woes are a sad corollary of South Australia's ideological approach to energy production, my primary concern is for the state I was elected to represent. Indeed, I hold grave fears for Victoria's energy security under an Andrews Labor government, a government that has put Victoria on the same path as South Australia. And if the Andrews government's 40 per cent renewable energy target is a threat to affordable and secure energy in Victoria, then my greatest concern is that Mr. Shorten's Labor opposition and their 50 per cent renewable energy target represents an even worse threat across our nation. Mr Shorten wants Australia to source 50 per cent of its energy from renewables by 2030, the exact same goal as Premier Jay Wetherill and his ill-fated state of South Australia. One would think that the malaise lingering around the South Australian economy is evidence that extreme renewable energy targets cannot sit alongside the goals of job creation and improving living standards, which Australians expect and deserve. Certainly, Victorians expect and deserve better.


At their heart, extreme renewable energy targets represent an ideological approach to energy that places emissions reduction ahead of energy security, and energy security is our priority. As it currently stands, renewable energy sources are unable to provide a consistent, secure baseload power supply to the national grid. Instead, renewables like wind and solar supply intermittent power, which unfortunately comes with major drawbacks. Put simply, when the wind ain't blowing and the sun ain't shining, power is simply not being generated.


The coalition government is acutely aware of these issues and has made a decisive move to improve Australia's long-neglected energy storage capacity. This, I believe, is particularly exciting. The Prime Minister has requested that ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation work together on a new funding round for large-scale energy storage solutions. This storage will improve the stability and the reliability of variable renewables.


But renewables alone will not fulfil our goal of stable and secure energy supplies. As old high-emissions power stations are retired, we will need to consider more baseload power to fill that void and be capable of supplying power day in and day out. As the world's largest coal exporter we have a vested interest in showing that we can provide both lower emissions and reliable baseload power with state-of-the-art clean coal-fired technology, utilising both combustion efficiency and pollution control. It is possible.


Indeed, our approach to emissions reduction should be technology agnostic—the maximum emissions reduction for the least amount of economic damage to families and to businesses. We should employ our vast supplies of coal in cutting-edge facilities that will allow us to use our natural competitive advantage in power production to deliver low-cost energy to Australian homes and businesses. Let me make it clear that our commitment to the federal renewable energy target remains unwavering, but this government is determined to achieve its target without the devastating impact that a 50 per cent renewable energy target under Labor, sadly demonstrated in South Australia, would have upon Australian businesses.


The Turnbull coalition government is approaching emissions reduction and energy security in a clear-eyed and far more pragmatic way. We are not at all shackled to certain technological methods, unlike those opposite, but rather we are determined to make sure that we choose the most practical, efficient path towards emissions reduction. This government is determined that Australia should be able to achieve the policy trifecta of energy that is affordable, reliable and secure. Labor's approach is driven simply by ideology, heedless of the cost of the thousands of Australian jobs that it will destroy. I am determined that my state will not follow in the same path as South Australia.
