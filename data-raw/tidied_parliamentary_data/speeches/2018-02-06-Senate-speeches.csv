Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:02):  It is my pleasure to advise the Senate that, since we last met, during the last sitting week before Christmas, some more work has been done across the chamber in relation to this important bill. We do believe that there is now majority support for the bill in the Senate, even if former Senator Lambie were still here and voting against the bill. Furthermore, noting the proposal of the opposition to defer consideration of this bill until such time as a replacement for former Senator Lambie has joined the Senate, I'm also pleased to advise the Senate that the government and the opposition have had some further discussions in relation to the progression of this bill.


I'm pleased to be able to inform the Senate that we've reached agreement and that bill can proceed now, subject to certain amendments which we understand the opposition will move, which the government has indicated we will support. May I place on the record my thanks and appreciation for the way the shadow minister for agriculture, Joel Fitzgibbon, has approached this matter by cooperating and working constructively with the government.


The government will support amendments which make the operating mandate for the Regional Investment Corporation a disallowable instrument. We will also support amendments that will make the rules and eligibility criteria for farm business, water loans and financial assistance disallowable instruments. We will also support amendments which require that ministerial directions and agreements regarding water infrastructure projects be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days, after a final agreement has been received by the minister for agriculture. We will also, in a similar vein, support amendments which require that a copy of any agreement or ministerial direction, as above, must also be published on the internet within 30 days, after its receipt by the minister.


The location of the Regional Investment Corporation will be determined by a recommendation of the board, although it's of course well understood that the government's expectation is that the Regional Investment Corporation will be established in Orange. Finally, we will be supporting an amendment which requires the CEO of the Regional Investment Corporation to provide written notice to the board of any disclosure under section 20 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, which deals with the duty to disclose interests. So, again I thank all those in the chamber who have engaged with the government. I know that Senator Leyonhjelm has also had some constructive engagement with the minister for agriculture, Mr Littleproud. We are very appreciative of the way the chamber has engaged with us. With the indications that the government will support these amendments, I hope that we can secure a speedy passage of the legislation.

I thank Senator Cormann for his contribution just a moment ago, and I also thank the government for engaging with Labor on the amendments. But it is important, I think, to again reiterate that the Regional Investment Corporation is a poor piece of public policy. It was driven by politics, rather than the interests of our farmers. How else would you explain the decision to locate it in Orange, the place where the National Party lost a local seat for the first time in 69 years? The former agricultural minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce, wants to spend $28 million of taxpayers' money to administer loans already administered by the states. He has offered no acceptable rationale other than to criticise the states. At the same time we know that he is asking the states how to do the job. We know that. We've heard that in contributions last year on this bill. 


The fact that the RIC is just a shocking pork barrel is not our only concern. There are a number of governance deficiencies in this bill. The lack of transparency and accountability should be of concern to every senator. They were certainly matters of concern to the Senate's Scrutiny of Bills Committee. These deficiencies are not drafting errors; they are a deliberate attempt to keep secret the work of the RIC and to give the minister extraordinary powers to maximise the pork-barrelling opportunities. As I said last year when we were first debating this bill, Labor remains opposed to the RIC and we will remain opposed while ever the government is unable to provide a cogent reason for its establishment. But we are pleased by Minister Cormann's statements here today. We are pleased the government has finally been dragged into at least accepting some of the amendments which address some of the governance, accountability and transparency issues. 


Senators need to be reminded that most of these amendments were put to the Senate last year. They were rejected by the government at that time but lost very narrowly—in one case, on a tied vote. The main effect of the amendments is to allow the parliament to scrutinise and monitor the ministerial direction. This will reduce further political exploitation of the RIC. The RIC's mandate will be disallowable, as will set rules and criteria. The location of the RIC will now be based on a recommendation from the RIC board, rather than ministerial edict. Of course, the board will be appointed by the minister, which, sadly, softens the impact of the measure. However, we believe it has the potential to bring some proper public guidance to the process, and we will put pressure on the board to justify its choice. We know that no other regional areas were given the opportunity to bid for this agency, and the future board should take this into account. Further, agreements entered into with state governments will, at the appropriate time, be made available to the parliament. Finally, the CEO of the RIC will now be required to declare any pecuniary interest. This is surely standard and good practice. The case for the expenditure of tens of millions of dollars on a new Regional Investment Corporation has not been established, and Labor continues to reject what we believe is a political stunt, but we are pleased that, if this bill does pass, people can at least have faith in its governance arrangements and that there are a few safeguards against the political abuse of the new entity.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:10):  I'm interested to hear of the amendments and the government's agreement to them, and I want to ask one question about that. But before doing that: I don't always agree with everything Mr Joyce proposes, but I do very much appreciate and support his actions in moving some obvious government agencies out of Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and putting them into rural communities. There has been a lot of criticism of Mr Joyce in relation to the veterinary authority moving. I applaud that, and I applaud the fact that this organisation is to have its headquarters, apparently, in Orange.


I do sound a note of warning, of course, that, where government ministers are doing this, they shouldn't send them all to New South Wales. There are other states of the Commonwealth where these agencies could well be situated. With modern communications and good internet these days—which you're getting under a government that understands the NBN and is trying to make it as good as Labor promised but never had any ability to deliver—you really don't need to live in the next door office building in Canberra to be able to properly administer particular government departments and, particularly, agencies. I applaud Mr Joyce's and, indeed, the government's approach of moving some of the obvious ones; not every one could go out into the country.


I'm disappointed that Border Force hasn't been moved up into the north of Queensland or the north of Australia where some of its operations are principally organised. Some of the activities of that organisation haven't been agreed to be put there, as I've been campaigning for for some time. But I do applaud the government doing this, and I again make the point that with modern communications you don't have to sit in the next door building in Canberra to be able to properly administer the Public Service; you can spread them out into the country. In fact, I suspect that very few public servants these days speak to each other; they usually get on the internet and email each other when they want to pass on some communications. So, that bit I do applaud but with the warning that they shouldn't all be set up in New South Wales and Victoria. There are other states of the Commonwealth where, with communications, this could happen.


There is a question that I want to ask the minister. It seems to me that there are similarities between this organisation and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I am furious that Australia has let itself into this situation with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. The federal government set up a policy to develop Northern Australia; it promised it at two elections. The people of Australia supported the coalition because of its proposals to develop the north. Part of the proposal was that there would be an independent board that would deal with applications. An independent board, not a government or a politician, would deal with these applications. The board was a very good board, I think, of people with expertise in business and in the work that that organisation would do. The Commonwealth government made, as an election promise, certain commitments. The Commonwealth government provided the money, and then we find a state Labor government that has a different policy approach to things completely curtailing, completely abjuring and completely abrogating the Commonwealth government's policy, election promises and commitments.


How can that possibly be good for Australia? People elected us. They say to us, 'You promised to do this. Why aren't you doing it?' It is because—and I know they keep saying it's the Constitution—in the way we set that up, we had to pass the money through the states and we gave them some ability to veto a Commonwealth government policy and election commitment of the coalition. Here is a state government that has nothing to do with it not putting a cent into it and not contributing anything, except raw political deals with the Greens political party to stop the Adani project no matter what. It has nothing to do with the state government. The board of NAIF is not an environmental tick-off agency. In fact—and I keep repeating this—the Queensland Labor government actually ticked off the Adani project in every aspect. The Queensland Labor government approved Adani for its environmental requirements. The Commonwealth government, the department of the environment and all the bureaucrats we have there looking at the EPBC Act went through the lot of it. They ticked it off after a rigorous consultation process. In fact, on top of those two environmental agencies, all those bureaucrats and all those experts in the environment area dealing with it—in addition to that—the High Court's had a chop at it as well. There have been several Federal Court and High Court decisions in relation to environmental matters. They've all been dealt with. So it should go ahead. It should be left to the board to decide if this is the sort of business proposition that should be supported. But, no! The board are being targeted—personally, I might say—by activists and accused of being environmental vandals. It's got nothing to do with the board of NAIF. The NAIF board is a bankers board, not an environmental board. The people responsible for the environment—the Queensland government, the Commonwealth government and the courts—have all looked at it and determined it.


It just disturbs me that a sovereign government that is elected on a particular policy cannot get that policy implemented simply because a state government of a different political persuasion, in this case the Labor Party doing deals with the Greens political party, is stopping a Commonwealth initiative. That is wrong and it should not happen in the case of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.


My question to the minister is this. In this instance, I must confess I haven't closely studied the Regional Investment Corporation and the details as much as I did with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, but I want to make sure that, in agreeing to the amendments put forward by Labor, we are not again giving state governments, be they Liberal state governments in New South Wales or Labor state governments in Queensland, the ability to override Commonwealth policy and to abrogate coalition election commitments which the people of Australia supported and expect to be dealt with and to be honoured. Can I be assured that, in this case, by accepting the amendments proposed by Labor, we are not repeating that folly of giving other governments—who have nothing to do with it, are not putting in the money and are not promoting a particular policy approach—that ability to then abrogate and avoid and overturn the policies and commitments of an elected federal government?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:20):  I can reassure Senator Macdonald that none of the amendments that the government is supporting and which were moved by the opposition today have that effect. These are essentially amendments that go to the capacity of the parliament to scrutinise, and, if considered appropriate, disallow certain rules and the operating mandate, though we obviously don't expect that the Senate will, and we hope that it won't, be inclined that way. I understand the point, and essentially all of the other amendments go to transparency and to disclosure requirements. So none of it relates to the rights or the powers of a state to stop anything that the Commonwealth would want to initiate from getting ahead.


Let me make this general point. Senator Macdonald raises the NAIF, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Obviously we were very disappointed when the Queensland Labor government made the decision they did in relation to an important piece of rail infrastructure, which was designed to have opened up the Galilee Basin as the next frontier of coal production and exports, and, of course, the Adani project, being a very substantial project which, when it is built, will create many thousands of jobs, which we want to see happen. When it comes to the development of infrastructure, the Commonwealth of course has to work with relevant state and territory governments about infrastructure in their respective jurisdictions, which is why the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility was set up the way it was. We still hope that this project will proceed. We strongly support the Adani project. We strongly support the need for infrastructure to open up the Galilee Basin as a coal-producing and exporting region across Australia. We very much hope that the billions and billions of dollars of investment that are ready to be deployed can be deployed, and that the thousands and thousands of jobs can be generated. But, as far as the specific amendments in front of the chair are concerned, which the government has indicated we will support, none of them go to the rights of states to stop Commonwealth initiatives when it comes to infrastructure.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-02-06,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:22):  I appreciate the minister's assurance in that regard. I must say that, at a recent inquiry into NAIF set up by the Senate, by the Labor Party and the Greens, it was raised that there were conflicts of interest which were unresolved. Again, I understand that, under the CAC Act and other Commonwealth legislation—and, indeed, under the NAIF's own legislation—there are the natural requirements for disclosure where there are conflicts of interest and for avoiding even participating in discussions or votes where that occurs. So I just hope that these amendments don't take that disclosure obligation, or that avoidance of any involvement in anything in which a board member may have a conflict of interest, any further.


I won't pursue this further, except to say—just returning to the Adani issue—that not only were all the environmental approvals given, not only did this go to the Federal Court and the High Court any number of times and not only hasn't the NAIF board been able to do its job because of the intervention of the Queensland government—which has absolutely nothing to do with it—but also, more importantly, in this inquiry there were a number of contributors at the Darwin hearing who spoke about the importance of Indigenous involvement, in that instance in the development of Northern Australia, and how it was important to get Indigenous people involved.


I know in the Adani case the local Indigenous population, by I think a majority of about 98 per cent, supported this. Why did they support it? It is because they wanted jobs for themselves and their children. They wanted to be able to employ their children on their own lands. Yet, notwithstanding that, the Greens political party and now the Labor Party government in Queensland—and, indeed, it seems Mr Shorten and the federal Labor Party with their sop to voters in Batman—have also ignored the wishes of the local Indigenous people who wanted that project because it provides jobs for them.


Clearly you hear a lot of bleating from the Greens and the Labor Party about Indigenous employment, but when there is a real opportunity for Indigenous employment, as there is with the railway line construction in Central and North Queensland, the Labor Party, rolling over to the Greens political party again, simply ignore the wishes of Indigenous people. It seems that Mr Shorten, in his determination to fight with his Green mates in Batman and to promise the people of Batman anything that the Greens will promise, is saying, 'We don't give a stuff about Indigenous employment.' I suspect there are not a lot of Indigenous people in Batman, so that wouldn't be an issue in that particular electorate. It is in Central Queensland. It is in North Queensland. It is in northern Australia, where we are trying to get development that will assist Indigenous people into real jobs. What do we get? We get the Queensland Labor government rolling over to the Greens who keep them in power in Queensland. Now in Batman, because Mr Shorten has the fight of his life on with his former allies in the Greens political party, they will both promise anything they need to win the latte set, completely ignoring the wishes of Indigenous people who want real jobs in northern Australia.


And so, Minister, I won't delay the passage of this legislation anymore. Suffice it to say that we have your assurances that the requirements on accountability and conflicts of interest are not outrageous. They are part of the normal approach. We expect all government agencies, all public servants, all minister and all parliamentarians to disclose and, where they do have a conflict of interest, to remove themselves from any discussion that relates to the subject matter before the board.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",IND,2018-02-06,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (12:27):  This is not my first speech. I rise to speak strongly in support of the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017. This bill will establish a Regional Investment Corporation to be the single delivery agency for the Commonwealth's Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. A major part of these loans is about managing drought. Successive governments have failed in their duty to drought-proof Australia. In my own state of Queensland, every year millions of litres of fresh water are allowed to flow to the sea which could easily have been used to water hundreds of thousands of acres of parched inland areas. Simply capturing water that is currently wasted by being allowed to flow out to sea could be used to drought-proof many hundreds of sheep and cattle properties, as could lowering power costs through hydroelectric schemes and opening up central barren land and cultivating it, in the process creating thousands of jobs. The economic benefits to Australia of the nation-building Bradfield Scheme, for example, would be enjoyed by many generations to come. The Romans 2,300 years ago, for instance, were moving water to irrigate their land, but we haven't done a very good job of irrigating ours.


Since 2013 and 2014, the Commonwealth has been offering concessional loans under the government's Farm Business Concessional Loans program to farm businesses to help them through difficult times and to encourage infrastructure and economic development. To date, over $680 million in loans has been approved to 1,270 farm businesses. Until now, these concessional loans were delivered through the states. However, this not only is ineffective but also results in a lack of consistency in loan delivery, as individual state government policies reflect their own agendas. More importantly, the state governments are currently pocketing fees of between 2.5 per cent and eight per cent, which is money that would otherwise have been provided to the farm businesses. There are expensive administration costs involved in having a state-administered fund, and having to undertake separate negotiations with each state makes the operation of the fund protracted and cumbersome.


By replacing this process with the Commonwealth Regional Investment Corporation, the sticky-fingered Labor states will be removed from involvement and the Commonwealth will be able to allocate its own money to farmers in need, rather than capital city bureaucrats. In addition, the program will have broader powers compared with the bodies administered by the states, which currently handle the funds, because the Commonwealth has broader constitutional powers, including trade and commerce and external affairs.


Finally, the corporation will also administer the government's National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. The corporation's administration of the loan facility will provide further incentive for states and territories to fast-track the construction of dams and priority water infrastructure projects. This is particularly important in my state of Queensland, in which successive Labor state governments have appeared to be allergic to dam building. Billions that should have been earmarked for dam-building projects, including raising the wall of the Burdekin dam, building Hells Gates dam, building the Rookwood Weir and building the Wolffdene dam, has instead been frittered away on useless Tugun desalination plant and the South-East Queensland Water Grid water shell game—billions of dollars spent that added not one drop of additional water for irrigation and domestic use.


Thanks to the RIC bill, $2 billion worth of concessional loans have been made available for states and territories to deliver much-needed water infrastructure. Hopefully, this will entice even the Queensland government to stop constructing random tram lines on the Gold Coast and unnecessary tunnels under the Brisbane River and finally build the additional water storage Queensland needs.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-06,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:32):  The Greens are pleased to hear of the negotiations that have occurred since we last were discussing the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, as some measures are going to increase elements of transparency and accountability as to how the Regional Investment Corporation is run. But, in doing these negotiations, the government's agreement to these amendments—we're told they're about to agree to these amendments, which are essentially the same amendments that they rejected last year—just highlights the political nature of the whole Regional Investment Corporation.


The Regional Investment Corporation was a political invention. It was created to shore up government support in an area of Australia where their stocks were low. It was created to be able to direct money to particular areas where it was going to have the most political gain—and, fundamentally, the Regional Investment Corporation is still going to be able to do that. The government is going to agree to these measures that are improving accountability—and don't get me wrong; I welcome that—but it's clear that the reason that they are agreeing to them today is that they want a political win. They want to be able to say, 'Tick; we've achieved the Regional Investment Corporation.' I'm not sure what else is going on or not going on, but obviously it's important for them to be able to do that today rather than next week. It just underlines the political nature of this whole corporation that's being set up. These amendments are welcome; the Greens will be supporting them, but they do not address the fundamental nature of the RIC, which could end up being a political slush fund, without the full level of transparency and accountability needed for determining where our precious financial resources are being directed.


Senator Macdonald was ranting and raving about the NAIF and the Adani coalmine. In fact, in one way, linking the two of them is accurate because they are both institutions that have been set up in order to deliver on particular political initiatives without the full range of transparency and accountability, without looking at whether the investments that the money is being put towards are actually in the long-term interests of the country. It's very clear when you're talking about the NAIF and its, hopefully, now completely knocked over prospect of providing finance for a rail line to serve the Adani coalmine, that this investment—the whole Adani coalmine and the rail line—was not in the public interest, not in the long-term interest. It would be climate-destroying to dig up so much coal. It would add to climate change. It would add to dangerous global warming just at the time when the rest of the world is shifting away from fossil fuels and rapidly shifting to renewable energy—'Here's Australia, continuing on with the old, dirty, last-century polluting industries.' But the NAIF was going to be able to do that. Similarly, I expect that we will see potential investments from the Regional Investment Corporation made not in the long-term interests of Australia. Even with the amendments that are going to be passed today, there won't be the accountability, there won't be the transparency and there won't be the assessment needed to know if these investments are really the right thing for the long-term future of Australia.


I'm going to finish by putting on the record that we're certainly going to support the amendments that have been negotiated, and we welcome the fact that that's happened. But we remain opposed to this bill and the Regional Investment Corporation overall as being not in the interests of the long-term, sustainable development of Australia.

We believe that they're broadly in line with what applies in other parts of government. They certainly don't go beyond what we feel is appropriate in the circumstances. I can also confirm previous advice that the government intends to include a reference within the rules presenting the terms and conditions for any agreement with the states and territories for the construction of water infrastructure—that the states cannot privatise or sell off water infrastructure that has been built using Commonwealth funding through the Regional Investment Corporation. These rules will be disallowable instruments as a result of the amendments that have been moved by the opposition.

May I place on the record my thanks and appreciation for the way the shadow minister for agriculture, Joel Fitzgibbon, has approached this matter by cooperating and working constructively with the government.


The government will support amendments which make the operating mandate for the Regional Investment Corporation a disallowable instrument.

We will also support amendments which require that ministerial directions and agreements regarding water infrastructure projects be tabled in each house of parliament within 15 days, after a final agreement has been received by the minister for agriculture. We will also, in a similar vein, support amendments which require that a copy of any agreement or ministerial direction, as above, must also be published on the internet within 30 days, after its receipt by the minister.


The location of the Regional Investment Corporation will be determined by a recommendation of the board, although it's of course well understood that the government's expectation is that the Regional Investment Corporation will be established in Orange. Finally, we will be supporting an amendment which requires the CEO of the Regional Investment Corporation to provide written notice to the board of any disclosure under section 20 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, which deals with the duty to disclose interests. So, again I thank all those in the chamber who have engaged with the government. I know that Senator Leyonhjelm has also had some constructive engagement with the minister for agriculture, Mr Littleproud. We are very appreciative of the way the chamber has engaged with us. With the indications that the government will support these amendments, I hope that we can secure a speedy passage of the legislation.

I thank Senator Cormann for his contribution just a moment ago, and I also thank the government for engaging with Labor on the amendments. But it is important, I think, to again reiterate that the Regional Investment Corporation is a poor piece of public policy. It was driven by politics, rather than the interests of our farmers. How else would you explain the decision to locate it in Orange, the place where the National Party lost a local seat for the first time in 69 years? The former agricultural minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce, wants to spend $28 million of taxpayers' money to administer loans already administered by the states. He has offered no acceptable rationale other than to criticise the states. At the same time we know that he is asking the states how to do the job. We know that. We've heard that in contributions last year on this bill. 


The fact that the RIC is just a shocking pork barrel is not our only concern. There are a number of governance deficiencies in this bill. The lack of transparency and accountability should be of concern to every senator. They were certainly matters of concern to the Senate's Scrutiny of Bills Committee. These deficiencies are not drafting errors; they are a deliberate attempt to keep secret the work of the RIC and to give the minister extraordinary powers to maximise the pork-barrelling opportunities. As I said last year when we were first debating this bill, Labor remains opposed to the RIC and we will remain opposed while ever the government is unable to provide a cogent reason for its establishment. But we are pleased by Minister Cormann's statements here today. We are pleased the government has finally been dragged into at least accepting some of the amendments which address some of the governance, accountability and transparency issues. 


Senators need to be reminded that most of these amendments were put to the Senate last year. They were rejected by the government at that time but lost very narrowly—in one case, on a tied vote. The main effect of the amendments is to allow the parliament to scrutinise and monitor the ministerial direction. This will reduce further political exploitation of the RIC. The RIC's mandate will be disallowable, as will set rules and criteria. The location of the RIC will now be based on a recommendation from the RIC board, rather than ministerial edict. Of course, the board will be appointed by the minister, which, sadly, softens the impact of the measure. However, we believe it has the potential to bring some proper public guidance to the process, and we will put pressure on the board to justify its choice. We know that no other regional areas were given the opportunity to bid for this agency, and the future board should take this into account. Further, agreements entered into with state governments will, at the appropriate time, be made available to the parliament. Finally, the CEO of the RIC will now be required to declare any pecuniary interest. This is surely standard and good practice. The case for the expenditure of tens of millions of dollars on a new Regional Investment Corporation has not been established, and Labor continues to reject what we believe is a political stunt, but we are pleased that, if this bill does pass, people can at least have faith in its governance arrangements and that there are a few safeguards against the political abuse of the new entity.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-02-06,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:10):  I'm interested to hear of the amendments and the government's agreement to them, and I want to ask one question about that. But before doing that: I don't always agree with everything Mr Joyce proposes, but I do very much appreciate and support his actions in moving some obvious government agencies out of Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and putting them into rural communities. There has been a lot of criticism of Mr Joyce in relation to the veterinary authority moving. I applaud that, and I applaud the fact that this organisation is to have its headquarters, apparently, in Orange.


I do sound a note of warning, of course, that, where government ministers are doing this, they shouldn't send them all to New South Wales. There are other states of the Commonwealth where these agencies could well be situated. With modern communications and good internet these days—which you're getting under a government that understands the NBN and is trying to make it as good as Labor promised but never had any ability to deliver—you really don't need to live in the next door office building in Canberra to be able to properly administer particular government departments and, particularly, agencies. I applaud Mr Joyce's and, indeed, the government's approach of moving some of the obvious ones; not every one could go out into the country.


I'm disappointed that Border Force hasn't been moved up into the north of Queensland or the north of Australia where some of its operations are principally organised. Some of the activities of that organisation haven't been agreed to be put there, as I've been campaigning for for some time. But I do applaud the government doing this, and I again make the point that with modern communications you don't have to sit in the next door building in Canberra to be able to properly administer the Public Service; you can spread them out into the country. In fact, I suspect that very few public servants these days speak to each other; they usually get on the internet and email each other when they want to pass on some communications. So, that bit I do applaud but with the warning that they shouldn't all be set up in New South Wales and Victoria. There are other states of the Commonwealth where, with communications, this could happen.


There is a question that I want to ask the minister. It seems to me that there are similarities between this organisation and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. I am furious that Australia has let itself into this situation with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. The federal government set up a policy to develop Northern Australia; it promised it at two elections. The people of Australia supported the coalition because of its proposals to develop the north. Part of the proposal was that there would be an independent board that would deal with applications. An independent board, not a government or a politician, would deal with these applications. The board was a very good board, I think, of people with expertise in business and in the work that that organisation would do. The Commonwealth government made, as an election promise, certain commitments. The Commonwealth government provided the money, and then we find a state Labor government that has a different policy approach to things completely curtailing, completely abjuring and completely abrogating the Commonwealth government's policy, election promises and commitments.


How can that possibly be good for Australia? People elected us. They say to us, 'You promised to do this. Why aren't you doing it?' It is because—and I know they keep saying it's the Constitution—in the way we set that up, we had to pass the money through the states and we gave them some ability to veto a Commonwealth government policy and election commitment of the coalition. Here is a state government that has nothing to do with it not putting a cent into it and not contributing anything, except raw political deals with the Greens political party to stop the Adani project no matter what. It has nothing to do with the state government. The board of NAIF is not an environmental tick-off agency. In fact—and I keep repeating this—the Queensland Labor government actually ticked off the Adani project in every aspect. The Queensland Labor government approved Adani for its environmental requirements. The Commonwealth government, the department of the environment and all the bureaucrats we have there looking at the EPBC Act went through the lot of it. They ticked it off after a rigorous consultation process. In fact, on top of those two environmental agencies, all those bureaucrats and all those experts in the environment area dealing with it—in addition to that—the High Court's had a chop at it as well. There have been several Federal Court and High Court decisions in relation to environmental matters. They've all been dealt with. So it should go ahead. It should be left to the board to decide if this is the sort of business proposition that should be supported. But, no! The board are being targeted—personally, I might say—by activists and accused of being environmental vandals. It's got nothing to do with the board of NAIF. The NAIF board is a bankers board, not an environmental board. The people responsible for the environment—the Queensland government, the Commonwealth government and the courts—have all looked at it and determined it.


It just disturbs me that a sovereign government that is elected on a particular policy cannot get that policy implemented simply because a state government of a different political persuasion, in this case the Labor Party doing deals with the Greens political party, is stopping a Commonwealth initiative. That is wrong and it should not happen in the case of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility.


My question to the minister is this. In this instance, I must confess I haven't closely studied the Regional Investment Corporation and the details as much as I did with the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, but I want to make sure that, in agreeing to the amendments put forward by Labor, we are not again giving state governments, be they Liberal state governments in New South Wales or Labor state governments in Queensland, the ability to override Commonwealth policy and to abrogate coalition election commitments which the people of Australia supported and expect to be dealt with and to be honoured. Can I be assured that, in this case, by accepting the amendments proposed by Labor, we are not repeating that folly of giving other governments—who have nothing to do with it, are not putting in the money and are not promoting a particular policy approach—that ability to then abrogate and avoid and overturn the policies and commitments of an elected federal government?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-02-06,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:20):  I can reassure Senator Macdonald that none of the amendments that the government is supporting and which were moved by the opposition today have that effect. These are essentially amendments that go to the capacity of the parliament to scrutinise, and, if considered appropriate, disallow certain rules and the operating mandate, though we obviously don't expect that the Senate will, and we hope that it won't, be inclined that way. I understand the point, and essentially all of the other amendments go to transparency and to disclosure requirements. So none of it relates to the rights or the powers of a state to stop anything that the Commonwealth would want to initiate from getting ahead.


Let me make this general point. Senator Macdonald raises the NAIF, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. Obviously we were very disappointed when the Queensland Labor government made the decision they did in relation to an important piece of rail infrastructure, which was designed to have opened up the Galilee Basin as the next frontier of coal production and exports, and, of course, the Adani project, being a very substantial project which, when it is built, will create many thousands of jobs, which we want to see happen. When it comes to the development of infrastructure, the Commonwealth of course has to work with relevant state and territory governments about infrastructure in their respective jurisdictions, which is why the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility was set up the way it was. We still hope that this project will proceed. We strongly support the Adani project. We strongly support the need for infrastructure to open up the Galilee Basin as a coal-producing and exporting region across Australia. We very much hope that the billions and billions of dollars of investment that are ready to be deployed can be deployed, and that the thousands and thousands of jobs can be generated. But, as far as the specific amendments in front of the chair are concerned, which the government has indicated we will support, none of them go to the rights of states to stop Commonwealth initiatives when it comes to infrastructure.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-02-06,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:22):  I appreciate the minister's assurance in that regard. I must say that, at a recent inquiry into NAIF set up by the Senate, by the Labor Party and the Greens, it was raised that there were conflicts of interest which were unresolved. Again, I understand that, under the CAC Act and other Commonwealth legislation—and, indeed, under the NAIF's own legislation—there are the natural requirements for disclosure where there are conflicts of interest and for avoiding even participating in discussions or votes where that occurs. So I just hope that these amendments don't take that disclosure obligation, or that avoidance of any involvement in anything in which a board member may have a conflict of interest, any further.


I won't pursue this further, except to say—just returning to the Adani issue—that not only were all the environmental approvals given, not only did this go to the Federal Court and the High Court any number of times and not only hasn't the NAIF board been able to do its job because of the intervention of the Queensland government—which has absolutely nothing to do with it—but also, more importantly, in this inquiry there were a number of contributors at the Darwin hearing who spoke about the importance of Indigenous involvement, in that instance in the development of Northern Australia, and how it was important to get Indigenous people involved.


I know in the Adani case the local Indigenous population, by I think a majority of about 98 per cent, supported this. Why did they support it? It is because they wanted jobs for themselves and their children. They wanted to be able to employ their children on their own lands. Yet, notwithstanding that, the Greens political party and now the Labor Party government in Queensland—and, indeed, it seems Mr Shorten and the federal Labor Party with their sop to voters in Batman—have also ignored the wishes of the local Indigenous people who wanted that project because it provides jobs for them.


Clearly you hear a lot of bleating from the Greens and the Labor Party about Indigenous employment, but when there is a real opportunity for Indigenous employment, as there is with the railway line construction in Central and North Queensland, the Labor Party, rolling over to the Greens political party again, simply ignore the wishes of Indigenous people. It seems that Mr Shorten, in his determination to fight with his Green mates in Batman and to promise the people of Batman anything that the Greens will promise, is saying, 'We don't give a stuff about Indigenous employment.' I suspect there are not a lot of Indigenous people in Batman, so that wouldn't be an issue in that particular electorate. It is in Central Queensland. It is in North Queensland. It is in northern Australia, where we are trying to get development that will assist Indigenous people into real jobs. What do we get? We get the Queensland Labor government rolling over to the Greens who keep them in power in Queensland. Now in Batman, because Mr Shorten has the fight of his life on with his former allies in the Greens political party, they will both promise anything they need to win the latte set, completely ignoring the wishes of Indigenous people who want real jobs in northern Australia.


And so, Minister, I won't delay the passage of this legislation anymore. Suffice it to say that we have your assurances that the requirements on accountability and conflicts of interest are not outrageous. They are part of the normal approach. We expect all government agencies, all public servants, all minister and all parliamentarians to disclose and, where they do have a conflict of interest, to remove themselves from any discussion that relates to the subject matter before the board.

"Anning, Sen Fraser",IND,2018-02-06,"



Senator ANNING
 (Queensland) (12:27):  This is not my first speech. I rise to speak strongly in support of the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017. This bill will establish a Regional Investment Corporation to be the single delivery agency for the Commonwealth's Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. A major part of these loans is about managing drought. Successive governments have failed in their duty to drought-proof Australia. In my own state of Queensland, every year millions of litres of fresh water are allowed to flow to the sea which could easily have been used to water hundreds of thousands of acres of parched inland areas. Simply capturing water that is currently wasted by being allowed to flow out to sea could be used to drought-proof many hundreds of sheep and cattle properties, as could lowering power costs through hydroelectric schemes and opening up central barren land and cultivating it, in the process creating thousands of jobs. The economic benefits to Australia of the nation-building Bradfield Scheme, for example, would be enjoyed by many generations to come. The Romans 2,300 years ago, for instance, were moving water to irrigate their land, but we haven't done a very good job of irrigating ours.


Since 2013 and 2014, the Commonwealth has been offering concessional loans under the government's Farm Business Concessional Loans program to farm businesses to help them through difficult times and to encourage infrastructure and economic development. To date, over $680 million in loans has been approved to 1,270 farm businesses. Until now, these concessional loans were delivered through the states. However, this not only is ineffective but also results in a lack of consistency in loan delivery, as individual state government policies reflect their own agendas. More importantly, the state governments are currently pocketing fees of between 2.5 per cent and eight per cent, which is money that would otherwise have been provided to the farm businesses. There are expensive administration costs involved in having a state-administered fund, and having to undertake separate negotiations with each state makes the operation of the fund protracted and cumbersome.


By replacing this process with the Commonwealth Regional Investment Corporation, the sticky-fingered Labor states will be removed from involvement and the Commonwealth will be able to allocate its own money to farmers in need, rather than capital city bureaucrats. In addition, the program will have broader powers compared with the bodies administered by the states, which currently handle the funds, because the Commonwealth has broader constitutional powers, including trade and commerce and external affairs.


Finally, the corporation will also administer the government's National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. The corporation's administration of the loan facility will provide further incentive for states and territories to fast-track the construction of dams and priority water infrastructure projects. This is particularly important in my state of Queensland, in which successive Labor state governments have appeared to be allergic to dam building. Billions that should have been earmarked for dam-building projects, including raising the wall of the Burdekin dam, building Hells Gates dam, building the Rookwood Weir and building the Wolffdene dam, has instead been frittered away on useless Tugun desalination plant and the South-East Queensland Water Grid water shell game—billions of dollars spent that added not one drop of additional water for irrigation and domestic use.


Thanks to the RIC bill, $2 billion worth of concessional loans have been made available for states and territories to deliver much-needed water infrastructure. Hopefully, this will entice even the Queensland government to stop constructing random tram lines on the Gold Coast and unnecessary tunnels under the Brisbane River and finally build the additional water storage Queensland needs.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-06,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:32):  The Greens are pleased to hear of the negotiations that have occurred since we last were discussing the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, as some measures are going to increase elements of transparency and accountability as to how the Regional Investment Corporation is run. But, in doing these negotiations, the government's agreement to these amendments—we're told they're about to agree to these amendments, which are essentially the same amendments that they rejected last year—just highlights the political nature of the whole Regional Investment Corporation.


The Regional Investment Corporation was a political invention. It was created to shore up government support in an area of Australia where their stocks were low. It was created to be able to direct money to particular areas where it was going to have the most political gain—and, fundamentally, the Regional Investment Corporation is still going to be able to do that. The government is going to agree to these measures that are improving accountability—and don't get me wrong; I welcome that—but it's clear that the reason that they are agreeing to them today is that they want a political win. They want to be able to say, 'Tick; we've achieved the Regional Investment Corporation.' I'm not sure what else is going on or not going on, but obviously it's important for them to be able to do that today rather than next week. It just underlines the political nature of this whole corporation that's being set up. These amendments are welcome; the Greens will be supporting them, but they do not address the fundamental nature of the RIC, which could end up being a political slush fund, without the full level of transparency and accountability needed for determining where our precious financial resources are being directed.


Senator Macdonald was ranting and raving about the NAIF and the Adani coalmine. In fact, in one way, linking the two of them is accurate because they are both institutions that have been set up in order to deliver on particular political initiatives without the full range of transparency and accountability, without looking at whether the investments that the money is being put towards are actually in the long-term interests of the country. It's very clear when you're talking about the NAIF and its, hopefully, now completely knocked over prospect of providing finance for a rail line to serve the Adani coalmine, that this investment—the whole Adani coalmine and the rail line—was not in the public interest, not in the long-term interest. It would be climate-destroying to dig up so much coal. It would add to climate change. It would add to dangerous global warming just at the time when the rest of the world is shifting away from fossil fuels and rapidly shifting to renewable energy—'Here's Australia, continuing on with the old, dirty, last-century polluting industries.' But the NAIF was going to be able to do that. Similarly, I expect that we will see potential investments from the Regional Investment Corporation made not in the long-term interests of Australia. Even with the amendments that are going to be passed today, there won't be the accountability, there won't be the transparency and there won't be the assessment needed to know if these investments are really the right thing for the long-term future of Australia.


I'm going to finish by putting on the record that we're certainly going to support the amendments that have been negotiated, and we welcome the fact that that's happened. But we remain opposed to this bill and the Regional Investment Corporation overall as being not in the interests of the long-term, sustainable development of Australia.

We believe that they're broadly in line with what applies in other parts of government. They certainly don't go beyond what we feel is appropriate in the circumstances. I can also confirm previous advice that the government intends to include a reference within the rules presenting the terms and conditions for any agreement with the states and territories for the construction of water infrastructure—that the states cannot privatise or sell off water infrastructure that has been built using Commonwealth funding through the Regional Investment Corporation. These rules will be disallowable instruments as a result of the amendments that have been moved by the opposition.

Senator Wong:
  The opposition will do the courtesy of granting leave, but it is customary for the minister who was asked the question to answer the question, not to palm it off to someone else.




Senator Birmingham:
  I seek indulgence on the point that Senator Wong has made. I think if Senator Wong reflects on the question she will find that much of the question related to the agriculture portfolio, which I do not handle in the chamber. Indeed, if Senator Wong would prefer, we can wait and I'll come back at another time and provide the information that Senator Ruston is offering to provide to the chamber at this point in time. If Senator Wong wants to be hung up on that process, that is fine. Senator Ruston, who directly handles these matters in a ministerial sense in a number of ways, has brought information as additional information to the chamber.

  On the point of order, I'm not being hung up; it's about ministerial accountability. She is not the minister who represents the member of the executive who was asked the question in this chamber.

We will ask the ministers representing the relevant portfolio and we would expect any additions to answers to be given by that minister.


Leave granted




Senator RUSTON:
  In response to questions asked yesterday by Senator Hanson in relation to the use of foreign fishing vessels in Australian waters, I would like to provide the following additional information to that provided by Senator Birmingham.


I have been advised, after discussions with the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, that from time to time it responds to requests for information regarding bringing in boats from overseas to fish in the Australian Fishing Zone. However, I can confirm to the chamber that neither the Australian government nor the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is engaged in any discussions with the Chinese government or any other government in relation to either the acquisition of foreign fishing licences or the deeming of vessels as Australian fishing vessels so as to operate in the Australian Fishing Zone.


I have further been advised by AFMA that no approvals are in place for any foreign vessels fishing to operate in Commonwealth waters under deeming provisions. If there has been any deceit, it has been the very dishonest campaign prosecuted in recent weeks by environmental campaigners, such as Save Our Marine Life, to deliberately mislead the Australian people with regard to foreign fishing fleets and the proposed network of Australian marine parks. Without any evidence, and contrary to the facts, it has been claimed that Australian waters, including those proposed for marine parks, are about to be flooded with cheap, distant water fishing fleets. I, absolutely and outrightly, reject these ridiculous claims and call them out for what they are: unsubstantiated scaremongering. 


The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge Australia's global reputation as a world leader in fisheries management, especially in terms of ecological and environmental perspectives, which has resulted in no fishery solely managed by the Commonwealth being overfished for the fourth consecutive year this year. The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that Australia's fisheries management regime ensures that the total allowable catches for all fish stocks are set at ecologically sustainable levels. The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that any vessel operating in Australian waters must follow Commonwealth fisheries rules and regulations. There are absolutely no exemptions to this requirement whatsoever. 


The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that any fishing vessel, either foreign or Australian, cannot fish in declared no-take marine-protected areas or green zones. The campaign deliberately fails to reference the extremely strict requirements the Australian government imposes on such vessels, should they ever be approved to fish in Australian waters, which are outlined in the Australian Fisheries Management Act 1991. 


The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that the new marine parks will strengthen conservation outcomes, support sustainable fishing, attract more tourism,  provide cultural, recreational and economic benefits for coastal communities and deliver investment certainty for the fishing businesses. The coalition government's management of marine parks will restore a balanced approach and allow a variety of uses for our shared marine resources. The coalition will safeguard not only our marine ecosystems but also the interests of current and future generations of Australian people, by striking the right balance between economic, social and environmental objectives, consistent with the aspirations of the entire Australian community. Under this coalition government, Australians can be confident that we will have both world-class, best-practice marine park networks and the world's best fisheries management.

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Communications (Senator McKenzie) and the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senators Brown and Cameron today relating to GST distribution and to Senator Molan.


What a performance today. What a performance from Senator Cormann trying to defend what is the worst start ever for any senator in this place—the start that Senator Molan has had. Senator Molan continues to refuse to apologise for propagating racist, bigoted posts from a white supremacist organisation. This is the same organisation whose sympathiser—a British Britain First sympathiser—killed British MP Jo Cox. That's the type of propaganda that Senator Molan is putting on his Facebook posts. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.


And I see now it's being reported online that Senator Molan has been retweeting parts of the Voice of Europe, which is seen as a Russian propaganda site. Senator Molan is retweeting them! And what's it about? It's about immigration and it's about Muslims. This senator really needs to get his act together. He is not a general in the Australian Army; he is a backbench senator. He has responsibilities to this place and he has responsibilities to the Australian community to act in the best interests of Australia. He has not been doing that and his behaviour is absolutely reprehensible. He has been retweeting the Voice of Europe. He retweeted:


Shocking: Belgian fairground owner has to hide bikini images because they could offend Muslims


This is a former general in the Australian Army deeming to retweet this nonsense, creating division in this country. He retweeted:


Poland Right in Refusal to Accept Muslim Migrants Amid Latest Attacks – Official


This is a senator who just seems to be obsessed with the Muslim community in this country.


I have to say that there is another former general who is active in public life in this country, and that's former General Duncan Lewis, who is the ASIO chief. Former General Duncan Lewis actually said in budget estimates in October 2017:


Stereotyping any group as a source of threat is not helpful. It is behaviour, not background, which ASIO is investigating.


There is a real general. There is a general of the Australian Army that understand the issues and understands the importance of making sure that there is a cohesive society. He goes on to say:


There are more than half a million Australian Muslims. Of these—and I've said this in this committee before—less than 0.1 of 1 per cent, so one-tenth of 1 per cent, are the subject of security interest. If you flip that, more than 99.9 per cent of Australian Muslims are of no security interest to my organisation.


Yet here we have Senator Molan, who has been described online as the Steven Bradbury of the Senate. This Steven Bradbury has got here after all these other people falling down, roundabout. No wonder he was so far down the list in the Liberal Party of New South Wales preferred candidates! Yet he is here, propagating this nonsense, propagating division in this society and propagating views that are unacceptable in this place.


This man should not be defended. He should be apologising to the Australian Senate. He should be apologising to the Australian public. And if he won't do it then the Prime Minister should make him do it. And if the Prime Minister doesn't have the guts to do that then he is not deserving to be Prime Minister of this country. What we should be about is multiculturalism. (Time expired)

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:14):  If the people of Australia needed yet another reason to confirm why they are smashing Mr Shorten in the opinion polls—




Senator Cameron:
  What ones are you looking at? That is really misleading the Senate.




Senator ABETZ:
  it is the sort of commentary that we have just seen from one of his key frontbenchers, Senator Cameron, besmirching the character of a career soldier that has done this nation proud with 40 years of service, of putting his life on the line for the security of not only our nation but the world. Painful as it was, I listened to Senator Cameron in silence. Can he repeat that courtesy? No, because he is a thug in the way that he conducts himself.




Senator Cormann:
  On the point of order: the level of interjection by Senator Cameron is completely out of order and highly disrespectful. We listened to his remarks in silence, despite them being quite provocative, and I think the chamber deserves to be able to listen to Senator Abetz's contribution in silence as well.




Senator Cameron:


On the point of order: I have to indicate that what Senator Abetz has been doing is misleading the parliament. The proposition that he has put forward is that the general was in danger; it was working-class Australians that got killed, not generals.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister, you will be aware that I was, despite having a loud voice, seeking to call the Senate to order, which I eventually did at the same time as you stood up, Senator Cameron. Senator Abetz does have the right to be heard in silence, and I would ask all senators to observe that, please. 




Senator Cameron:
  Tell the truth.




Senator ABETZ:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. You have just asked the honourable senator to sit in silence and, before I even commenced, he interjected yet again, which highlights the standard that Mr Shorten has in his frontbench, a man that is willing to denigrate a great servant of the Australian people who now happens to find himself in this Senate, namely one Jim Molan. He has put life and limb on the line in the service of this nation, something that Senator Cameron will never understand. Senator Cameron's career in this place has been to defend the worst and attack the best. And let's have a look at the way—




Senator Cameron:
  My old man fought for Britain, not the Nazis.




Senator ABETZ:
  Oh, Mathias, don't bother. This is indicative of the low standard—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister, on a point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  That was a most disgraceful interjection by Senator Cameron, an outrageously inappropriate reflection on a senator in this chamber, and Senator Cameron should be required to withdraw.




Senator Cameron:
  On the point of order: I did not reflect on Senator Abetz. I made no mention of Senator Abetz.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There was no mention of any senator in that response, but I again would ask senators to respect the debate and to remain silent. 




Senator Cormann:
  On this occasion—and I do this extremely rarely—this was such a seriously inappropriate interjection by Senator Cameron, I would ask that the Hansard be reviewed and for the President to review the Hansard and to consider your ruling.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Minister. That will occur. I would again re-state the need to hear this debate in silence and to be respectful of other senators' contributions.




Senator ABETZ:
  Madam Deputy President, for the third time, the Australian people have seen the inappropriateness of Senator Cameron's commentary, yet he holds a very senior position in the shadow cabinet led by Mr Shorten. Those with whom one surrounds oneself are an indication of one's character and of one's standards. And so Mr Shorten's standards are to have somebody like Senator Cameron on his frontbench—a man willing to defend the worst and attack the best. He defends the worst, people like Luke Collier, for whom and on whose behalf he asked over 60 questions at Senate estimates—a man convicted, if I recall correctly, for having broken the law on multiple occasions and for having engaged in violence against his female partner. But 60-plus questions were run in defence of a person like that. Why? Because he was a CFMEU official. Yet somebody like Senator Molan, who has put life and limb on the line in service of this nation, is to be denigrated and dragged through the mud by Senator Cameron. 


That's the sort of standard the Australian Labor Party now brings to these debates. The Australian people ought be warned, the Australian people ought realise that, with the election of a Labor government—if that were to occur—men and women like Senator Doug Cameron would hold frontbench positions and direct our nation. That is, quite frankly, a horrifying prospect. The Australian people deserve so, so much better. 


These attacks that have been made on Senator Molan by Senator Cameron indicate that he is willing to attack a decorated soldier but defend a criminal such as Luke Collier. Let's not forget how he ensured the preselection of a gentleman that is now in jail in New South Wales for corruption, one Ian Macdonald—not to be confused with my bench buddy Senator Ian Macdonald here. Let's be clear: they are the sort of people that Senator Cameron goes in to defend. Then he somehow claims that he comes into this chamber with clean hands and denigrates a good man like Senator Jim Molan, a man that I am pleased to call a friend and, as of recent times, a colleague, a man that has done so much more for this nation than you or I, Senator Cameron, ever will. Just remember that. His service overseas, be it in Indonesia, East Timor or Iraq, has been exemplary. That is why he has the 'AO' and that is why he has his military decoration. (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:22):  In taking note today, I wish to talk about the response by Senator McKenzie to my question around the GST and the impact on South Australia and Tasmania. Unfortunately and quite disappointingly, the minister was not able to answer the question that I put to her. The question about GST and the distribution of GST is an extremely serious one. The people from my home state of Tasmania are keen to get an answer out of this government on this question, and they are keen to get an answer prior to the Tasmanian state election on 3 March. 


My question went directly to the impact of any changes of the distribution of the GST on Tasmania. The Productivity Commission in its interim report talks about some massive cuts to Tasmania, and $168 million in proposed cuts to Tasmania have been recorded and reported. They are cuts that Tasmania can ill afford. We already have, under the watch of the state Liberal government, a health system in crisis. Our system needs more beds, more nurses, more doctors, more ambulances. We cannot afford any cuts, any changes to the GST that will see less GST revenue coming to Tasmania.  


This government is delaying the final report of the Productivity Commission. It will now be handed down in May, after the Tasmanian election and the election in South Australia. Why is that? Tasmanians deserve to know. They are worried that their GST revenue will be ripped out of Tasmania. They have a right to be worried. 


I think it was yesterday that we had a member of the federal government, Queensland MP Warren Entsch, say, 'Why should WA GST payers be subsidising other states, particularly states like Tasmania?' Mr Entsch obviously has no understanding of how the GST distribution formula works. He has no understanding of the reason that system was put in place. So these discussions need to be happening. The Tasmanian Liberal senators need to be asking these questions of their government—about what is going to be happening to the GST revenue for Tasmania. This is revenue that is critical to delivering the services that Tasmanians need.


Mr Entsch, with his quote, really let the cat out of the bag, because it is an imminent threat to Tasmania's GST share. We want to know what discussions the government has had. We want to know up-front so that Tasmanian voters can make a decision, an informed decision, with their vote on 3 March, because this government cannot be trusted. It certainly can't be trusted when it comes to health. We've already had $1.1 billion in health cuts from Canberra. We've already had the state Liberal government cut $210 million from Tasmania's health system in their first budget. We need, in Tasmania, more beds, more nurses, more doctors, more ambulances. The system that the state Liberal government have created and presided over is in crisis. We need the federal government to be up-front with Tasmanians. This is a very serious issue. (Time expired)

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Science, Jobs and Innovation) (15:27):  What we heard there from Senator Brown was, of course, the fake scare campaign that Labor are now trying to create because they don't want to talk about the issues in places like Tasmania. In Tasmania, what's happened under the Tasmanian Liberal government? They inherited a basket case from Labor and the Greens. The highest unemployment in the country, over eight per cent, has dramatically dropped under the leadership of Will Hodgman. They inherited a massive deficit and they've turned it into a surplus. They inherited some of the worst figures in health and have, in their time, seen massive improvements. Labor don't want to talk about that because that would be dealing with the facts, so what they're going to do is create a scare campaign ahead of a state election. It's never Jay Weatherill's fault that South Australia is a basket case, but they can never give credit to Will Hodgman, who's turned around the disaster that he inherited from Labor and the Greens.


This goes to the dishonesty of Bill Shorten and the Labor Party. We've seen the character of Bill Shorten and his team on display here today in the chamber, and I will get to that in a minute. Bill Shorten goes to Western Australia—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Seselja.




Senator SESELJA:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. Mr Shorten goes to Western Australia and says, 'We'll do you a better deal.' Then he goes to Tasmania and says: 'We'll do you a better deal. We'll take it from the others.' He can't be believed on anything. It's just like what he's facing now with these by-elections coming up. Mr Shorten's desperate not to see by-elections on the same day in Batman and in Queensland, because he wants to go to the inner city of Melbourne and say: 'Look, we're against Adani, and we're not really going to turn back the boats. We're going to be soft on the borders.' And he wants to go to regional Queensland and say, 'Of course we're tough on borders, and we support jobs in regional Queensland.' The guy is a chameleon. He is a phoney, an absolute phoney, and it goes to his character—one message for one state, one part of Australia, and a completely different message for another part of Australia.


When it comes to character, we saw the character of Labor and the Greens on display today in the Senate, in their reprehensible attack on Senator Jim Molan, a fine Australian, someone who has served this nation for decades and has made a much greater contribution than any of the people who launched grubby attacks on him today in the chamber, such as Senator Di Natale and Senator Cameron.


I'm very happy to compare the character of Senator Cameron with that of Senator Molan, because Senator Molan will win hands-down. Other speakers have pointed out the kinds of people that Senator Cameron has supported in the past. He has backed people like Luke Collier, like Ian Macdonald, who got jailed for 10 years because of corruption. These are kinds of people Senator Cameron has supported in his political career. These are the kinds of people he was close to, and yet he has the hide to come into this place and launch a despicable and disgusting attack on a great Australian who has done so much more for this nation than Senator Cameron could have ever dreamed of. Senator Cameron joined with his Greens parliamentary colleagues in launching this disgraceful attack. 


Senator Molan comes here after finishing 40 years of service to this nation. I will just comment, for military personnel serving in Australia, on the way that Senator Cameron, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, described the 40 years of service of Senator Molan with such disdain, saying that he never really sacrificed anything. What would you know, Senator Cameron, about his military service? What have you ever done for this country? When Senator Molan, in his former capacity, was helping to stop 1,200 people drowning at sea, people like Senator Cameron and Senator Di Natale were maintaining support for a policy which would have seen those people drown. Who are the better characters? Not Senator Di Natale and the Greens. Not Senator Cameron. 


This was a low point today. It was a low point from the Greens. We thought we had reached absolute rock bottom, and Senator Cameron came back into this place after question time and continued that disgraceful attack. He continued the disgraceful attack on a fine man, Senator Molan. He continued the disgraceful attack with the way he described his military service. I say to you, Senator Cameron, and I say it to Senator Di Natale: I would put Senator Molan up against you guys any day of the week. You should be ashamed of yourselves for this gutless attack.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:32):  I too rise to make a contribution in this debate taking note of answers from Senator McKenzie and Senator Cormann. At the outset, I'd just like to say that, as a relatively infrequent visitor to Western Australia, I have been struck on at least two separate occasions, while listening to talkback radio, by the absolute virulence of the campaign to have GST and horizontal fiscal equalisation addressed in the west. There were talkback radio announcers exhorting listeners to march on the federal offices of their political representatives, Senator Cormann and Senator Smith. There were people ringing up and saying, 'Tell me which day and I'll be there to do it.' The issue of GST and horizontal fiscal equalisation in Western Australia is a huge electoral issue. 


All governments, and the opposition, are attempting to work their way through this. We've seen infrastructure payments given to Western Australia to offset this horizontal fiscal equalisation problem, which has been delivered, in my view, by the largesse that was dispensed in their boom years. When you come back to South Australia and Tasmania, you see that there is a Productivity Commission recommendation that there be a cut of $557 million from South Australia and $168 million, I think, from Tasmania. People then say: 'What does that actually mean for this state?' What it means for the state of South Australia—and people are doing the work; there is an election in South Australia as we speak—is that it would be like cutting 5,340 teachers. A cut of $557 million means 5,340 teachers wouldn't be employed. It means 5,000 nurses wouldn't be employed, or 2,400 doctors, or, as in my question to Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, 4,422 frontline police. 


Now, I'm getting representations, as I'm sure every senator in Tasmania and South Australia is, from all of the organisations that are concerned about this. A lot of those organisations are not traditional Labor supporters; they are on traditional Liberal ground, like the chamber of commerce and Business SA. All of these people know that if you take a whole swag of money out of a state that is struggling to balance a budget then there must be cuts to frontline services, or inefficient taxes are put in their place. This is a pressing issue. It is a really widespread issue in Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia. The Hon. Malcolm Turnbull and his respective ministers need to be open, transparent and honest and on the front foot delivering clarity about this issue.


It is well recognised worldwide that horizontal fiscal equalisation is the only way a large and disparate country can deliver equality in services. An Australian in South Australia is entitled to the same police force, medical services and education as one in Sydney—unless you go to what may be an American-type system where, if you don't have the population, you don't have the taxes and you don't get the services, so either move out or put up with it. It's a really serious issue. It needs to be addressed transparently and coherently.


Just to touch on the issue of Senator Molan: one of the things that is really apparent when you come into the Senate is that everything you've ever done, everything you've ever posted and everything you've ever said will be scrutinised. It is no surprise that people have raised questions about some of his posts. I actually live in an area where there is high Muslim immigration. They run successful businesses, their children are successful at school, and they walk and talk and are as Australian as the rest of us—maybe they dress a little bit differently. But if I was to do anything on Facebook, I'd be celebrating that community and how they have come here, started businesses, employed people, gone to school and been successful. That's what I would be propagating. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (15:43):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 18 December 2017, of the Honourable Barry Cohen, AM, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Robertson and Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment in the Hawke Government, places on record its gratitude for his service to the Parliament, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Barry Cohen's life was one of remarkable achievement in public life, defined by his persistent concern for the good of others and an unflappable—and very Australian—sense of humour. Born on 3 April 1935 in the regional centre of Griffith, New South Wales to local dentist Louis Cohen and his wife, Phyllis, Barry undertook schooling at Griffith High School, Sydney Grammar School and North Sydney Technical High School. Following this, he went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts from the Australian National University.


Barry's grandparents left the Polish region of Russia in the 1890s at a time of a wave of Jewish immigration to countries like Australia, which welcomed them with open arms. Decades later, in one of the darkest chapters of human history, several members of his extended family perished in the horrors of the Holocaust. A proud and active member of the Jewish community, Barry remarked about his time at Griffith High School, 'Seven Jewish children in a school of nearly one thousand made us a curiosity.'


From an early age, Barry's commitment to public service was clear. In 1953, he enlisted in what was then the Citizen Military Forces, today's Australian Army Reserves, and he served ably with the Scottish Regiment until 1957. Two years later, in October 1959, Barry married Rae McNeill, with whom he had three sons, Stuart, Adam and Martin. Running a gentleman's outfitters prior to entering federal parliament, he occasionally considered pursuing his dream of becoming a professional golfer—so I'm told. Barry's work running a modest retail business might seem unremarkable, but it was a significant part of what shaped Barry's strength in his subsequent political career. As one of the few people on the Labor side to have experienced owning a small business, he was a strong policy counterweight to the union voices in the Labor Party. Even after his retirement from parliament, he often took Labor to task in his prolific newspaper columns whenever he felt that the parliamentary party was becoming detached from realities. 


One of Barry's most important contributions to public life was his work as the deputy campaign manager for the 'yes' campaign in the 1967 referendum on Indigenous Australians. That referendum involved a significant public discussion on the treatment of Indigenous Australians that built the momentum towards a resounding result of over 90 per cent support. Knowing his opinions, the suggestion of a friend prompted him to join the Australian Labor Party in 1964. From there, Barry's deepening party involvement, coupled with his passion for the New South Wales Central Coast, led him to run as the Labor candidate for the district of Robertson at the October 1969 federal election. Barry was elected the first Labor member for that seat since Thomas Williams' election defeat in 1949. 


Only a few years after his entry into parliament, the election of the Whitlam government saw Barry exposed to a period of substantial reform. After serving in the shadow ministry between 1977 and 1980, the election of the Hawke government saw Barry appointed to the role of Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, retitled as the Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment only a year later. Barry was also made a Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Bicentennial in 1984, continuing in that role until 1987 when he left the ministry.


During this time, he became quite close to the then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, with the two having bonded over shared appreciation for the state of Israel and the fierce passion for golf. That friendship was on full display at a 1986 dinner celebrating Barry's career, with the Prime Minister noting—tongue in cheek, I'm sure: 'All of us in the Labor Party have had cause to be grateful that he chose politics over the glittering promise of life on the pro golf circuit.'


Barry's most enduring legacies can be found within the environmental space. As Minister for the Environment, he stewarded the processes that came to protect some of our nation's greatest natural wonders, including legislating additional protections for the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru. In addition, Barry played a prominent role in securing the stage 2 listing of the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park as a UNESCO World Heritage site, a process that would reach its completion a few short years after his retirement from parliament. 


His commitment to the environment was a truly personal one. This was most evident after Barry's retirement, when he threw his life savings into building a wildlife sanctuary. This involved years of toil for Barry and his son Adam to build the park, and he ran the facility until 2005. Of equal significance were the stands that Barry took in his continuing fight against discrimination. His early life experiences instilled in him a passion for justice that was first articulated in his maiden speech. Barry passionately advocated for an end to discrimination in South Africa and Rhodesia, which he charged had raised the dogma of racial superiority 'to a fine legislative art'. However, his efforts extended beyond words and into action. Of particular note was Barry's role in shining a light on the suffering of the Soviet Union's Jewish population.


Following his departure from the Hawke ministry in 1987, Barry retired from parliament just prior to the March 1990 federal election. The years after Barry's retirement were spent as a prolific writer, penning numerous opinion pieces in leading Australian newspapers alongside eight light-hearted books on the nature of Australian politics. Throughout that time, his larrikin spirit shone through, with Barry once noting that 'the only thing that kept me sane during the pressure of the last 20 years was to have a good laugh'. Isn't that something that all of us should always remember?


In recognition of years of dedicated service in both the Australian parliament and a wide range of other community roles, Barry was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the Queen's Birthday honours in 2007. But Barry's commitment to public service did not end with his parliamentary career. He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2014, and his final years were spent campaigning for greater awareness around Alzheimer's disease and for additional resources towards a search for a cure and the care for those that it affects.


Beyond his advocacy, Barry's candid and frank public writings on his experiences battling the disease helped to bring the tragic reality faced by hundreds of thousands of Australians further into the national spotlight. In the life and service of Barry Cohen we find so many of the traits that are most prized as part of our national character—good grace and humour, hard work and an unfailing commitment to those around him.


To Barry's wife, Rae; his sons, Stuart, Adam and Martin; all of his grandchildren; and his whole family, on behalf of the government, I offer my most sincerest condolences.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:51):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of a member of the Labor family, a former member of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Barry Cohen AM, who served as a minister in the Hawke government, who passed away, sadly, in December 2017. I commence by conveying the opposition's deepest sympathies to his family and friends and to all who knew him.


In many ways, Barry Cohen was a member of one of the lucky generations of Labor parliamentarians. He saw the rise and fall of the Whitlam government before being at the vanguard of the Hawke ascendancy, and it presented him with the opportunity to serve as a minister, most notably in the environment portfolio. Throughout his life in politics he always took an approach that seemed to acknowledge his good fortune, and we are very grateful—certainly those of us in the Labor Party, but I suspect the Australian community more broadly—that he never took the advice that Fred Daly gave him early in his career to 'cut the comedy'. It's to our benefit that he didn't take that advice, because he ensured his passion and achievements were accompanied by good humour. 


Throughout his career, Barry Cohen retained his underlying zeal for fairness and his opposition to discrimination—greatly influenced by his Jewish faith and the treatment suffered by so many of his family who were killed in the Holocaust. As a minister, he seized the opportunity to be a part of nation-shaping reforms. After politics he continued to share the lighter side of political life with others. In his final act, he used his debilitating disease as a motivation to secure greater awareness and policy advancement for the benefit of others.


As Senator Cormann said, Barry Cohen was born in Griffith in 1935. His father was a dentist in the town, with the family later moving to Sydney where Mr Cohen completed his secondary education. His early adult years included aspirations to be a professional golfer, retailing sporting goods and as a TV sports commentator. Prior to his election, he was a small businessman, and he was always proud of this background, having opened his first menswear shop on the North Shore of Sydney in 1959, possibly not the typical foundation for a career in Labor politics, even in the 1960s.


For Barry Cohen, discrimination wasn't just something experienced by others; it was something he endured. But he recognised his cause was not a personal one and, whether it be against anti-Semitism, apartheid or the appalling treatment of our first peoples, he determined he would not sit idle, so in order to make a difference he joined the Australian Labor Party. He seized the House of Representatives division of Robertson—I note Senator O'Neill is here and, no doubt, may wish to speak about that history—a seat located then as now on the Central Coast of New South Wales, in 1969. Until his electoral success, it had been a Liberal-held seat for two decades. He built the seat into a personal stronghold, but it was never safe. He worked it hard. He was a formidable campaigner, evidenced by the fact that he held it through to his retirement in 1990. Since then, notwithstanding our best efforts, it has oscillated between the major parties.


In his first speech, Barry Cohen reflected on some of his motivations for entering politics, and the theme of discrimination was a strong one. He said, 'I've always been concerned with the question of prejudice, whether that prejudice be based on class, religion or race.' He went on to describe his opposition to racial unrest, particularly in the United States, parts of South-East Asia and in sections of communities all over the world. He also turned his attention to the home front, lamenting the lack of advancement in Aboriginal affairs. Of course, he came to this topic from a knowledgeable background, having served as an executive member of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. He highlighted the gap that existed between the myth that Indigenous people were making giant steps forward and the reality of the squalid living conditions on the outskirts of country towns in his home state of New South Wales. He knew from his personal experience of having visited such places how desperate the need was not just in housing but also in so many areas, including education, health care and employment. In the wake of the euphoria of the 1967 referendum, there is no doubt that electing people like Barry Cohen to the parliament helped to bring practical firsthand knowledge of the plight of Australia's first peoples, on which we still need to shine a light today.


During his time on the backbench, Barry Cohen had the opportunity to learn firsthand about success and failure in politics through the election and dismissal of the Whitlam government. At the same time, he prepared himself for future responsibility by completing tertiary qualifications at the Australian National University. From 1977 to 1980, he was in the shadow ministry in the portfolios of environment, sport and recreation, tourism and home affairs under Bill Hayden. Despite a hiatus over the next three years, he was restored to the frontbench following the election of the Hawke government. He entered the ministry in 1983 in the portfolio of Home Affairs and the Environment. In 1984, this became Arts, Heritage and the Environment, and he also gained responsibility for assisting the Prime Minister with arrangements for the impending bicentennial celebration in 1988.


Barry Cohen was fortunate to serve in a ministry that is still widely regarded as one of the most talented ever composed in Australia. At the same time, he also took on portfolios—especially environment—which were gaining importance in the national political landscape. We can see this in some of the remarkable decisions taken under his stewardship: the granting of full protection of the Great Barrier Reef and Uluru as well as World Heritage listing for stage 2 of Kakadu. Even today these achievements are remarkable. To be able to play a role in preserving these icons of Australia for future generations in perpetuity is a great legacy of executive office and serves also a reminder to us all of the importance of continuing to work for the protection of our natural environment.


In the arts portfolio, Barry Cohen worked hard to ensure art support was not compromised, despite tough budget policy and many competing pressures, which earned him praise from the sector. His capacities in the arts area were described in an anecdote in Bill Shorten's speech to his memorial service, where he tells a story of Barry Cohen starting his first menswear shop in 1959 and a friend of his told him, 'You should go down. There's another shop on the Pacific Highway that specialises in artwork. Add some character to the interior of your shop.' It happened that Barry had known the shop owners for a long time. He thought they were a respectable middle-class family, but he thought their 18-year-old son Brett was a 'five-star nutter'. Barry bought a few pieces on his way out. The owner asked if he was interested in purchasing some of his son's paintings. He pointed to five he'd had hanging in the shop and said, '15 quid or all five for 60 pounds.' Barry said, 'I don't know much about art and I wasn't about to be conned by an old codger trying to sell his son's paintings, so I replied, ""It's kind of you to offer, but, no, thank you, Mr Whiteley.""'


Mr Cohen's role in the organisation of the Australian bicentennial celebrations should not be overlooked. As Senator Cormann mentioned, he was very close to Bob Hawke. They shared an emotional attachment, a commitment to Israel and a very strong sporting rivalry on the golf course. Nevertheless, despite this, he was a victim of changing winds in his right faction and wasn't returned to the ministry after the 1987 election. He served his remaining three years in the parliament on the backbench.


Barry Cohen used his immediate post-parliamentary career to complete several books and write columns, including for The Bulletin and The Australian. This was a great outlet for his sense of enjoyment in many of the everyday occurrences of political life. His humour shone through in his collections of anecdotes and witticisms and in particular in his collections of stories about the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Whitlamisms, as they are known, were the product of dedicated study from when he first entered the House in 1969. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2007 in recognition of his service to the Australian parliament and the community.


When he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease Mr Cohen was shocked, and it took him some time to come to terms with being told he was at the early stages of dementia after being hospitalised after a series of falls. However, with characteristic courage, he recognised that he could be an advocate for the hundreds of thousands of Australians living with dementia and their families—in many ways his greatest realisation. He joked that he could employ some of the tactics that his constituents employed to lobby him when he was their local member to in turn lobby for action and encourage others to do so. His challenge he saw as a policy challenge for our country, and set about addressing it just as he had so many other challenges in his career, seeking a better deal for older Australians.


Barry Cohen deserves a lasting place in Labor history and a lasting place in Australia's history. He drew on his experiences of discrimination to pursue policy changes that would benefit countless others from all backgrounds and all walks of life. He served amongst some of the finest parliamentarians of his generation to deliver the preservation of some of the most iconic and valuable environments in our country. We are fortunate to have had such a dedicated, passionate but of course humorous servant to grace our parliament. Politics is a tough business, but laughter was his antidote to the pressures and tribulations of the job. He said:


To see the absurdity of some of the things we were doing; to laugh at myself and my colleagues.


Barry Cohen was indeed the life of the party. On behalf of the Labor Party, I again extend my and all of our empathies to Rae and all of his family and friends at this time.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:02):  It is a sad occasion on which to rise, but I absolutely appreciate the opportunity to put on the record remarks around the amazing Barry Cohen. I recall the first time I met Barry Cohen. I was considering running for preselection and I was advised that I should go and meet him. In all the years I had lived on the coast, and being only a fairly recently joining member of the Labor Party, I hadn't had the pleasure of making his company. So I went to the bottle shop on the way at the bottom of the hill, I picked up a bottle of red and a bottle of white and I proceeded up to the top of the hill to what's now known as the Walkabout Wildlife Park but was Barry's Calga Springs Sanctuary at the time. I was greeted first by a wallaby and then by Barry, emerging from the back of the house at the call of his wife, Rae. He stood on the balcony and he looked me up and down; I had the two bottles in my hand. He said, 'Oh, well, what have you got there?' I said, 'Barry, I didn't know if you liked red or white, so I brought one of each.' He said, 'I don't know anything about you, darling, but I like your style.' That was our first encounter.


What a generous and wise mentor he was for me on so many occasions. That evening we sat as the sun set, and the wallabies jumped around in a free and open environment, which was quite a radical departure from the way in which engagement with our native animals is often experienced by tourists to Australia. Barry had vision there and he created this wonderful sanctuary that is a hallmark of the tourist industry that is part of the Central Coast. I'm very pleased to say that just last week I was in a local shop, talking to a young girl who has undertaken some training at TAFE and is on a disability support. She loves animals and she is going to work at the Walkabout Wildlife Park. It has been a great place of engagement for people in our local community.


I wanted to acknowledge that Barry's passing on 18 December was something that really affected so many people on the Central Coast who have been long-term residents. Barry was very much a part of the furniture. I know that, when he retired from politics and when he finally sold the business that he had up there on the Central Coast and moved to Bungendore, he was still very much enamoured of the political process, for all its flaws—and I noted Senator Wong's comments about his capacity to critique and to laugh at the lunacy of some of the things that happened around this place. He was still a passionate believer in the power of democracy to improve people's lives, and the passion that it is possible to bring to politics, to bring about change. 


Much has been said of Barry's contributions to a range of policy areas, particularly the environment. In my conversations with Barry, the one particular issue that he spoke to me most commonly about was his efforts to improve and change practices to enhance road safety. There was always this profoundly practical dimension to the ideas that Barry wanted to advance, and he spoke with great joy about the changes that he was able to make and the lives of Australians that had been saved as a result of that policymaking that he was part of. 


On that very first meeting that I had with Barry, he gave me some reading to take away with me—which shouldn't surprise people. Amongst the reading—also no surprise—was one of his very own books. In fact, it was How to Become Prime Minister, which Barry wrote in 1990, six years before I even joined the Labor Party. It was a wonderful entry for me, through him, into his perspective on what happens here in Canberra.


Barry married Rae McNeill in October 1959. To Rae and their three sons, Stuart, Adam and Martin, and to Barry's grandchildren, I convey my deepest condolences, as a long-term resident of the Central Coast, for and on behalf of the people of the Central Coast. Certainly, as a Labor person, he is writ large in our history. But I also wanted to acknowledge that the community remembers some remarkable local contributions that Barry made. Many of you would have heard of the RED scheme, which was a very significant way of getting funding into the local community. The RED scheme on the Central Coast, on Barry's watch, delivered the very first versions of our surf lifesaving clubs up and down the coast. That was the way in which Barry engaged with the local people on a very, very practical level. Those surf clubs became the foundation institutions and the foundation places in which the community gathered at Copacabana, where I live; at Macmasters Beach; at Terrigal; at Avoca. That section of Robertson that he represented relied on those buildings to create spaces in which we could become a community in what was a very much a growing area at the time. 


As Senator Wong has indicated, Barry Cohen won the seat in 1969. He wrested it from Liberal control, which it had been under for 20 years, and then held onto it till his retirement in 1990, no small feat in what is still declared pretty much a bellwether seat. Barry was part of the community. He read it very well, he appreciated the people who were there and he had an amazing set of allies. In fact, I recall him talking to me about a local real estate agent by the name of George Brand, who has real estate offices right across the coast. George Brand comes from the area of Copacabana where I live. Barry said that one day this fellow rolled up in his office wearing his stubbies shorts and a T-shirt, and he said he didn't know who he was. He walked in and just said, 'I'd like to contribute to your campaign, Barry,' and just put the money straight down and helped him out. Local businesses really understood that, to grow their businesses, they needed a great member who was going to make practical enhancements to our local community and deliver the roads that enable communities to function and enable businesses to function. They had a great friend in Barry Cohen. 


Before, during and after politics, Barry Cohen was very true to his cultural and faith tradition. He championed always a very strong and enduring friendship between Australia and Israel, and he never resiled from his commitment to that end. He certainly shared with me on a regular basis his thoughts about pressing matters with regard to our international relations.


Barry's determination to try and help shape the debate, both at a local level and the national level, continued, as has been indicated, well after his parliamentary career. He continued to write books and he continued to go around the country. I'm sure that there was a powerful educative impact from Barry telling the stories of the human interactions that happen in this place, revealing the flawed nature, but also the possible nature, of the work that we do. I noted in the comments that Bill Shorten made yesterday—and I'm very sad to say that parliamentary business prevented me from being able to attend that memorial service yesterday as a former member for Robertson—when he paid tribute to Barry's record in the parliament by indicating Barry's response to his final illness of Alzheimer's, his turning it from a personal struggle into a policy challenge. He certainly communicated with me, at least early in his illness, his ideas about what needed to be tackled. As Bill Shorten said, he did not go gently into that good night. Instead, he took up the fight on behalf of every Australian living with dementia, urging politicians from all sides to deliver a better deal for older Australians. I think that passion that he embodied in his last policy push remains a signature for a life lived in great service of the Australian people. I am proud to have called him my friend.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (16:15):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government is committed to tackling ovarian cancer. Today the Minister for Health has announced $3 million to support a new, groundbreaking project that helps women identify whether they are at risk of developing ovarian cancer. This builds on the $33 million we have already provided for dedicated research related to ovarian cancer since 2013. The Minister for Women has been an ovarian cancer ambassador since 2012 and, along with senators and members from other parties, has held an awareness event in parliament every year since then, the most recent of which was last night. The government is pleased that all sides of politics have come together to spread awareness of this horrible disease.

 (South Australia) (16:17):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.


I table the explanatory memorandum and seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This week marks the 9th anniversary of the Rudd Labor Government's infamous $42 billion stimulus package. The implementation of this package was a dark day in Australia's history where the economic surplus that the Howard Government had prudently built up over 11 years was scandalously frittered away. For the first time in nearly a decade, Australia's budget plunged into the red.


Before he was elected in 2007, Mr Rudd badged himself ""Mr Austerity"", saying at the time that, ""This reckless spending must stop.""


But it didn't.


The egregious examples of chronic waste under Labor's stimulus package are staggering. From over-priced classrooms and school halls — in some cases, built only to see the schools close soon afterwards — to the budget blowouts and tragic deaths resulting from the ill-fated Pink Batts Scheme.


The interest on the Rudd Government's ballooning debt kept growing. In this context, that government and this parliament — quite rightly — legislated a change to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act in 2008 to impose a debt ceiling of $75 billion.


However, the Labor Government — regardless of which leader was at its helm ¬maintained an unhealthy addiction to profligate spending. The Parliament approved the government raising the legislated debt ceiling to $250 billion in 2011, and again to $300 billion in 2012.


The election of the Abbott Liberal/National Coalition Government in 2013 was heralded as a watershed moment for Australia. The government had campaigned strongly on addressing the debt and deficit crisis.


Leaving aside some regrettable budgetary decisions and policy positions taken by that government, the Abbott Government were also frustrated by the obstructive Senate of the 44th Parliament dominated as it was then — and now in this 45th Senate — by an ideologically fiscal left-wing bloc of Labor, Greens and crossbench senators.


As senators who were here at the time would recall, the original bill introduced by the Abbott Government in the Senate on 14 November 2013 sought to raise the debt limit to $500 billion. Labor moved to amend that figure to $400 billion instead — a point worth noting and comparing with what position they take on this bill. It was implicit from the Australian Labor Party's behaviour in that debate, 4 years ago, that they had no problem with a debt limit then. Indeed, using their numbers the major parties agreed to raise the limit to that alternate $400 billion figure.


Then something odd happened. Between the Houses, the bill came back, and there was a deal with the Greens to agree to an alternate amendment on 5 December 2013 to repeal the ceiling altogether.


To quote the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as she was then and remains today, Senator Wong told the Senate on 5 December 2013:


""If you ever wanted an example of this government not being the government they said they would be, have a look at the deal today. From a government that said in opposition that they were against debt, and from a government that said they were the party of no debt, we now have a government of no debt limit. No debt limit! The party of no debt becomes the party of no debt limit! But even more extraordinary than that is the fact they have done this with the support of the Australian Greens.""


On 9 December 2013, the matter returned to the Senate and in divisions, the Australian Labor Party voted against repealing the debt ceiling.


On that fateful day, with the support of the Greens, the Abbott Government raised the white flag on fiscal responsibility and the newly-amended bill repealed the legislated debt ceiling altogether.


Unsurprisingly, the budgetary blow-outs continued in a patchwork of reckless spending, totalling tens of billions of dollars, including a wish list of off-balance-sheet initiatives which crudely attempted to hide the true picture.


The measure used to track a debt ceiling, gross debt, now stands at more than $530 billion, in excess of 29% of gross domestic product (GDP). This ratio is far worse than the then-lofty heights set by the financially illiterate former Whitlam Labor Government. At the time Mr Whitlam was dismissed by the Governor-General in 1975, their debt-to-GDP level stood at 21.6%.


Thankfully, on 6 December 2017, the Senate agreed to my motion acknowledging the condemning and comparative Whitlam era and Turnbull era levels and, I quote,


""expresses its in principle support for legislative measures that will help chart a pathway to budget surplus achieved by reducing spending and waste, not by increasing taxes.""


Naturally, on this subsequent sitting week I present the Senate with the prime means to charting a pathway to surplus, namely capping debt. This should not be received as a radical proposition — at least, not by members of the government — since the limit I have set exceeds the levels in the forward estimates. This measure puts the whole Senate on notice when considering legislation with budgetary impacts that it will have set itself a debt limit to work within.


Burgeoning Coalition Government spending and the accompanying interest payments show no signs of appreciably slowing down. It is time to put the brakes on — and fast — and this is how we do it.


A cavalier approach to intergenerational debt will have long-term consequences. Consider some of the European economies that could not restrain their spending and debt. To name just a few of the consequences, the EU saw economic collapse, urgent negotiations, the potential for other sovereign nations to foot the bill — and the domestic protest about the same. Not to mention the resultant intergenerational antagonism and other social problems.


Looking past the forward estimates, the latest government figures show we are heading for a mind-boggling debt of $684 billion in ten years.


This is simply unsustainable.


The Turnbull Liberal-National Coalition Government and those on the crossbench who might oppose this measure will — in doing so — be indicating they are on a unity ticket with Labor and the Greens' disregard for the cost of our ballooning debt and the long term consequences that come with it. Senators opposing this reform will be telling the Australian public — and future generations — that they want to make hay while the sun shines on their own bank accounts. As their pay increases thanks to the beneficence of the Remuneration Tribunal, they are saddling current and future generations with the bill to pay for spending commitments they won't be around to electorally answer for. Such members and senators want to kick the can down the road for future generations and future governments to deal with.


Our children and grandchildren deserve better. Australia deserves better.


After ten years of empty promises about a budget surplus being ""just around the corner"" we need a serious reality check.


The plain fact of the matter is, we are witnessing intergenerational theft on a grand scale which will see our children, our grandchildren and their children struggling to pay back a debt which is growing faster than it can be repaid.


The Parliament of Australia is awash with red — red ink and red politics — even from some of those allegedly occupying the right of the political spectrum. Few in this place — or the other place — know what a surplus looks like anymore.


Now we hear talk of 'pathways to surplus' which are as warm and fuzzy as `roadmaps to peace'. They sound like you're doing something, when you're not, because you can't secure the commitment of other parties to achieve the desired result.


There is never any serious debate or focussed effort on paying back debt — until today.


A Liberal backbencher observed recently:


`Well, in 2021, if we deliver a surplus of $7 billion and we do that every year for the next 100 years, we'll be able to pay back the debt that we've got by then.' A hundred year plan to pay for a decade of spendthrift waste.


I'm sorry, but that's as tricky as promising funding like `Gonski' or anything else beyond forward estimates. The only promises that matter are those that you have to deliver upon within forward estimates. In other words, if you are not accountable for your promise at the next election, then it is, at best, hot air and, at worst, dishonesty with the voters.


There is one iron law of economics: all debt must be repaid at some point. This responsibility falls to us, not our children. We must stop the debt explosion now, before it does irreparable damage to our economy.


The Coalition Government prefers not to talk about the fact that by 2020 there is going to be about $20 billion a year of interest costs. That amount of money each year would build many roads and hospitals, fund substantial tax cuts and strengthen our flagging economy.


Unfortunately, it's all too easy for successive Australian governments in their frenzied addiction to excessive spending, to pass the ticking problem down the line.


Instead of moving to fix the debt and deficit crisis once and for all, they are forcing us to impose a crushing tax burden on successive generations of workers to support the failure and irresponsibility of the current political class.



I urge the Senate to return to its fiscal senses and support the measures it once upheld, and support this bill.

  Thank you. Release of the documents at the time was not in the public interest, as outlined by Minister Payne on 13 September 2017, as it may have compromised the future frigate request for tender evaluation. As the tender evaluation component of the SEA 5000 procurement process is now complete and the offer definition improvement phase is currently underway, the government will review the documents and make those sections available if appropriate.

Senator McGRATH:
  The coalition government has committed to completing the NBN and ensuring that every Australian home and business has access to fast broadband as soon as possible at affordable prices and at least cost to taxpayers. The government's statement of expectations to NBN is explicit in requiring that all premises in Australia will have access to fast broadband of at least 25 megabits per second and 50 megabits per second for 90 per cent of the fixed line network. The coalition government has put the NBN on track for completion by 2020. In 2013, there were up to 1.6 million premises throughout Australia which had poor or no fixed broadband connectivity. Today more than 6.2 million premises can access an NBN service.

  The government opposes this motion. The coalition government is providing record funding for Antarctic research and infrastructure through its $2.2 billion Australian Antarctic Program. This includes $1.9 billion on the Antarctic icebreaker, $200 million for AAD's operations and $55 million for overland traverse capabilities and initial work for year-round aviation access. This investment will ensure Australia remains an international scientific leader in the Antarctic region. The government is currently considering a review of the governance of Antarctic science, conducted by Drew Clarke AO PSM, and is also assessing the most appropriate arrangements for the funding of Antarctic science. The government will release its response to the Clarke review in due course. Antarctic science funding is subject to the usual budget process.

  It's fine to invest money in shiny new ships and buildings, cut ribbons at election time and fly the Prime Minister down multiple times to make announcements. What we need investment in, in Tasmania and in Hobart, is the people. We have a situation where up to 80 scientists and their families—an absolutely integral part of our scientific community in Hobart—are facing a funding cliff at the end of this year, after nearly 15 years of funding research. And it's not just climate research; it's research on the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic. The projects the scientists are working on are globally collaborative. This is absolutely critical. The single biggest issue in Southern Tasmania at the moment is: where is the money that we need to give these scientists certainty so that they don't leave and go elsewhere? It's about time your government took science funding seriously and stumped up what you're going to do about science funding both in Hobart and in Australia.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2018-02-06,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (16:48):  Despite having been repeatedly asked not to bring the facts about Manus Island and Nauru into this chamber, I have continued to do that. The Australian Greens have continued to do that, and I want to do it again today.


It is now more than five years since the Australian Labor Party reopened the Manus Island detention centre and the Nauru detention centre, and more than four long years since the Abbott government began turning around desperate people at sea, abusing their human rights, trampling on their freedoms and liberties, and exiling them, as Australia's political prisoners, to Manus Island and Nauru. Amnesty International has described the treatment of some of these refugees and people seeking asylum as tantamount to torture, and the Australian Greens agree with that assessment. We see the sick pleasure that some coalition senators, including the newly minted Senator Molan, one of the authors of the disgraceful offshore detention regime, seem to draw from the misery they are inflicting on innocent men, women and children in detention.


But it is the Australian Labor Party's cowardice on this issue that has given the coalition a blank cheque for the unspeakable cruelty it is perpetrating on refugees and people seeking asylum. In fact, if the Labor Party had shown an ounce of decency on this issue at any time in the last five years, the situation would not have deteriorated into the human rights calamity that it is today. The people of Australia are heartsick and disgusted at what is being done in their name, and millions of them are demanding that the situation be resolved.


Despite years of ineffective hand-wringing from some members in the Australian Labor Party, that party's policy position has only hardened and solidified—just like their hearts. Their motivation is actually not relevant here. Remember, it was Kevin Rudd who declared that no person who arrived by boat would resettle in Australia, and that remains the case today. How can the Australian Labor Party continue to sit on their collective hands after all that they have seen and all that has been revealed in this chamber and in innumerable Senate inquiries championed by the Australian Greens?


The ALP candidate for Batman, Ms Ged Kearney, has said recently that she accepted the reality of Labor's policy despite previously speaking out against it. Well, what she calls an 'acceptance of reality' we call a 'denial of humanity'. It's a retreat into cowardice. It puts the safety and protection of thousands of innocent men, women and children behind base political priorities. Because despite Ged Kearney and other Labor members muttering reasonable and nice words about the issue, the only thing that actually matters is how they vote in this place. It's votes in the parliament that determine the government. It's votes in the parliament that determine our laws. And it is votes in the parliament that can evacuate Manus Island and Nauru and bring those innocent people here to Australia.


But they won't vote for that because they're beholden to the ALP's factional machine. Despite all the horrors and despite all the cruelty that we've seen, Labor has only moved further away from decency on this issue. They repeatedly refuse to support any efforts in here to evacuate the men, women and children from Manus Island and Nauru and bring them here to safety and freedom in Australia. Ms Kearney has confirmed she's going to line up with Peter Dutton; she's going to line up with the LNP to keep people locked up on Manus Island and Nauru.


People in offshore detention cannot afford to wait for this mythical change from within the Australian Labor Party, and reassuring words offer them no hope whatsoever. People will not be freed from Manus Island or Nauru by electing hand-wringers from the Australian Labor Party. The only way to green up the ALP is to vote Green. It's the only language the Labor Party understands. If we are going to close the camps and bring those innocent people—those desperate people, who only want two things: freedom and safety—to Australia, we need votes in this parliament now. We need people elected to this parliament who are prepared not just to talk the talk but to walk the walk, and the only way that we are going to get that is to elect more MPs who will vote to evacuate Manus Island and Nauru, and who will vote to end the horrors of offshore detention. In Batman, that can only mean a vote for the Greens.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:54):  Excuse me, Madam Acting Deputy President, I've got to stop laughing. Can I say to the previous speaker: well, what a refreshingly different speech. In fact, I almost think it might be a speech that Senator McKim copied from me because, for years, I've been saying, 'Don't blame the coalition,' as Senator McKim always does, 'blame the people who set it up, the Labor Party.' Of course, Senator McKim's never understood that point until Batman comes along. The rank hypocrisy of the Greens was shown in that speech supposedly concerned about people they call distressed and disadvantaged on Manus and Nauru, but there was not a word about them, only about the Batman by-election and the huge fight they're having with the Labor Party for that particular seat. I cannot believe that any party claiming any responsibility or honesty could, for years, have sided with the Labor Party.


You'll recall, Madam Acting Deputy President Kitching, that it was the Greens that kept in power the Labor Party, which set up Manus and Nauru. Congratulations, Senator McKim—when you said you were going to deliver some facts, I laughed audibly—you did deliver some facts, but it is the first time you have ever, ever, ever accepted the reality: it was the Labor Party who started Nauru and Manus and they were supported by the Greens political party. The Greens political party come with dirty hands to this debate and always have. 


I can only simply chuckle to myself how this speech supposedly on humanitarian efforts in Nauru and Manus turned entirely on the Batman by-election, with no pretence made. Senator McKim, in one of his rare honest speeches, admitted that it was all about voting Green in the Batman by-election. One of the great benefits for me is that I don't have to vote in Batman—because I just don't know who I could vote for if my party didn't stand a candidate. 


On the basis that this might have been a sensible debate about Australia's migration policy over the years, I did want to mention some real facts: under the Labor government, supported by the Greens' political party—it was a Labor-Greens alliance, you might remember—50,000 people arrived on over 800 boats; there were 1,200 deaths that we know of; over 8,000 illegal migration arrivals—children—were detained while Labor and the Greens were in power; and, at the height of the policy failure of the Labor and the Greens' political parties at that time, there were 10,201 people held in detention, including 1,992 children—




Senator Williams:
  Ten thousand?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, 10,000, and almost 2,000 children. They were forced to open 17 new detention centres at huge cost to the Australian taxpayer to deal with the influx of these illegal arrivals, and an $11 billion border protection blowout happened under the Labor-Greens policy on illegal migration arrivals. That all changed from the Howard days, when there were no children in detention and, since the advent of a coalition government, all of those children have been taken out of detention. Mind you, as the coalition was getting rid of all those children, the Human Rights Commission and Professor Triggs decided they would have an inquiry into the children in detention. They didn't bother at the height of Labor's failures and the Labor-Greens failures, when there were almost 2,000 children in detention. When the coalition had got that down to about a thousand—now it is zero—the Human Rights Commission started to have this big inquiry into children in detention. They didn't bother when the Labor-Greens policy had put them all there. 


I'm delighted that, since the advent of the coalition government, the illegal arrivals have stopped completely. There's not been one IMA boat into Australian waters in that time. That has meant that there have been no deaths at sea. It also means that the people smugglers who made a fortune out of bringing in IMAs to our country have all but gone out of business. The people smugglers knew their business. The would-be illegal immigrants to Australia paid a lot of money to fly from wherever to Malaysia or Indonesia. They then paid the people smugglers at least $15,000 per person—they weren't poor people—to try and come into Australia illegally. 


Australia and Australians have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to our refugee policy. Per capita, we are up there amongst the most generous in the world. We actually look after genuine refugees who wait for years in squalid camps around the world, waiting for their turn to get to the promised land of Australia, and we take in about 15,000 each and every year. But these people that the Greens support, and the people smugglers that apparently the Greens support, were jumping the queue, meaning those in the squalid camps overseas were left to wait another year for their chance to reach utopia. 


All of this was supported by the Greens political party, who now want the people of Batman to think that they are the only ones that are pure as far as this is concerned. I would love to have a look at the political donations to the Greens political party one day in detail and see the source from overseas of some of their support, because I do know this: the people smugglers have all but been put out of business, and it's cost millions and millions of dollars to their business model. Their only supporters, their real supporters in Australia, have been the Greens political party. One always wonders whether the people smugglers are not rewarding those who help their business model in Australia. 


The Labor Party is equally guilty. But it was the Labor government—with Greens support, I emphasise—who did actually return to the Howard-years solution by saying to people, 'You might try to get to Australia, but you're not going to end up here.' That has stopped those jumping the queue. It's allowed us to take genuine refugees from the squalid refugee camps right around the world and bring them into our country, where they are welcome. We take more per capita than any other country in the world. And, most importantly, we don't have at least 1,200 people—that is the number that we know of—drowning at sea. The Labor Party returned to the Howard government solution. They didn't do terribly well with it, but, with the change of government to the coalition government, we have stopped the boats and stopped those deaths at sea. For some reason, the Greens don't seem to think that's good policy. 


We do what we said we'd do. Those people on Manus and Nauru are well treated and they are given every assistance—better assistance than many Australian disadvantaged people. They are looked after, but they know they will never come into Australia while this government is here. Their only hope is for the Greens and the Labor Party to get back into power. Then they and the people smugglers— (Time expired)

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:04):  It's really important to note at the outset that the factual position of the Labor Party was contained in a motion on 14 November 2017 carried by 31 votes to 28 in this chamber. That motion clearly and succinctly set out the position of the Australian Labor Party. It reads:


(a) acknowledges the failure of the Abbott-Turnbull Government to manage offshore processing arrangements and secure other third country resettlement arrangements for eligible refugees;


(b) notes the United States of America refugee resettlement agreement will resettle up to 1250 eligible refugees from Manus Island and Nauru but that some eligible refugees will miss out on the opportunity to resettle in America;


(c) acknowledges that former Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced an agreement with Prime Minister John Key on 9 February 2013 at the annual Australia-New Zealand Leaders' meeting that:


   (i) New Zealand would resettle 150 refugees annually from Australia, including refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, and


   (ii) the first refugees would be resettled in 2014;


(d) notes that, if former Prime Minister Tony Abbott had not withdrawn from the agreement, as many as 600 refugees would have been resettled in New Zealand by now;


(e) acknowledges the inquiry and report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, Serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in relation to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, and any like allegations in relation to the Manus, and in particular, recommendation 7: 'The committee recommends that the Australian Government give serious consideration to all resettlement offers it receives, including the Government of New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Nauru. Further, if particular resettlement offers are considered unsuitable, the Government should clearly outline the reasons';


(f) notes that New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has renewed the offer to Australia to resettle 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru;


…   …   …


(h) calls on the Turnbull Government to immediately accept New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru and begin negotiating appropriate conditions, similar to the United States refugee resettlement agreement, to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people.


So our position is exceedingly clear. It was carried as a resolution of this chamber as late as November of 2017.


We can go around and around this argument as many times as you like—and Senator Macdonald and others can regurgitate their version of history and the failures of previous government—but the simple reality is that you've had five years in office and we have had a continual problem in this area. Really, there are two ways that we can sort this out. We can resettle them somewhere else or we can leave them as they are, in circumstances which—whilst Senator Macdonald will contest—don't appear to be ideal, or at the very least do not appear to be conducive to proper outcomes for mental health and the like. There can be many reasons for that. You can say it's the Greens party's problem for whipping up their expectations, but the reality is that I don't think the situation in Manus Island and Nauru has contributed to Australia's international reputation.


I had a very close look at the situation in Nauru when I chaired the inquiry into the allegations over there, and it was very, very clear that there were circumstances which challenge propriety, governance and fair play. When the government of Nauru throws out the Australian Federal Police representative for some advice they didn't welcome, when a magistrate has his visa removed for some advice that the government of Nauru didn't welcome and when we continue to pour unaudited quantities of money into Nauru, it is simply not good enough. We know—and there has been some media speculation and actual evidence on this—that we can spend up to $600,000 or $700,000 on each one of these people, keeping them in what are allegedly pretty miserable conditions.


Labor believes in strong borders. We believe in offshore processing. The regional settlement was the initiative of the Labor government. We believe in boats being turned back where it is safe to do so because it does save lives. We all watch the news. I have travelled through Italy and I have travelled through Europe, and people are making that perilous journey on unsafe boats. The Italian coastguard is doing an exemplary job saving people's lives. We know that this is an international economic problem.


I do applaud Senator Macdonald's comments about the great work Australia has done with the humanitarian intake. Per capita, we are probably one of the best in the world at that. We do it exceedingly well. I have travelled to Mount Gambier and been at citizenship ceremonies where the Karen refugee community in that area—all speaking English, all working and their kids excelling at school—have actually been absorbed into a regional community area with tremendous success. In the suburb I live in, the Afghani Hazara community have revitalised half a kilometre of Prospect Road with their business acumen and investment. They are doing great things. So we all acknowledge that refugees come here and contribute, but there has to be a process by which they come here and contribute, and people smugglers shouldn't be part of that process. We just don't accept that you should be able to fly, buy a ticket or come in on a boat.


We both have this problem. Ironically, as I have said here before, it's been on the agenda since 1 July 2011, I think the first day I was here. Senator Cash, on this side of the chamber, was articulating well what her view of the world was—sometimes a little shrilly, but she definitely put her point of view forward strongly. What we need to do here is resolve this. I don't think it's going to be resolved like an impasse at chess, where, 'Unless you go back to Iran,' who won't take you, 'you're not coming this way.' We have an offer from New Zealand, we have an offer from the United States and we have offers from other parts of the region. The government needs to be more proactive and diligent, and resolve this issue.


I accept the fact that we never want to have a resurrection of the boats. No-one wants to go through that awful tragedy off Christmas Island. There are people in this parliament who contributed in that inquiry who are still affected by that evidence. So we don't resile from the fact this is a really difficult issue for the parliament as a whole, but I think it is about time that all of the parties in this place tried to get common ground. We shouldn't be seeking the things that keep us apart; we should be looking for the things that bring us together and get closer to resolving this issue, whether it's getting the Trump administration to quicken the process and those genuine refugees being allowed to resettle in the United States and get on with their lives, or in New Zealand and get on with their lives. I think the hard-edged political factors in this are not conducive to good people outcomes.


I really don't think it is relevant to mention the electorate of Batman as some sort of panacea for this. If we do get a successful candidate for the Greens party in Batman, that will be the wish of the people of Batman. But it's not going to resolve anything in here. It is not going to resolve anything in here; it may bring another voice to their side of the table, but if that's a voice of disunity or of noncooperation and not trying to work through the problems and get resolution, then that's not really what should be promulgated by Senator McKim and his party. Electing one Greens person in Batman will not do one iota for resolution for people who are struggling to find resolution in Manus Island and or Nauru.


What we do need is a more collegiate effort in the parliament to get both sides—all sides; the four sides in this argument—to put together a genuine Australian position that restores our international reputation to where it should be: at the absolute peak. We have done this really well in the past. We have done humanitarian stuff really well in the past, and the cooperation that's been exhibited by Indonesia and others in these areas is exemplary. We should double our efforts in those areas. We should resolve this problem and take these people; it is a real stain on our reputation.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2018-02-06,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:14):  I am continually astounded by the depth of the depravity and inhumanity of this government in its treatment of the most vulnerable people: refugees and people seeking asylum. And the justification for this cruelty, such as we just heard from Senator Macdonald, is a stain on our country. These are our fellow humans. They are simply seeking safety and a future for their families. It is shameful and it has gone on for far too long. Of course, it's not just the government that should be ashamed. We've just heard Senator Gallacher be an apologist for ongoing, indefinite incarceration of asylum seekers on the offshore hellholes of Manus Island and Nauru. The Labor Party must also recognise its key role in this. The Labor Party and the government are equally responsible for the cruelty and inhumanity of those offshore camps.


In the face of this cruelty and bigotry there are, however, some windows of hope. In my home state of Victoria people are undertaking determined, hopeful actions, in the face of this regime, to drive change and signal Australia's true values of care and compassion. Both major parties should take heed. Victorians are exercising their voices, and they'll continue to do so at the ballot box. One local council, the City of Darebin, which lies within the federal seat of Batman, has fearlessly demonstrated its support for refugees and asylum seekers. In December last year, council resolved to write to the Prime Minister to express concern regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Australia's offshore detention camps. Mayor Kim Le Cerf stated that all levels of government must meet their humanitarian obligations to support asylum seekers and refugees. She called on the federal government to close the offshore detention camps on Manus Island and Nauru and immediately bring the refugees and asylum seekers to Australia for resettlement. I also note that Darebin is a refugee welcome zone, where refugees successfully settle and receive support in the community, and that Darebin council is a signatory to the joint statement on asylum seekers by Victorian local governments. There are many other Victorian councils and community groups that are providing leadership, humanity and a vision for a welcoming Australia; who are reflecting the values of their community and the wishes of ordinary Australians that refugees and asylum seekers be treated with compassion. I commend them all. It makes me proud to be a Victorian.


Both major parties should heed these community voices. I know a lot of good former Labor supporters who cannot abide the current parliamentary party's continued support for the fear based, cruel regime we have in place, so I say to my Labor colleagues in this place: there is always room to recognise these humanitarian options, but until you do Australians will struggle to believe that you are ever true to your purported values of fairness and equality. In a few short weeks the residents of the Batman electorate will get the chance to send a strong message to the Labor Party that they want action—no more talk, no more lip service, no more pussyfooting around on refugees. Labor talk tall on refugees and asylum seekers but in the end they always fall into lock step with the cruel policies of this government in a race to the bottom. The likely Labor candidate for Batman, Ged Kearney, tells us she's progressive. She tells us she will represent the people of Batman. She tells us she's a lifelong supporter of refugees and asylum seekers. Indeed, I commend her work and her previous advocacy. But since becoming the likely Labor candidate she's already fallen into line with party policy. She now says Labor's position on boat turnbacks and offshore detention has been adopted at the party's national conference and 'as a candidate and hopefully member of the Labor caucus, that's a reality I accept.' Well, that's not good enough. 'A lifelong advocate for refugees,' she says. 'That's the reality I accept'—a reality of cruelty, inhumanity and indefinite detention in these offshore hellholes. That's not a reality that the people of Batman accept, and it's not a reality that Alex Bhathal, the Greens candidate for Batman, accepts.


When you're given the honour of being an MP or a senator, what matters is how you vote, not your supposed lifelong advocacy for refugees and asylum seekers, not how much you say you're going to change the party from within and not what realities you accept. What matters is how you vote. And the people of Batman deserve someone who believes that how they vote matters. Alex Bhathal is a lifelong advocate for refugees and asylum seekers. She will vote, as the member for Batman, to end the cruelty of offshore hellholes, she will vote to end boat turnbacks and she will vote to end indefinite incarceration, because Alex Bhathal knows that what matters to the people of Batman is how she votes in the parliament as their representative. I have hope for a day when this cruel, inhumane, secretive and, frankly, globally shameful treatment of refugees and asylum seekers will end. We must never stop highlighting its horrific impact on people. Australian community members won't be silent, and the Greens won't be silent, because the current cruel and inhumane asylum seeker and refugee policies are not a reality that the Greens accept.

"Molan, Sen Jim",LP,2018-02-06,"



Senator MOLAN
 (New South Wales) (17:21):  Again, this is not my first speech. I'm rising to speak to oppose the matter of public interest that's been addressed by a number of speakers before me, and I remind the Senate that the title of the MPI that we're looking at today is:


The inhumanity and cruelty of Australia's offshore detention system and the need to evacuate to Australia the men, women and children detained on Manus Island and Nauru.


That's extraordinarily emotive language—'inhumanity' and 'cruelty'. When I read it, I wondered where I'd heard it before. I don't have to go back very far in my extraordinary political career to remember where I have heard it before, because yesterday someone called McKim—I'm not too sure whether it's our McKim or any McKim—tweeted a tweet against me, calling me a racist first, which I take very, very seriously.




Senator McKim:
  My point of order is on the respectful addressing of senators in this place.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No, I was listening intently. Senator Molan was referring to a tweet from an individual named McKim, and he said he doesn't know whether it was the McKim in the Senate or another. The point is he was referring to the information at hand. There is no point of order.




Senator McKim:
  Another point of order: the tweet was sent from the official Senator McKim account, and it is identified—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I've made the ruling. The ruling is consistent with the standing orders.




Senator MOLAN:
  I thank Senator McKim because he's clarified that point. He goes on and brags about the cruelty of offshore detention and he says that I revel in trampling rights and freedoms.


We all remember the situation, unfortunately, because it's not that long ago. We've been through this a number of times before. People will remember the Howard years. They'll remember Minister Philip Ruddock. They'll remember the Tampa incident and the involvement of the military in that. They'll remember offshore processing. They'll remember Christmas Island and they'll remember John Howard, who said that we decide who comes to this country and how they come to this country. And we did decide, fundamentally, because about 70 per cent of the people supported that decision. We did decide that, and the way that we decided was that we emphasised that, to come to Australia, you had to come in through a legal entry port. The method of arrival can be illegal even if you then claim refugee status. Of course, that was the reason that we used the term 'illegal maritime arrival' or its abbreviation 'IMA'. It was quite a legitimate abbreviation and quite properly used because their method of arrival was illegal and that's what it stands for. It stands for 'illegal maritime arrival'.


When Kevin Rudd arrived, he claimed that he would maintain John Howard's border policy and defence policies. As Prime Minister, he formed a committee to actually do something. Yes, committees are great for policy, but rarely are they any good for doing things. As a result of this, he failed to do anything with 15 or 16 government departments and agencies working through a committee, none of whom had ultimate responsibility and none of whom worked in accordance with management 101. It was guaranteed to fail from day one. The actions that that government took just made the situation worse.


It was roughly at this stage that I became involved in Operation Sovereign Borders. At that stage, I was assisting the then opposition with defence policy. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government had, during its period of time in government, been absolutely appalling on defence. It was a legitimate function for someone with some defence knowledge to actually try to assist the opposition to oppose them. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government saw the Defence Force as an ATM and drove down defence spending from two per cent to 1.6 per cent. They had no ships and no subs but were very good at pink batts and school halls!


The greatest thing we saw was the arrival of a consolidated and logical management 101 based technique for actually solving this extraordinary problem. Minister Morrison at the time was good enough to call me a co-author of Operation Sovereign Borders—something I am very, very proud of. But I suspect, in fact, that there were about four co-authors of Operation Sovereign Borders, so it's not an honour that I have to myself. Why did all this occur? After everything that the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government did had not worked, the one thing that they left us with, as we were saying before—Senator Macdonald gave you the statistics of the number of children who were held in detention over that period of time, the highest number being almost 2,000 at any one time, along with 50,000 people off 600 to 800 boats—was an appalling situation. There were something like 30,000 people left in this country who were undocumented, and 1,200 drowned. What that left us with was an extraordinary problem. I have not heard anyone who was running the government or from the Greens, who were supporting the government at that time, take responsibility in any way, shape or form for those deaths. Senator Macdonald went through all those figures.


We had to pick up after that. The only thing that we were really left with that we then had to carry on overseas was offshore processing. The matter of public importance describes the system that we have as 'Australia's offshore detention system'. It's not an offshore detention system; it is an offshore processing system that has an element of detention in it. At the moment, there are no people in detention on either of those two islands.


The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government tried to stop the boats, but they couldn't do it. It cost us $11 billion for them to fail, so we did it for them. We did it for the people of Australia, who have consistently supported Operation Sovereign Borders and the strengthening of our borders at about 70 per cent in any poll that's been taken. We did it because this was a life-and-death issue. It is not as though we were solving an esoteric or abstract problem. This was a life-and-death problem—1,200 people had died. We did it because we are an immigrant nation and, as an immigrant nation, we must maintain confidence in our immigration system. Our people will not support 200,000 people coming to this country each year of which just less than 20,000 are under the humanitarian program. On top of that, in the last couple of years, we've brought in 12,000 Syrian refugees.


We must maintain the confidence of the people in our immigration system and we have done that. The migration system at the time that we took it over was being run by the people smugglers. That is an appalling situation. To subcontract your major migration policy to a bunch of thugs throughout the world—a bunch of criminals—is absolutely irresponsible, and we see the consequences of that every single day in the Mediterranean. The policy that we did not introduce in Australia still exists in the Mediterranean and people are dying in their thousands to this day.




Senator McKim:
  They're fleeing from Syria! They're fleeing from your wars, mate!




Senator MOLAN:
  If we control our borders, we can actually show Australians that, as a migrant nation, they can trust this government to implement the migration policy; therefore, we can bring in more people than we've brought in in the past. Controlling borders is a magnificent step.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: there's no secret that Senator Molan is very new to this place. It is his second day here. Interjections are disorderly and I ask you to refer to the Greens to stop their interjecting and let him speak freely, at least till he gets some more experience in this place. After two days, I think it is very rude to be interjecting consistently with a new senator.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McCarthy
):  Thank you, Senator Williams. I just remind all senators to have courtesy when a senator is on his feet.




Senator MOLAN:
  Thank you very much, Madam Acting Deputy President; and, Senator, thank you for your intervention. Here are the issues. The issues really are that the Australian people support Operation Sovereign Borders. Manus and Nauru is tough, tough policy. We acknowledge that. I have never met anyone who wants to keep people on Nauru and Manus. We are doing our best, through the US policy at the moment, to move people off Manus Island. Offshore processing is tough policy. There are no boats. There have been no successful boat missions and there have been no deaths because we turned them back—exactly that. We turned them back and they went back whence they came. That is the success. As a result of that, we are able to bring in 200,000 people a year in the migration policy because Australians support the migration policy, and that is absolutely critical. Of that number, a large proportion, 18,750, are under the humanitarian program, and that is critically important. So strong borders are humane. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the Senate and colleagues, the reasons for success are turn-back, offshore processing and TPVs. Take one out and you'll kill people again.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2018-02-06,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:33):  Australian society would be so much poorer without the diversity of those who have come from every part of the globe. As a good global citizen and signatory to a number of human rights conventions, Australia has a responsibility to ensure that people are safe from violence and persecution when they seek our support. Until recent years, Australia had a proud history of providing that safety—that safe haven for those asylum seekers and refugees—and accepted them into our broader Australian community. But, unfortunately, for years now, Australia, as we know, has been indefinitely incarcerating men, women and children in offshore detention camps on Manus Island and Nauru. This policy, breaching our human rights obligations, is generating deserved criticism and even revulsion in Australia and overseas.


I note Senator Molan's contribution just now, and I ask him to educate himself about international law, about human rights law and about migration law, because if he did he would know very well that everyone has the right to seek asylum. Everyone has the right to seek asylum—to use labels like 'illegals' is simply showing your ignorance about the need to provide that and ensure that we are living up to what we have signed under international law.


I also urge those government senators to meet with and get a better understanding of the international development sector. ACFID, the Australian Council For International Development, went on a fact-finding mission in November last year. They went to PNG. They went to investigate the conditions of refugees and asylum seekers who were brought to Papua New Guinea by the Australian government and who remain under the Australian government's responsibility. ACFID produced a short preliminary findings report. As their report made clear, there are three key factors that are making this a protracted crisis: the four to 4½ years that people have been held by the Commonwealth of Australia in Papua New Guinea; the deterioration of mental health and, in many cases, their physical health and wellbeing due to the deprivation of freedom of movement, poor case management and a lack of settlement options; and the plain fact that the conditions and systems are not adequate to meet the needs of people with complex mental health and medical needs, which is being exacerbated now of course by the drawdown of services.


In January this year, Human Rights Watch, in their annual report, called on the Australian government to act on the serious shortcomings in its human rights record if it wants to be a credible leader on the global stage. And although Australia was elected last year to the UN Human Rights Council for a term of some three years, pledging to prioritise freedom of expression, indigenous rights, gender equality, good governance and national human rights institutions, Human Rights Watch noted that the Turnbull government was undeterred by UN calls to end offshore processing and maintained its cruel practice of warehousing asylum seekers in abysmal conditions, where detainees faced violence and unnecessary delays in medical care. This is all occurring in the Australian government's name—in the Commonwealth's name.


Indeed, January this year also saw extremely disturbing reports of a Rohingyan refugee, suffering an acute mental health crisis and a broken ankle requiring surgery, who had been waiting for more than a year to be transferred from Australia's offshore immigration centre on Nauru for medical treatment. This is just one example. Apparently, Australian Border Force have not yet made a decision on his transfer, despite Nauru hospital's overseas medical referral panel twice approving this refugee for transfer to Australia for treatment and repeated warnings from doctors on the island that he presents a medical emergency and cannot be cared for on that island. The circumstance of this Rohingyan refugee is not unique, and reports make that clear. The governments of Nauru and Australia have ignored doctors' recommendations and blocked medical transfers for nearly 50 people, including those women who have been raped on Nauru and then denied an abortion in Australia. The human rights abuses against people are horrific—against people who simply sought our protection, that right to seek asylum, that we have denied to so many people. 


The worth of families is a fundamental principle of international and Australian domestic law. Australia is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that children have the right to know and be cared for by their parents and should grow up in a family environment where possible. But several departmental sources and sources on Nauru have confirmed to journalists that it is unofficial policy to use family separation to encourage refugees to return to Nauru after medical treatment overseas. Refugees have been told they must leave their children alone in offshore immigration detention in order to access life-saving medical treatment overseas. 


There are still children inside the regional processing centre on Nauru, 18 months after the trumpeted deal with the US, which is an utter disgrace. The fact that only about 100 refugees have left the camps for the United States is not good enough and is just too slow. I support the findings in this ACFID report. I support the findings that go into the need to fast-track the processing of resettlement to the United States. Of course, even after that, it still leaves a number of people—including, at the moment, 150 children—in offshore detention with no prospects for freedom, 4½ years later. 


Some of these people are, as I mentioned before, Rohingyas from Myanmar. Australians are well aware of the nightmare that has been going on since 25 August in Myanmar and Rakhine State, where the Myanmar military have killed and slaughtered thousands, resulting in some 688,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh. Despite this, the Turnbull government is offering Rohingya refugees in our offshore processing facilities money to go back to Myanmar. It is just unfathomable. Tim Costello, on his visit to Bangladesh and to Manus, said recently:


It was a surreal irony to meet Rohingya refugees who have been locked up on Manus while the Australian government simultaneously supports international humanitarian appeals to aid the Rohingya in Cox's Bazar.


I recently visited the Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. I spoke to those distressed Rohingyas, who have experienced the worst atrocities—what the UN Human Rights Commissioner called 'textbook ethnic cleansing'. When I asked them, they did not want to go back to Myanmar. Yet, here is our government wanting to offer refugees who sought our protection money to send them back to Myanmar. The hypocrisy is just bizarre. At the same time we are giving $30 million to Bangladesh to support the Rohingya to stay out of Myanmar. Go figure! This is how ludicrous this government's policy is. It's just sheer, rank hypocrisy. So, I ask Senator Molan to please read ACFID's report, Refugees on Manus— (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-02-06,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (17:43):  It is good to have the debate brought back to some basic facts and reality about what is happening on Manus Island and Nauru, and that the reality of people who are fleeing persecution, including in our region, is being put on the record. Somehow or other we are continuing to get this fiction that these people are just trying to rort some non-existent system. A textbook case of genocide is happening right now in our region, and people are fleeing that. Are they are supposed to just stay there and die? That is this government's idea of what they consider 'humane'. 


Let's revisit the actual text of what we are discussing here today, a matter that is, very much, of public importance: the inhumanity and cruelty of Australia's offshore detention system. 


Not a single word from the coalition speakers today in any way sought to suggest that it is anything other than inhumane and cruel on Manus Island or Nauru, except for the extraordinary statement from Senator Macdonald that these people are 'well treated'. Eight of them have died! Whatever you say about the regime under John Howard, Philip Ruddock and their successors, at least they managed to run an offshore detention regime that didn't involve people dying, people being murdered, people dying by blatant bureaucratic neglect. This minister in this country has to take ultimate responsibility for those things.


As people know, I've only recently come back into this chamber, but it was a terrible feeling of deja vu listening to some of the nonsense, from Senator Macdonald in particular. Literally 20 years ago when I first came here, the same lies were being said, and probably by the same speaker. And it's because those lies have been able to be repeated and take hold that these sorts of outrageous human rights abuses have continued to occur. This litany of lies still gets repeated today. It is not illegal to seek asylum; that is a simple fact, and to continue to assert otherwise is false. It is false to suggest anything other than: the vast majority of people are clearly refugees. That has been determined by our own grotesquely inadequate system of assessment on Manus Island and Nauru. It is totally false to say that Australia is the most generous country in the world when it comes to accepting refugees per capita. It is the same falsehood was said 20 years ago, and yet we had the grand, crowning lie today that somehow these people on Manus Island are 'well treated'. Unbelievable! 


And there is the nonsense that somehow people have stopped drowning. What do you think happened to all of those Rohingya people, even before the genocide got put on to massive turbocharging by the Myanmar military? What do you think happened to them on those boats? Remember—those other countries in our region who followed Tony Abbott's lead and pushed them back out to sea. What do you think happened to them? Did they all, sort of, go back home and sit in their lounge rooms and say, 'Oh, well, we had a go and we missed out'. There is clear evidence. I know they're not interested in anything other than the fairytales that they continue to try and perpetrate for political advantage on the Australian people. There is clear evidence of thousands of people drowning in our region. But somehow or other that is not a matter of concern.


The simple fact is: of course we can't assist every person who is fleeing extreme danger, but there are some people that we can help now, and we certainly should not be inflicting extra harm, extra suffering, extra cruelty on those people. It does have to be said that those camps on Manus Island were reopened under the Labor government, and it was not—as claimed in another falsehood from Senator Macdonald—'with the support of the Greens'. It was clearly opposed by the Greens at the time, categorically and repeatedly. 



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator BARTLETT:
  Senator Macdonald perhaps hasn't been listening all that time, but I see he's back in the chamber and responding, so presumably he's heard me just this one time. So I can tell you: it was not true; you are wrong. Now you cannot not repeat at least one falsehood again.


The simple fact is there is an opportunity right now, as was stated by another speaker. Hundreds of those people could be and should be in New Zealand right now. Let's also not forget, in amongst all that history over the last 20 years, that there was a significant shift due to public pressure—community pressure, groups like Rural Australians for Refugees, and so many other people in the community, and some people back then in the Liberal Party who pressured the Howard government to change its policy—to bring those refugees here from Nauru, some of whom are now citizens, as others have said in this debate and have built strong lives in this country and are contributing effectively to this country. That position can be changed again, and I know community sentiment is shifting to stop this cruelty now.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:49):  by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga which took place from 25 June to 2 July last year. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the document.


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document. 


I am pleased to present the delegation report. I want first of all to thank my colleagues who formed that delegation, starting with my friend and colleague Senator Williams. The delegation also included Mr Steve Georganas, the member for Hindmarsh, and Mr Milton Dick, the member for Oxley. I particularly want to thank the delegation secretary, Mr Gerry McInally, who, as is the way with the secretaries who accompany parliamentary delegations, was excellent in his work, in his support for the delegation and in making sure that all the right doors were opened. I also want to thank the international and parliamentary relations element of this parliament for their support and to thank those who assisted us both in Kiribati and in Tonga. The delegation's visit was organised and supported by the Australian parliament's International and Parliamentary Relations Office. They, as any senators who have ever been on a delegation will know, do a wonderful job, as do the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The delegation, during most of its meetings, was accompanied by DFAT officers stationed at Kiribati and Tonga. The professionalism, knowledge and guidance of these officers were very much appreciated by every member of the delegation.


I also particularly want to express the delegation's thanks to the Australian high commission staff who assisted the delegation—in particular, in Kiribati, the Australian high commissioner, His Excellency Mr Bruce Cowled, and the first secretary and consul, Ms Kate Chamley, and, in Tonga, the Australian high commissioner, His Excellency Mr Andrew Ford, and the deputy high commissioner, Ms Rhona McPhee. I should as well thank the government officials and staff in both Kiribati and Tonga for their welcome and the way they dealt with the delegation.


Time is short. I just want to mention two things. I was delighted to see in Kiribati that, as a result of a lot of good work by Australia over many years past, particularly in the fishing area, Kiribati have really turned their budget around and they have now increased their revenue to around $200 million a year from selling their licences for day-long fishing to commercial fishermen. This accounts for some 70 per cent of Kiribati's annual income. Australia had a big part to play in setting up the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, with the Australian Pacific Patrol Boat Program, which assists very much in the monitoring of foreign fishing vessels in Kiribati waters, and also the Central Pacific vessel monitoring system, which again Australia had a lot to do with setting up, a decade or so ago. It was a wonderful visit and it was great to see some of the major battlegrounds of the Second World War in the Pacific. 


On Tonga, the report says it all. I encourage people who are interested in those islands or Australian support there to read the delegation report. It was a very full program in Tonga. I just want to mention one thing that I don't think is mentioned in the report. On the last day that we were there, the high commissioner invited the delegation—unfortunately I was the only one who could make the travel arrangements to do this—to go and see the most significant thing that has happened in Tonga, I'm sure, for 10 years, and that was the annual rugby union match between Tonga and their archrivals from Samoa. I'm pleased to say, and I claim credit for the fact that the Australians were there in some presence with the high commission staff, that Tonga actually won that game; they hadn't done it before. Football diplomacy is very, very big in PNG and in the Pacific. It was great to be part of that, as well as all of the other very significant things we did, which are reported in the delegation's report. I recommend the report to the Senate.

Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:55):  I would like to contribute to Senator Macdonald's tabling of the report. I thank him for his leadership and friendship. Mr Dick and Mr Georganas were also on that trip.


There is a lot we can do to help the Pacific region. In Kiribati, they have some serious problems.




Senator Rhiannon:
  Do something about climate change! That's what you should do!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Are they going to be quiet? We'll ignore the Greens, won't we, Madam Acting Deputy President? So we won't get on to all the coal-fired power stations being built. We're not going to change the world. I just want to say this. They import a lot of their vegetables and fruit and, by the time they get there by ship, they're not that fresh. I think we could help them by showing them how to grow hydroponic food. I've talked to Minister Fierravanti-Wells about this. It would be a great assistance. Also, it's something small to us but big to them.


When we met with the health minister at the main hospital, at Tarawa—a hospital that caters for 50,000 people—they had just one wheelchair. I came back and spoke to friends, including Bob Neich, a great member of the Rotary Club in Inverell, a good member of the National Party too, and a good friend, I might add. He rounded up the wheelchairs, fully reconditioned, in Sydney, and in January they were sent over to Tarawa. The health minister accepted four wheelchairs, fully reconditioned by Rotary. It's something small, but now they have five wheelchairs at their hospital. We had a container go over there.


We need to help them grow food because they are importing so much food and it's just not fresh. Of course, there are other things they could do there. I'm sure Senator Macdonald was as amazed as I was: there's a real problem with litter and rubbish. There are car bodies everywhere, as well as nappies and rubbish.


I was very pleased to be part of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Hanoi, Vietnam, a couple of weeks ago. On the agenda for next year we should put: cleaning up the Pacific. There's no reason we couldn't clean it up. Look at Singapore. Singapore is renowned for its cleanliness. Don't throw the rubbish out for it to blow into the ocean. Don't throw it on the streets or whatever. We can do a lot to clean up the Pacific. We can do a lot more in Australia to do exactly that. As a former South Australian, I'm very aware of rubbish. The Keep South Australia Beautiful campaign is very successful.


The best thing we could do for the people in the Pacific is help them to grow food and grow their industries. Samoa has so much potential to grow coffee. The second-most demanded commodity in the world after oil is coffee, yet they have thousands of acres not being utilised. We could help them do that. I've tried to do exactly that over many years with little success, I can tell you. I'd like to see the government put about $500,000 forward, get an expert in hydroponics and set up a hydroponics system—not a big one but a good one to show the people at Kiribati how they can grow their vegetables. They're lacking land. We are fortunate in Australia and have plenty of land. Per capita, there are probably more acres of land than any other country in the world. I think we can help them immensely. They are great people. They were great hosts. I thank DFAT, the ambassadors and the high commissioners.


The Tongan people are also wonderful. As Senator Macdonald said, the rugby union match between Samoa and Tonga was a real highlight. I have seen two religions in the Pacific: one is Christianity and the other is rugby union, and I enjoy both of them very much. I wish them well. I hope we can continue to help our Pacific neighbours in any way we can. I thank Senator Macdonald for his leadership and his friendship on the tour.


Question agreed to.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2018-02-06,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (18:01):  I move: 


That the Senate take note of the document. 


Last December, the Senate passed a most important motion calling on the Commonwealth, the Turnbull government, to respond to a whole number of issues to do with the Williamtown contamination. There was one very important aspect to it that set out that they needed to address the financial impacts on businesses and individuals.


The report is deeply shocking. It really shows how out of touch this government is. It's really quite ruthless and it's uncaring. It is also the latest insult from the Turnbull government. The report is vacuous. It goes for a few pages, but there is nothing of use there for the people of Williamtown. After looking at it you came to the conclusion that the Turnbull government has given up on working to solve the Williamtown crisis, which it has created, arising from the contamination coming from the RAAF base. When we debate this we need to remember that. The Department of Defence has admitted total liability for the toxic run-off that has been polluting that area for years.


A little bit of history underlines how shocking this report is. We found out publicly about the contamination in 2015, but through estimates questioning we came to realise that, in fact, the department had known for much longer but had not told the public. Then there was an inquiry we were able to get set up in 2015. But at every stage, the government has not done the right thing by the people of Williamtown. One of the things that is so shocking is that contamination continues to pour off the base. This is a base that's incredibly important for Australia's defence: $900 million has been put into this base to upgrade it for the Joint Strike Fighter planes. 


I've been to the Williamtown area on many occasions, and often the locals have said to me: 'Just one of those planes would allow us to get our lives back on track.' What they mean is that if the government didn't go ahead with buying all the Joint Strike Fighters—just gave up on one—but put the money into the needs of the people of Williamtown, they could pay compensation or buy out the properties of people who have been told that they can't eat their vegetables and shouldn't sell their cattle or, if they were running a business, whose business may have collapsed. If people want to sell up, they can't, because property values have crashed.


A humane and caring government would work with these people to either help address their immediate concerns so they can stay there, because some want to. But in the case of those in the red zone, which has been identified as the most contaminated, it would work with them so they could get out, but there has been nothing. It would be the decent thing to do.


This report is disgraceful. The closest we get to any details about the financial impacts is where the government lists a number of banks and financial institutions that its task force has met with. There is nothing about the details of those meetings. There is no information about any recommendations. All it offers us is more excuses—excuses that try to make out that maybe this contamination isn't that bad for your health after all. This goes against much of the United Nations work and international health studies that have identified various cancers linked with this contamination.


Another thing adding to the stress of the local people is that the contamination hasn't stopped coming off the base. One of the things that is so extraordinary is that action hasn't been taken to clean up the pollution on the base itself. Now, I acknowledge it's difficult to manage this. It's a water-soluble chemical. It gets into the water. It gets into the soil. It is dispersed quickly. The knowledge and the ability is there to contain it and then treat this area, but that hasn't been done. Meanwhile, this base has been given a massive upgrade for the Joint Strike Fighter pilots. What a contrast it is. This becomes a state-of-the-art base to wage war while the local people's lives are being devastated. And 'devastated' is not a strong enough word. Today's report has added more uncertainty, more insecurity, more sadness and more loss of hope. That is what the government has delivered with the report before us today. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (19:11):  I rise to continue my remarks which I commenced just before question time today with regard to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. In my opening remarks today I indicated that there were serious concerns about what the government were attempting with this bill. The sector seems to be quite happy to have a modesty skirt, basically, to protect them from proper scrutiny. I want to repeat a couple of the remarks from Choice, who didn't describe it as a 'bear that had any teeth'—in fact, they said it was more of a 'teddy bear' as a piece of legislation. I think that's absolutely the case. 


If we go immediately to some of the details of what this bill does in terms of setting out the accountability obligations of authorised deposits-taking institutions—which for most people generally means banks—we see that this is what they're saying banks should do: 'A bank must take reasonable steps to conduct its business with honesty and integrity and with due skill, care and diligence.' I'm waiting for that to settle, because I can't understand why we're stating that in a bill here. That should well and truly already be the case. If that's one of the goals of this piece of legislation, it just shows you how desperately bad things are in the sector. ADIs must take reasonable steps to deal with APRA in an open, constructive and cooperative way. For those who might be listening to this debate and who don't know what APRA is, they're the government authority that makes sure that banks and other major institutions that have fiduciary responsibilities are doing the right thing. This is supposed to make the banks open, constructive and cooperative with APRA. This accountability obligation that's supposed to come in now is a far cry from what people have expected their banks should be doing all the time. What we see just in those two elements of this bill is an important part of why it should exist. It just goes to show how desperately bad the cultural practices of our banks are.


I want to indicate clearly that Labor is not going to stand in the way of this legislation, but, my goodness, it's a low, low bar that has been set by this piece of legislation: 'Naughty banks! You should play nice with APRA. You should be open and transparent.' It's just really not good enough. We know that the Labor Party, for a very long time, has been very concerned about systemic, structural and cultural issues that are facing the banking and financial services sectors. During the course of the Senate inquiry that was held into this bill, evidence was not provided to the contrary. The evidence that was received indicated that, if this BEAR legislation—the legislation that is before the parliament today for debate and that perhaps will be voted on tomorrow—had been in place, it probably wouldn't have had the impact required to change the banking practices and outcomes. 


We know that more needs to be done, because there have been a multitude of banking scandals. We seem to be hearing about them on an almost weekly basis. Labor has been calling for this government to take seriously the entrenched issues in this sector by having a proper royal commission, in which the terms of reference are very, very carefully considered, where everybody who could be significantly affected—everybody who is a key stakeholder in this—has a say. But, in the hasty way that this government finally caved and delivered a form of a banking royal commission, we saw consultation with a very limited group of people. The banks in particular featured prominently in the consultations that were undertaken. So, after 600 days of delay, instead of a genuine royal commission that could do a proper job, we have this weak piece of legislation. Instead of having a proper royal commission, we've got the banking royal commission that the banks would like to have. We've got the banking royal commission that the banks are willing to have. Banks—we hear them all the time—ANZ, NAB, Commonwealth, Westpac—they've been mentioned by all of my colleagues who've participated in this debate, including Senator Williams and yourself, Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson.


We have a big problem. The Australian people know it. And we need to have a higher bar set by this government in terms of dealing with that problem. Despite the fact that we're having the banking royal commission that the banks were willing to have, the Prime Minister's reaction to his own announcement of the royal commission was to label it as a 'regrettable' thing. He said it was a regrettable thing to actually have to go and inquire into the banks, which have been so prominently featured in our media impacting terribly on people's lives. 


Senator Williams and I have been on the joint parliamentary committee into financial services and superannuation for several years, and we've seen an awful lot come before us. We have heard some incredibly sad stories. And I know that the senator's spoken to many people offline. I think of one story at the Storm Financial hearing that we had in Melbourne. I recall a gentleman sitting at the end of a row of people who came to give testimony about the impact of terrible practices within banking and financial services provision. He was speaking about what it was like for him to feel like he had lost everything—the shame, the burden of failure. He talked about how he drove out and sat under the flight path of planes at Melbourne Airport and considered taking his own life. This is the reality of a failure of culture in our banks; exploitation of people has become a model of operation for profit-making by those with power and agency. 


It's not good enough that this piece of legislation is mucking around at the edges. What's even worse is that we're subjected to a royal commission that is inadequate in its terms of reference. What sort of terms of reference can you possibly get when your process of consultation has ignored the victims of the banking sector—like the man I just spoke about who gave evidence in Storm Financial, like the people who have stood up for all the managed investment schemes where they were exploited, and people like Jeff Morris, who stood up about CommInsure? Those whistleblowers, those people who have been working in the banks trying to get their message through—

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  Although there remain cynics out there, the reality is everyone loves a wedding—especially a royal wedding. A wedding is one of the most significant milestones in anyone's life, and an anniversary allows a couple to step back from the daily grind and relive a moment that changed their lives forever. The anniversary of a royal wedding allows us all to reflect on the significance of this moment and how our lives have been changed. 


When Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh married in Westminster Abbey in 1947, during the period of postwar austerity, Winston Churchill called the wedding 'a flash of colour on the long road we have to travel.' On 20 November last year, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are the first British monarch and consort to reach this remarkable historical milestone. The Queen acknowledged this in her Christmas broadcast as she reflected on significant events visited upon Britain over the last 12 months, including the Grenfell Tower fire and Manchester attack. She said:


Reflecting on these events makes me grateful for the blessings of home and family and, in particular, for 70 years of marriage. I don't know that anyone had invented the term 'platinum' for a 70th wedding anniversary. When I was born, you weren't expected to be around that long.


Even Prince Philip has decided it's time to slow down a little, having, as he economically put it, done his bit. But I know his support and unique sense of humour will remain as strong as ever as we enjoy spending time this Christmas with our family, and look forward to welcoming new members into it next year.


So the Queen reflected in her most recent Christmas broadcast.


Seventy years since they wed, the Commonwealth continues to survive, and the Queen remains head of state of 16 of its 53 countries. The monarchy remains the only national institution that still commands widespread and instinctive respect. For over 70 years, the Queen has kept the pledge she so memorably made on her 21st birthday in Cape Town to devote her whole life to the service of her subjects. She has been immeasurably fortunate that, for seven decades, the Duke of Edinburgh has been so steadfast in his support and undoubted affection for her. This support has been crucial in positioning the monarchy as a beacon of stability in what is a world of increasing complexity and turmoil. I join with my fellow Australians and the Commonwealth in paying tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh on the celebration of their 70th wedding anniversary in the November just passed. I congratulate Her Majesty and His Royal Highness on this remarkable achievement, which continues to be the longest royal marriage known in history.


Later this year, the Queen celebrates another significant milestone: the 65th anniversary of her coronation. At the age of 25, following the death of her father, King George VI, the Queen ascended to the throne. It was on this very day, in fact, 66 years ago. More than a year later, on 2 June 1953, the coronation ceremony took place. The Queen may not be considered a ground breaker by some, but her innovation should be acknowledged at this historical juncture. Her coronation was the first to be televised, but it was only so because Her Majesty did not take the advice of her then-Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and other members of the British cabinet, who were against the idea. In the United Kingdom alone, the coronation was watched by 27 million people and of course millions more around the world. The ceremony lasted almost three hours and was comprised of six parts: the recognition, the oath, the anointing, the investiture, the enthronement and the homage.


It is important, I believe, to better understand the ritual, history and religious and political significance of the act of the coronation, an event that has taken place at Westminster Abbey for over 900 years. The monarchy represents evolution and continuity. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II is the longest-serving sovereign in the history of the British crown. That alone is worthy of great celebration. Long may she reign.
