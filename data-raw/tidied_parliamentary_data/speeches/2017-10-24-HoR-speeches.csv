Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security and Minister for Defence Personnel) (12:01):  I ask leave of the House to provide a ministerial statement in response to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's report on the inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The constant battle: suicide by veterans.


Leave granted.




Mr TEHAN:
  As all Australians know, one suicide is one too many. Tragically, suicide affects all areas of our community—around seven Australians a day will tragically take their own life and it remains the greatest cause of death for men between the ages of 14 and 44.


Veterans and members of our Australian Defence Force (ADF) are sadly not immune. In the latest official figures available from the Australian institute of health and wellbeing (AIHW), which I have detailed to the parliament, between 2001 and 2015, 325 veterans took their own lives. Sadly, the number is increasing over time. In 2014, the figure was 31. In 2015, this rose to 33.


The government is committed to addressing suicide in our community. We must understand that everyone including the government has a role to play if we are to address the incidence of suicide in Australia.


The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's report on the inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, The constant battle: suicide by veterans, was tabled in parliament on 15 August 2017. The work of the committee in preparing this report has been significant and the government has carefully considered all recommendations that it made. The committee report states:


… the aspirational target rate for suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel should be zero. However, it would be misleading to represent that the recommendations in this report will achieve that goal. Any effective measures to decrease the rate of suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel will require a long-term multifaceted approach involving government, business, non-government and ex-service organisations and the wider Australian community. Change is likely—


to—


take a substantial period of time.


Today, I table the government's response and outline the measures that will be put in place to reduce suicide and self-harm in the veteran community.


The government has agreed to all of the recommendations made by the committee. Today I announce a package of $31.0 million and provide new programs that will deliver better support for veterans and their families.




Jesse Bird—
r
eview



Through its work in its inquiry, the Senate committee has drawn on many individual stories. As the committee notes in the report, 'Bereaved widows, partners, parents, friends and advocates have shared stories which have often ended in tragic loss.' Sadly, the government has seen examples where the current support services were not good enough. 


One such veteran was Jesse Bird. With the approval of his family, today I will show how Jesse's case highlights the need for us to continue to improve the current system. Jesse Bird took his own life on 27 June this year, at the age of 32. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge his parents, Karen and John Bird, his siblings, Brendan, Kate and David, and their partners, who I have gotten to know since Jesse's regrettable death. I would also like to acknowledge his extended family and extensive network of friends, many of which he served with in the ADF. I would like to reiterate my commitment to them that this government will continue to drive the reforms necessary to improve the support and care available to veterans and reduce the risk of suicide in the veteran community.


Jesse joined the Australian Army as a rifleman in 2007. His family remembers him as 'an elite-level athlete, booming with charisma and self-confidence and proud to be a member of the ADF'. In 2009, Jesse deployed on Operation Slipper to Afghanistan. There he faced the challenging and dangerous nature of service. On 18 July 2009, a close friend of Jesse's was killed in an improvised explosive incident. Jesse returned to Australia in 2010 and in 2012 he voluntarily discharged from the Army. 


Following Jesse's discharge, he faced the challenges of transition back into civilian life. Due to physical injuries and the deterioration of Jesse's mental health with the impact of PTSD during his time in the Army, Jesse found it increasingly difficult to find meaningful work that gave him the sense of purpose he had during his time serving in the ADF. Departmental processes failed or simply did not exist to offer services to help Jesse. While struggling with all this, Jesse decided to end his life. 


Jesse's case highlights the complexity and breadth of the challenge the Department of Veterans' Affairs faces to support our veterans, particularly those with mental health conditions as a result of their service. These Australians have risked themselves in the service of our country. If these people are not receiving the support they need, then we must continue to drive change. 


Following Jesse Bird' s death, I asked the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence and the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service to thoroughly examine his case. They have conducted a review which looked at his experience with Defence and Veterans' Affairs. This occurred in consultation with his family. 


I delivered a report on this investigation to Jesse's family on 15 September. Amongst other findings, the report into the management of Jesse Bird's case shows that, while some aspects of process and management were within expectations, others were contrary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs policy and practice. The Department of Veterans' Affairs either did not or could not provide the support or proactive engagement Jesse needed. 


In particular, the report highlighted the issue of providing timely compensation and financial assistance to support those veterans suffering mental health conditions. The requirement for mental health conditions to be stable before being considered for compensation needs to be addressed. In addition, the provision of financial assistance when veterans are at their most vulnerable is needed. These issues let Jesse down as he was unable to get financial assistance when he needed it. 


The report identified 19 recommendations, which I have accepted on behalf of the government and will table today. Many of these align with recommendations put forward by the Senate committee. These recommendations include priority actions to improve current processes and practices in DVA and progressing initiatives already being considered as part of the Veteran Centric Reform program. The implementation of the recommendations will be independently reviewed after 12 months.


It is the government's commitment to address the shortfalls identified by this investigation and to put in place urgent changes in the provision of support to our veterans, especially those who are vulnerable or at risk. These veterans must have their claims assessed quickly and have case managers to assist them during what can be a difficult process.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs has apologised to the Bird family for the way in which its processes failed their son and brother. Today I put that apology on the public record. The Department of Veterans' Affairs apologises to the Bird family and to Jesse's extended family and friends.


In examining what happened to Jesse Bird, we have developed plans together that will change Defence and Veterans' Affairs. The lessons from Jesse's case have helped inform the government's response to the Senate committee's report. I want to assure Mr and Mrs Bird and Jesse's family and friends that the government is committed to making that change happen.




The Senate report



The Senate committee has made 24 recommendations in its report. These recommendations ask that the government undertake a number of different reviews and policy changes to address veterans and defence personnel mental health and suicide prevention.


Firstly, the committee has recommended that the government undertake wide-ranging reviews of its processes in Defence and Veterans' Affairs. Amongst others, the committee recommended that the Productivity Commission should review the legislative framework of compensation and rehabilitation and review other arrangements in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The government has accepted the recommendations and will ask the Productivity Commission to undertake this review. The Treasurer and I will develop the terms of reference for this review, which will be open to submissions from all Australians. 


The government also accepts the committee's recommendation that the Australian National Audit Office conduct a review into the efficiency of veterans service delivery by DVA and will write to the Auditor-General to request to include this review in the 2017-18 program of work.


In its report, the committee identified a number of measures that the departments of defence and veterans' affairs should implement without the need for review. They included recommendations that: 


the departments align the provision of mental health care; 


the Career Transition Assistance Scheme include an option for external work experience for veterans;


ADF members are provided DVA white cards on discharge; and


a two-track program be developed for ADF members leaving Defence. 


The government welcomes these recommendations and agrees to implement them. Many are already being implemented.


Throughout the inquiry, the committee covered a number of issues relating to the current functions of DVA. To address this, the committee has provided a number of recommendations. Firstly, the committee has recommended a continuation of the Veteran Centric Reform program in DVA, while also providing resources to alleviate claims times and resolve complex cases. This is consistent with the government's commitment in this year's budget, which provided over $160 million to veteran centric reform. It represents the largest investment in the department in over a decade.


The committee has also recommended that the government establish a formal bureau of veterans' advocates with the capacity to commission legal representation and training for veterans advocates. There is an opportunity to improve the regulation of veterans advocacy to increase quality and consistency of services to veterans. The government agrees with the committee in principle that the current advocacy system needs to change. We will consider the committee's recommendation for a bureau of veterans' advocates alongside other advocacy models and will consult the veteran community about future directions in veteran advocacy.


Most importantly, the committee has identified measures that can help us provide support to those who need it today. The government knows that mental health treatments work best when intervention is early. That is why we have put in place a system that provides free and immediate treatment for all mental health conditions for anyone with one day's full-time service in the military. 


As the committee noted, 'there was almost universal praise from stakeholders regarding the extension of non-liability health care for all mental health conditions.' This reform over the past 18 months has been revolutionary. It has meant treatment for veterans without the need to prove it was linked to service, cutting the administration and processing burden.


However, the committee has recommended the expansion of a number of services and systems to support this: (1) the development of specific suicide prevention programs targeted towards at-risk groups and a pilot of a case management service for at-risk veterans; (2) the expansion of online engagement with younger veterans; and (3) the funding of a trial program to provide assistance animals for veterans with PTSD. I am pleased to say that work on these recommendations has begun or is about to begin.


Finally, the committee recommended that the government should maintain a national veteran suicide register. The government commissioned the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to provide the first accurate, robust data ever produced on suicide among the serving and ex-serving populations. This data was published last year. The government has asked the AIHW to continue to independently track this data. 


To achieve all the committee's recommendations, the government will put forward a package of $31 million. This package will include: 


a new veteran payment;


extended support for veterans' families;


GP health assessments for the first five years post discharge;


a case management pilot; and


a scoping study to professionalise veterans' advocacy.


This package is part of around $550 million of new programs and money this government has provided over the last 18 months to veterans and their families.




Conclusion



In closing, I want to reiterate to the entire Australian Defence Force and ex-service community that this government will continue to prioritise mental health support for our veterans.


Please remember, help is available. Help can make a difference. If you, your family, or friends are worried about how you are coping or feeling, please reach out. The Defence All-hours Support Line, VVCS and Lifeline are there for you at any time of the day or night.


The government would like to thank the senators who participated in this inquiry and the secretariat. In particular it would like to thank the work of the chair, Senator Alex Gallacher, and the deputy chairs, Dr Chris Back and Senator Bridget McKenzie.


The government would like to thank the individuals and organisations who made a submission to the inquiry or gave evidence at the public hearings for their contribution to this important issue. Their evidence helped shape this report and will add further to the government's understanding of how to serve veterans and their families.


As the Prime Minister has said, in this Centenary of Anzac period, we best honour the diggers of a century ago by caring for the current and former service men and women of today. I thank the House.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (12:17):  The mental health and suicide of our current and ex-serving Defence personnel has received considerable attention in recent times, and rightfully so. Serving in the Australian Defence Force involves sacrifice and risk and, in exchange for this risk, we commit to supporting our personnel both during their time in Defence and beyond.


While many will leave Defence having gained much from the experience and view their time and contribution positively, for some their time in the ADF and their subsequent transition back into civilian life can have a negative impact on their mental health. Mental illness can be an impact of war and service and, without effective support and treatment, the impact on the veteran and their support network can be significant. The Senate inquiry report into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, which was handed down in August, both makes a vital contribution to our understanding of the issues facing veterans and proposes solutions which seek to provide greater support for veterans and their families.


In conjunction with this inquiry, today, as the minister has stated, we have the outcome of the review into the suicide of Jesse Bird. This inquiry initiated a review into the management of the handling of Jesse Bird's case by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and demonstrates the very real and potentially tragic results if we don't get this process right.


Jesse was a private with the Townsville 1RAR infantry battalion who proudly served for eight months on the front line in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. While serving, he was exposed to significant trauma which resulted in him leaving Defence. Following his time in Defence, it is clear from reports that there were many factors which resulted in Jesse not receiving or accessing the care and support he needed. Tragically, he took his own life on 27 June 2017.


I welcome the minister and the government's accepting all 19 recommendations of the review into the circumstances surrounding Jesse Bird's case. I firmly believe that the report and subsequent outcomes have happened because of the advocacy and persistence of both Karen and John Bird. I can't imagine the strength and bravery it took, so recently after his passing under such difficult circumstances, for them to advocate on Jesse's behalf to ensure that his death was recognised and not forgotten, and also that steps would be taken so that other veterans would not be let down in the future.


I spoke to Karen Bird last night, and she asked me to put on the record thanks to a number of people who have supported both her and her husband during this difficult time. She wanted me to mention Jesse's brother, Brendan, and Jesse's sister, Kate. She also wanted me to mention Inge Stainlay, Don and Annie Brealey, the Exton family and Michael Atkin, from the ABC, who she said treated their story seriously. Also she wanted to make mention of the support she had had from the wider veterans community. This was invaluable to her.


As members may be aware, both Jesse's family and his ex-partner made submissions to the Senate inquiry process detailing some of their concerns and experience with DVA. Their submissions form part of the 458 submissions the Senate inquiry received from peak bodies, ex-service organisations, advocates and individual veterans and their loved ones detailing how their experiences post their time in the ADF had impacted them.


I understand that the government has accepted all of these recommendations, noting that there will be some work still to be done around the detail of several of these recommendations. Labor look forward to continuing our discussions with the government on how best to implement all of these recommendations. Labor believe that one suicide of a veteran is one too many, and we will continue to do all we can to ensure that veterans receive the care and support to live full and productive lives both during and after their time with the ADF.


This past year has seen a number of studies on the mental health of our current and ex-serving Defence personnel released, all of which form a picture of the impact of mental illness on our ADF members and veterans. Earlier this year, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare completed a study into the incidence of suicide amongst serving and ex-serving Australian Defence Force personnel and found that, while serving members had a lower than average suicide rate, the concern was when they finished their service. The risk of suicide is 13 per cent higher than the general population in those who have left service. They also found that veterans aged between 18 and 24 were twice as likely to die by suicide. In addition, men—and I say 'men' because that is what the statistics were able to show—who were discharged involuntarily were 2.4 times as likely as those who were discharged voluntarily to commit suicide, and those who were discharged for medical reasons were 3.6 times more likely to die from suicide.


The Senate inquiry into veterans' affairs initiated by Senator Lambie and supported by Labor sought to highlight the struggles that some veterans and their families undergo following their time in the Australian Defence Force. For too long there has been a stigma around mental illness and suicide, particularly for our ex-serving personnel. This has meant that some veterans have been reluctant to ask for help, leaving them feeling isolated and often alone. Overcoming stigma is integral to ensuring that those suffering know they can talk about how they're feeling and to preventing tragedies like this from occurring.


I have no doubt in my mind that, for some of those who made submissions to the Senate inquiry, it was the first time that they had disclosed their experiences widely and, in some cases, at all. I want to affirm to each and every submitter to this inquiry: you were heard; you are not alone; and thank you for your contribution. Thank you for taking the time to tell your story. It is your strength that has made this inquiry as productive and useful as it is, a thorough, detailed and expansive discourse that highlights the struggles that some people are experiencing post their time in the ADF but, importantly, a pathway to improving this experience.


The report made 24 recommendations which seek to provide greater assistance to veterans and deal with longstanding administrative issues in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Overwhelmingly, this inquiry and the Jessie Bird report highlight that there are significant ongoing issues in the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the impact this can have on a veteran's mental health. I recognise that the government has taken steps to address these issues. In particular, I want to draw the House's attention to recommendations 2, 9 and 13 of the suicide inquiry, which sought to address the compensation claims process, the training of staff and the provision of service to veterans. This does echo feedback that I consistently receive in my work with veterans and the ex-service community.


The long and overly complicated and adversarial nature of the claims process for some veterans has been raised with me time and time again. Several submitters highlighted these issues, describing the DVA claims process as 'challenging and weighing heavily upon one's mental health and wellbeing, generally at a time when one is at an extremely low ebb'. Several recommendations do seek to address this point, whether it be through reviews or streamlining administrative processes, and Labor is certainly supportive of these. Prior to the last election, Labor sought to resolve these issues by undertaking a first principles review of Veterans' Affairs. Our proposal for a first principles review was a holistic end-to-end review of the department based on a set of agreed first principles. The review would examine the department and seek to rectify administrative process failings to ensure the department is able to meet existing and future challenges in a clear and efficient manner. Most importantly, this review would help to re-establish the trust of veterans and their representative organisations in the DVA.


As noted in the Senate inquiry, transition can be a difficult time when some ex-service personnel can fall through the cracks. This was a focus of a number of the other recommendations, with a number of submitters highlighting how the period of transition can impact individuals and families. How to prepare for discharge is different for each person, with the needs varying significantly for those who are medically discharged or leave involuntarily. The committee highlighted the importance of transition, stating that the appropriate support is essential to assist ADF members' transition to civilian life. Recommendation 14 called for the transition task force to examine and address gaps to support veterans, barriers to employment and any disincentives for veterans undertaking work and study. Following on from this, in recommendation 15 the Senate inquiry called for the establishment of a two-track transition process which provides additional support for those who need it and the provision of a white card for all transitioning members to facilitate access to non-liability health and for identification and data collection. This is something Labor has supported for some time and we are very pleased that the government has accepted that recommendation.


Transition is a critical juncture in life for a veteran and their family. If not undertaken well, it can lead to worse outcomes for them and their loved ones. Finding a purpose post Defence is a key element to a successful transition. What that purpose looks like is different for each individual and can be a direct result of their reasons for discharge. For some, it is about ensuring continuity of care in regard to rehabilitation. For some, it is about exploring social and other connectedness. For others, it is about moving to further study or finding meaningful employment. Whatever that purpose may be, we should be working with the individual and their family to ensure that the best outcome and support is available for veterans and their loved ones.


Support for families was an issue raised by a number of submitters, with many acknowledging the role families play in supporting our ex-service personnel. This was reflected in recommendations 19 and 22. I was pleased to see that this report addressed the need for greater support for family members. The critical role of family members in supporting our current and ex-serving Defence personnel is often not acknowledged or appreciated by society as much as it should be. When an individual serves in the ADF, their family serves with them. Military families make sacrifices. We know that many service men and women are deployed internationally for months at a time, with this separation causing emotional stress for partners and children; and, when personnel are not deployed, there are regular re-postings to different bases around the country, meaning they have to choose between uprooting their whole family and living apart for a period of time. Post-service, particularly in the circumstances where someone is medically discharged, the impact can be significant and ongoing. When someone is medically discharged, it is often the family who become their carers. It is the family who help and support them. It is often the family who can identify those first signs of mental illness. It is also the family who often can recognise the signs and symptoms of poor physical health. But they need support too, and this was highlighted by a number of submitters to the inquiry. One submitter, a Vietnam veteran, stated that we need to go one step further with support, and that step is family support, saying: 'Without the support of parents, spouses and children, the veteran cannot get anywhere. If you lose family support, you are lost.'


I believe, by not including families in our greater policy response to supporting our ADF personnel, we are ignoring our biggest asset in assisting members of the ADF and veterans. It is for this reason that Labor has recently committed, if elected, to develop a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans, a key recommendation of the National Mental Health Commission's review. This strategy would provide a national blueprint to include engagement of DVA and Defence with military families. It would also ensure that best-practice support for families of serving personnel and ex-ADF members is consistently available across the country.


In closing, I would like to sincerely thank all of the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for the work they've done on this important bipartisan inquiry. In particular, I acknowledge Senator Lambie for initiating this inquiry and the consistently hard work of Senator Gallacher, as the chair, and of the deputy chairs, Chris Back and Bridget McKenzie. I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for being willing to work in a bipartisan way on this report. And I thank all those who put their hearts on their sleeves and were willing to contribute to this inquiry. Finally, I give a thankyou to Karen and John Bird. I hope the review of Jesse's case and the subsequent changes that the government has committed to will bring you some comfort. I commend this report to the House.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (12:34):  I move:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to:


(1) abandon its support of the decision of the Fair Work Commission to cut penalty rates because it will mean nearly 700,000 Australians will have their take home pay cut by up to $77 a week; and


(2) legislate to prevent the decision from taking effect to stop Australians from having their penalty rates cut"".


I rise to oppose the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 and speak in favour of the amendment. It is fair to say that this is a very considerable bill, as far as its size is concerned. The first I saw of this proposed piece of legislation was Thursday, last week. The bill has 80 pages and, of course, has an accompanying explanatory memorandum. There was no consultation with the opposition before it was introduced into this place last Thursday. A whole range of issues arise from the proposed provisions of the bill that the opposition will want to examine. I want to thank the department, which yesterday briefed my office and me on the bill, but that has led to as many questions as answers. No doubt there'll be a chance for the Senate committee to examine this bill, but, nonetheless, there are some things I want to put on the record. As I say, at this point the federal opposition is not in a position to support the legislation.


The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 was introduced in the House last Thursday. This bill has five schedules and runs to 80 pages. It amends five pieces of legislation: the Fair Work Act 2009, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Tax Administration Act 1953. It has significant implications for unions and employer bodies, some of which will only be able to be identified following detailed examination of the technical provisions of this bill. It has significant implications for workers who benefit from their entitlements being protected through these funds and from the counselling, training, occupational health and safety and support services that those funds invest in. Notwithstanding this, we would contend that the government is rushing this bill through the parliament without proper scrutiny and without sufficient stakeholder consultation, and that's unfortunate. If the government wants to work with the opposition to improve laws in this area of public policy or, for that matter, any area of public policy, it would do well to consult and seek to find common ground rather than just expeditiously introduce legislation of this significance without that consultation and engagement.


I understand that, with the support of the Nick Xenophon Team, the government defeated Labor's attempts to have a thorough Senate employment committee inquiry, which would have examined the bill over several months. Instead, a reporting date of 10 November this year was imposed. We would argue that sets a very difficult time line for stakeholders to prepare submissions and present evidence. The time line for submissions is coming up, so there was very, very little time for stakeholders and affected parties in general to cooperate and produce submissions for that inquiry. We just note that that's characteristic of this minister, who doesn't seem to know what the word 'engagement' means.


The government's purpose is to use this bill to limit the legitimate activities and sources of income of employer bodies and unions. Partly, I think, that's a result of them not understanding the genesis of worker entitlement funds, their history and the important service they provide thousands and thousands of workers in this country. The minister's press release claims:


Through cosy deals with big businesses, unions have become a big business in their own right and more focused on making profits than representing people.


I would argue that that's unmitigated rubbish. Worker entitlement funds—which, by the way, are jointly established by unions, employer bodies and employers—operate firstly to ensure that workers' entitlements are protected, and secondly to provide important services to workers such as, as I said earlier, training, counselling support, suicide prevention, and funding of OH&S officers, just to name a few.


We think that it would have been useful if there had been a genuine engagement with those affected to consider the history of the funds and what purpose they serve, and to give a brief history of some of the funds. Some of these funds were set up decades ago, and were set up arising out of genuine complaints about phoenixing companies—that is, companies that were not paying entitlements and were winding up, avoiding obligations to creditors and, in particular, their workers, and then starting up again and maintaining a similar business debt-free. And for that reason and others, employers and unions wanted to provide greater security to their employees and members respectively by allowing such funds to continue and to afford that protection to workers.


The construction industry represents unique safety risks to workers. It is one of the most dangerous industries in this country and is characterised by high levels of worker vulnerability. For example, construction workers face one of the highest risks of injury and death of any industry; the highest level of suicide of any worker group; high levels of labour mobility and insecure work; long periods of unemployment; and high levels of redundancy. One of the funds in the construction industry, Incolink, provides a safety net which protects vulnerable construction workers by investing in workers' training, health, wellbeing and safety to tackle the issues. It is an important fund which brings workers and employers together to solve industry problems.


This bill, it's been put to me, may well have very significant impacts on this and other funds. It would prevent these funds investing in key occupational health and safety initiatives. It is unclear as to whether these funds could continue to subsidise members' insurances such as funeral cover, accident, dental, ambulance, portable sick leave and income protection. If they cannot continue to provide some of these services, I don't doubt that employers will bear the cost because there will be claims in subsequent enterprise negotiations asking employers to pay through those negotiations the shortfall that might arise if we allow for the unfair limitation of the purpose of these funds, which is to provide general protection for working people in the construction industry. Incolink, for example, worked alongside industry associations to establish a program of industry occupational health and safety grants when WorkSafe removed funding for these roles in 2002. Funding these OH&S roles helped to ensure good OH&S practice across the commercial building and construction industry.


That fund invested $4.8 million in 2016-17, I'm advised, to fund the occupational health and safety program. In order to be able to provide a range of additional benefits and support services to workers and their families in the building and construction industry, I'm advised that that fund invests to generate a return. Some of these funds are used to provide important wellbeing services such as supporting workers with mental health and DNA problems; attending critical incidents and providing suicide prevention; funding training for over 16,000 workers per year; counselling over 3,000 workers each year; and undertaking almost 4,000 health checks for workers. These are some of the really important services provided by these funds. If the government came from the view that they wanted to resolve any regulatory matters but understood the importance of the schemes, if they had at least some sense of the importance of consensus that exists in the construction industry with respect to these funds—that this is about workers, their representatives and employers working together to afford protection to workers in the industry—if the Minister for Employment thought through that prism rather than the constant partisan, extreme language that she uses when talking about organised labour, then I think the government would have a different view about these funds and would probably deal with the bill in a different manner.


We'll be looking at the bill to see how it might affect very important services to workers, to see whether in fact there'll be adverse consequences that flow, intentionally or otherwise. The government claims that this bill implements 10 recommendations of the Heydon royal commission. I accept that that may in part be true, but, as we know, that was a discredited royal commission led by a discredited commissioner. He is a former High Court justice but wanted to raise money for the Liberal Party while he was sitting in that position and presiding over the commission's conduct. He tried to deny it. Then he realised: 'I'd better think about this,' and judged that he was not partial and that there was no apparent conflict of interest. He sat in judgement of himself, found himself clear of all allegations and continued to act in that role, even though, if you look at his own judgements as a High Court justice, you would find he was completely contradicting his own reasoning when he was a justice of the High Court. Nonetheless, he proceeded, and that really discredited the findings of the commission. We also know that the commission was a political witch-hunt headed up by the commissioner to whom I just referred, who was willing to attend Liberal Party fundraisers and whose sole aim was to do the government's bidding. Nonetheless, even if the reasoning behind this legislation had a rocky start, we're examining whether some of these provisions are reasonable and would lead to better reporting and better disclosure provisions and whether the penalties are reasonable.


History teaches us that we can't trust this government to introduce legislation that does what it claims and that does not have serious overreach and flawed drafting. Labor will properly and thoroughly examine the provisions of the bill. Accountability, transparency and good governance are important. However, we must be vigilant to ensure that, in the name of these principles, this bill doesn't impose such a heavy regulatory burden that worker entitlement funds are not able to function.


I turn now to the range of matters that are the substance of the bill. The bill would put additional requirements on governance, financial reporting and financial disclosure requirements of worker entitlement funds. It would prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from requiring or permitting contributions to any fund other than a superannuation fund, a registered worker entitlement fund or a registered charity. It would prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from permitting or requiring employee contributions to a union election fund. It would prohibit coercion of employers to pay amounts to a particular worker entitlement fund, superannuation fund, training fund, welfare fund or employee insurance scheme, which is unlawful already. It would put additional financial management and disclosure obligations on registered organisations. It would introduce new penalties for registered organisations' noncompliance with financial management disclosure and reporting requirements.


A 'worker entitlement fund', according to the bill, is defined as 'a fund which is for the purpose or purposes of paying worker entitlements and death benefits'. 'Worker entitlements' are defined as including payments in respect of leave, payments in lieu of leave, payments in relation to termination of employment and any payments that contracts, awards or agreements provide for an employer to make to an employee. A superannuation fund, a registered charity, a discretionary mutual fund, a fund established by state, Commonwealth or territory law, and a fund controlled by a fund member are not included; however, the minister may prescribe additional funds as worker entitlement funds.


Given the conduct of the minister in these matters generally, and the government's intentions to attack unions at every turn, we do have a concern. I can say from the outset, without having it referred to the Senate committee, that the idea that we would allow for a minister to prescribe additional funds and deem them worker entitlement funds is of concern to the opposition. We can imagine in the hands of the current minister what sorts of malevolent acts might be perpetrated upon such funds and, therefore, we are concerned about allowing the minister to have a disallowable instrument—even if it is a disallowable instrument, we're concerned that regulations will allow for the broadening out of the definition of the funds and we will be examining that.


The bill places limits on when a worker entitlement fund can become or stay registered, including what sort of organisation can operate the fund and the make-up of the board of the fund, and the way in which the assets of the fund can be used. The bill also contains provisions that we understand would operate to prohibit enterprise agreements specifying that employers have to pay into training funds. What is the justification for this, given that enterprise agreements are completely transparent? They are voted on by workers, they have to be presented to the Fair Work Commission, the commission has to find that they're fulfilling the requirements of the act, so what would be the need for this potential change to the law? Mr Dyson Heydon conceded that training funds provide a public good. Stakeholders have raised concerns that there's a significant uncertainty about whether worker entitlement funds can continue to provide safety training and wellbeing services, such as suicide prevention support, mental health, and drug and alcohol counselling.


We are concerned about the construction of this bill. These are significant issues. If the government's intention is to stop unions or, indeed, employers from being part of providing these types of services to workers, then we cannot support that proposition. There are too many questions yet to be answered, as I said from the outset, about the details of the bill for Labor to give it support, even qualified support. And, as I also said earlier, I did receive a department briefing. I do appreciate the speed with which the department, with the cooperation of the minister's office I should add, were able to brief me on the bill; however, there were a lot of questions taken on notice. There were a lot of questions—more questions sometimes than answers, which is understandable given the breadth and depth of the bill—and so we are awaiting further information, which I'm sure the department are dutifully considering and I'm sure they will return to us with those answers.


For the record, some of the issues we are concerned about include how do the regulations this bill imposes on registered organisations compare to the regulations in place for corporations? I think that is a very important point. The rhetoric of the government often is that we need to make sure there's a comparable set of arrangements for publicly listed companies on the one hand and registered organisations on the other. They're very different legal personalities, they're very different beasts, but that's the argument put by the government. That's why I never fully understood why the government didn't support Labor's reforms to this area and say that you don't need to establish a registered organisation commission, which I'm sure will have the minister interfering with it every week. I'm sure we'll see more of that soon. That will come to light.


We believe that allegations of serious breaches by officers of registered organisations should be dealt with by ASIC. If you believe that companies and registered organisations should be treated the same or similarly, then surely you would use the same regulator, with a history of regulating such matters and with the capacity to prevent interference by a very interfering minister? ASIC is big enough and ugly enough to resist those interventions by the minister and by this government, who would want to use the Registered Organisations Commission in the same way that they've used the ABCC, which is as their vehicle to attack their political opponents. Strangely enough, I think, whilst they argued that they wanted to treat organisations like corporations, it was Labor who suggested that we actually have ASIC as the regulator, but that was not accepted.


Another question in relation to the bill is: is this bill another layer of regulation over and above what applies already under legislation, such as the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act and the Corporations Act? How do the proposed deregistration schemes compare to what is in place for managed investment schemes? We're particularly concerned that the minister will have the power to flesh out the details of this new regulatory scheme via regulation. We're concerned that we don't know whether in fact there are comparable regulations for corporations, vis-a-vis registered organisations. I think that's an important point given the rhetoric of the government. We think that there is a series of things that we need to do. We're most concerned that the very good work that these funds undertake would be adversely affected by such legislation.


The reason we question the motives of the government is because it spends all of its time obsessing about overregulating, interfering with and attacking unions in this country. A week doesn't seem to go by that we don't have the government introduce another bill in this place seeking to intervene further into the conduct of unions and employer bodies. Employer bodies just happen to be the collateral damage. They're quite happy to damage employer bodies if they can get to the unions. That's what they do; that's their obsession. We saw that with the integrity bill that was introduced some weeks ago, which would have devastating effects upon unions. And we now see that there's another attempt to regulate. We want to make sure that the changes proposed in this bill are in the public interest. We want to make sure that the government, in its attempt to attack unions, doesn't end up damaging the rights of working people.


We do know that the government is very happy to see working people exposed. We do know, through their own history, that the Liberal Party are the party of Work Choices. They may have learned something since then; they know now to start by attacking unions rather than immediately and directly ripping off conditions of employment for workers in this country, as Work Choices did. That is something that the current Prime Minister supported and advanced. And so their relentless assault on unions just goes on uninterrupted, and that's why we have to question the motives behind this legislation.


It's also why we moved this second reading amendment. We moved the second reading amendment to make very clear that Labor has not given up supporting workers in this country and the more than 700,000 workers who are going to see their wages fall in real terms as a result of the penalty rates decision. Already on 1 July this year, retail and hospitality workers' wages have been cut, with the support of the Prime Minister and this government. They have backed this position and have refused to support the private member's bill moved by the Leader of the Opposition to prevent the effects of that happening.


We have a situation in this country where wages are falling in real terms, and that's being compounded by a government decision to support the Fair Work Commission decision that will cut real wages to some of the lowest-paid workers in this country. There are thousands of workers in every electorate across this country; every member of this place represents workers whose wages are falling in real terms, and it's being supported by a government which had the opportunity to support our legislation and to stop the immediate effect of that decision, not only for this year but for next year and 2019 and 2020. These workers will not get a pay increase for four years, because they're getting pay cuts for four years as a result of the decision that has arisen out of the Fair Work Commission.


At a time when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation, this Prime Minister has presided over the lowest wage growth in living memory, and yet he supports tax increases for low- and middle-income earners, he supports tax cuts for multinationals and millionaires and he supports penalty rate cuts for some of the lowest paid workers in this country. The Prime Minister has no regard for these workers. He has no empathy, because he does not understand. He does not understand the struggle that they have to make ends meet and to pay the bills that they need to pay. He has no idea.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The member for Hunter's right: the Prime Minister has no idea what's going on in the real world. That's why he supports tax increases for low- and middle-income earners and penalty rate cuts for some of the lowest paid in this country. At a time when he's presiding over low wage growth, he's got the temerity and arrogance to think it's fair that some of the hardworking low-paid workers in this country should take a pay cut.


Well, that's not what Labor believes. We don't believe that at all. We believe that, at a time when wage growth is falling, you don't increase taxes on low- and middle-income earners. You do not put up their taxes, which is exactly what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are seeking to do, and you don't support a decision to put a hand in the workers' pockets and take out their wage, which is effectively what's happening with the government supporting the Fair Work decision and not supporting the private member's bill that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition. While the government is obsessed with attacking unions in this country, attacking industry superannuation funds, attacking working people generally and supporting a penalty rate cut decision, Labor will continue to defend workers in this country. We will defend workers in this country. We will change the laws to make sure that people are not unfairly treated at work. We'll make sure that they get their fair share.


We heard the Treasurer only today change his language. Apparently now he's into inclusive growth. He wants to have inclusive growth. He can barely say the phrase 'inclusive growth'. You can't just say 'inclusive growth'; you've got to mean it when you say 'inclusive growth', and when you say it you've got to have policies that sit below it. You have to have something that makes sense and is consistent with that phrase. What he has done is go to a focus group which has said: 'Look, you've got to say ""fair"" more often, and to other people, to the commentators, you've got to use the phrase ""inclusive growth"". It ought to go down well if you say it, because the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank say it now, so why don't we say it now?'


The problem is that none of their policies are consistent with the proposition that they believe in inclusive growth. The government are saying one thing and doing another. The Treasurer's standing up today and saying, 'We support inclusive growth,' as he supports tax increases for low- and middle-income earners. The Treasurer's standing up today and saying 'inclusive growth' as he supports a decision that will take money out of the pockets of retail workers and hospitality workers. The government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say they believe in fairness and inclusive growth, and yet they want to give the biggest tax cuts we've seen to multinational companies, to the big end of town, and tax increases for people earning over $21,000 a year. What sort of joke is this? Do they really think the Australian people are mugs to believe that's even possible? They must, because I tell you: it is a contemptuous thing to say one thing and do the direct opposite, but that's exactly what this government's doing.


They are obsessed with unions, interfering with organised labour and supporting decisions that are hurting retail and hospitality workers. They say they can't oppose the decision because it's the umpire. Well, quite frankly, they were willing to abolish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal as an umpire when they didn't like truck drivers' wages going up. This time they won't intervene, because it's allowing retail and hospitality wages to go down. So it is hypocrisy on the part of the government and the Prime Minister to suggest that they could not have supported Labor. Of course, we should not be surprised. This is the Liberal Party. This is the party of Work Choices. This is the party that has always had a callous disregard for working people in this country and the difficulties that they might confront at times when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (12:34):  I move:


That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to:


(1) abandon its support of the decision of the Fair Work Commission to cut penalty rates because it will mean nearly 700,000 Australians will have their take home pay cut by up to $77 a week; and


(2) legislate to prevent the decision from taking effect to stop Australians from having their penalty rates cut"".


I rise to oppose the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 and speak in favour of the amendment. It is fair to say that this is a very considerable bill, as far as its size is concerned. The first I saw of this proposed piece of legislation was Thursday, last week. The bill has 80 pages and, of course, has an accompanying explanatory memorandum. There was no consultation with the opposition before it was introduced into this place last Thursday. A whole range of issues arise from the proposed provisions of the bill that the opposition will want to examine. I want to thank the department, which yesterday briefed my office and me on the bill, but that has led to as many questions as answers. No doubt there'll be a chance for the Senate committee to examine this bill, but, nonetheless, there are some things I want to put on the record. As I say, at this point the federal opposition is not in a position to support the legislation.


The Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 was introduced in the House last Thursday. This bill has five schedules and runs to 80 pages. It amends five pieces of legislation: the Fair Work Act 2009, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Tax Administration Act 1953. It has significant implications for unions and employer bodies, some of which will only be able to be identified following detailed examination of the technical provisions of this bill. It has significant implications for workers who benefit from their entitlements being protected through these funds and from the counselling, training, occupational health and safety and support services that those funds invest in. Notwithstanding this, we would contend that the government is rushing this bill through the parliament without proper scrutiny and without sufficient stakeholder consultation, and that's unfortunate. If the government wants to work with the opposition to improve laws in this area of public policy or, for that matter, any area of public policy, it would do well to consult and seek to find common ground rather than just expeditiously introduce legislation of this significance without that consultation and engagement.


I understand that, with the support of the Nick Xenophon Team, the government defeated Labor's attempts to have a thorough Senate employment committee inquiry, which would have examined the bill over several months. Instead, a reporting date of 10 November this year was imposed. We would argue that sets a very difficult time line for stakeholders to prepare submissions and present evidence. The time line for submissions is coming up, so there was very, very little time for stakeholders and affected parties in general to cooperate and produce submissions for that inquiry. We just note that that's characteristic of this minister, who doesn't seem to know what the word 'engagement' means.


The government's purpose is to use this bill to limit the legitimate activities and sources of income of employer bodies and unions. Partly, I think, that's a result of them not understanding the genesis of worker entitlement funds, their history and the important service they provide thousands and thousands of workers in this country. The minister's press release claims:


Through cosy deals with big businesses, unions have become a big business in their own right and more focused on making profits than representing people.


I would argue that that's unmitigated rubbish. Worker entitlement funds—which, by the way, are jointly established by unions, employer bodies and employers—operate firstly to ensure that workers' entitlements are protected, and secondly to provide important services to workers such as, as I said earlier, training, counselling support, suicide prevention, and funding of OH&S officers, just to name a few.


We think that it would have been useful if there had been a genuine engagement with those affected to consider the history of the funds and what purpose they serve, and to give a brief history of some of the funds. Some of these funds were set up decades ago, and were set up arising out of genuine complaints about phoenixing companies—that is, companies that were not paying entitlements and were winding up, avoiding obligations to creditors and, in particular, their workers, and then starting up again and maintaining a similar business debt-free. And for that reason and others, employers and unions wanted to provide greater security to their employees and members respectively by allowing such funds to continue and to afford that protection to workers.


The construction industry represents unique safety risks to workers. It is one of the most dangerous industries in this country and is characterised by high levels of worker vulnerability. For example, construction workers face one of the highest risks of injury and death of any industry; the highest level of suicide of any worker group; high levels of labour mobility and insecure work; long periods of unemployment; and high levels of redundancy. One of the funds in the construction industry, Incolink, provides a safety net which protects vulnerable construction workers by investing in workers' training, health, wellbeing and safety to tackle the issues. It is an important fund which brings workers and employers together to solve industry problems.


This bill, it's been put to me, may well have very significant impacts on this and other funds. It would prevent these funds investing in key occupational health and safety initiatives. It is unclear as to whether these funds could continue to subsidise members' insurances such as funeral cover, accident, dental, ambulance, portable sick leave and income protection. If they cannot continue to provide some of these services, I don't doubt that employers will bear the cost because there will be claims in subsequent enterprise negotiations asking employers to pay through those negotiations the shortfall that might arise if we allow for the unfair limitation of the purpose of these funds, which is to provide general protection for working people in the construction industry. Incolink, for example, worked alongside industry associations to establish a program of industry occupational health and safety grants when WorkSafe removed funding for these roles in 2002. Funding these OH&S roles helped to ensure good OH&S practice across the commercial building and construction industry.


That fund invested $4.8 million in 2016-17, I'm advised, to fund the occupational health and safety program. In order to be able to provide a range of additional benefits and support services to workers and their families in the building and construction industry, I'm advised that that fund invests to generate a return. Some of these funds are used to provide important wellbeing services such as supporting workers with mental health and DNA problems; attending critical incidents and providing suicide prevention; funding training for over 16,000 workers per year; counselling over 3,000 workers each year; and undertaking almost 4,000 health checks for workers. These are some of the really important services provided by these funds. If the government came from the view that they wanted to resolve any regulatory matters but understood the importance of the schemes, if they had at least some sense of the importance of consensus that exists in the construction industry with respect to these funds—that this is about workers, their representatives and employers working together to afford protection to workers in the industry—if the Minister for Employment thought through that prism rather than the constant partisan, extreme language that she uses when talking about organised labour, then I think the government would have a different view about these funds and would probably deal with the bill in a different manner.


We'll be looking at the bill to see how it might affect very important services to workers, to see whether in fact there'll be adverse consequences that flow, intentionally or otherwise. The government claims that this bill implements 10 recommendations of the Heydon royal commission. I accept that that may in part be true, but, as we know, that was a discredited royal commission led by a discredited commissioner. He is a former High Court justice but wanted to raise money for the Liberal Party while he was sitting in that position and presiding over the commission's conduct. He tried to deny it. Then he realised: 'I'd better think about this,' and judged that he was not partial and that there was no apparent conflict of interest. He sat in judgement of himself, found himself clear of all allegations and continued to act in that role, even though, if you look at his own judgements as a High Court justice, you would find he was completely contradicting his own reasoning when he was a justice of the High Court. Nonetheless, he proceeded, and that really discredited the findings of the commission. We also know that the commission was a political witch-hunt headed up by the commissioner to whom I just referred, who was willing to attend Liberal Party fundraisers and whose sole aim was to do the government's bidding. Nonetheless, even if the reasoning behind this legislation had a rocky start, we're examining whether some of these provisions are reasonable and would lead to better reporting and better disclosure provisions and whether the penalties are reasonable.


History teaches us that we can't trust this government to introduce legislation that does what it claims and that does not have serious overreach and flawed drafting. Labor will properly and thoroughly examine the provisions of the bill. Accountability, transparency and good governance are important. However, we must be vigilant to ensure that, in the name of these principles, this bill doesn't impose such a heavy regulatory burden that worker entitlement funds are not able to function.


I turn now to the range of matters that are the substance of the bill. The bill would put additional requirements on governance, financial reporting and financial disclosure requirements of worker entitlement funds. It would prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from requiring or permitting contributions to any fund other than a superannuation fund, a registered worker entitlement fund or a registered charity. It would prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from permitting or requiring employee contributions to a union election fund. It would prohibit coercion of employers to pay amounts to a particular worker entitlement fund, superannuation fund, training fund, welfare fund or employee insurance scheme, which is unlawful already. It would put additional financial management and disclosure obligations on registered organisations. It would introduce new penalties for registered organisations' noncompliance with financial management disclosure and reporting requirements.


A 'worker entitlement fund', according to the bill, is defined as 'a fund which is for the purpose or purposes of paying worker entitlements and death benefits'. 'Worker entitlements' are defined as including payments in respect of leave, payments in lieu of leave, payments in relation to termination of employment and any payments that contracts, awards or agreements provide for an employer to make to an employee. A superannuation fund, a registered charity, a discretionary mutual fund, a fund established by state, Commonwealth or territory law, and a fund controlled by a fund member are not included; however, the minister may prescribe additional funds as worker entitlement funds.

The bill also contains provisions that we understand would operate to prohibit enterprise agreements specifying that employers have to pay into training funds. What is the justification for this, given that enterprise agreements are completely transparent? They are voted on by workers, they have to be presented to the Fair Work Commission, the commission has to find that they're fulfilling the requirements of the act, so what would be the need for this potential change to the law?

It's also why we moved this second reading amendment. We moved the second reading amendment to make very clear that Labor has not given up supporting workers in this country and the more than 700,000 workers who are going to see their wages fall in real terms as a result of the penalty rates decision.

These workers will not get a pay increase for four years, because they're getting pay cuts for four years as a result of the decision that has arisen out of the Fair Work Commission.


At a time when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation, this Prime Minister has presided over the lowest wage growth in living memory, and yet he supports tax increases for low- and middle-income earners, he supports tax cuts for multinationals and millionaires and he supports penalty rate cuts for some of the lowest paid workers in this country. The Prime Minister has no regard for these workers. He has no empathy, because he does not understand. He does not understand the struggle that they have to make ends meet and to pay the bills that they need to pay. He has no idea.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The member for Hunter's right: the Prime Minister has no idea what's going on in the real world. That's why he supports tax increases for low- and middle-income earners and penalty rate cuts for some of the lowest paid in this country. At a time when he's presiding over low wage growth, he's got the temerity and arrogance to think it's fair that some of the hardworking low-paid workers in this country should take a pay cut.


Well, that's not what Labor believes. We don't believe that at all. We believe that, at a time when wage growth is falling, you don't increase taxes on low- and middle-income earners. You do not put up their taxes, which is exactly what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are seeking to do, and you don't support a decision to put a hand in the workers' pockets and take out their wage, which is effectively what's happening with the government supporting the Fair Work decision and not supporting the private member's bill that was moved by the Leader of the Opposition. While the government is obsessed with attacking unions in this country, attacking industry superannuation funds, attacking working people generally and supporting a penalty rate cut decision, Labor will continue to defend workers in this country. We will defend workers in this country. We will change the laws to make sure that people are not unfairly treated at work. We'll make sure that they get their fair share.


We heard the Treasurer only today change his language. Apparently now he's into inclusive growth. He wants to have inclusive growth. He can barely say the phrase 'inclusive growth'. You can't just say 'inclusive growth'; you've got to mean it when you say 'inclusive growth', and when you say it you've got to have policies that sit below it. You have to have something that makes sense and is consistent with that phrase. What he has done is go to a focus group which has said: 'Look, you've got to say ""fair"" more often, and to other people, to the commentators, you've got to use the phrase ""inclusive growth"". It ought to go down well if you say it, because the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank say it now, so why don't we say it now?'


The problem is that none of their policies are consistent with the proposition that they believe in inclusive growth. The government are saying one thing and doing another. The Treasurer's standing up today and saying, 'We support inclusive growth,' as he supports tax increases for low- and middle-income earners. The Treasurer's standing up today and saying 'inclusive growth' as he supports a decision that will take money out of the pockets of retail workers and hospitality workers. The government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer say they believe in fairness and inclusive growth, and yet they want to give the biggest tax cuts we've seen to multinational companies, to the big end of town, and tax increases for people earning over $21,000 a year. What sort of joke is this? Do they really think the Australian people are mugs to believe that's even possible? They must, because I tell you: it is a contemptuous thing to say one thing and do the direct opposite, but that's exactly what this government's doing.


They are obsessed with unions, interfering with organised labour and supporting decisions that are hurting retail and hospitality workers. They say they can't oppose the decision because it's the umpire. Well, quite frankly, they were willing to abolish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal as an umpire when they didn't like truck drivers' wages going up. This time they won't intervene, because it's allowing retail and hospitality wages to go down. So it is hypocrisy on the part of the government and the Prime Minister to suggest that they could not have supported Labor. Of course, we should not be surprised. This is the Liberal Party. This is the party of Work Choices. This is the party that has always had a callous disregard for working people in this country and the difficulties that they might confront at times when wage growth is at its lowest in a generation.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:29):  I offer my condolences to the families of those senselessly murdered in the terrorist attack in Mogadishu, Somalia, on 14 October. At least 358 people were killed and 228 injured, and there are still many unaccounted for. The attack targeted the city's largest marketplace, everyday people doing everyday things—working, shopping, socialising. Somalis are in a state of shock and mourning right across the world, and we mourn with them.


Jagajaga is home to the largest population of Somali Australians in Victoria. They are a proud, vibrant, family-oriented people, and they love their community and love Australia. On the weekend I joined them for a community barbecue in Heidelberg West to show support and our affection for those lost and left behind. They showed and told me of people they knew who were killed in this attack. There was a young woman who had graduated that day from her medical course and a paraplegic father of eight who lost a son and daughter working in a market stall selling milk—terrible stories. However, the Somali people are eternal optimists. They won't allow those attempting to drag their country backwards to win. I'd like to thank local community elders, the Darusalam Society, Abdullah Ahmed, Hussein Haraco, the women leaders and the children of that great community.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (15:25):  Mr Speaker, if you were looking for your daily dose of inspiration today, you certainly would not have taken it from the Minister for Communications. On the Today show this morning we saw the following:


Stefanovic asked Senator Fifield to fast-forward to 2020 and give his 30-second pitch to sell the ""great turkey"" to investors.


""This is a national broadband network, we're the first continent this sort of fast-broadband network,"" Senator Fifield said.


""It's fit for purpose and it's over to investors.""


After an awkward pause, a baffled looking Stefanovic asked: ""That's your pitch?""


""You're not going to be able to sell it, who is going to buy it?"" Stefanovic asked.


""Australians just want hard talk from their politicians, they want you to take responsibility,"" he said.


The Minister for Communications may have no passion for this portfolio whatsoever and no vision about digital inclusion and ending the digital divide. But what is most telling is the fact that again we have all blame and no responsibility on the part of this government.


I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, you only have to look at some of the effort that this government and the current NBN Co put into spin over improving the consumer experience. We have, for example, the 'gen nbn' marketing campaign. How much money has it spent since January this year on that campaign alone? $9.5 million. In contrast, how much was spent on consulting engagements for customer experience and customer service? $2.6 million. Imagine if the amount of effort that went into spin from this government actually went into improving the consumer experience.


But, no, this Prime Minister has thrown up his hands and said, 'Big mess; not my problem.' It is an extraordinary change in language from what we have seen from this Prime Minister in the past. We had him talking only days ago about how the NBN was all in hand. We had the Minister for Communications saying that the NBN under this government would be the envy of the world. We had the Prime Minister waxing lyrical about how the NBN under his tenure is the biggest corporate turnaround in Australian history. All of a sudden, the Prime Minister says, 'Well, the NBN's a train wreck.' We've gone from it being in hand to being in chaos. We've gone from it being commercially viable to the boss of NBN Co saying he's not even sure if it's commercially viable.


The question arises: what has changed? What has changed in the space of such a short time? I'll let you know what hasn't changed. What hasn't changed is that the consumers of Australia are still fed up. They are fed up with the second-rate internet that they are getting under this government. The lived experience of consumers will trump any day this government blowing its own trumpet, this Prime Minister refusing to take responsibility and absolutely nothing happening to improve or to shorten the digital divide in this country. You have to ask yourself: do the people opposite actually believe in making sure that we eliminate the digital divide in Australia? When the minister was asked about this issue, what do you think the response was? Maybe it was a response about how we recognise that Australia is part of a global economy and that we need to have the highest quality broadband in order to compete in a globalised market for goods, services and employment, and in order to do that we need the best connectivity available for consumers, education and health care. No—none of that. All he gave is an answer that makes even Karl Stefanovic say, 'Are you serious?'


This is not some abstract concept about a digital divide. We saw only a few months ago that the Australian Digital Inclusion Index shows growing evidence around inequality and digital inclusion, and Australians with low levels of income, education and employment are significantly less digitally included. There is a significant digital divide between the rich and the less-well-off Australians. We see in the Australian Digital Inclusion Index yet another set of benchmarks that show that the government can't even get the basics right for every Australian to have the equality of opportunity to participate in our economy and enable Australia to compete on the world stage. Instead, they are ploughing billions of taxpayer dollars into a copper network that is simply not delivering for Australians.


Let's look at how the government has approached the issues of consumers. For example, the Prime Minister responded to last week's figures from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, which reported a 159 per cent increase in consumer complaints about the NBN. What did he have to say? At first, he said nothing. He just gave a smirk in response to a question about this. He then answered: 'Well, you know, complaints—they're a fact of life.' How out of touch can you get as a Prime Minister? How out of touch can you possibly get? The government claimed that the level of complaints is in line with the rollout. It's not in line with the rollout at all. For the first time, we see consumer complaints increasing above the level of the rollout—the first time this has happened. For the first time, we see NBN complaints being the highest source of complaints. The internet is the highest source of complaints in the TIO's complaints data.


What we also see is the business case under this government for the NBN completely unravelling. The economics are changing by the day. As I said, once upon a time, not too long ago, the NBN was supposedly the envy of the world and all in hand. Now the head of NBN Co is calling for protections and new taxes, saying, 'Not even sure that it's commercially viable.' I'll tell you what the reality is: under this government, the economics of the NBN are completely busted, but they throw up their hands and say, 'It's not my responsibility.' So not only are the economics of the NBN busted but consumer complaints are going through the roof. Here is their response to what they've been doing for consumers. They say they've instituted a broadband monitoring scheme to test internet speeds. I'll tell you about this. The minister sat on this advice from the ACCC for 14 months before it was instigated. Earlier this year, he said that this would be 'the year of the customer'. That was in April this year. We're still waiting. There are still about two months to go to see if this is actually the year of the customer.


What do Australians think of the government's second-rate NBN?


I will tell you what they think. You only have to look at the Essential report, where only 27 per cent of those surveyed say they support the Liberal government's plan—which actually represents an increase in support for the Labor plan since the question was asked in September 2015. So, more and more, we see Australians not only completely turning off this government but also starting to understand—indeed, many of them have understood this for some time given the level of complaints—that this is a second-rate network that is not serving Australians.


Talking about the digital divide, have a look at what the rest of the world thinks about us. Earlier in the year The New York Times did a dissertation showing that: 


Australia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. 


That is how the rest of the world sees us. How on earth is Australia supposed to crack the digital divide under this government with a second-rate copper network, a minister who has no passion and no vision, and a government that won't take responsibility?

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2017-10-24,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield—Minister for Urban Infrastructure) (15:36):  Let me make it clear that there's one thing in this debate that the coalition takes very seriously, and that is unsatisfactory customer experiences on the NBN. Where there's an unsatisfactory experience we want to see it dealt with, we want to see it fixed. That's why, for example, Bill Morrow, the Chief Executive Officer of NBN Co, said last week:


We're working with retail service providers and industry as a priority to improve these figures and the overall experience for consumers. This work is being reflected in a 13.6 per cent decline in overall TIO complaints between July to September 2017 and a 26.3 per cent decline in TIO complaints about landline and internet services over the same period. We believe it is an early sign of movement in the right direction.


So let me be absolutely clear: if there are unsatisfactory customer experiences we want to see them dealt with, we want to see them fixed; we take them very seriously.


Let me make equally clear what we do not take seriously. We do not take seriously the attempts by the Labor Party to rewrite history and pretend that it wasn't their collection of chaotic decisions which created a starting point which we have been working to resolve. Let me remind you of some of the key Labor mistakes in relation to the NBN, including the shocking process by which this model was first developed. Let me quote from an independent audit into the NBN public policy process conducted by the eminent former public servant Bill Scales AO. He had this to say about the process that led up to Kevin Rudd—remember him—announcing this approach: 


After just 11 weeks of consideration, the government had decided to establish a completely new start-up company, now called NBN Co, to roll out one of Australia's largest ever single public infrastructure projects. The NBN was to be rolled out in eight years at a preliminary estimated cost of around $43 billion. There is no evidence that a full range of options was seriously considered. There was no business case or any cost-benefit analysis or independent studies of the policy undertaken, with no clear operating instructions provided to this completely new government business enterprise within a legislative and regulatory framework still undefined and without any consultation with the wider community.


That is what Bill Scales, an eminent former public servant, said about the train crash public policy process which led to Kevin Rudd announcing the NBN in early 2009. So that was the first mistake—the terrible process.


The next mistake was appointing a board with virtually no relevant skills, and management with very little relevant skills. Here's what the forensic accountants KordaMentha had to say when they reported on this issue in August 2014. Their assessment of the board appointed by Labor was that it had 'a collective lack of deep operational experience and insight in areas critical to the success of NBN Co'.




Ms Madeleine King:
  Five years!




Mr FLETCHER:
  One of the public policy geniuses on the other side of the chamber says, 'Five years.' That's your argument. I'll tell you what, mate: there's no statute of limitations on public policy incompetence! When you stuff things up as fundamentally as Kevin Rudd did, that stuff-up stays around for a very long time. Be it NBN, pink batts or Building the Education Revolution, Kevin Rudd was responsible for years and decades of public policy stuff-ups—and this government is working hard to fix them.


The next mistake that we saw from the Labor Party when it came to the NBN was hopelessly mismanaging the rollout. By the time we came to government, barely 50,000 premises were connected to the fixed network and they were hopelessly behind their own business case. They were supposed to be achieving 1.7 million by 30 June 2013. In fact, they had reached 282,799—hopelessly behind. Here's another mistake, another fundamental factor that we never hear from Labor today. They wanted it erased from history, but it's a reality and you can't erase it from history. The contract that they did with Telstra was to pay $11 billion in net present value terms to Telstra and $1 billion to my former employer Optus. And yet they want to wash their hands of the fact that through these contracts they put an incoming government into a position where it had to take the most rational choice in the circumstances, and that's what we've done.


The other big mistake they made was saying, 'We'll build fibre to the premises everywhere.' These geniuses said that. Not one of them had a jot or iota of telecommunications operational experience, and their ripper idea was fibre to the premises to 90 per cent of the population. Let's look at how much fibre to the premises costs to connect to some premises. We've seen some evidence of it just in recent days. A premises in Ravenswood in Tasmania costs $91,000 to connect to fibre. Mount Cotton in Queensland is $40,000. The average cost to connect fibre to the premises is $4,400. The average cost to connect fibre to the node is $2,200. It is for these rational business reasons, these sensible public policy reasons, that, when we came to government having inherited this hopeless train smash of a policy, we reconfigured it under the current Prime Minister—then Minister for Communications—who instituted a rational policy to turn this mess around. This turnaround is one of the most successful turnarounds you are ever going to see, and it was from one of the most disastrous starting points you could imagine.


Why did we do it? First of all, changing to this mix means we're going to save $30 billion. Second of all, it means that we're going to get the rollout completed six years earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Let's just go back to the impact of the reduced cost of the rollout. What we've got is one side of politics with their head in the skies: the dreamers, the visionaries—'Don't talk to me about how its done; we've got the dream.' Actually, your dream is going to cost $43 a month more for the ordinary Australian family on their NBN broadband bill.


This is a very familiar story, members of the House. A bunch of completely impractical dreamers and their ripper idea mean ordinary Australian families have to pay more on their bill every month. Telecommunications, energy—it's the same incompetent public policy approach from this hopeless rabble.


Let me turn to another question, which is a very instructive question for the House to consider: what is Labor's alternative plan? Here's a very instructive quote from The Sydney Morning Herald, not notorious for its friendship with the coalition government, this morning:


Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland was sharply critical of the government's handling of the project, but could not say whether in government it would spend billions more to deliver fibre to the home connections or what it would do to fix speed issues.


There's Labor's policy: Labor's communication spokesman could not say. We can go back to 2016 and we can have a look at the ripper policy that was put forward by the member for Blaxland, who is now very relieved to have got away from this particular policy area. This was a ripper policy. What a genius! This genius said, 'A Shorten Labor government will roll out fibre to the premises to up to two million additional Australian homes and businesses.' That sounds great. Listen to this bit: 'Labor will spend exactly the same amount.' What a miracle. The ordinary rules of economics have been abolished. They're going to find a way to build two million more fibre to the premises at not one extra dollar. It's a miracle! It's a miracle! The conventional rules of economics have been thrown out the window by these geniuses in the Labor Party.


What did the Financial Review have to say about it? Here we go again: 'Labor's announcement it will reinvigorate the NBN fibre optic cable to every home network, but not share any details or even admit it will cost a lot more money than the current mix of technologies, should come as no surprise. Labor has no credibility in this area.' You could not find a better summary of this public policy area. Labor has no credibility in this area. So let's be clear: we inherited a mess, thanks to Labor; we're fixing it up. Over six million premises are able to connect and we are getting on with the job. This hopeless rabble has no idea and no plan.

In the alternative universe that those opposite inhabit, I note that this morning the foreign minister said to the party room that, and I'm quoting here, 'Julie Bishop tells the coalition room that the NBN is a success story for the coalition.' That is the alternative universe.

Don't take my word for it—



Mrs Prentice interjecting—




Mr DICK:
  The member for Ryan says 'overconfident'. I'll ignore the 21 Newspolls that we're seeing; I'll ignore that poll after poll shows us that Australians do not trust, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, you to handle telecommunications in this nation.


Let's deal with what the minister, who has now vacated the floor, just said. If that's what the foreign minister is saying about the NBN then I suggest she spend a little less time on the red carpet and a little more on blue carpet. I know, by listening to what the government says, that it does not match the commitments that it's promised the Australian people. We have had a lot of history lessons today. That's fine, that's the narrative from the government. We know that the Prime Minister had promised that every household in Australia would be connected to the NBN by last year. We know that the NBN, as promised by the Prime Minister, would cost $29.5 billion. That was your commitment to the Australian people. His multitechnology mess now costs $50 billion, a blowout of $20 billion. He made a commitment; it blows out—the assistant minister is shaking his head.




Mr Taylor:
  It's not right.




Mr DICK:
  He's saying that's not right. The Prime Minister promised everyone would have access to NBN by the end of 2016. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that correct? No answer. By the end of 2016, more than seven million premises were still waiting for connection. The Prime Minister also promised that the NBN would be faster and cheaper. The reality is that he is delivering a second-rate NBN that is slower and more expensive.


We know that last week the communications minister said the government's second-rate NBN would be the envy of the world, but all of a sudden this week the NBN is a train wreck. So what's happened in one week? It went from being in hand to now being in chaos. It went from being commercially viable to the NBN CEO saying that he was no longer sure. As the shadow minister has said, the economics of copper are destroying the NBN. We all know it because when we're out campaigning we're listening to constituents in street corner meetings, at shopping centres—and the member for Macarthur receives the highest amount of complaints of anyone. Yet I know those opposite, who are campaigning and doing street stalls at yacht clubs and at Point Piper and country clubs, don't hear the same message that those on this side of the House are hearing. We hear it day in, day out. And do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? I know those opposite get complaints from constituents. I know the so-called minister has said that they deal with every one of those complaints.


Let's talk about my electorate of Oxley, and about my constituent Pam, of Sinnamon Park, who has had problem after problem since the NBN was installed in March this year. Of course, the service provider is blaming the NBN, and the NBN is blaming the service provider. It is still currently unresolved. Another of my constituents, Jean, of Westlake, finally had her issue resolved yesterday. Seven months it took, to solve a simple issue.


This is what the foreign affairs minister said this morning is a great success story for the coalition. On the front page of my local paper we read: 'Stranded. Switching to the NBN was supposed to be a godsend, but for five days last month Naomi and Marcus Hodgson had no internet or phone line at all. The couple, who study and run a business from their Springfield Lakes home, wish they had never chosen to be connected to the NBN.' Yet the foreign minister this morning told the party room it's a complete success for the coalition. Those opposite are in an alternative universe. Just once we would like them to apologise for the mess they've created in Australia which is their NBN. (Time expired)

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2017-10-24,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Assistant Minister for Cities and Digital Transformation) (15:51):  This government was handed a pup—and that's as far as I need to go with that analogy. But Labor's NBN was a pup, and it's those opposite who are living in an alternative universe. It's Labor, Member for Oxley, who should be saying sorry on this one, not us. It's Labor that should be saying sorry. But we haven't heard that. Now, as usual, as is customary in this place, and as has been customary in recent years, we're cleaning up their mess. We have taken responsibility to fix their mess.


Time and time again I discover in this place that Labor doesn't show much respect for the facts and is constantly in denial. In fact, in recent times we've seen the professional apparatchiks from the union movement turn Labor into a shadow of its former self. Rational arguments have been lost in a mist of fact-free fervour where spin merchants can create their own reality. So let's bust apart a few of those Labor myths.


False claim No. 1 from those opposite, from the earlier speakers, is that nations around the world are rolling out fibre to the premises. Well, that is rot. Nations around the world are overwhelmingly rolling out a mix of technologies in an economically pragmatic way. Fibre to the premises might make sense in city-states like Singapore and Hong Kong, where almost the entire population lives in high-rises, but not here. They have population densities of 300 people per hectare; we're about a 10th of that in our densest cities. I know those opposite would love to turn our cities into apartment-living, basket-weaving, sandal-wearing, car-free utopias, but it isn't happening anytime soon. In the meantime, we need a range of technologies, and that's exactly what we have done in cleaning up your mess.


The second claim from those opposite is that, under Labor's original rollout, all Australian homes would have had the NBN by 2021—more rot. Labor's fibre-to-the-premises NBN policy would've cost, we know now, $30 billion more. That's generous, by the way. We're hearing this week about $90,000-per-premises rollouts. We read in the media it would've taken six to eight years longer to complete, and it would've left millions of households waiting another decade for better broadband, including those in my electorate—and I'll come back to that in a moment. Labor drastically underestimated the time and cost involved in a full fibre rollout when they embarked on the NBN program, because they didn't understand the basics of our cities and our regions—the lack of density that they thought that we had, as I explained earlier, in some kind of utopian view about what Australia should be. We know that every 10 days we're rolling out more than Labor rolled out in its whole time in office. So the reality is very different from the false claims of Labor.


The third false claim is that the network is behind schedule and that there are cost overruns. Under the coalition, NBN has hit every rollout target we've seen since coming into government. We had a three-year rollout plan released in July 2015. We set the target of reaching half of the premises across Australia by mid-2017 and three-quarters by mid-2018, and we are right on track. In contrast, back in December 2010 Labor forecast it would reach a target of 1.2 million premises by the end of 2013, but it only passed 200,000 premises. It had burned through $6.5 billion in funding out of its total budget. That was over $300,000 per premises.


The Labor Party sold us a pup. We have spent the last four years cleaning up the mess. In my electorate, we are at a point where 89 per cent of premises have access and over 50 per cent have connected, and that rate is increasing by the day. It's time for Labor to say sorry for the mess they left.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Before I call the member for Werriwa, the volume of interjections is increasing to a point where I'm issuing a general warning. The member for Macarthur is out of his place and is grossly disorderly, so he's warned.

Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (15:56):  The frustration that people are experiencing in my electorate in the growing south-west region of Sydney is clear to see. Last week's figures released in the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman annual report listed both Liverpool and Campbelltown as being in the top 10 postcodes for complaints. In fact, the only areas in the electorate with positive feedback are those with fibre to the premises—and they were part of the original rollout.


Recently, I held an NBN forum in Werriwa. Even on a very cold night, over 100 people attended. Thirty more contacted my office to provide apologies and seek further support. The forum was attended by a representative of the NBN. I thank her for her presentation and willingness to answer questions from my constituents, but it is clear from the forum and the inquiries my office is dealing with every day that the NBN providers and retailers are failing every segment of my electorate, and this is creating a difference in the experience of our residents. Elderly residents are confused as to why they need to change their phones and medical alert devices. Technicians show up but don't ensure the phones are put in the most convenient places in the house or even that they work properly. Young people are being promised and are paying for speeds which are just not being delivered. NBN Co says this is because the retailers are not buying enough bandwidth or because there's still ADSL on the line. However, the fact is people aren't getting what they were promised. My office has received in excess of 300 inquiries since June alone, when we began promoting the NBN forum. Regardless of the issues with the NBN or the telecommunication providers, the sheer scale of the issues that have been raised is astonishing, ranging from issues with installation and technician appointments to the quality of installation and the speed and reliability of connections.


One of the most consistent issues raised comes from constituents with hybrid fibre-coaxial, or HFC, connections. These are used when the existing pay TV or cable network can be used as the final connection for the NBN. Many constituents who've been using an existing ADSL connection have been switched over to HFC before the connection was correctly activated, thereby leaving them without any phone or internet connection, sometimes for weeks at a time. This is particularly prevalent in Macquarie Fields and Hinchinbrook in my electorate. When finally the connection does work, many of my constituents are so disappointed to find their service quality is, in fact, significantly diminished with this connection. The difficulties with switching households to HFC have been disastrous for the elderly in particular. The lack of access to a phone connection is creating a great deal of anxiety for older constituents and their families, as they frequently don't have mobile phones—and don't want them—and rely on their landlines for cases of emergency. There is also ongoing confusion about how the NBN will interact with special-need devices, such as landlines for the hearing impaired, which NBN Co have failed to truly clarify for many of the constituents in my electorate.


Many young families moving into new neighbourhoods in my electorate are discovering that their new 'NBN-ready' properties are not actually ready at all. In Edmondson Park, the residents of Zulu Road were very pleased to recently have their residences connected, except for the fact that they waited well over a year without any fixed-line connection. The most egregious example, however, is probably the suburb of Long Point, which I've spoken about in this place previously. Long Point residents barely have mobile coverage and, despite NBN Co earlier promising rollout dates and connecting suburbs that are less than 60 metres away, they remain left behind.


I recognise, though, that it's not just the constituents of Werriwa who've been let down by this government's bungling of the NBN rollout. Australia's average download speeds have reached 11.1 megabits per second. This leaves Australia ranked 50th in the world for average speeds, behind South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand and Kenya. While it's frustrating enough for someone to stream the latest Netflix series or communicate on Skype, this also risks leaving Australia behind while countries such as China and India look to keep their economies on the cutting edge and compete with the success of Silicon Valley. This will not occur with the current NBN rollout that we've got. This has been compromised. By no longer connecting homes and businesses directly to high-speed fibre to the network and using this second rate copper wire, we have seen— (Time expired)

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2017-10-24,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (16:01):  I'll get to the good work that we've been doing as a government with the NBN, but this whole story reminds me of an Irish joke I might share with you, Deputy Speaker. You may have already heard of it. There's this American tourist and he's driving around Ireland. He's in his convertible. He's got the roof down. He's enjoying the Irish countryside—the stone walls and the green fields—but after about an hour or so he feels as though he's lost. He feels, 'I think I've driven past this place before, or down this lane before.' After a while, he sees an Irish farmer putting some hay into a shed, and he walks over to the Irish farmer and says: 'Sir, I'm trying to get to Dublin. How do I get to Dublin from here?' The Irish farmer says, 'Oh, sir, if I were going to Dublin, I wouldn't start from here.'


I think that says it all about the NBN. We were left something which certainly isn't the place you would have started from. The minister spoke about—and it's been well documented—the complete public policy wreck that the NBN was as it was created by Minister Stephen Conroy. Some of his exploits were well documented, but the minister alluded to a few of them. In 11 weeks it was put together. There was no business case. There was no independent study. Let's look at this, because this was always a project of tens of billions of dollars, and there was no independent study ever done on it. There was no cost-benefit analysis. The board was put together and, as has been documented by independent people, there was no operational experience on the board. This was a thing that was hatched together by a minister who did no consultation and no independent study on it. So what were we left with? We were left with the debacle that it was.


Deputy Speaker Coulton, I share a thing with you. When I'm not in Canberra and I'm with industrious Australians who are out there having a go and starting small businesses, out and about doing it, it's easy to feel optimistic about Australia and everything that's going on. When I'm in Canberra, I feel less optimistic as the week goes on, having to listen to the ideology of those opposite and the diatribe that comes out of their mouths. They have no commercial experience. Most of them have never run a business or had management experience, and then, of course, you hear them say things like this.


If you were to run it as it was originally designed by the Labor Party, where they were going to do fibre to the premise everywhere, that was obviously going to mean a couple of indefutable things. It was always going to be more expensive to build. To build a fibre-to-the-premise model was always going to be more expensive than fibre to the node or fibre to the curbside. Besides being more expensive to build, it was always, obviously, going to be more expensive for the customer. To build a more expensive project meant that the expense to the customer was always going to be more and, obviously, the rollout was always going to be slower when doing a fibre-to-the-premises model.


What should've happened in the original, as happened in many countries, is that there should have been a mixture of technologies, and not necessarily done by government. This is the shock to them: this didn't have to be done by government! But that's something that they just can't get through their minds, because they have to control everything. Everything needs to be built by government. Many countries have done this in a good model; they have done it with a model with private companies doing it in the high traffic areas. They've done it with a model in capital cities, where people competed to build it, and, obviously, governments got involved where it may not have been commercially viable and they needed government involvement.


Obviously, that is too shocking for them; everything has to be done by government—governments are the only people who know how to do stuff. And, of course, what a great result! It will be a thing that goes down in history as the diabolical thing we were left with—much like the Irish farmer said: 'You wouldn't start from here.' It's where we were left when we took over.


But much good has been done. Firstly, the Prime Minister, who was the previous Minister for Communications, got in and put the management team and the governance system in place with NBN. This meant that the statistics and the rollout have been much better than they otherwise would have been. In my electorate of Page, we've had the rollout of the fixed broadband, which is now covering just about all of the electorate where the fixed broadband was going. We're going to have a mixture of fibre to the node and fibre to the curb. It's been redesigned in some of the CBDs where it floods, so there is good work happening.

"Wilson, Josh, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr JOSH WILSON
 (Fremantle) (16:06):  And the member for Page is spot-on: the NBN, as it currently stands, is 'bolical'. It's indisputable, it's irrefutable and it's even, if you like, 'indefutable' that this is 100 per cent on you. This 'bolical' NBN is 100 per cent on you!


It's a rare achievement to stuff up the policy and program implementation for an essential service twice—not once: twice. It was the Howard government, in its wisdom—in its unbridled enthusiasm for privatisation—that decided to sell off Telstra, and they consigned Australia to life as a broadband backwater. That decision in the late 1990s, at the relative dawn of the internet, put us into a 20-year broadband limbo—a 20-year holding pattern. Other countries, including much less developed countries in our region, surged ahead. We have the 13th-biggest economy in the world—sometimes the 12th, sometimes the 13th—and we currently have broadband speeds at 53rd in the world. The member for Page told an Irish joke. As the member for Lyons points out, in Ireland, they're seventh in the world. We are 53rd in the world; it's a crying shame.


Labor's creation of the National Broadband Network was designed to repair that damage—to create an affordable, consistent, high-quality broadband framework for this nation in the 21st century. And it was going to be based on fibre, because all the evidence and all the expertise showed that fibre is the state-of-the-art, future-proofed technology. As every person who knows anything about broadband the world over will tell you, 'Do it once, do it right, do it with fibre.'


So how did it all go wrong? I think I'd be tempted to borrow a phrase from the Prime Minister and put it down to ideology and idiocy, because it's hard to explain it in any other way. It began with the lunacy of privatising an infrastructure monopoly. Privatisation at any cost is the path they wanted to go down, and that's where we are now, 25 years later. It continued with the abandonment of a fibre based network in favour of the multitechnology mess and the 19th century copper catastrophe that we live with now in 2017. It's not just decades-old copper, where they found it buried in the ground after 70, 80 or 90 years, but brand-spanking-new copper that they've brought in, becoming one of the largest copper wire stockpilers in the developed world, and shipping it around to put back into trenches where the old copper just won't do. Why? Why did they do that? Because the Vertigan review—geniuses; cutting-edge high-tech users, like Henry Ergas—decided that the biggest risk was that a fibre network might just be too fast. A fibre network may give more speed and more data than we actually needed. Never mind that since the 1970s computer processing power has doubled every single year. It's called Moore's law, a law that computing power and processing power will double every year.


Ninety per cent of all the data on the planet right now was created in the last two years. But those on that side were concerned that the fibre network would be over par—that it would be too good for Australia's needs. What is the result of all that? It means that Australian households and businesses continue to go without an essential service. It means we remain at a global disadvantage. It means our economy misses out on the most important infrastructure investment that is critical for us to take advantage of the areas that our economy needs to move into: high-tech manufacturing and agriculture, and creative industries. We are missing out on all of the various different creative and productive opportunities that the 21st century holds and it's because of the policies of this government.


The saddest thing, if you take a broad view of social and economic life, is the creation of a savage and steep digital divide that will lock in and exacerbate disadvantage. That will mean that people who live in poorer areas, people who already face significant disadvantage, are locked into that set of circumstances. They are held out from access to health, education and essential services.


The NBN disaster is the Prime Minister's pet project. It's his area of special interest. It was his portfolio responsibility. It is 100 per cent on this government. They have done the double: they sold off Telstra and they buggered up the NBN. It is 'indefutably' a mess of their making, and they will wear it around their necks.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2017-10-24,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:11):  Labor's attacks today are as fantastical and lacking in preparation as their plan for the NBN was in 2009. This MPI is one of the greatest own goals ever kicked. When I read The Australian yesterday morning, I thought, 'Surely they won't do anything in the MPI in relation to the NBN.' I will have great delight in going through that great article from The Australian just yesterday. They couldn't even let the dust settle for a couple of days or a week. The best form of offence is defence, they say, and that has clearly been exhibited by those opposite today.


Let's have a look at this. Labor is as credible on the NBN as they are on the NDIS. With the NDIS, they promised the world; they gave us an atlas; they delivered a $55 billion funding black hole. With the NBN, they told Australians that they must all have fibre to the premises, whether they needed it or not. Even if they didn't want it, they would still get it. What they delivered was fewer connections in four years than we are delivering every fortnight, and yet there is another black hole. Labor's impractical plan would have cost up to $84 billion—over $30 billion more than the coalition's business-like approach. I know those opposite don't care about money—'We'll just keep putting up the taxes to pay for it.' The gall of members opposite, in seeking to attack the government for so effectively cleaning up the mess of that lot, is hard to stomach.


Labor's NBN was two years behind schedule before it even connected a single home. Labor's NBN would have been finished, if it ever was, in 2028, and would have cost $3,500 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Labor's NBN spent $50,000, $80,000 and even $90,000 to connect single premises to the network. I'm going to return to that article, because that article from The Australian was an absolute pearler. Labor's NBN, according to one analysis, would have driven up average home internet bills by more than $500 a year. Labor's plan, if you can call it that, was an impractical, financially illiterate, technologically uninformed shambles. In contrast, the coalition has taken pragmatic, business-like and evidence based action to give Australians the high-speed broadband that they need.


This government adopted a mixed technology approach, giving NBN the option to choose the best-fit and most cost-effective technology solution for each area. This government saved the taxpayer $30 billion. This government fixed the build costs to ensure that the NBN's business model delivers a modest return on taxpayers' investment. This government has made the NBN available already to 6.2 million premises and prioritised regional Australia, ensuring that two-thirds of regional premises are already connected. This government got the rollout back on track, ensuring that NBN has beaten its financial year 2017 target by 100,000 and that the full rollout will be complete by 2020.


In my electorate of Fisher, the rollout is 53 per cent complete. That's 45,000 households who are ready to access the high-speed broadband. Tens of thousands of people have already signed up. Though we have around 39,000 of our 85,000 premises still to connect, we're at least six to eight years ahead of where we would've been under Labor's fantasy version of the NBN.


Let's have a look at some of these costs to connect to the internet. This is from The Australian yesterday, and what a great article it was. For Ravenswood in Tasmania it was $91,196—that's not to connect the town; that's just one house. For Invermay in Tasmania, it was $86,533; for Kingston in Tassie—the good place of Tassie—$55,766. In relation to speed, 80 per cent of users of NBN are opting to buy the two slowest NBN speed packages of up to 25 megabits per second. That's half of the average capability of 60 megabits per second, plus— (Time expired)

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (16:16):  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this MPI because the NBN is in Labor's blood. It's in our DNA. We created the NBN, and we're incredibly proud of it. These guys opposite mucked it up. They messed it up. They've killed it. There are just a couple of issues I'd like to go through before I get to the substance of my speech.


The member for Page, who's unfortunately no longer with us, said the NBN didn't have to be delivered by government. He is a member who represents the far north-east of New South Wales. I cannot imagine any corporation or any telecommunications company breaking their neck to deliver NBN services to the good constituents of Page. So he might want to have a talk to his constituents about that.


My good friend the member for Fisher was scoffing at the cost of service delivery for cherrypicked premises. I wonder if those opposite, especially National Party members, have the same attitude and put the same logic to extending services like roads and powerlines and power poles and telephone wires to remote and rural areas of this country. They cost more per premises to deliver as well, and they too, like the NBN, are essential services. So there are two issues there.


Tasmanians know about the digital divide. We live with it every day. The Australian Digital Inclusion Index, which the shadow minister referred to, shows that Tasmania still lags in the broadband stakes. Southern Tasmania, which includes part of my electorate, is in the bottom five digitally included regions in Australia. In 2014, Tasmania's digital inclusion score was 4½ points behind Victoria. Now it's 7.7. For digital ability, in 2015, there was a 5.8-point difference, and now it's 8.6. The affordability gap has blown out from one point in 2015 to 7.9 points now. It's going in the wrong direction under this government. Ever since the election of the Liberal government, Tasmania's digital gap has widened.


What a different story it was under Labor, when Tasmanian towns and cities were the first in the country to benefit from Labor's real NBN, with fibre to the premises delivered in Sorell, Midway Point, Smithton and Scottsdale, Launceston and Hobart. These places are now the envy of the country, delivering superfast broadband. We've got Launceston, the first gigabit city in the country. One can only imagine how bad the digital divide in Tasmania would have been if Labor had not delivered fibre to the premises.


The Prime Minister says that Australia should have followed the New Zealand example—he's quoted in the press—of splitting an existing telecommunications company into wholesale and retail rather than creating the NBN. He conveniently forgets that his side privatised Telstra, as my friend the member for Fremantle mentioned, and refused to include separation when it did so. And those opposite, including the Prime Minister before he became the Prime Minister, opposed Labor's legislation at the time for separation. He says that Labor should have followed the New Zealand example, but he was one of the very people who prevented it from happening.


The NBN didn't exist before 2009. It was conceived, developed and started under Labor, and it was starting to roll out in just four years, a mammoth infrastructure project. The size of it almost can't be conceived, and it was rolling out in four years, and it was well underway when those opposite came to power and they demolished it. Who can forget that cringe-worthy performance by the Prime Minister when he was the shadow communications minister, with the former opposition leader Tony Abbott, member for Warringah? He was the man who invented the internet! They said they were going to crush the NBN and create their version of it—a cringe-worthy performance. That was the beginning of the end for the NBN in this country, and this Prime Minister has kept that up. He's been an absolute disgrace as a Prime Minister and the worst communications minister in this country. He had one job, to deliver an NBN that this country could be proud of, and he's wrecked it. As Prime Minister, he's had the power and the authority to deliver an NBN that Australians can be proud of and that can close the digital divide in this country, but instead he's widened it. He's made it worse. He's delivered an NBN that no-one is proud of, where complaints are soaring. Nobody wants to be part of it. He's so embarrassed about it that he doesn't want to answer questions in this place and defers to his junior minister. It is an absolute disgrace, and I back the shadow minister in this MPI. Only Labor can deliver a real NBN. (Time expired)

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (16:21):  We just heard from the member for Lyons, and he said that, when we took over as government in 2013, the NBN was well underway, but during part of my speech I'll be happy to remind him how well it was underway. We also heard the member for Fisher talk about an own goal, and it reminded me of a question from the Leader of the Opposition back on 14 September, when I managed to send a GIF to one of the members opposite. I won't name who it was, but I sent a GIF to one of the members opposite of a bloke playing soccer who tries to kick the ball over his head but actually kicks it into his head, and it goes into the goal. That reminds me of this MPI. It's an own goal.


These MPIs on the NBN have been going on since 2010. There are a lot of new members here, but I see the member for Hunter. He'll know. He's probably participated in a few MPIs on the NBN over the years. Back in 2015, when some of the members who are now in here weren't here, there was a question I gave to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure, who at that time was the Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects. He certainly wasn't the minister for the Asian century. I don't know where he's gone now, but I know there was one back when Labor were in power. They have all disappeared, those ministers. My question to the minister at the time was:


I have received … letters from my constituents about the poor broadband service in the Ascot exchange. In 2007 the then Labor member wrote to the constituents of Swan and said that they would solve this—


by 2009.


They said they would fix it, but in six years they did nothing. They were absolutely useless. What action is the coalition government taking to reverse Labor's inaction and pathetic uselessness, and to help my constituents in the Ascot exchange?


There were a lot of interjections, because a few of the members over there, particularly the Manager of Opposition Business, said there was argument within that particular question, but the Speaker allowed it, and this was the minister's answer. I'll remind the member for Lyons to listen to how well underway they were in Western Australia. This'll tell you how well underway, after five years of rolling out the NBN, they were in Western Australia. Mr Fletcher said:


I do want to thank the member for Swan for this question, which really reflects a campaign that he has been assiduously pursuing in the totality of his time here in the parliament in relation to the delivery of broadband in Ascot.


There is, as the member informed the House, a letter on the record from Kim Wilkie MP, the then Labor member for Swan, from September 2007 which says: 


Labor's National Broadband Network will solve Ascot's broadband problems.


There it was. There was the promise in 2007. And so, when the new member for Swan—as he then was in 2007—came to the parliament, he understandably pursued the delivery of that promise—


through the Labor government. What happened? Nothing. The answer continued:


To his great surprise, when the city of Belmont and the Eastern Metropolitan Regional Council put forward a proposal to prioritise the Ascot exchange, it was rejected by the then minister for broadband, Senator Conroy. He rejected out of hand the proposal, when there had been a promise only two years before by the then Labor member for Swan that Ascot would be sorted out.


It has fallen—as it always does—to the coalition to sort out Labor's mess. We are doing that with the NBN all around Australia. We are doing that in the electorate of Swan, where there are 28,000 premises ready for service today. I am sure there are many in the House who recollect that the total number of premises connected in all of Western Australia in 2013—


wait for it—


when we came to government, was 34.


After five years, only 34 premises in the whole of Western Australia had been connected.




Mr Brian Mitchell:
  What have you built in five years?




Mr IRONS:
  And the member for Lyons says, 'It was well underway'—it was well underway after five years. What an absolute disgrace. Do you know how many premises were connected in Swan? Eighteen.



Mr Brian Mitchell interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Lyons!




Mr IRONS:
  The minister's response continued:


Yet today—only slightly more than two years later—in just one electorate in Western Australia over 28,000 premises are ready for service. Indeed, when we came to government, Western Australia's NBN rollout was in such disarray that the primary contractor, Syntheo, had pulled out of that market.


This was another contract by the Labor government. Remember that contractor, Syntheo, you guys selected to roll out the NBN? Where are they? They pulled out of the market. Mr Fletcher continued:


So we have turned that situation around in a short period of time. Thanks to the advocacy of the member for Swan on behalf of his constituents, some 15,500 homes and businesses in Ascot, Belmont, Cloverdale, Perth, Redcliffe and Rivervale will see construction begin in the first quarter of 2017 …


To update the member for Lyons, we have now connected over 59,000 premises in Swan.




Mr Brian Mitchell:
  Yes, but it's all rubbish!




Mr IRONS:
  No, they're working well, mate. I've actually been out on the site. The NBN is being rolled out by the coalition government and is successful, particularly in my electorate of Swan.

Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (16:27):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Representation) Bill 2017 reflects the Australian government's ongoing commitment to the long-term sustainable use and development of Australia's fisheries resources.


The Australian government continues to work with all fisheries users—commercial, recreational and Indigenous—to ensure ecologically sustainable development and achieve the maximum benefit to the Australian community of this important and publicly owned resource.


Our fisheries management framework is internationally recognised as one of the best in the world. In 2015, no fish stock managed solely by the Commonwealth was subject to overfishing, ensuring the sustainability of Australia's fisheries for the benefit of present and future generations of Australians.


Commonwealth fisheries legislation primarily regulates the commercial harvest of fish stocks in Commonwealth fisheries to ensure catch rates and fish stocks are at sustainable levels. However, in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of recreational fishing occurring in Commonwealth waters.


By recognising and taking the interests of all users into account in the Commonwealth fisheries management framework, the government can enhance regulatory certainty and improve access to Commonwealth fish stocks consistent with their optimal use as a public resource.


As significant stakeholders in Commonwealth fisheries it is important that recreational fishers' interests can be readily identified and taken into consideration by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).


Recreational fishers have an interest in a number of fish stocks managed by the Australian government. Considering their interests as part of the fisheries management framework is important both for ensuring sustainable fish stocks and for optimising the benefits of our fisheries resources for the Australian community.


Proposed amendments will address this, ensuring that legislation keeps pace with the changes in use of Commonwealth waters and thus stays effective in ensuring sustainable management of the resource.


Fishing by Indigenous Australians should also be recognised as a sector in its own right in fisheries management regimes, including for any traditional customary fishing rights.


It is important that governments recognise and understand the strong relationship Indigenous people have with fishery resources and ensure the fisheries management frameworks appropriately accommodate sustainable cultural fishing through greater and more meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities.


The amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 will ensure that the interests of all fisheries users are adequately represented, and taken into consideration in fisheries management decisions.


This bill provides greater certainty to stakeholder groups regarding the extent to which their interests should be identified, represented and considered by AFMA.


It also allows for greater membership of all interested parties on management advisory committees.


The inclusion of a new objective in both acts ensures that legislation keeps pace with the changes in the use of Commonwealth-managed fish stocks, particularly given the increasing presence of recreational fishers in Commonwealth waters.


It improves transparency and provides formal mechanisms for recreational and Indigenous fishers to voice their views regarding proposed changes in management decisions.


The inclusion of an additional objective is consistent with representations from recreational fishers and Indigenous advisory bodies. Submissions by these sectors to the recent Productivity Commission inquiry into the regulation of Australian marine fisheries and aquaculture sectorscalled for legislative recognition of the two sectors as well as greater involvement in AFMA's decision-making framework.


In addition to a new objective, the bill amends the eligibility criteria for the appointment of AFMA commissioners. The criteria will be expanded to include the addition of expertise in matters relating to recreational and Indigenous fishing.


Broadening the eligibility criteria of AFMA commissioners to include expertise in matters relating to recreational and Indigenous fishers will enhance the capacity of the AFMA Commission to respond to future challenges in fisheries management.


Finally, the bill increases the maximum number of members on AFMA's management advisory committees from seven to 10.


It also includes a requirement for AFMA to actively seek, as far as practicable, recreational fishing members on relevant management advisory committees.


These amendments will ensure that there is greater opportunity for key fisheries stakeholders to be appropriately represented on management advisory committees.


Importantly, the bill strengthens the voice of recreational fishers and Indigenous stakeholders in regard to the management of Commonwealth fisheries without compromising the Commonwealth's world-class fisheries management framework.


I commend the bill to the House.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (16:32):  As the assistant minister indicated, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Representation) Bill 2017 is about giving recreational and Indigenous fishers a voice in Commonwealth decision making, and of course the opposition supports the proposition. We think it's a very important step in recognising both the value of recreational fishers and Indigenous fishers and their important contribution to the public debate wherever the Commonwealth has responsibility.


I'm very proud to represent an electorate which has more than its fair share of Australia's many recreational fishers. In fact, there are around five million of them, contributing more than $2 billion to the national economy. Of course, fishing is very much part of the Australian culture. It's as Australian as football and meat pies, I would suggest, and this is a group worthy of support.


And, as the minister has indicated, our Indigenous Australians have a very, very deep connection to both our waterways and our fishing resources. That needs to be recognised and respected. They too deserve some role in the decision-making process and of course have a great deal to offer in terms of advice to the Commonwealth on fishing matters. So we do support the legislation before the House.


I must say, though, that this has been in the making since prior to the 2013 election. Labor, in government, began the process of further engaging the rec fishers and Indigenous fishers sectors in Commonwealth decision making. I note that the coalition opposition at the time also promised to progress that engagement if elected at the 2013 election. It's fair to say that this has been an all-too-slow process.


I again reinforced Labor's commitment to the policy in an announcement on 18 June 2016—in other words, just prior to the last federal election. The coalition again met Labor's commitment, but here, again, we are almost at the end of 2017 and only now is legislation being put into effect to give fishers the voice they deserve. It's a little like the Forest Industry Advisory Committee and other stalled processes in forestry. Both fishers and forestry, of course, are portfolio areas of responsibilities which have been dropped from the title of the senior minister. We think that's regrettable, because we think that their role and contribution should be taken into account and fully and properly respected as such. So the opposition supports the bill, and we trust that the government will be very quick now to take all the necessary steps to ensure that the engagement is substantial and that the voice we expect to be given is given both to rec fishers and Indigenous fishers.


I'm very pleased to say that over recent years I've been an active member of the Parliamentary Friends of Recreational Fishers group. There's a regular breakfast here in Parliament House, as you probably know, Mr Deputy Speaker Irons. Sorry, I'm not a regular attender at the friends of fishers; I'm a regular attender of a breakfast held by the Australian Recreational Fishers Foundation, led by CEO Allan Hansard. At last year's event, in my own contribution to that event, I suggested that it was time that we have a parliamentary friends of fishers group in this place. It seems that we have one for just about every other interest in the parliament, and fishing is of interest to many members on both sides of the House. I'm pleased that that has now occurred, and particularly pleased that the member for Solomon has led the way there at my request. He has played a leading role in having the formation of that friendship group put in place. I know that the friendship group will keep a close check, and will look to the government to make sure that the hope given in terms of this legislation and the government's other commitment is fulfilled and that the rec fishers and Indigenous fishers get a proper voice in Commonwealth decision-making.

Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (16:27):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Representation) Bill 2017 reflects the Australian government's ongoing commitment to the long-term sustainable use and development of Australia's fisheries resources.


The Australian government continues to work with all fisheries users—commercial, recreational and Indigenous—to ensure ecologically sustainable development and achieve the maximum benefit to the Australian community of this important and publicly owned resource.


Our fisheries management framework is internationally recognised as one of the best in the world. In 2015, no fish stock managed solely by the Commonwealth was subject to overfishing, ensuring the sustainability of Australia's fisheries for the benefit of present and future generations of Australians.


Commonwealth fisheries legislation primarily regulates the commercial harvest of fish stocks in Commonwealth fisheries to ensure catch rates and fish stocks are at sustainable levels. However, in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of recreational fishing occurring in Commonwealth waters.


By recognising and taking the interests of all users into account in the Commonwealth fisheries management framework, the government can enhance regulatory certainty and improve access to Commonwealth fish stocks consistent with their optimal use as a public resource.


As significant stakeholders in Commonwealth fisheries it is important that recreational fishers' interests can be readily identified and taken into consideration by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA).


Recreational fishers have an interest in a number of fish stocks managed by the Australian government. Considering their interests as part of the fisheries management framework is important both for ensuring sustainable fish stocks and for optimising the benefits of our fisheries resources for the Australian community.


Proposed amendments will address this, ensuring that legislation keeps pace with the changes in use of Commonwealth waters and thus stays effective in ensuring sustainable management of the resource.


Fishing by Indigenous Australians should also be recognised as a sector in its own right in fisheries management regimes, including for any traditional customary fishing rights.


It is important that governments recognise and understand the strong relationship Indigenous people have with fishery resources and ensure the fisheries management frameworks appropriately accommodate sustainable cultural fishing through greater and more meaningful engagement with Indigenous communities.


The amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 will ensure that the interests of all fisheries users are adequately represented, and taken into consideration in fisheries management decisions.


This bill provides greater certainty to stakeholder groups regarding the extent to which their interests should be identified, represented and considered by AFMA.


It also allows for greater membership of all interested parties on management advisory committees.


The inclusion of a new objective in both acts ensures that legislation keeps pace with the changes in the use of Commonwealth-managed fish stocks, particularly given the increasing presence of recreational fishers in Commonwealth waters.


It improves transparency and provides formal mechanisms for recreational and Indigenous fishers to voice their views regarding proposed changes in management decisions.


The inclusion of an additional objective is consistent with representations from recreational fishers and Indigenous advisory bodies. Submissions by these sectors to the recent Productivity Commission inquiry into the regulation of Australian marine fisheries and aquaculture sectorscalled for legislative recognition of the two sectors as well as greater involvement in AFMA's decision-making framework.


In addition to a new objective, the bill amends the eligibility criteria for the appointment of AFMA commissioners. The criteria will be expanded to include the addition of expertise in matters relating to recreational and Indigenous fishing.


Broadening the eligibility criteria of AFMA commissioners to include expertise in matters relating to recreational and Indigenous fishers will enhance the capacity of the AFMA Commission to respond to future challenges in fisheries management.


Finally, the bill increases the maximum number of members on AFMA's management advisory committees from seven to 10.


It also includes a requirement for AFMA to actively seek, as far as practicable, recreational fishing members on relevant management advisory committees.


These amendments will ensure that there is greater opportunity for key fisheries stakeholders to be appropriately represented on management advisory committees.


Importantly, the bill strengthens the voice of recreational fishers and Indigenous stakeholders in regard to the management of Commonwealth fisheries without compromising the Commonwealth's world-class fisheries management framework.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (16:32):  As the assistant minister indicated, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Representation) Bill 2017 is about giving recreational and Indigenous fishers a voice in Commonwealth decision making, and of course the opposition supports the proposition. We think it's a very important step in recognising both the value of recreational fishers and Indigenous fishers and their important contribution to the public debate wherever the Commonwealth has responsibility.


I'm very proud to represent an electorate which has more than its fair share of Australia's many recreational fishers. In fact, there are around five million of them, contributing more than $2 billion to the national economy. Of course, fishing is very much part of the Australian culture. It's as Australian as football and meat pies, I would suggest, and this is a group worthy of support.


And, as the minister has indicated, our Indigenous Australians have a very, very deep connection to both our waterways and our fishing resources. That needs to be recognised and respected. They too deserve some role in the decision-making process and of course have a great deal to offer in terms of advice to the Commonwealth on fishing matters. So we do support the legislation before the House.


I must say, though, that this has been in the making since prior to the 2013 election.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (19:30):  Saturday, 2 December, will see the opening of the 2017 Blacktown City Art Prize competition—I'm pleased to have the member for Chifley here in the chamber. The competition is now in its 22nd year, and the prize is highly valued. There are cash prizes of $20,000 and acquisitive awards, and the prize attracts local, regional and national artists in drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics and mixed media.


But this year there's another reason why this event is so important. It will also be the occasion to officially rename the Blacktown Arts Centre in honour of the late Leo Kelly, who passed away on 24 January this year. Leo had an amazing passion for the arts. He wanted to encourage local artistic talent and performance space, and his ethos was that the western suburbs of Sydney should have equitable access for its citizens in recognition of their desire to participate in, view and enjoy art and culture in all its forms. Indeed, it was Leo Kelly who in 1996 moved the motion to establish the Blacktown Arts Centre. He instigated the Blacktown City Art Prize. He attended all of them and, despite his illness, he attended the function to announce last year's winners. He overcame strong opposition to the plan for an arts centre on its current site. He argued that his opponents had no alternative use for it and just wanted to sell it as a car park. But Leo had the foresight to recognise that the people of Western Sydney deserved and should have such a high-value centre of excellence.


Leo Kelly was a servant of local government. In fact, he was first elected to Blacktown City Council in 1980 and had served continuously since that time. He was mayor on three occasions, including during my period of service from 2004-08 and including a year in which I had the honour of serving as his deputy mayor. I found myself rifling through old boxes of campaign material from our election in 2004. It was Leo who, in 2003, suggested to me that we should run a ticket in ward 2—Labor hadn't elected two Labor members to that ward for decades. It's hard to imagine that that was 14 years ago. I remember saying to Leo: 'Look, if we're going to do this, I'm going to run this campaign. You're going to be doorknocking in Glenwood, and you're going to have to keep up with me.' I remember seeing him one day—we were doorknocking during the summer—and I lost him. I couldn't find him. It turned out someone in Glenwood had taken him in because he was covered with sweat and they were worried that he was going to expire in front of them. But Leo persisted, and we got up in 2004. That was the start of my career in public office.


He had an incredible vernacular. He created words like 'stuffwittery', which I'd never heard from anyone else. His voicemails were legendary. His voicemails would start: 'Leo here, Michelle'. He was a life member of the ALP, as is his beloved wife, Janet. I still remember, unfortunately, Janet coming to a mobile office of mine in Schofields towards the end of last year. It was there that she told me that he was sick and wasn't going to get better. He had just been elected to council again in those elections.


Leo did so much for Blacktown. He loved Blacktown. He was a true champion of Western Sydney, in everything from the establishment of parks and reserves to arts, as I discussed, and sport. He was passionate about the idea that local sporting groups should play on high-quality fields. He never believed that second-rate teams deserved second-rate grounds; he wanted everyone to have the highest quality facilities. He was passionate about child care. He was passionate about the staff of council more than anything. It was a testament to how much he was loved by all the staff by the attendance of so many of them at his funeral.


He was in the last weeks of his life when my baby Aurelia was born just before Christmas, and Janet messaged me the afternoon that she arrived: 'Congratulations to you on the birth of your daughter, a wonderful Christmas present. Leo not doing so well. Cancer spread to his brain. Just told him about the baby, and his reply was, ""I knew it was a girl.""' Janet, the dignity which you showed Leo in his final weeks was incredible.


To John and Melissa, his beloved grandchildren, Owen and James: he loved you so much. Owen, Leo considered you his son. He made a difference, and it's fitting that he'll be honoured in this way.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (16:00):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme was designed, created and fully funded by Labor in government, and it's one of the greatest social investments of our generation. Labor understood that the old system of disability support was broken and needed to be fixed. That's why we acted. When the NDIS is fully rolled out in 2019-20, more than 460,000 Australians with severe or profound disability will be receiving the care and support they need. For people with disability, their carers and their families, the NDIS will be truly transformational.


Unfortunately the government's planned rollout and growth of the scheme has not been up to standard. People with a disability and their supporters want and need the NDIS rollout to be made clear and much more efficient. In my electorate of Richmond I've been contacted many times by constituents or their carers who are experiencing delays and difficulties with accessing the NDIS in its initial rollout phase. One particular family advised me that they'd made a request to start a plan after being approved several months ago for the NDIS. They'd still not been contacted after very lengthy time frames, despite constant phone calls being made by both the daughter in the family and their social worker, and this was causing a great deal of stress for them, of course. The woman in question remains stuck in limbo in a local hospital. She urgently needs her NDIS plan to be implemented so that she can get a motorised wheelchair to provide her with some freedom and also to fund some form of housing so she can finally be discharged.


Another family who were extremely stressed had been waiting months after requesting a review of their current plan. They were promised, after several phone calls to the NDIA, that their case would be escalated. They were then advised, weeks later, that the request for review had been approved, but they could not guarantee how long the process would take. Fast-forward six weeks, and her two carers had not been paid a cent for their services. After contact was made with the minister's office, the problem was again escalated, and once again it was unable to progress, because of an administrative problem. Finally the changes that this family wanted did happen, but the fact is that these changes are relatively simple and straightforward. This family does have the ability to advocate on their own behalf, yet it still took so long. The review process is inadequate, and the time taken for reviews is simply unacceptable.


Whilst I understand that of course there are so many who have benefited from the rollout of this scheme, there are many participants who have issues with accessing this important service. Participants with psychosocial disability and those who struggle to navigate the system are most at risk of experiencing poor outcomes, as are people who are living in outer regional and remote and very remote areas and those with complex, specialised or high-intensity needs, and of course also our older participants. There are also lengthy waiting lists for some providers and types of support because of the absence of local providers, along with some concerns about quality. So I call on the Turnbull government to invest more resources to ensure that the quality of this rollout will improve to provide much better and more accessible services to those in our community who need the support the most and those who need to access the NDIS in a timely and efficient manner.

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2017-10-24,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:32):  It's a basic principle, fundamental to our system of financial regulation, that if someone is managing the investment of a large amount of other people's money we apply governance rules to ensure that investors have a reasonable chance of that money being deployed in their best interests. When it comes to bodies like banks, credit unions and super funds, we oversee them with APRA, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. We require them to have independent directors, we require them to meet strict reporting standards and to keep written policies, and we require them to act prudently to protect their members or customers' interests. 


There is, however, another kind of organisation that holds and invests billions of dollars of hardworking Australians' money. Each year, millions of dollars are being poured into what are called 'worker entitlement funds', controlled by union and employer organisation officials. These opaque funds are now worth around $2 billion. While they are supposed to pay and protect workers' entitlements, in reality some unions skim around $25 million every year from these funds. The money for these funds comes from employers who are forced to pay as much as $100 per employee per week, or more than $500,000 per year from a single employer. Around 30 per cent of enterprise agreements compel payments into funds just like these, and that figure is as high as 60 per cent in the CFMEU dominated building and construction industry. This is all money which could be going to employing more workers or be invested back into that company. 


Currently, the basic rules of good governance that we rightly apply to banks, credit unions and super funds do not apply to worker entitlement funds. They do not need to be managed by trained professionals or even by people of good character, they don't need independent directors, they don't need to be transparent or provide even the most basic of reporting, and they don't need to state in writing their policies on investment. In short, there is no requirement on them to act responsibly, to use workers' funds in their best interests, or even to tell them what they are doing with that money. 


This is yet another area of secrecy and corrupt self-service in the union movement uncovered by the Heydon royal commission. The trade union movement and their friends in their political wing, the Labor Party, do not like transparency. When they had the chance, the Labor Party abolished the ABCC and, with it, the powers needed to uncover union corruption and illegality. When we sought to investigate, the Labor Party tried to stop the Heydon royal commission happening at all. They called it a witch hunt. They called it politically biased. They attacked its commissioner on frivolous grounds. And they called its evidence 'smears'. They fought tooth and nail to avoid the Leader of the Opposition being required to testify. They sought to undermine it at every turn.


When the Leader of the Opposition testified, he was—in the words of the commissioner—'evasive', and gave cause for concern as to his credibility as a witness. When the Heydon royal commission had identified widespread union corruption, illegality and violence, and had demonstrated the damage unions were doing to workers, Labor voted down the reintroduction of a tough cop on the beat, and even were willing to force the country into a double-dissolution election to try and prevent its reinstatement. 


What do we find when we break through the secrecy and examine what unions are actually doing with their members' funds and their collective power? We find a CFMEU that has accrued fines of more than $12 million for illegal activities, and 90 CFMEU representatives before the courts on more than 1,300 charges. We find the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, saying on national television that it's okay for unions to break the law, that the unions are above the law. Most recently, we find a union picket line at Oaky Creek Mine, where officials threatened to rape the children of those who were simply trying to do their jobs. 


So, when it comes to the union movement, we desperately need transparency, and we need governance rules every bit as strong as those that pertain in the private sector. The bill imposes that transparency and those governance rules on unions and their schemes in the area of investing funds on behalf of workers. The need for this has been clearly demonstrated in recent years. There's more than $245 million of workers' money held in the Protect scheme, which ostensibly exists to provide workers with redundancy and income protection. That sounds perfectly good, doesn't it? That's fine. Employers are made to pay into it on their employees' behalf by arrangement with the Victorian Electrical Trades Union and National Electrical and Communications Association, NECA. 


So where does this money end up? It's invested for the benefit of the workers, to ensure that they have an income when they need it. Well, is it? Nearly $5 million of it is not. $4.5 million is funnelled straight into the coffers of ETU Victoria, and another $330,000 goes back to NECA. If it were not for the work of the royal commission, workers would never have known about this arrangement. They would never have been told, because there is no rule that forces the fund to tell the very workers it alleges and purports to protect. 


UPlus, another Victorian income protection scheme, is a joint venture between that worst of unions, the CFMEU, and insurer Coverforce. The scheme provides free travel and insurance and ambulance benefits to workers whose employers pay into it, but only those who belong to the CFMEU. If you're a law-abiding citizen and you don't want to join a union which has accrued record fines for illegality, then you are out of luck. It almost goes without saying, of course, that the scheme has also made around $810,000 a year in undisclosed payments to the CFMEU. 


Sadly, in my own state of Queensland, we have the Building Employees Redundancy Trust, sometimes referred to as BERT. It holds $130 million of workers' money and, like too much of the construction industry in this country, it is controlled by the CFMEU, along with the CEPU and the Queensland Major Contractors Association. The fund regularly uses money that should be helping workers who were made redundant to pay those who actually have a job. It has channelled millions into the unions and associations that control it and has even made illegal payments to striking workers. The CFMEU is so desperate to keep this cash cow that its Queensland secretary, Michael Ravbar, is currently in court facing penalties for boycotting Universal Cranes because their employees had the audacity to find an alternative fund that offered real value for money.


Something must be done to ensure that these funds act in the interests of their members, just as anyone else who holds millions of other people's money must do. This bill does just that. This bill will require funds to be run by people of good character—not a particularly unusual thing, you would think. This bill requires funds to have at least one independent voting director on their boards, and it will require the funds to be managed at arm's length. This bill will require workers' money to be responsibly invested and managed by trained professionals. This bill will require transparency in the form of regular reporting to workers, employers and the Registered Organisations Commission. This bill will require the registered unions and employer organisations that run these funds to have written policies on basic matters like how they make financial decisions, how they use credit cards and how they treat hospitality and gifts. Finally, this bill will put these funds under the proper regulation of the Registered Organisations Commission. The Registered Organisations Commission will monitor the funds. It will ensure that they comply with the law and check whether they are managing workers' money responsibly.


As the Heydon royal commission told us, we need to go further to ensure that workers are not compelled to get involved in schemes like these when they have no interest in doing so. This bill ensures that enterprise agreements and employment contracts cannot include terms that require people to contribute to election funds that are set up to fund the campaigns of people running for office in a union or employer group. The bill also bans the coercion of employers into contributing to specific union approved super funds, welfare funds or other worker benefit schemes like those we've been discussing. The pressure that unions have placed on employers to contribute to specific schemes is not in the interests of workers. As we've seen, it has often been applied because those schemes were to the direct financial benefit of the union, and this must stop.


Once again, we've discussed throughout this debate that the best solution to the blight of union corruption and the selling out of workers in this country is transparency. The unions have proven time and again that they cannot be trusted to obey the law or to act in their workers' interests. I will make a correction on that, because I firmly believe that not all unions are bad. Many unions do a great service to their members, and in fact I'd go so far as to say that we need unions in this country, because if it wasn't for unions then some unscrupulous employers would take advantage of their workers. I'm not against unions, and neither is this government. What we are against is the illegal conduct of unions who continue to break the law, who continue not to observe the rule of law, who continue to think that they are above the law. That's why this bill also requires unions, employer groups and employers to disclose any financial benefit they will receive from promoting or arranging insurance products or payments to workers' entitlements, training or welfare funds.


I recently had a group called MATES in Construction come and see me, just last week. They were concerned about how this bill would impact on them. MATES in Construction does a terrific job in the construction industry. MATES in Construction, as the name suggests, educates people working in the building industry, particularly about how to look after your mates who are working in the construction industry. The construction industry is renowned for high suicide rates and high rates of mental illness. MATES in Construction does a terrific job of teaching building and construction workers how to look for signs and symptoms in mates who might be suffering from mental illness. They were concerned that this bill might impact upon them. They went and saw the minister, and they came and saw me and a couple of my colleagues, and the bill was amended to appease their concerns. MATES In Construction should have no fears with this bill and nor should any other group, any other valid group, any other bona fide group, that is conducting training or welfare services to those who are working in the building and construction sector.


Workers need to know when a conflict of interest exists. Where their interests are being sold out for the benefit of their union or its officials, I'm confident that workers will take action to protect themselves and withdraw from or reform the unions that have abandoned them.


Sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is a steriliser that the government is determined to apply to the union movement and all of its corrupt practices. At the Heydon royal commission we saw the reintroduction of the ABCC, and also the introduction of the registered organisations act, the protecting vulnerable workers act and the corrupting benefits act. In the many years to come, when we reflect on the achievements of this government, our comprehensive and determined delivery in forcing the secretive and corruptive union movement into the light will be one of our enduring legacies. This bill is an important part of that mission, and I commend it to the House.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:47):  I rise to speak in favour of the amendment that's been moved by the member for Gorton. It focuses on and calls on this government to protect the penalty rates—the penalty rates that have been cut for over 700,000 workers—workers in retail, workers in hospitality, workers in pharmacy. The previous speaker didn't even make reference to the amendment, which would see those pay cuts restored for all of the workers who've had their pay cut, meaning that they would not cop this pay cut. The previous speaker and the government aren't even interested in protecting the pay of low-paid workers, some of the lowest-paid workers in our community.


I urge all of those on the government side to finally stand with Labor to protect the penalty rates for 700,000 low-paid workers. Since that penalty rate cut, we've seen other industries—hair and beauty, clubs and hotels—now also ask the Fair Work Commission to cut the penalty rates for their workers. These workers don't receive compensation for this pay cut. This is a minimum entitlement, a minimum wage, and there's been a straight wage cut.


I'd also like to set the record straight on a few things that the government is saying in relation to this bill. You'd think that they were living in some kind of alternative universe, that they were completely ignoring what is actually happening in the space of your rights at work and in the space of the ABCC. They're completely rewriting and changing history. Let's start with the royal commission. The Heydon royal commission was supposed to be independent and impartial, yet during the process of the royal commission, the commissioner himself, Dyson Heydon, agreed to be the keynote speaker at a Liberal fundraiser. Hardly impartial. Hardly independent. When you as the commissioner agree to go to a Liberal Party fundraiser, before the report is even handed down, I'd call that a little bit biased. It wouldn't even pass the pub test. Because of the findings of this particular commission, we now see legislation after legislation attacking unions—anti-worker, anti-union legislation. They took us to an election on the ABCC but hardly ever raised it during the election, then got the ABCC through, and now what's happened?


It's going so well for the government that the commissioner himself has had to resign because he knowingly broke the law; he knowingly broke the Fair Work Act. And yet they stand up here and talk about how great it is. You'd think there'd be some humility within the government—that they'd realise they've made a mistake. But, no, talking point after talking point still talks up how they needed to reintroduce the tough cop in the construction industry, who's had to resign because he broke the law. He knowingly broke the law. In fact, the minister recommended that he be reappointed to the role, knowing that he had broken the law. 


Then we get to what has happened this week. The ABCC legal counsel quit, citing that Hadgkiss's actions made the role untenable. The whole reason the government forced this country to an early election was on the back of the ABCC. The commissioner has quit, the legal counsel has had to quit because of the consequences of the commissioner, and yet they still stand up here and lecture us—lecture people in the Labor Party, lecture construction workers, lecture the union movement. 


Whilst the ABCC has been in place under this government, the hardest thing to stand here and say is that the union, unfortunately, was right: the number of construction deaths has gone up. There were 27 yesterday and 28 today and counting. That is because of this government's actions, deliberately weakening workplace health and safety on worksites. The ABCC, under their watch, is more interested in prosecuting union officials who fail to give 24 hours notification that they're walking onto a site, when that union official, in most instances, is walking onto that site because a construction worker has incurred a workplace injury. Some of the most grievous of those cases have been in Victoria. A union official walked onto a site because they received a call from a union member that a good friend and a delegate had fallen in the workplace. He died in the union official's arms. The company did the right thing and shut the job down. They called in counselling and the site went into grieving. Do you know what this government did, what the ABCC did? Issued a notice to the CFMEU: 'Why didn't you give 24 hours notification before entering that workplace?' The man was dying in the union official's arms, and the government doesn't talk about the workplace health and safety breaches—they ask why they didn't file the paperwork. Well, 24 hours after that man died, is there really a point to issuing a notification that you're going to walk on site? That is the audacity of the government, and that is where they're going. 


Then we get to the bill that we have before us. I need to set the record straight on a couple of things that were raised by the previous speaker and that also came up in question time. As I've said previously, the Queensland Police have said that they are not investigating any member of the Oaky North picket line for accusations suggesting that they would rape a child. That is wrong, and every single person in this place stands united in condemning any threats of child rape, any threats of child abuse and any actions of it. The Queensland Police have said, in The Australian—which is not a workers' paper, which is not a union paper—that they are not investigating that incident. Yet this government—the ministers and the speakers on this bill—used that for political purposes when there is no evidence that it was ever said. The miners at Oaky North have been locked out by their employer, Glencore, for over 117 days—miners, working people, who just want to go back to work. 


Today the Fair Work Commission basically issued a stunning rebuke against Glencore for their behaviour and conduct. They have ordered Glencore to order their security company to stop surveilling workers when they're at home. The commission declared that Glencore withdraw its direction in which it tried to discipline workers for being involved in the dispute. It has also said that it must stop the private security company applying military tactics to its anti-worker operations, likening union members to the Vietcong, and following union members and their families into schools and around their homes. 


This is the behaviour of the mining company in this dispute: they are following families, they have private security behaving like a military organisation and they are referring to these workers as the Vietcong. They've said openly to the commission, 'We know where every CFMEU member lives.' The company has handed over their personal addresses. This has come out in the commission. The Fair Work Commission has turned around and said to Glencore, 'Stop what you are doing to your own workers.' But not one member of the government has stood up and condemned Glencore. Not one member of the ministry has stood up and condemned this multinational. Instead, they seek to condemn the workers who have been locked out, are frustrated and just want to go back to work. This is the nature of this government.


You can understand why Labor is saying that this bill needs to go to a Senate committee to make sure what is trying to be done is fully understood. The member for Fisher, the previous speaker, said to MATES in Construction, a great organisation: 'Don't worry. We've amended the bill so that your organisation will not be affected.' I don't take the government and the minister at their word, which is why this bill's content should be fully examined.


Worker entitlements funds are a way unions and employers pool resources to support workers, to protect their entitlements and, importantly, to provide services workers may need, such as training, counselling, suicide prevention and OH&S officers, just to name a few. We've already heard about the great work that MATES in Construction do. They're necessary. Every year about 190 construction workers take their own lives. That's a high statistic. Very few other professions would have a suicide statistic that high. A construction worker is six times more likely to die of suicide than from an accident at work. About 5,500 construction workers attempt suicide each year and just under 1,000 of them are permanently disabled because of their attempt. In acknowledging this and knowing this, unions and employers helped establish and fund MATES in Construction.


MATES in Construction was established in Queensland in March 2008 by the building employer redundancy trust—one of the trusts and organisations that this government seeks to target in this bill. MATES in Construction believe that, as a result of this bill, they will lose about 18 per cent of their funding. They estimate that would see a cut to frontline services: a 40 per cent cut in staffing and services in Queensland, a 15 per cent to 20 per cent cut in staffing and services in Western Australia and the organisation having to close in South Australia. That is the impact that MATES in Construction believe this government's bill will have.


This 80-page bill is being rushed through this parliament. We don't really get the chance to explore the true impact. These are significant issues. If the government's intention is to stop unions from being able to provide these types of services to workers, then we on the Labor side cannot support it. There are far too many questions that are yet to be answered about the details of this bill and the impact that this bill will have. This is why it needs to be properly explored. 


How does what the bill imposes on registered organisations compare to regulations in place for corporations? Is the bill yet another layer of regulation over and above that that applies under other legislation, such as the fringe benefits tax act and the Corporations Act? How does the proposed deregistering scheme compare with what is in place for managed investment schemes? Again these are more questions that the government needs to answer. We are particularly concerned that the minister will have the power to flesh out details of this new regulatory scheme via regulations—so let's just leave it up to the minister, who knowingly appointed a commissioner who had broken the law. You can understand why we're a little bit sceptical on this side about giving that kind of power to the minister, who knowingly appointed someone who has had to resign because they had broken the law. 


Further, why would we not want to encourage more organisations like MATES in Construction? Perhaps the government fails to understand that in a number of workplaces, in a number of industries, employers and employees, through their union, do work collectively and collaboratively together to make sure people are safe at work. I've mentioned MATES in Construction, but there are other organisations that are, for example, tackling drugs, making sure that workers are fit and ready to work. There are lots of schemes being operated to ensure that workers have support. On Friday I will be on site in Victoria attending some toolbox meetings which the CFMEU run around DV prevention, to make sure that their members understand what their role is not just in terms of White Ribbon but in making sure that women are always safe. Will this organisation be at risk because of these changes? 


I urge the government to stop its attacks on unions and to start focusing on the real issues in Australian workplaces, like wage theft. Where is the legislation to tackle the chronic issue of wage theft in our country? Where is the government supporting Labor's amendment here today to reverse the cuts to penalty rates? These are the issues that we need to tackle in our workplaces. We do not need more rhetoric from the government or more attacks on unions that are getting on with the job to make sure not only that workers are safe but also that their work rights, their wages and their conditions are protected.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2017-10-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:02):  It may come as a surprise to the government, but sometimes people like to use their money to help other people. Not everything is about profit. Some might say, 'Well, you can come together collectively as a group of people, get in a community group, or a workers' group; you might want to pool your money and then use that to help out people who might be doing it a bit tough.' In many industries, like the construction industry and the electrical industry, that's something that workers have to deal with quite regularly because they are industries where a lot of people work for a short period of time when there is building going on, a piece of construction, and then they might find themselves without a job for the next little while. They will spend their whole lives going through many, many employers. Over the years in those industries the workers, with the agreement of employers, have managed to set up funds that the employers pay some money into, under an agreement with the workers, and those funds then sit there to be available to people when they fall on hard times—when they are out of a job for an extended period, for example, or when they find themselves injured or they get sick when they are off the job and are not covered by WorkCover. They might get income protection insurance at below market rates, for example. This happens because people have pooled their money together and said, 'We recognise that this is the nature of our industry and we want to look after each other.' This has worked very well in looking after people. Unless the government is going to say, 'We want to tighten up the unfair dismissal laws in the construction industry and the redundancy laws so that no-one ever gets sacked,' then it is going to be a feature of life in construction or in the electrical and plumbing trades that people will go through periods of work and not having work, and they will have to look for support in those times when they don't have work. 


So we've got these funds around the country that look after people in these industries, and they look after them in a number of ways. One is that they provide access to things like insurance at rates that are cheaper than they would be if you went to the market and got them yourself. A second thing they do—one of the main reasons for their existence—is to provide redundancy and income support for those periods when you're not working. And there are other services that they don't provide at a cost but because they're good things to do. For example, they provide counselling. We know that the suicide rates in the construction industry, in part because of the hours people work, are higher than average. What has happened over the years through people chipping in a little bit, a couple of dollars a week, and that money adding up is that there's now a fund, managed by workers and employers alike, to look after people in the industry. It means, for example, that if you find yourself doing it really tough then not only do you have access to financial support but there is someone to get on the phone to who will provide counselling—and you don't have to pay for it. That's not something that's done because they went out to tender, went to the market, and said, 'Who can give us the best possible rate?' No; it was seen as a good to look after the people in their community.


So we've got schemes that currently do this, in Victoria and right around the country, and they're serving their members very, very well. They can do it because they're run on a cooperative model. When they don't have to run everything at a profit they can do things like subsidise insurance, which they might not otherwise be able to do, and offer free counselling, which they wouldn't be able to do if they had to pay for everything at market rates. There is a basic understanding that if everyone pitches in a little bit to a central pool, and that central pool is managed properly—not like a corporation as a profit-making entity but with the money going back to the members in the industry—then everyone benefits. It allows these funds, for example, to make grants to training organisations to train people up so that there's safety in the workplace and people increase their skills.


Bear in mind that very often these funds are run by an equal mix of employer and union people. When funds go off to these training organisations it's not done because they're running things like a company, working out how they can make a profit, but to benefit everyone in the industry. It means that training can be offered in a way that doesn't impose additional costs on employers. Many of these training centres run without having to charge the people who front up, which means that employers get a benefit as well. They train people in aspects of construction, they train people in plumbing—not far from my electorate of Melbourne—and they do it right around the country. They can do this because when they get money from the workers they invest it, and when they get returns they can use them for these purposes that improve the lives of everyone in the industry.


This government looks at that and it hates it. It says, 'That should not be allowed, because these are not commercial, market-length transactions where we open up everything to the private sector.' It's the equivalent of saying: 'You can't go and join the RACV and pitch in your money and run things on a cooperative basis. Every time your car breaks down you have to go out to tender and find someone to come and look after it for you. If it costs you a bit more, so be it.' No. People have the right to come together and put their money into cooperative ventures, and that's exactly what is happening here. But the government wants to break it apart.


We saw a version of this with the Kennett government when they got their hands on local councils in Victoria and said: 'Councils aren't allowed to run things not for profit anymore. You have to contract everything out to the private sector.' Rates have gone up and, as a result, many councils are trying to pull things back in. They have council-run providers running a lot of their services. What we've learned in Victoria is that the whole process, which is embodied in this bill, of saying we have to do everything at market rates and make a profit out of it results in people getting fewer services but paying through the nose for them. We've seen it with electricity, we've seen it with councils and now the government is ideologically trying to do it to unions as well. It will mean that when the central fund, one of the funds governed by this legislation, says, 'We'd actually like to give a grant for some training to be run in the industry on a zero-cost or not-for-profit basis,' they won't be allowed to do it anymore. They won't be allowed to do it anymore under this bill because everything has to be paid for at market value. If you want to offer a bit of counselling to people, on my reading of this bill you won't be able to do that for free anymore because using money from the fund to pay for a service can only be done if you are giving it to someone offering the service at market value and at arm's length. It goes on and on.


It's typical of the government to give us an 80-page bill and say, 'Pass it now.' In the short time we've had it available to us to read, the bill has made us go, 'Hang on; this will actually make life very, very difficult for a number of services at the moment that are actually making people's lives better, only because they're not being run at a profit.' The government, for purely ideological reasons want to come in and say, 'You've got to reconstitute your board and you've got to rewrite your contracts,' without asking the first question of, 'Is the system actually working at the moment?' If the government actually ask that they will probably find that, by and large, it is. If there is a case for making some improvements, you would probably find some willing participants within the sector who'd say, 'We are happy to sit down and discuss improvements.' But that's not the government's approach. The government's approach is to bring in a bill that could grind to a halt the operations of some very worthwhile services and to say: 'Pass it. We are going to give you a couple of days to look at it.'


That suggests that the government's purpose is not at all to improve governance in the sector. Yet again this is purely an ideological stick to beat up people with. That's all it is. They say, 'We've had a royal commission that has recommended it.' It was a royal commission headed by someone who was going to go and speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser until he got found out. The government are quite happy to say, 'We'll have a royal commission into unions and particularly unions we don't like because they sit on a certain side of the political fence,' but, when there are allegations that Crown Casino have been tampering with pokie machines and causing people to lose money, they say, 'We couldn't possibly have an investigation into that.' That tells you everything about this government's priorities. So, pardon me, government, if, when you whack an 80-page bill on the table and say, 'Trust us; it's all about improving governance,' I don't believe you.


They have the gall to come in here and say, 'We want to improve the rule of law in areas like the construction industry.' I'm still waiting for the explanation from this government about why they appointed someone to head up the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, who has just had to resign because he broke the law that he was meant to enforce. He has admitted this in court. He knowingly went out and said to people: 'I know that the law gives people certain rights to meet their unions to discuss things like safety and so on in the lunch rooms, but I don't want you to tell anyone that. In fact, I want you to tell them the opposite.' He got his organisation to publish misleading information to workers and builders in the sector to say, 'No, you're not allowed to have these meetings,' when in fact, by law, they were allowed to. He got found out and he had to resign. All the while, it turns out the minister knew these allegations were hanging over his head. The same minister who is bringing this bill to us and saying, 'It's all about improving good governance,' has not given an explanation at all about why she appointed someone to head up the construction industry watchdog who broke the law that he was meant to enforce.


Meanwhile, if you look around the country at the moment, if you want to focus on something in industrial relations or fix up issues in the workplace, there's plenty to do. We've got a youth unemployment crisis in this country. Youth unemployment is always higher than general unemployment. Historically, every time we have a downturn, we know that young people get hit hard and youth unemployment spikes up. But what you usually find is that a couple of years after that the lines come back into sync and youth unemployment comes back to its normal levels—still higher than general unemployment, but the two lines come back into sync. What we found in this country since the GFC, though, was that youth unemployment spiked and stayed high. The lines haven't come back together. In other words, we have a situation where, when it comes to the workplace—which the government is telling us they're concerned about in this bill—there are now young people who, since the GFC, have never been able to find a job, and the unemployment rate for them has not come back to its historical norm. We've abolished entry-level jobs in this country to a large extent. They just don't exist anymore in the way that they used to, and young people are suffering. As a result, we have the stats of five young people applying for every one job advertisement, with youth unemployment at historical highs and no jobs for them to go into.


If the government were seriously concerned about addressing issues in the workforce, it would be dropping everything to deal with this youth unemployment crisis, because it is worse than it has been for several decades. I'm still waiting for the government to come up with a bill that tells us how they're going to address that—what nation-building infrastructure they're going to invest in to find jobs for young people or how we're going to make sure young people can work. But not a week goes by that they don't come up with another bill that attacks people's rights at work and disrupts services and systems that are working perfectly well. So, pardon me if we don't take you on trust, government, and if we don't accept that this is all just about tidying up some loose ends. When you're serious about dealing with some of the issues that are facing people at work, when you're serious about dealing with the fact that wage growth is at historic lows because you've spent the last three decades, often with Labor's support, changing the industrial laws so that people can't bargain—when you're serious about addressing that—come back with some proposals, and we'll take you seriously.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,14,1
"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (17:17):  Well, another day, and it's no surprise, as the member for Melbourne observed in his closing there, that we see yet another government bill—a trumped up Trump-style government bill—attacking unions, the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017. This is extraordinary, in terms of both substance and process. The process does need to be looked at from the outset. There are five schedules—80 pages—amending five pieces of legislation, with significant implications for employer groups and for unions. This needs detailed technical examination. It doesn't deserve to be rushed through the parliament as if somehow this is a crisis, as if this is urgent. It would behove the government to allow us to do our jobs as legislators and spend time actually reflecting on the clauses and the words, particularly given that apparently it's implementing some of the recommendations from that outrageous Heydon royal commission—which was quite some time ago, so it's difficult to understand what the urgency is. But the government of course is trying to rush it through. There may well be worthy bits, but you wouldn't really know, and you can't be confident in the time available. And, as the member for Melbourne and others have observed, you certainly cannot place any reliance anymore on this minister's word, given her appalling behaviour and given that there is still a lack of explanation around the affair with the ABCC commissioner.


It is based, as we see from the press release—a bit like the energy policy: it's government by press release or letter, these days; you don't have to release policy or modelling—on familiar nonsense about unions. Unions are apparently big business, and they're focused on making profits and not representing workers, and therefore we should just vote for this, which is utter garbage. Just because you say it, government, that doesn't actually make it true. Worker entitlement funds are jointly established by unions and businesses, and they operate primarily to ensure that workers' entitlements are protected. But they also have important secondary functions, and there should be no shame about that; there's no problem with their providing important services, including safety advice and services. Regarding the Heydon royal commission, apparently we're supposed to vote for this because it came out of a dodgy royal commission. I mean, give me a break: it's the same old conservative trick that we've seen through the decades. It started I think with the Queensland conservative government having a witch-hunt royal commission on, as they say, 'Red Ted' Theodore, when he was the Commonwealth Treasurer back in 1929-30. We saw the same outrageous, garbage trick played by the Court government on Carmen Lawrence when she was a senior minister in the Keating government. We see exactly the same trick that conservatives always pull: they misuse the powers of a royal commission. In this case, it is to get the opposition leader in the dock, get him on tellie being investigated by a former High Court judge. It is completely outrageous. He attended a Liberal Party fundraiser and we give it no credence whatsoever.


You really have to look at the context. We have made some important points in the second reading amendment. This fundamentally is a desperate attempt. If you say 'fair work' in the title, perhaps the government thinks that someone might be fooled that this is in some way fairer, in some way going to improve workplaces—



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  Indeed. Thank you, member for Brand. You are my muse here in this chamber. We have a packed gallery.


This is a desperate attempt to distract public attention from the fact that the government has no agenda to address wage stagnation or underemployment or rising inequality, and to distract people from remembering that the government is really only focused, as you see from their budget and legislative priorities, on the top end of town. We all get a tax cut. Everyone earning over $180,000 in this country gets a tax cut. Let's give it away! Fire up the nation's ATMs—$65½ billion company tax cut, including for Gina Rinehart and her mates in the next tranche! Defend to the death the unjust and highly regressive damaging and unsustainable tax breaks that go to high-income earners overwhelmingly. Not just stagnant wages though—and this is the piece de resistance—



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr HILL:
  That's right. Pop that into Hansard—is to actually cut wages. And, as the second reading amendment shows, the government could legislate now. They could put this bill aside, push it down the Notice Paper, let the parliament do its job, let us work through it clause by clause, let us reconcile it to your dodgy royal commission report and see whether it is one of the reasonable bits in there, and focus on stopping the wage cut for 700,000 low-income workers. That should be a priority for the parliament to legislate. 


Indeed, there is a bill on the Notice Paper—you shouldhave had enough time to look at it because it has been hanging around for months—that the Opposition Leader introduced to do exactly that. Perhaps, if plebiscites and surveys are the order of the day, you can have a survey and see what the Australian people think about penalty rate cuts. Try that on for size. 



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr HILL:
  No. Call an election. Try that. With regard to the penalty rate cut for hospitality, fast food, retail and pharmacy awards, fundamentally this is a wage cut for 700,000 workers. You can dress it up however you want; it is a wage cut, a wage cut, a wage cut. It is the thin end of the wedge, as we are already seeing, for millions of others. 


This is not a blank sheet. We are not designing society or the economy from scratch. We need to consider reality as we find it in the real world, outside this building, not on the IPA's magical happy place or on the whiteboard where they dream this rubbish up, but in the real world, in families and communities where young people and women will bear the brunt of these wage cuts, as the second reading amendment points to. 


The first point I would make is this is not inevitable. We are told there is a sense of inevitability. 'Oh well, the Fair Work Commission said this. It's a neoliberal happy trickle-down world. It's inevitable.' It's not. We choose. We can, and we have the responsibility to actively choose the kind of society we want. This is an unwanted and unnecessary change to the long-established economic and social structure in Australia. It goes to the heart of the kind of society we want to be. 


Labour is not—this is news to those opposite, the bean counters, the widgets, the Daleks—a normal economic input like electricity or rent, at least not outside the IPA's happy whiteboard place. Ethical and human concerns must be taken into account in workplace relations laws. The Australian community has long valued people working unsociable hours. They miss family events, they miss time with kids, they miss sports and they miss social events. Everyone else can have a day or a night out, but not those people working unsociable hours. And this stuff is important to the fabric of our communities, to the kind of place and country we want to be. It is often thankless work—shop workers, shelf packers, cleaners—people who make everyone else's Sundays relaxed should be valued. 



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  You're on my side, Member for Brand. Reducing penalty rates reduces the necessary respect and the value of time that should exist between employers and employees. Remember? Key point: it is not a normal economic input. These are human beings, with families and lives; they are part of society, not just rent or electricity. As a society we have every right to shape our economy to suit our way of life. We can choose to keep these arrangements, and the economic arguments that we somehow just have to ditch them are wrong.


The second point I would make is that penalty rates are a necessity for millions of Australian households. They rely on them to cover their expenses. They're not optional extras or executive bonuses. So what this wage cut for 700,000 people means—that the government is too gutless to actually stand up and stop—is that people will be forced to try and work more hours just to maintain their family's take-home pay, which of course is impossible for most people because of family or caring responsibilities or study. 


Secondly, if they can't work more hours to keep their same take-home pay, guess what? They lose household income, which worsens inequality, because, unsurprisingly from this mob, these wage cuts overwhelmingly affect lower-income workers. That in turn reduces spending in the real economy, because the people affected by these wage cuts spend every dollar of their pay. They are not pouring thousands of dollars extra into superannuation; they are not spending it on enormous overseas holidays; they are not piling it up in the bank. They spend it on their daily lives.


In terms of the economic impact, cutting wages is not an efficient way of boosting productivity or growth. It actually does the opposite, because reducing domestic spending reduces turnover in exactly the kind of businesses that are cutting wages. It is an unvirtuous reinforcing cycle. An average $3,500 per year will be reduced from full-time employees' wages. Thousands of people will be unable to spend thousands of dollars in local economies. Instead, these funds will be pocketed by businesses as profit for high-income earners, which means a less-positive impact on the economy, because these people, probably people in this room here, are more likely to save this money or spend it overseas, which doesn't add to our national prosperity.


With regard to employment, we're told that somehow you have to just roll over and suck it up, grin and bear it, because, somehow, it will create more jobs overall. This is based on a flawed version of the discredited trickle-down myth, which goes something like this: make doing business cheaper and it will increase aggregate profits and therefore employment will somehow increase, as business has more revenue with which to employ staff, and businesses will also remain open for longer hours as the cost of labour reduces. Yet the Fair Work Commission finds that the aggregate impact on employment rates of cutting penalty rates is negligible. So, all we have is a very weak case based on theory and anecdote, and it is not a proper basis on which to make policy or to justify such a massive change. The evidence, of course, is that larger businesses do not choose to remain open for longer and they don't invest labour savings into more jobs. Larger businesses, of course, employ as many people as they need to do the job—no more, no less. If they need more people they will employ them.


If a few businesses do open a bit longer, that doesn't mean that consumers will spend more. Most businesses in the affected industries are already open for long hours. There are plenty of opportunities for consumers to spend their money. Longer trading hours don't mean more money in the average consumer's pocket. People can't spend money they don't have—who knew! For any extra hours created here or there, as I said at the start, back to where we began, existing workers will be working those extra hours just to try to maintain their take-home pay. It doesn't create new jobs overall. It forces people to work longer for the money they already have.


If you think about timing—timing is everything, they say—even if you believe this nonsense theory this is the worst possible time in years, decades really, to cut wages, because wages have stagnated for the last five years. We are in the 20th quarter, I think probably the 21st consecutive quarter, since mid-2012 of falling wages growth for private sector workers. The most recent rate of growth was only around two per cent, the lowest since 1991. This consistent reduction in wage growth rate has resulted in real wages remaining stagnant for over 4.5 years, and in many cases actually declining in real terms.


We have the government over there introducing voluminous legislation to implement supposedly critically urgent recommendations from a dodgy royal commission that has hung around for ages—it is still unclear why it is so urgent—instead of focusing on something that actually matters to Australians. As I said, I dare you to have a plebiscite or a survey to see what people think of penalty rates cuts.


This is happening at the worst possible time. It shrinks the whole economy, because we create a negative cycle where wages remain depressed. Most sensible mainstream economists cite that average everyday Australians have identified lack of wage growth as one of the biggest problems facing the economy. It makes the cost of living even more difficult, it worsens inequality, it is bad for business, consumers spend less and, of course, it threatens budget projections.


The final point I want to touch on is something we've been whacked over the head about. When the Fair Work decision came out we said, 'This is going to set a pattern. This is going to flow on to other industries and other sectors.' We were told that that was wrong, it was not fair and we were making it up. Labor said it was the thin end of the wedge. We were told by the government: 'You're running a scare campaign. It's only these awards.' Well, now we're seeing the true agenda. This decision is spreading, right now: other awards, other sectors, other workers and other industries are pursuing these pay cuts. We've seen the application, already, from the restaurant and catering industry. There's talk of the hairdressing industry and many others. 


The decision itself is flawed, and that's why we should be prioritising legislation to fix this decision, not mucking around with voluminous legislation, shoving it through the House when the case hasn't been made. Some findings in the Fair Work Commission decision about fact and law do go beyond these industries. It's not a Labor scare. This is a considered, detailed analysis that commentators have made, and we are now seeing it happen in the Fair Work Commission. The kind of factors which the Fair Work Commission said justified these wage cuts include: existence of entry-level jobs, consumer expectations of weekend public holiday service, the potential for increasing jobs, and the disutility for employees not, on balance, preventing a reduction in rates. The fact that employees were earning just enough to cover their weekly expenses wouldn't prevent a reduction in rates. 


These exact same factors apply in numerous other industries. That's the text of the decision, and that's what we're seeing other sectors now jumping on board with, salivating for a wage cut, so they can pocket some profits. The industries most at risk are aged care and health care, nursing, transport, security, cleaning, construction, teachers, education workers working on weekends—such as sports coaches, mining workers, social, community, disability and homecare nurses. I'll probably be told by those opposite that that's a scare campaign. But it's not. Exactly the same conditions that underpin this flawed decision are flowing to other sectors right now. The decision is wrong. It was a flawed legal framework. There's a need to prevent it from being implemented and to fix the legislation. 


The final thing I'll point out is that it will also affect people on enterprise agreements. Some commentary is saying that people on enterprise agreements are immune. That is, frankly, rubbish, because in the real world the relevant award becomes a measuring stick. This will flow through. It is flowing through elsewhere, over time, even within this sector. If the government had a shred of decency and had any contact with the real world, they would introduce legislation now to fix this flawed decision.

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr ROB MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (17:32):  I feel for the member for Bruce. He was hoping to get an answer, but, clearly, no-one on the government side wants to defend this dodgy piece of legislation. I rise to speak about the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 which was introduced to the House last week. You can just guarantee it: another day, another government bill designed to attack workers' pay and conditions. The government has, once again, managed to find another way to try and rob Australians of their rights in the workplace. This time, they're targeting workers' entitlement funds, funds which were set up, due to the countless complaints against phoenix companies, to provide better security to employees against loss of their entitlements. 


In the manner that we've come to expect from this government, they're doing all they can to stop us from properly scrutinising this bill and from undertaking any real consultation with stakeholders. They want to rush this bill through the House faster than they can down a Cristal champagne or two by the harbour side. At the end of the day, it's just another measure to continue the government's absurd war against unions. It's clear that they simply don't understand the need for workers' rights, or the vital role that unions have played throughout the years. The minister is under some strange illusion that unions have become big businesses, focused on making profit instead of protecting the people they represent. It is an utter load of rubbish. 


This kind of arrogance could only come from those opposite, who have never done a hard day's work in their lives. They've never been a worker, never understood a worker, and never, ever, stood up for a worker. Maybe if they left their marble offices and their big velvet chairs once in a while they would see that Australia is made up of hardworking people—people who will be gravely affected by the loss of penalty rates of up to $77 a week. Workers' entitlement funds are put in place to make sure that workers' entitlements are protected, that workers are adequately trained, that the proper funding of OH&S officers is guaranteed, and that employees can access fundamental services like counselling support and suicide prevention. I'd love to see those opposite own up to this disgrace of a bill and tell Australians what it really means. It means the government are backing away from what is right, once again showing they're putting dollars first, even when it means ripping off everyday Australians.


The absurdity doesn't end there. The government have told us that they've based this bill on 10 recommendations by the Heydon royal commission—the Heydon royal commission. It isn't that hard to see that the previous pieces of legislation based on this disgraced royal commission have been a flop, and they simply can't be trusted. Put simply, the disgraced royal commission was a political witch-hunt, using $100 million of taxpayer money that has delivered nothing better for workplaces. In what universe is it appropriate that their hand-picked royal commissioner attends a Liberal Party fundraiser in the middle of a commission to do the government's political bidding? What did the disgraced commissioner do when we raised this inappropriate behaviour? He investigated himself! He thought he'd go and talk to the tough cop on the beat! So he sat there and said, 'Commissioner, have you done the wrong thing?' 'No, Commissioner, I haven't done the wrong thing.' 'Are you sure?' 'Yes, I'm positive. I'm 100 per cent sure.' 'That's okay, then. All is good. All is forgiven. Let's move on.' You couldn't make up this stupidity. 


Effectively, the government is trying to take away the independence of crucial unions and employers around Australia and put them under the umbrella of incompetent organisations like the IPA. You can be sure that all this does is replace real union advocacy with bureaucratic nonsense. The government want to stack these independent boards with Liberal Party stooges in an attempt to destroy fair working standards in this country. From a government that spruiks the need for less red tape, this measure is another broken promise as they push back efficiency to allow rolls and rolls of red tape to come in. The government claims these will be run by good people. Those are the minister's own words: 'good people'. Who exactly are they talking about? If we're talking about some of the government's good people, we're talking about Nigel Hadgkiss and Michael Lawler. What about Kathy Jackson or, of course, the Prime Minister's favourite, good old Godwin Grech? We know, when it comes to good character, the government has no credibility whatsoever. 


We on this side see that workers' entitlement funds benefit workers. They are managed transparently and responsibly, and are spent for the genuine benefit of Australian workers. You only have to look at the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to see how fast the government is to kick aside the matter of workers' rights. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was put in place to pay truck drivers a fair wage and to make sure, when they're out on the road, they can pay their bills and feed their families. But the second the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal attempted to bring in minimum wages in order to combat unsafe contracts—which are causing death and serious injuries on our roads, and in the trucking industry—the government went into an absolute frenzy: 'We can't have people being paid proper wages!' 


More than 200 truck drivers die in Australia each and every year. The government took the easy way out. Instead of addressing these deaths and protecting Australians, it completely destroyed the RSRT, turning a blind eye to the unbelievable conditions and pressures that truck drivers are expected to work under. This government, time and time again, ignores the advice of experts. When the National Transport Commission demonstrated the clear link between safety outcomes and truck driver pay rates, the government feigned ignorance. By axing the RSRT, the government took away protections for whistleblowers in the industry who were concerned about the safety of their workplaces, and took away their right to take leave without losing contracts. It was and is an appalling, short-sighted move by the government—just a way for them to point at something tangible, to give them a win during their time in government. 


We on this side of the House know better than to gamble with the lives of Australians. It's not a win when you make it easier for truckies to die on our roads while they're trying to make a living. It's not a win when, for political gain, you drive good men and women truck drivers to suicide. But just like the trucking industry, the construction industry has one of the highest levels of worker vulnerability. The construction industry relies on entitlement funds for payments regarding leave, termination of employment, contracts, awards or agreements provided for an employer to make to an employee.


Quite often the government will come in and want to attack the CFMEU. It's their plaything. I really think John Setka should be panicking about what the Prime Minister's up to. Is he looking over his fence day in day out? Why is he always on his back?


My son-in-law works in the construction industry, and I'm more than proud to stand with the CFMEU to know that they are going to, each and every day, make sure he can come home, make sure he has a safe workplace. Even today, we had a construction worker die on the job. And where was the government's empathy for the family or for the workers? It was nowhere to be seen. They just want to keep sprouting proven false allegations. And the disgusting work in question time today: fair dinkum; I don't know whether anyone had the misfortune of watching that. I remember the chief of the ADF saying, 'The standard you set is the standard you walk past.' Well, today we've seen the lowest standard of the most morally and ethically bankrupt and corrupt government in this nation's history. It was wrong. The CFMEU stands up each day and makes sure people have safe workplace practices. I like the idea of knowing that my six-month-old granddaughter is going to know that her dad's going to come home each day because the CFMEU is standing up to make sure that he's looked after—to make sure that he's paid and gets the entitlements that he's due, to make sure that he can come home safely and go to work again tomorrow. That's what it's about.


The government just want to kick the union as a plaything, but they've got no understanding, because of their arrogance and ignorance—just as they are ignorant and arrogant towards the 700,000 Australians who are going to be losing up to $77 a week. That's $77 a week that a family in Mernda could use to pack their kids' lunches. It's $77 a week that a young couple in Sunbury could set aside to pay their mortgage. And it's $77 a week that this government is taking out of the pockets of hardworking Australians. Why does the government think families shouldn't be able to sit around the table to share a meal and have some quality time? You see just how little they care when you look at their attacks on penalty rates. The fact is that penalty rates are in place because people working on weekends or working unsociable hours are missing out on what we value in Australia. My father was a printer at News Limited. It hurts me to say that he worked at News Limited! But he worked all his life. He missed out on birthdays, Christmases—you name it: everything—because he worked at night-time, just so he could have the rag out in the morning.


The McKell Institute report found that McEwen will be the second-worst impacted by penalty rate cuts in the whole of Australia. We're set to lose approximately $19 million a year out of the economy that this government is doing nothing about. I have heard countless stories from constituents who are affected by these penalty rate cuts. At our local Amcal Pharmacy in Craigieburn pharmacists are fighting for their fair share in wages. Amcal turned over a $50 million profit last year. And how did it repay its staff for their hard work? By cutting the pay of their workers, who already earned as little as $27 an hour, thanks to this government and to big businesses ripping off hardworking employees and making it harder for them to make ends meet. While our local pharmacists serve our community 24 hours a day, seven days a week, this government sits idly by while they lose out. The government is so completely out of touch that it thinks cutting penalty rates will improve job opportunities. The irony is that the government's own information shows that's factually untrue. The government fails to see outside the Sydney Harbour bubble. In the small towns in McEwen, where more businesses are being opened, that doesn't actually mean more jobs or a huge boost in trade. Cutting penalty rates means that people throughout Australia and in McEwen will have less money to spend, which means they won't be visiting those restaurants and shops. Small-town economies are bound to suffer, and that's just unacceptable. In electorates like McEwen, a high proportion of retail and hospitality workers earn less than their city counterparts already.


When regional workers are employed by firms that are not locally owned, the benefits leave our communities. The McKell Institute study shows that workers in 45 regional communities will lose $667 million per year from penalty rate cuts, and $289 million of that is expected to leave our regional electorates altogether—just to line the pockets of corporations in the city and, even worse, overseas. The research shows that more than 277,000 workers in regional communities will be hit by the cut to Sunday penalty rates. Most of the savings businesses owners stand to make will not feed back into local communities. 


The government are trying to stop unions from being part of the Australian workforce. They are trying to stop unions from providing crucial services to workers. We simply will not stand for that. They've done it before and they're doing it again with this bill. They'll keep coming and coming. Australian families and Australian workers know that the Australian Labor Party is there to stand in the way of these right-wing ideologues that run this pathetic government. It's disgusting, it's unjust and it just goes to show that, when it comes to Australian workers, only the Labor Party can be trusted.


The Prime Minister presides over the worst wage stagnation in years, though he did pretty well giving himself a $16,000 tax cut on 1 July. He keeps that nice and quiet, doesn't he? This government wants to continue to undermine workers and the unions. It's all words and no action when it comes to the government's plans to address wage stagnation, underemployment, rising inequity and really anything else, for that matter. Under this government big business gets tax cuts while Aussie workers get wage cuts. Labor will not stop fighting for workers' rights and exposing the truth behind this government's flawed and convoluted plans to empty workers' pockets and make sure that big businesses are looked after. If this bill were a dog, you'd take it out the back and shoot it. Maybe that's what needs to be done now.

"Khalil, Peter, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (17:46):  I too rise to speak on the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017. I cannot commence talking about this bill without making initial comments about the absolutely extraordinary attacks by this government on the union movement that played out this afternoon. We've seen outrageous raids on the offices of the Australian Workers' Union in Sydney and Melbourne. On the same day that this parliament is told that Malcolm Turnbull's cuts to the Australian Federal Police have meant serious crimes like drug smuggling cannot be properly investigated we see the extraordinary use of the AFP and taxpayer dollars to raid the offices of the Australian Workers' Union in Sydney and Melbourne.


The Turnbull government has openly directed the commission to start this witch-hunt. It's entirely responsible for this turn of events. It's an alarming misuse of ministerial power. It's an abuse of power, and it needs to be called out for that. The Liberals have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on their witch-hunt into unions. Their visceral anger and hatred towards the union movement and towards workers and their rights is absolutely disgraceful. They will stop at nothing in attacking workers and their representatives. We've seen that play out this afternoon in these extraordinary raids on the AWU.


Of course, this is a bit of deja vu. It's about the political incompetence and desperation of this government. We're seeing the NBN raids play out all over again. What did that get us? Absolutely nothing but more wasted taxpayer dollars. I believe that the Australian people will see this for the desperate act it is. It's an act of desperation by a desperate, pathetic government in the last throes of trying to figure out what to do with itself. 


At the outset, we're also extremely concerned that we're debating this bill, given that it has five schedules, running to a total of 80 pages, and was introduced only last Thursday, 19 October. Barely five days, including the weekend, is hardly sufficient to get across an extremely dense and technical bill. I note, too, that the member for Gorton, as shadow minister for employment, received a departmental briefing on this bill only yesterday. Several questions put on notice to the head of the department have not yet been answered. The government is clearly attempting to avoid scrutiny of this bill. In everything they do they seek to avoid scrutiny, responsibility, accountability and transparency. It's being rushed through this parliament and that is simply unacceptable. The government claims that this legislation's purpose is to implement various recommendations of the Heydon royal commission. We remember that, don't we? Tens of millions of dollars was wasted on that royal commission, on that witch-hunt. The Heydon royal commission, as many will remember, was presided over by an individual who attended Liberal Party fundraisers and whose sole aim was to do the political bidding of the then Abbott government. 


The explanatory memorandum states that this bill amends five separate pieces of legislation, and it will: first, put additional requirements on the government's financial reporting and financial disclosure requirements of 'worker entitlement funds'; second, prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from requiring or permitting contributions to any fund other than a superannuation fund, a registered worker entitlement fund or a registered charity; third, prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from permitting or requiring employee contributions to a union election fund; fourth, prohibit coercion of employers to pay amounts to a particular worker entitlement fund, superannuation fund, training fund, welfare fund or employee insurance scheme; fifth, put additional financial management and disclosure obligations on registered organisations; and, sixth, introduce new penalties for registered organisations' non-compliance with financial management disclosure and reporting requirements. 


It is quite clear, even in this summary, that this bill has significant implications for both unions and employer groups. But it is entirely reasonable to say that a detailed examination of the technical provisions in the bill is essential in order to fully ascertain what the full impact of the bill is and which groups will be affected. On this basis I note that Labor has attempted to have the bill examined by the Senate employment committee—in my view an extremely appropriate approach, given the density of this particular bill. Regrettably, the government has joined with a group of senators, led by departing Senator Nick Xenophon, to block Labor's efforts on that front. The inquiry the Senate is having on this bill will be forced to report on 10 November 2017, setting an almost impossible deadline for stakeholders to prepare submissions and evidence. This proposal represents yet another chapter in this government's relentless attacks on unions. I know the media is focused on what we're seeing play out at the AWU offices this afternoon; nonetheless, this is part of this government's relentless attack against unions and it is no less important, given how they're trying to rush this through the parliament. 


Of course, we know why they are doing this—the Liberals have always loathed the trade union movement. They've always hated the trade union movement. That's part of their DNA. Particularly disturbing is that those opposite remain obsessed with this ideologically driven antiworker agenda given the current environment of low wage growth and rising cost-of-living pressures. The latest Department of Employment Trends in federal enterprise bargaining report provides more evidence that the Turnbull government is presiding over record low wages growth and a 22-year low in approved enterprise agreements. According to the latest data, wages growth for enterprise agreements approved in the June quarter fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.7 per cent in March—a 26-year low. In addition to low wages growth, there were only 845 approved enterprise agreements in the June quarter—the lowest since 1995. It's staggering, then, that the International Monetary Fund and the OECD have both warned that declining union density and collective bargaining are contributing to stagnant wages and growing inequality. 


This government wants to further undermine workers and their unions. Cost-of-living pressures are a very real problem and are having a real impact on people's lives, and those people demand real solutions. Instead we have this bill, hastily introduced by those opposite. They hope they can sneakily rush it through the parliament, probably while all these raids are occurring this afternoon on the TV screens, hoping that no-one fully understands what they're actually doing because they haven't had the time to assess the bill. It's extremely telling that the government, in their disreputable attitude to this debate, are seeking to squeeze union-backed worker entitlement funds, such funds being defined as funds which are for the purpose of paying worker entitlements, including those in respect of leave, payments in lieu of leave, payments in relation to termination, other payments due contractually or under an award, and death benefits. These very funds were designed and set up by the unions to protect their workers and ensure that their lawful entitlements were paid by employers, something that we know does not always happen.


This bill seeks to limit when a worker entitlement fund can become or stay registered, including defining what sort of organisation can operate a fund. It prescribes what the make-up of the board can be and the way in which the assets of the fund can be used. The bill further establishes a subset of worker entitlement funds called single-employer funds, which are funds that are controlled by a single employer for the benefit of its own employees. It would appear that these single-employer funds essentially escape all of the regulations contained in the bill, other than the tax related ones, unless the operator of the fund elects for it to be a worker entitlement fund and applies to be registered. In reality, worker entitlement funds often operate in the interests of creating a source of finance for unions to provide training, OHS support and other services to their members, hence the bill's very real potential to undermine the benefits that some workers receive through these funds.


The bill also contains provisions which we understand would operate to prohibit enterprise agreements specifying that employers have to pay into training funds. To reiterate the question posed by the member for Gorton earlier, during his remarks: what is the justification for this, given that enterprise agreements are completely transparent, voted on by the workers, and Heydon himself, even given his background, conceded that the training funds provide a public good? What is the justification?


Several stakeholders have raised concerns about the significant uncertainty as to whether worker entitlement funds can continue to provide safety training and wellbeing services such as suicide prevention support and mental health and drug and alcohol counselling. These are extremely significant issues. At this point there are just too many unanswered questions about this bill for Labor even to get close to supporting it. Despite the minister's hot air in the media, where she laughably tried to cast unions as evil, profit-hungry entities, what the government is actually doing with this bill is limiting the legitimate activities of unions and limiting the legitimate sources of income for unions, which unions use, of course, to represent their members, as they are duty-bound to do. A press release issued by the Minister for Employment in September read:


Through cosy deals with big businesses, unions have become a big business in their own right, more focussed on making profits than representing people.


That is ridiculous. It shows the government's ideological and visceral hatred of the union movement. It's a slur. It's rubbish. Worker entitlement funds—which, by the way, are jointly established by unions and employers—operate, firstly, to ensure that workers' entitlements are protected and, secondly, to provide important services to workers: training, counselling support, suicide prevention and funding of OH&S officers, just to name a few. This government simply does not understand the genesis of worker entitlement funds and the important service that they provide. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it doesn't understand the basic needs of working Australians. That's apparent in its attacks today and in this bill.


In recent months we have seen this government stand idly by while some 700,000 hospitality workers nationwide have suffered cuts to their penalty rates and cuts in their take-home pay. According to research I commissioned from the Parliamentary Library, informed by figures in the ABS labour force survey, as many as 3,046 people in my electorate of Wills will be adversely impacted by these cuts. Some of the lowest-paid workers suffered an arbitrary pay cut of up to $77 per week. That's a lot of money for someone on a low income. It's the difference between putting food on the table or not. It's the difference between getting school clothes for your kids or not. It's the difference between being able to afford public transport or not. It is money that they could not afford to lose, and this government stood by and did nothing about it. It could have acted but it failed to do so.


I commend the second reading amendment moved by my friend the member for Gorton, as it once again calls on this government to do something for the 700,000 workers nationally who have had their take-home pay cut and to legislate to stop this egregious and unfair decision of the Fair Work Commission from taking effect. This government has no plan to arrest wage stagnation and no desire to do anything to protect workers. In stark contrast, the Labor opposition is committed to the strong economic conditions and fair and equitable industrial relations framework that will deliver a better standard of living for ordinary Australians.


We believe that every working Australian deserves a good wage and decent working conditions. We know that the best way to tackle poverty and reduce inequality is to ensure that every Australian who can work is able to get a decent job, and that's why Labor will always put jobs first. Labor is, of course, the party that works with the unions and union movement, business and industry. It's a party that works with all of these groups to create and secure decent jobs.


A couple of weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to hear Bill Kelty reflect on the role that he played as one of the authors of the accord between the trade union movement and the Labor governments of Hawke and Keating and the business community. This remarkably successful period in Australia's history is testament to the fruits of a productive relationship between capital and labour and what's potential and what's possible. It should be a lesson on the perils of the needlessly adversarial approach to industrial relations that is taken by this government. In cooperation, pay rises were achieved during this period, entitlements were expanded for workers, inflation was contained, unemployment numbers fell and the then Labor government was given the electoral authority to establish important public services, such as Medicare. I reflect on this golden era of Australian politics with some regret and angst because I know that this type of harmony and productivity will never exist under this government and Australians will be quite literally the poorer for it.


While we're not declining to give the bill a second reading in order for it to be subject to a Senate review—albeit an extremely short one—Labor do not support the proposition that is before the House. Labor will never support any measure which attacks workers and the unions who are so important to their livelihoods and, indeed, who are so important to the future of our nation.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:01):  I am a proud union member and I cannot possibly support this bill, the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017. I am proud to be a member of the Australian Services Union and I'm also proud to be a member of the Commonwealth Public Sector Union. I am a very strong believer in the power of the collective. That is the strength of the unions' work. It has only ever been the Labor Party and the unions who have fought for equality. This government seem to want to grow inequality. They want to achieve this by attacking the only people and entities that have ever stood up against the government's mistreatment of workers. There has been attack after attack, untruth after untruth, just so the government can assist their big business mates and give them a $65 billion tax cut without pesky Labor and the unions fighting for useful things like access to free health care, access to quality education for all, workers' rights and social inclusion and equality. There has been attack after attack by the Turnbull government and, with every blow, we stand united and fight back because workers united will never be defeated.


The unions that I am a member of are fighting against some of the shocking inequality and cuts that the Turnbull government is forcing on people. The Australian Services Union has been a strong advocate for the NDIS, but, under the guidance of the coalition, the aspirations for the NDIS in assisting the most marginalised group of people have been completely lost. The ASU has been vocal against the Turnbull government and its mishandling of the NDIS, and I am proud to be a member of a union that stands up to protect the NDIS and workers.


Then there is the CPSU. Haven't they experienced an absolute battering from the Turnbull government? There have been cuts to the Department of Social Services, cuts to the Australian tax office in Townsville and cuts to the services provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Townsville. It has been cut after cut after cut. This union has stood up and fought not only for its members but for the most vulnerable people in our society. Their work is just amazing, and I want to particularly note the work of the National Secretary, Nadine Flood, and the Queensland state secretary, Bill Marklew, who have been relentless in their fight against the Turnbull government's unfair cuts.


Today we see another attack on unions with this bill. The Turnbull government is trying to rush this bill through the parliament without any proper scrutiny or stakeholder investigation. They are trying to undermine the process and get this nonsense bill, which is attacking unions, through the parliament as quickly as possible without the community uproar. This bill has significant implications for workers who benefit from their entitlements being protected through funds, including services like counselling, training, occupational health and safety, and support services that these funds invest in.


The government's purpose is to use this bill to limit the legitimate activities and source of income of unions, because they don't understand the genius of worker entitlement funds and the important services that they provide. A worker entitlement fund is defined as a fund that is for the purpose of, or purposes including, paying worker entitlements and death benefits. Worker entitlements are defined as including payments in respect of leave; payments in lieu of leave; payments in relation to termination of employment, whether ETPs or not; and any payments that contracts, awards or agreements provide for an employer to make to an employee. Worker entitlement funds—which, by the way, are jointly established by unions and employers—operate, firstly, to ensure that worker entitlements are protected, and, secondly, to provide important services to workers: training, counselling support, suicide prevention, and funding of occupational health and safety officers, just to name a few.


This bill puts additional requirements on the governance, financial reporting and financial disclosure requirements of worker entitlement funds; prohibits awards or enterprise agreements from requiring or permitting contributions to any fund other than a superannuation fund, a registered worker entitlement fund or a registered charity; prohibits awards or enterprise agreements from permitting or requiring employee contributions to a union election fund; prohibits coercion of employers to pay amounts to a particular worker entitlement fund, superannuation fund, training fund, welfare fund or employee insurance scheme; puts additional financial management and disclosure obligations on registered organisations; and introduces new penalties for registered organisations' noncompliance with financial management, disclosure and reporting requirements. 


This bill places limits on when a worker entitlement fund can be registered or stay registered, including what sort of organisation can operate the fund, the make-up of the board of the fund and the way in which the assets of the fund can be used. The stakeholders have raised concerns that there is significant uncertainty about whether worker entitlement funds can continue to provide safety training and wellbeing services, such as suicide prevention and mental health support, and drug and alcohol counselling. As someone who has had 15 years experience working in the mental health sector, I am particularly concerned about that fact. 


In particular, I am incredibly concerned over the impact this bill may have upon the excellent work undertaken by MATES in Construction, which is in the direct firing line of this bill. Changes in this bill have the potential to negatively impact upon MATES in Construction. MATES in Construction is a charity established in 2008 to reduce the high level of suicide among Australian construction workers. It was established in response to a major report on suicide, the AISRAP report, in the Queensland commercial building and construction industry. This report found that suicide rates in the industry were higher than the Australian average for men and that youth suicide in the industry could be as much as 2.38 times higher than it is for other young Australian men. Every year, 190 Australians working in the construction industry take their own lives. That figure is staggering, and MATES in Construction is there to assist construction workers and their families through these devastating and tough times. They do this by suicide prevention community development programs on sites. They support workers in need of help through case management and a 24/7 helpline. Together with OzHelp Foundation, they also provide Life Skills Toolbox training to apprentices and young workers. 


If you don't believe me, then allow me to read a letter I received from a Herbert constituent today regarding MATES in Construction and this bill. The constituent asks that I do not use her name, as she is fearful that her husband's employer may identify him. The letter reads:


To the Sitting Member, 


I bring to your attention as the wife of a union member the Bill the Turnbull Government are introducing into Parliament this week, the Fair Work Laws amendment (proper use of the workers benefits) bill 2017. 


My husband told me about this after a CFMEU sub-branch meeting last Thursday night. 


Our family has had to deal with the devastating tragedy of losing a child, personal illness and severe depression. 


Without the services of the Union's Mates In Construction, anything could have happened to my family. 


The threat of this Bill getting up and the blue-collar working class battlers losing the ability to use Mates In Construction suicide prevention assistance program and free counselling program for families including children would be devastating. I fear with this proposed bill all will be lost and many families will be disadvantaged, as we would have been. MATES in Construction gave us a funeral benefit that covered the cost of giving our child a dignified send-off. It will be a sad day if this bill gets over the line and a grim future for the generations to come if this government continues to take away the hard-fought entitlements that working-class people have continued to fight for to keep government from looking after the elite big end of town. 


Yours sincerely, 


Proud working-class union family in Townsville. 


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, these are the lives of real families that you aim to detrimentally affect as a result of this bill. This is the story of a family who has been through hardships that no family should ever have to suffer, a family that sought hope and help from MATES in Construction. MATES in Construction was the beacon of light for this family in very tough times, and I will not allow the Turnbull government to attack this vital service. I will fight for the workers in the Herbert community. I will fight for my comrades, and I will fight against this bill. It is vicious and malicious that the Turnbull government would attack this program just because MATES in Construction partners include the AMWU and the CFMEU. Causing any sort of detriment to an organisation that is purely there to help those in the construction industry with suicide prevention and mental health awareness, and to do so purely because it has links to unions, is abhorrent and disgusting. There is union bashing and then there is this. This is just plain outrageous by the Turnbull government. To put MATES in Construction under pressure, an organisation that assists an industry to decrease high suicide rates, is just downright wrong. 


It is beyond comprehension, at a time when even the IMF and the OECD are warning that declining union density and collective bargaining are contributing to stagnant wages and growing inequality, that this government wants to further undermine workers and their unions. The Turnbull government is desperately trying to distract the public from the fact that it has no agenda to address wage stagnation, underemployment, unemployment and rising inequality—and, for that matter, anything else. Coalition governments will continually try to undercut and attack unions. But Labor and the unions will continue to do what we do best when we are under attack: stand up and fight back.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (18:12):  There is no limit to the willingness of this government to use the extraordinary powers of the state to go after their political opponents for political reasons. In this parliament today we have seen some extraordinary circumstances. The government, in the House of Representatives, had one of their ministers stand up in parliament and make some absolutely outrageous observations about their political opponents on the other side of the House. The reason they did this? Because we had the temerity to expose some weaknesses and some problems with their administration of the Australian Federal Police. 


A few moments before question time we saw the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police tell a Senate estimates committee that staff cuts to the Australian Federal Police—we understand about 117 jobs—and budget cuts to the Australian Federal Police were interfering with their capacity to conduct drug raids. We understand that the ABC has seen documents from senior sources within the New South Wales branch of the Australian Federal Police saying those very same things: staff cuts are interfering with their capacity to conduct drug raids. 


Yet, at the very same time that evidence was being given and the minister was standing up in the House saying all sorts of slanderous things, the police had the capacity to be planning and conducting a raid on union offices. 'Staff cuts mean we can't conduct operations against drug smugglers and criminals, but we've got enough staff to raid the offices of the Australian Workers' Union about an alleged event that is alleged to have occurred 10 years ago.' I am sure that most Australians are scratching their heads and saying, 'Where are this government's priorities?' 'We haven't got enough staff to go after drug smugglers, but we've got enough staff to put on an operation to go after our political opponents.'


We have become anaesthetised to this government's willingness to use the forums of parliament, day after day after day, to slander law-abiding Australian citizens who do nothing but dedicate their lives to protecting the rights and conditions of their fellow workers. They are a target as far as this government is concerned because they are political opponents as far as this government is concerned. We have become anaesthetised to this government's willingness to use the legislative instruments of this place to go after their political opponents. In fact, you know it's a sitting week in Canberra because the government's got a bill before the parliament which is going after workers and their representatives. That's how you know when parliament's sitting; they go after workers and their representatives. You've got that fool of a Treasurer who goes on the radio this morning and says, 'We've got to do something about inclusive growth.' Then, a few hours later, he stands up in parliament and attacks unions and the representatives who are trying to do something about dealing with inequality in this country. 


Australians are scratching their heads. They know that this government will leave no stone unturned in going after their political enemies, using the protections available in this place to slander and defame law-abiding citizens; and using the legislative instruments of this place to attack the very institutions whose sole purpose is to look after workers' rights, protect their rights and conditions and ensure that they get some wage equality in this country. They will leave no stone unturned to use the legislative instruments of this place to go after those organisations. 


And yet today we see that is not enough: 'We have to go further. We are going to use the police force to go after our political enemies.' This at the very same time that the police force is telling parliament, 'We do not have the resources to go after criminals and drug importers and other people who legitimately should be attracting the police enforcement efforts of this country,' because this government has cut the resources to the AFP. And the minister who is responsible for this legislation before the House today thought it was more important that she instruct the AFP and the Fair Work Commission to have them go after this union. It is nothing short of a disgrace! The minister deserves to be condemned. The Prime Minister needs to be condemned. Is it any wonder that there is no member of the coalition government who is willing to come into this place and defend their actions and defend their legislation? 


It's not only the legislative instruments and the police force of this country that the government are using to go after their political enemies; they are doing it as an employer as well. They are doing it as an employer as well. There is not a day in this country where good, hardworking members of the Australian Public Service aren't putting themselves on the line to represent the government and its policies, whether they agree with them or not, and to ensure that they are providing the service that the Australian public deserves and expects of their government. They don't get paid well. They don't get paid as well as you and me, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough. They certainly haven't enjoyed the pay rises that members of parliament and ministers of government have enjoyed over the last five years.


In fact, let's look at what's happening in the Federal Court of Australia. The work of the Federal Court and the Family Court is incredibly important to the Australian community. Court staff often deal with some of the most difficult cases. Funding and staffing of our federal courts have been a challenge for a long, long time. The courts have generally had a strong working relationship with their staff and their union representatives, but this has broken down in recent times. It has broken down under the decisions of this government. In June this year, staff overwhelmingly rejected an enterprise agreement, with a 90 per cent vote against it. After four years of a pay freeze, staff were offered an agreement which proposed substantial cuts to conditions and money in exchange for a one per cent per annum pay increase. Now, you don't need to be a member of Mensa to understand that a one per cent per annum wage increase is actually a pay cut, because of inflation and other cuts to conditions. But instead of attempting to negotiate in good faith with the staff and their representatives, the government is slamming the door shut.


Well, members on this side of the House understand the important role performed by members of our court's staff. We understand that they are on the front line, just as the staff in this place are often on the front line, standing between the politicians, the ministers and the government in this place and the members of the public and what they expect of their government. We on this side think they deserve a fair and decent pay rise. Labor supports a pay rise for these people that will at least see them keeping pace with the cost of living without having to trade off hard-fought-for conditions.


If we had to spend this afternoon debating a bill to do with industrial relations and the rights of workers and their representatives in this country, these are the issues we should have been dealing with—things that are within the direct control and interest of this government and that it turns its back on, at the very same time it is using the instruments, the forces—the police force—of our government to go after its political enemies. Is there no level to which this government will not stoop? If there is a decent member on the other side of the House, they will stand up in this parliament today and condemn the actions of their government as an employer, condemn the actions of their government as a legislator and condemn the actions of their government as an executive, for using the police force of this state for nothing more than political purposes and diverting resources away from their proper purpose.


If we are to debate an issue that matters to the Australian people, an issue that is relevant, these are the things and this is the legislation we should be debating today, not this stuff, which is nothing short of a political attack on those who seek to represent workers and those who are dedicating their lives to ensuring that people who go to work every day—whether in our courts, in our public sector, on a building site, in the transport industry or wherever, in a small business around the country—get the wages and conditions they deserve, and perhaps a bit of a pay rise, and the dignity they deserve day in, day out.


This legislation is nothing short of an attack on the political enemies of this government And I can tell you: the numbers of those who have a grudge with this government are growing day after day—this government's mismanagement of everything from the NBN to the economy, their attack on workers' rights, their failure to do anything about inequality in this country. The workers of Australia, the people of Australia, have worked them out, and they're coming after them.

"Mitchell, Brian, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (18:23):  Like the member for Whitlam, I came in here prepared to speak on a bill before the House—the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017—which of course I will do. But the raids today have to be dealt with. What an absolutely disgraceful misuse of government power to allow a police force to be used in this way, to use the power of the state against your political enemies. It should send a shiver down the spine of anybody who cares about the way a democracy should run—to use the power of the state, the police, against your political enemies. And what crime are we talking about? An allegation that 10 years ago some paperwork wasn't done. That warrants a police raid? It is absolutely outrageous, particularly when you think that just in the last few months Nigel Hadgkiss, the minister's hand-picked henchman at the building commission, resigned in disgrace for breaking the law. This man, the right hand of the employment minister, actually broke the law. Were the police called in? Was he dragged away in handcuffs? Was there a raid on the minister's office? No. The man quietly resigned, was quietly sent on his way.


And then we learnt that the minister knew of his transgression for a full year and kept him in the office. So it's okay when your friends break the law, but woe betide anybody you disagree with, woe betide anybody that disagrees with this government, because the full force of the state will be down on your head. There will be NBN raids against senators for speaking out against the NBN policy of this government. There will be AWU raids against the union from 10 years ago. It just beggars belief that we live in a democracy in the 21st century and these are the depths that this government and this Prime Minister—who, prior to being in politics, was well known as a lawyer and somewhat of a social progressive—will go to. This is how far he has descended. This is the abyss that he has come to in his desperate attempt to cling to government. Nothing is too low for this Prime Minister, as he clings to government, as he grapples with the right wing of his own party. 


I can't understand it. When I know police resources are stretched and we are told all the time that they have to make choices about what they can and what they can't do. In Tasmania, we've got five AFP officers for the entire state. I'm pleased to say that the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, has promised that a Labor government will restore AFP officers to Hobart Airport, and not before time. AFP officers were taken out of service by this government. We will restore those officers. 


Just yesterday, a pair of bikies was dragged off a plane at Hobart Airport. I believe Senator Abetz and Senator Bushby were on the plane. I'm not sure if the officers dragged the wrong people off the plane, but a pair of bikies were dragged off the plan. They weren't taken off the plane by AFP officers. That plane was on the tarmac and Tasmanian police had to be called in. They had to drive into the airport—because they're not based at the airport—and take the bikies off, and then the plane could go on its way. There was an hour delay, because Tasmanian police had to be called out because AFP officers are not based at the airport. That's the effect of this government. There are no AFP officers at Hobart Airport, but you've got AFP officers to raid union offices for alleged transgressions of 10 years ago. 


Why is this government so keen to push this latest legislation before us through? Because it deals with their political enemies. It is like groundhog day. Ten years ago, the former coalition government, the Howard government, thought it would be a brilliant idea to take on the workers of this country with that dreadful Work Choices legislation. 'That'd be a good idea!    Let's take on the unions and take on the workers of this country, cut their conditions, cut their pay, cut their penalty rates.' That worked out really well! Labor was swept into office in 2007.


We have an election in two years time. If you want to go to an election on this issue—the issue of taking on workers, reducing penalty rates, cutting workers' conditions, keeping wages flat and keeping work insecure—we would be very happy to accommodate you. The workers of this country—the employees, the cashiers, the office staff, the police, the nurses, the teachers—deserve better than what they're getting from this government. This government is trying to make it easier and easier to cut workers' pay, to cut workers' conditions, to make work more insecure, to make work more flexible for the employer, and to take away the rights, the conditions and the fairness of what it means to be a worker and a citizen in this country. 


We've just seen the disgraceful, unbelievable situation where penalty rates in this country were actually reduced, at a time when wages have never been flatter. Since records started wages have never been flatter, and you've reduced penalty rates. Corporate profits are at an all-time high, a record high. So let's reduce the penalty rates for people working on Sundays. Let's make it harder for them to make ends meet. With power prices going through the roof, let's make it harder for people who depend on Sunday penalty rates to pay their bills. Bravo! Bravo! While you're cutting taxes for millionaires and people earning over $180,000 a year, you're making it harder for people on modest incomes to make a living in this country. What an absolute disgrace you are. In Tasmania, United Voice—

"Wallace, Andrew, MP",LP,2017-10-24,"



Mr WALLACE
 (Fisher) (16:32):  It's a basic principle, fundamental to our system of financial regulation, that if someone is managing the investment of a large amount of other people's money we apply governance rules to ensure that investors have a reasonable chance of that money being deployed in their best interests. When it comes to bodies like banks, credit unions and super funds, we oversee them with APRA, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. We require them to have independent directors, we require them to meet strict reporting standards and to keep written policies, and we require them to act prudently to protect their members or customers' interests. 


There is, however, another kind of organisation that holds and invests billions of dollars of hardworking Australians' money. Each year, millions of dollars are being poured into what are called 'worker entitlement funds', controlled by union and employer organisation officials. These opaque funds are now worth around $2 billion. While they are supposed to pay and protect workers' entitlements, in reality some unions skim around $25 million every year from these funds. The money for these funds comes from employers who are forced to pay as much as $100 per employee per week, or more than $500,000 per year from a single employer. Around 30 per cent of enterprise agreements compel payments into funds just like these, and that figure is as high as 60 per cent in the CFMEU dominated building and construction industry. This is all money which could be going to employing more workers or be invested back into that company. 


Currently, the basic rules of good governance that we rightly apply to banks, credit unions and super funds do not apply to worker entitlement funds. They do not need to be managed by trained professionals or even by people of good character, they don't need independent directors, they don't need to be transparent or provide even the most basic of reporting, and they don't need to state in writing their policies on investment. In short, there is no requirement on them to act responsibly, to use workers' funds in their best interests, or even to tell them what they are doing with that money. 


This is yet another area of secrecy and corrupt self-service in the union movement uncovered by the Heydon royal commission. The trade union movement and their friends in their political wing, the Labor Party, do not like transparency. When they had the chance, the Labor Party abolished the ABCC and, with it, the powers needed to uncover union corruption and illegality. When we sought to investigate, the Labor Party tried to stop the Heydon royal commission happening at all. They called it a witch hunt. They called it politically biased. They attacked its commissioner on frivolous grounds. And they called its evidence 'smears'. They fought tooth and nail to avoid the Leader of the Opposition being required to testify. They sought to undermine it at every turn.


When the Leader of the Opposition testified, he was—in the words of the commissioner—'evasive', and gave cause for concern as to his credibility as a witness. When the Heydon royal commission had identified widespread union corruption, illegality and violence, and had demonstrated the damage unions were doing to workers, Labor voted down the reintroduction of a tough cop on the beat, and even were willing to force the country into a double-dissolution election to try and prevent its reinstatement. 


What do we find when we break through the secrecy and examine what unions are actually doing with their members' funds and their collective power? We find a CFMEU that has accrued fines of more than $12 million for illegal activities, and 90 CFMEU representatives before the courts on more than 1,300 charges. We find the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, saying on national television that it's okay for unions to break the law, that the unions are above the law. Most recently, we find a union picket line at Oaky Creek Mine, where officials threatened to rape the children of those who were simply trying to do their jobs. 


So, when it comes to the union movement, we desperately need transparency, and we need governance rules every bit as strong as those that pertain in the private sector. The bill imposes that transparency and those governance rules on unions and their schemes in the area of investing funds on behalf of workers. The need for this has been clearly demonstrated in recent years. There's more than $245 million of workers' money held in the Protect scheme, which ostensibly exists to provide workers with redundancy and income protection. That sounds perfectly good, doesn't it? That's fine. Employers are made to pay into it on their employees' behalf by arrangement with the Victorian Electrical Trades Union and National Electrical and Communications Association, NECA. 


So where does this money end up? It's invested for the benefit of the workers, to ensure that they have an income when they need it. Well, is it? Nearly $5 million of it is not. $4.5 million is funnelled straight into the coffers of ETU Victoria, and another $330,000 goes back to NECA. If it were not for the work of the royal commission, workers would never have known about this arrangement. They would never have been told, because there is no rule that forces the fund to tell the very workers it alleges and purports to protect. 


UPlus, another Victorian income protection scheme, is a joint venture between that worst of unions, the CFMEU, and insurer Coverforce. The scheme provides free travel and insurance and ambulance benefits to workers whose employers pay into it, but only those who belong to the CFMEU. If you're a law-abiding citizen and you don't want to join a union which has accrued record fines for illegality, then you are out of luck. It almost goes without saying, of course, that the scheme has also made around $810,000 a year in undisclosed payments to the CFMEU. 


Sadly, in my own state of Queensland, we have the Building Employees Redundancy Trust, sometimes referred to as BERT. It holds $130 million of workers' money and, like too much of the construction industry in this country, it is controlled by the CFMEU, along with the CEPU and the Queensland Major Contractors Association. The fund regularly uses money that should be helping workers who were made redundant to pay those who actually have a job. It has channelled millions into the unions and associations that control it and has even made illegal payments to striking workers. The CFMEU is so desperate to keep this cash cow that its Queensland secretary, Michael Ravbar, is currently in court facing penalties for boycotting Universal Cranes because their employees had the audacity to find an alternative fund that offered real value for money.


Something must be done to ensure that these funds act in the interests of their members, just as anyone else who holds millions of other people's money must do. This bill does just that. This bill will require funds to be run by people of good character—not a particularly unusual thing, you would think. This bill requires funds to have at least one independent voting director on their boards, and it will require the funds to be managed at arm's length. This bill will require workers' money to be responsibly invested and managed by trained professionals. This bill will require transparency in the form of regular reporting to workers, employers and the Registered Organisations Commission. This bill will require the registered unions and employer organisations that run these funds to have written policies on basic matters like how they make financial decisions, how they use credit cards and how they treat hospitality and gifts. Finally, this bill will put these funds under the proper regulation of the Registered Organisations Commission. The Registered Organisations Commission will monitor the funds. It will ensure that they comply with the law and check whether they are managing workers' money responsibly.


As the Heydon royal commission told us, we need to go further to ensure that workers are not compelled to get involved in schemes like these when they have no interest in doing so. This bill ensures that enterprise agreements and employment contracts cannot include terms that require people to contribute to election funds that are set up to fund the campaigns of people running for office in a union or employer group. The bill also bans the coercion of employers into contributing to specific union approved super funds, welfare funds or other worker benefit schemes like those we've been discussing. The pressure that unions have placed on employers to contribute to specific schemes is not in the interests of workers. As we've seen, it has often been applied because those schemes were to the direct financial benefit of the union, and this must stop.


Once again, we've discussed throughout this debate that the best solution to the blight of union corruption and the selling out of workers in this country is transparency. The unions have proven time and again that they cannot be trusted to obey the law or to act in their workers' interests. I will make a correction on that, because I firmly believe that not all unions are bad. Many unions do a great service to their members, and in fact I'd go so far as to say that we need unions in this country, because if it wasn't for unions then some unscrupulous employers would take advantage of their workers. I'm not against unions, and neither is this government. What we are against is the illegal conduct of unions who continue to break the law, who continue not to observe the rule of law, who continue to think that they are above the law. That's why this bill also requires unions, employer groups and employers to disclose any financial benefit they will receive from promoting or arranging insurance products or payments to workers' entitlements, training or welfare funds.


I recently had a group called MATES in Construction come and see me, just last week. They were concerned about how this bill would impact on them. MATES in Construction does a terrific job in the construction industry. MATES in Construction, as the name suggests, educates people working in the building industry, particularly about how to look after your mates who are working in the construction industry. The construction industry is renowned for high suicide rates and high rates of mental illness. MATES in Construction does a terrific job of teaching building and construction workers how to look for signs and symptoms in mates who might be suffering from mental illness. They were concerned that this bill might impact upon them. They went and saw the minister, and they came and saw me and a couple of my colleagues, and the bill was amended to appease their concerns. MATES In Construction should have no fears with this bill and nor should any other group, any other valid group, any other bona fide group, that is conducting training or welfare services to those who are working in the building and construction sector.


Workers need to know when a conflict of interest exists. Where their interests are being sold out for the benefit of their union or its officials, I'm confident that workers will take action to protect themselves and withdraw from or reform the unions that have abandoned them.


Sunlight is the best disinfectant. It is a steriliser that the government is determined to apply to the union movement and all of its corrupt practices. At the Heydon royal commission we saw the reintroduction of the ABCC, and also the introduction of the registered organisations act, the protecting vulnerable workers act and the corrupting benefits act. In the many years to come, when we reflect on the achievements of this government, our comprehensive and determined delivery in forcing the secretive and corruptive union movement into the light will be one of our enduring legacies. This bill is an important part of that mission, and I commend it to the House.

"Chesters, Lisa, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (16:47):  I rise to speak in favour of the amendment that's been moved by the member for Gorton. It focuses on and calls on this government to protect the penalty rates—the penalty rates that have been cut for over 700,000 workers—workers in retail, workers in hospitality, workers in pharmacy. The previous speaker didn't even make reference to the amendment, which would see those pay cuts restored for all of the workers who've had their pay cut, meaning that they would not cop this pay cut. The previous speaker and the government aren't even interested in protecting the pay of low-paid workers, some of the lowest-paid workers in our community.


I urge all of those on the government side to finally stand with Labor to protect the penalty rates for 700,000 low-paid workers. Since that penalty rate cut, we've seen other industries—hair and beauty, clubs and hotels—now also ask the Fair Work Commission to cut the penalty rates for their workers. These workers don't receive compensation for this pay cut. This is a minimum entitlement, a minimum wage, and there's been a straight wage cut.


I'd also like to set the record straight on a few things that the government is saying in relation to this bill. You'd think that they were living in some kind of alternative universe, that they were completely ignoring what is actually happening in the space of your rights at work and in the space of the ABCC. They're completely rewriting and changing history. Let's start with the royal commission. The Heydon royal commission was supposed to be independent and impartial, yet during the process of the royal commission, the commissioner himself, Dyson Heydon, agreed to be the keynote speaker at a Liberal fundraiser. Hardly impartial. Hardly independent. When you as the commissioner agree to go to a Liberal Party fundraiser, before the report is even handed down, I'd call that a little bit biased. It wouldn't even pass the pub test. Because of the findings of this particular commission, we now see legislation after legislation attacking unions—anti-worker, anti-union legislation. They took us to an election on the ABCC but hardly ever raised it during the election, then got the ABCC through, and now what's happened?


It's going so well for the government that the commissioner himself has had to resign because he knowingly broke the law; he knowingly broke the Fair Work Act. And yet they stand up here and talk about how great it is. You'd think there'd be some humility within the government—that they'd realise they've made a mistake. But, no, talking point after talking point still talks up how they needed to reintroduce the tough cop in the construction industry, who's had to resign because he broke the law. He knowingly broke the law. In fact, the minister recommended that he be reappointed to the role, knowing that he had broken the law. 


Then we get to what has happened this week. The ABCC legal counsel quit, citing that Hadgkiss's actions made the role untenable. The whole reason the government forced this country to an early election was on the back of the ABCC. The commissioner has quit, the legal counsel has had to quit because of the consequences of the commissioner, and yet they still stand up here and lecture us—lecture people in the Labor Party, lecture construction workers, lecture the union movement. 


Whilst the ABCC has been in place under this government, the hardest thing to stand here and say is that the union, unfortunately, was right: the number of construction deaths has gone up. There were 27 yesterday and 28 today and counting. That is because of this government's actions, deliberately weakening workplace health and safety on worksites. The ABCC, under their watch, is more interested in prosecuting union officials who fail to give 24 hours notification that they're walking onto a site, when that union official, in most instances, is walking onto that site because a construction worker has incurred a workplace injury. Some of the most grievous of those cases have been in Victoria. A union official walked onto a site because they received a call from a union member that a good friend and a delegate had fallen in the workplace. He died in the union official's arms. The company did the right thing and shut the job down. They called in counselling and the site went into grieving. Do you know what this government did, what the ABCC did? Issued a notice to the CFMEU: 'Why didn't you give 24 hours notification before entering that workplace?' The man was dying in the union official's arms, and the government doesn't talk about the workplace health and safety breaches—they ask why they didn't file the paperwork. Well, 24 hours after that man died, is there really a point to issuing a notification that you're going to walk on site? That is the audacity of the government, and that is where they're going. 


Then we get to the bill that we have before us. I need to set the record straight on a couple of things that were raised by the previous speaker and that also came up in question time. As I've said previously, the Queensland Police have said that they are not investigating any member of the Oaky North picket line for accusations suggesting that they would rape a child. That is wrong, and every single person in this place stands united in condemning any threats of child rape, any threats of child abuse and any actions of it. The Queensland Police have said, in The Australian—which is not a workers' paper, which is not a union paper—that they are not investigating that incident. Yet this government—the ministers and the speakers on this bill—used that for political purposes when there is no evidence that it was ever said. The miners at Oaky North have been locked out by their employer, Glencore, for over 117 days—miners, working people, who just want to go back to work. 


Today the Fair Work Commission basically issued a stunning rebuke against Glencore for their behaviour and conduct. They have ordered Glencore to order their security company to stop surveilling workers when they're at home. The commission declared that Glencore withdraw its direction in which it tried to discipline workers for being involved in the dispute. It has also said that it must stop the private security company applying military tactics to its anti-worker operations, likening union members to the Vietcong, and following union members and their families into schools and around their homes. 


This is the behaviour of the mining company in this dispute: they are following families, they have private security behaving like a military organisation and they are referring to these workers as the Vietcong. They've said openly to the commission, 'We know where every CFMEU member lives.' The company has handed over their personal addresses. This has come out in the commission. The Fair Work Commission has turned around and said to Glencore, 'Stop what you are doing to your own workers.' But not one member of the government has stood up and condemned Glencore. Not one member of the ministry has stood up and condemned this multinational. Instead, they seek to condemn the workers who have been locked out, are frustrated and just want to go back to work. This is the nature of this government.


You can understand why Labor is saying that this bill needs to go to a Senate committee to make sure what is trying to be done is fully understood. The member for Fisher, the previous speaker, said to MATES in Construction, a great organisation: 'Don't worry. We've amended the bill so that your organisation will not be affected.' I don't take the government and the minister at their word, which is why this bill's content should be fully examined.


Worker entitlements funds are a way unions and employers pool resources to support workers, to protect their entitlements and, importantly, to provide services workers may need, such as training, counselling, suicide prevention and OH&S officers, just to name a few. We've already heard about the great work that MATES in Construction do. They're necessary. Every year about 190 construction workers take their own lives. That's a high statistic. Very few other professions would have a suicide statistic that high. A construction worker is six times more likely to die of suicide than from an accident at work. About 5,500 construction workers attempt suicide each year and just under 1,000 of them are permanently disabled because of their attempt. In acknowledging this and knowing this, unions and employers helped establish and fund MATES in Construction.


MATES in Construction was established in Queensland in March 2008 by the building employer redundancy trust—one of the trusts and organisations that this government seeks to target in this bill. MATES in Construction believe that, as a result of this bill, they will lose about 18 per cent of their funding. They estimate that would see a cut to frontline services: a 40 per cent cut in staffing and services in Queensland, a 15 per cent to 20 per cent cut in staffing and services in Western Australia and the organisation having to close in South Australia. That is the impact that MATES in Construction believe this government's bill will have.


This 80-page bill is being rushed through this parliament. We don't really get the chance to explore the true impact. These are significant issues. If the government's intention is to stop unions from being able to provide these types of services to workers, then we on the Labor side cannot support it. There are far too many questions that are yet to be answered about the details of this bill and the impact that this bill will have. This is why it needs to be properly explored. 


How does what the bill imposes on registered organisations compare to regulations in place for corporations? Is the bill yet another layer of regulation over and above that that applies under other legislation, such as the fringe benefits tax act and the Corporations Act? How does the proposed deregistering scheme compare with what is in place for managed investment schemes? Again these are more questions that the government needs to answer. We are particularly concerned that the minister will have the power to flesh out details of this new regulatory scheme via regulations—so let's just leave it up to the minister, who knowingly appointed a commissioner who had broken the law. You can understand why we're a little bit sceptical on this side about giving that kind of power to the minister, who knowingly appointed someone who has had to resign because they had broken the law. 


Further, why would we not want to encourage more organisations like MATES in Construction? Perhaps the government fails to understand that in a number of workplaces, in a number of industries, employers and employees, through their union, do work collectively and collaboratively together to make sure people are safe at work. I've mentioned MATES in Construction, but there are other organisations that are, for example, tackling drugs, making sure that workers are fit and ready to work. There are lots of schemes being operated to ensure that workers have support. On Friday I will be on site in Victoria attending some toolbox meetings which the CFMEU run around DV prevention, to make sure that their members understand what their role is not just in terms of White Ribbon but in making sure that women are always safe. Will this organisation be at risk because of these changes? 


I urge the government to stop its attacks on unions and to start focusing on the real issues in Australian workplaces, like wage theft. Where is the legislation to tackle the chronic issue of wage theft in our country? Where is the government supporting Labor's amendment here today to reverse the cuts to penalty rates? These are the issues that we need to tackle in our workplaces. We do not need more rhetoric from the government or more attacks on unions that are getting on with the job to make sure not only that workers are safe but also that their work rights, their wages and their conditions are protected.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2017-10-24,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:02):  It may come as a surprise to the government, but sometimes people like to use their money to help other people. Not everything is about profit. Some might say, 'Well, you can come together collectively as a group of people, get in a community group, or a workers' group; you might want to pool your money and then use that to help out people who might be doing it a bit tough.' In many industries, like the construction industry and the electrical industry, that's something that workers have to deal with quite regularly because they are industries where a lot of people work for a short period of time when there is building going on, a piece of construction, and then they might find themselves without a job for the next little while. They will spend their whole lives going through many, many employers. Over the years in those industries the workers, with the agreement of employers, have managed to set up funds that the employers pay some money into, under an agreement with the workers, and those funds then sit there to be available to people when they fall on hard times—when they are out of a job for an extended period, for example, or when they find themselves injured or they get sick when they are off the job and are not covered by WorkCover. They might get income protection insurance at below market rates, for example. This happens because people have pooled their money together and said, 'We recognise that this is the nature of our industry and we want to look after each other.' This has worked very well in looking after people. Unless the government is going to say, 'We want to tighten up the unfair dismissal laws in the construction industry and the redundancy laws so that no-one ever gets sacked,' then it is going to be a feature of life in construction or in the electrical and plumbing trades that people will go through periods of work and not having work, and they will have to look for support in those times when they don't have work. 


So we've got these funds around the country that look after people in these industries, and they look after them in a number of ways. One is that they provide access to things like insurance at rates that are cheaper than they would be if you went to the market and got them yourself. A second thing they do—one of the main reasons for their existence—is to provide redundancy and income support for those periods when you're not working. And there are other services that they don't provide at a cost but because they're good things to do. For example, they provide counselling. We know that the suicide rates in the construction industry, in part because of the hours people work, are higher than average. What has happened over the years through people chipping in a little bit, a couple of dollars a week, and that money adding up is that there's now a fund, managed by workers and employers alike, to look after people in the industry. It means, for example, that if you find yourself doing it really tough then not only do you have access to financial support but there is someone to get on the phone to who will provide counselling—and you don't have to pay for it. That's not something that's done because they went out to tender, went to the market, and said, 'Who can give us the best possible rate?' No; it was seen as a good to look after the people in their community.


So we've got schemes that currently do this, in Victoria and right around the country, and they're serving their members very, very well. They can do it because they're run on a cooperative model. When they don't have to run everything at a profit they can do things like subsidise insurance, which they might not otherwise be able to do, and offer free counselling, which they wouldn't be able to do if they had to pay for everything at market rates. There is a basic understanding that if everyone pitches in a little bit to a central pool, and that central pool is managed properly—not like a corporation as a profit-making entity but with the money going back to the members in the industry—then everyone benefits. It allows these funds, for example, to make grants to training organisations to train people up so that there's safety in the workplace and people increase their skills.


Bear in mind that very often these funds are run by an equal mix of employer and union people. When funds go off to these training organisations it's not done because they're running things like a company, working out how they can make a profit, but to benefit everyone in the industry. It means that training can be offered in a way that doesn't impose additional costs on employers. Many of these training centres run without having to charge the people who front up, which means that employers get a benefit as well. They train people in aspects of construction, they train people in plumbing—not far from my electorate of Melbourne—and they do it right around the country. They can do this because when they get money from the workers they invest it, and when they get returns they can use them for these purposes that improve the lives of everyone in the industry.


This government looks at that and it hates it. It says, 'That should not be allowed, because these are not commercial, market-length transactions where we open up everything to the private sector.' It's the equivalent of saying: 'You can't go and join the RACV and pitch in your money and run things on a cooperative basis. Every time your car breaks down you have to go out to tender and find someone to come and look after it for you. If it costs you a bit more, so be it.' No. People have the right to come together and put their money into cooperative ventures, and that's exactly what is happening here. But the government wants to break it apart.


We saw a version of this with the Kennett government when they got their hands on local councils in Victoria and said: 'Councils aren't allowed to run things not for profit anymore. You have to contract everything out to the private sector.' Rates have gone up and, as a result, many councils are trying to pull things back in. They have council-run providers running a lot of their services. What we've learned in Victoria is that the whole process, which is embodied in this bill, of saying we have to do everything at market rates and make a profit out of it results in people getting fewer services but paying through the nose for them. We've seen it with electricity, we've seen it with councils and now the government is ideologically trying to do it to unions as well. It will mean that when the central fund, one of the funds governed by this legislation, says, 'We'd actually like to give a grant for some training to be run in the industry on a zero-cost or not-for-profit basis,' they won't be allowed to do it anymore. They won't be allowed to do it anymore under this bill because everything has to be paid for at market value. If you want to offer a bit of counselling to people, on my reading of this bill you won't be able to do that for free anymore because using money from the fund to pay for a service can only be done if you are giving it to someone offering the service at market value and at arm's length. It goes on and on.


It's typical of the government to give us an 80-page bill and say, 'Pass it now.' In the short time we've had it available to us to read, the bill has made us go, 'Hang on; this will actually make life very, very difficult for a number of services at the moment that are actually making people's lives better, only because they're not being run at a profit.' The government, for purely ideological reasons want to come in and say, 'You've got to reconstitute your board and you've got to rewrite your contracts,' without asking the first question of, 'Is the system actually working at the moment?' If the government actually ask that they will probably find that, by and large, it is. If there is a case for making some improvements, you would probably find some willing participants within the sector who'd say, 'We are happy to sit down and discuss improvements.' But that's not the government's approach. The government's approach is to bring in a bill that could grind to a halt the operations of some very worthwhile services and to say: 'Pass it. We are going to give you a couple of days to look at it.'


That suggests that the government's purpose is not at all to improve governance in the sector. Yet again this is purely an ideological stick to beat up people with. That's all it is. They say, 'We've had a royal commission that has recommended it.' It was a royal commission headed by someone who was going to go and speak at a Liberal Party fundraiser until he got found out. The government are quite happy to say, 'We'll have a royal commission into unions and particularly unions we don't like because they sit on a certain side of the political fence,' but, when there are allegations that Crown Casino have been tampering with pokie machines and causing people to lose money, they say, 'We couldn't possibly have an investigation into that.' That tells you everything about this government's priorities. So, pardon me, government, if, when you whack an 80-page bill on the table and say, 'Trust us; it's all about improving governance,' I don't believe you.


They have the gall to come in here and say, 'We want to improve the rule of law in areas like the construction industry.' I'm still waiting for the explanation from this government about why they appointed someone to head up the ABCC, the Australian Building and Construction Commission, who has just had to resign because he broke the law that he was meant to enforce. He has admitted this in court. He knowingly went out and said to people: 'I know that the law gives people certain rights to meet their unions to discuss things like safety and so on in the lunch rooms, but I don't want you to tell anyone that. In fact, I want you to tell them the opposite.' He got his organisation to publish misleading information to workers and builders in the sector to say, 'No, you're not allowed to have these meetings,' when in fact, by law, they were allowed to. He got found out and he had to resign. All the while, it turns out the minister knew these allegations were hanging over his head. The same minister who is bringing this bill to us and saying, 'It's all about improving good governance,' has not given an explanation at all about why she appointed someone to head up the construction industry watchdog who broke the law that he was meant to enforce.


Meanwhile, if you look around the country at the moment, if you want to focus on something in industrial relations or fix up issues in the workplace, there's plenty to do. We've got a youth unemployment crisis in this country. Youth unemployment is always higher than general unemployment. Historically, every time we have a downturn, we know that young people get hit hard and youth unemployment spikes up. But what you usually find is that a couple of years after that the lines come back into sync and youth unemployment comes back to its normal levels—still higher than general unemployment, but the two lines come back into sync. What we found in this country since the GFC, though, was that youth unemployment spiked and stayed high. The lines haven't come back together. In other words, we have a situation where, when it comes to the workplace—which the government is telling us they're concerned about in this bill—there are now young people who, since the GFC, have never been able to find a job, and the unemployment rate for them has not come back to its historical norm. We've abolished entry-level jobs in this country to a large extent. They just don't exist anymore in the way that they used to, and young people are suffering. As a result, we have the stats of five young people applying for every one job advertisement, with youth unemployment at historical highs and no jobs for them to go into.


If the government were seriously concerned about addressing issues in the workforce, it would be dropping everything to deal with this youth unemployment crisis, because it is worse than it has been for several decades. I'm still waiting for the government to come up with a bill that tells us how they're going to address that—what nation-building infrastructure they're going to invest in to find jobs for young people or how we're going to make sure young people can work. But not a week goes by that they don't come up with another bill that attacks people's rights at work and disrupts services and systems that are working perfectly well. So, pardon me if we don't take you on trust, government, and if we don't accept that this is all just about tidying up some loose ends. When you're serious about dealing with some of the issues that are facing people at work, when you're serious about dealing with the fact that wage growth is at historic lows because you've spent the last three decades, often with Labor's support, changing the industrial laws so that people can't bargain—when you're serious about addressing that—come back with some proposals, and we'll take you seriously.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (17:17):  Well, another day, and it's no surprise, as the member for Melbourne observed in his closing there, that we see yet another government bill—a trumped up Trump-style government bill—attacking unions, the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017. This is extraordinary, in terms of both substance and process. The process does need to be looked at from the outset. There are five schedules—80 pages—amending five pieces of legislation, with significant implications for employer groups and for unions. This needs detailed technical examination. It doesn't deserve to be rushed through the parliament as if somehow this is a crisis, as if this is urgent. It would behove the government to allow us to do our jobs as legislators and spend time actually reflecting on the clauses and the words, particularly given that apparently it's implementing some of the recommendations from that outrageous Heydon royal commission—which was quite some time ago, so it's difficult to understand what the urgency is. But the government of course is trying to rush it through. There may well be worthy bits, but you wouldn't really know, and you can't be confident in the time available. And, as the member for Melbourne and others have observed, you certainly cannot place any reliance anymore on this minister's word, given her appalling behaviour and given that there is still a lack of explanation around the affair with the ABCC commissioner.


It is based, as we see from the press release—a bit like the energy policy: it's government by press release or letter, these days; you don't have to release policy or modelling—on familiar nonsense about unions. Unions are apparently big business, and they're focused on making profits and not representing workers, and therefore we should just vote for this, which is utter garbage. Just because you say it, government, that doesn't actually make it true. Worker entitlement funds are jointly established by unions and businesses, and they operate primarily to ensure that workers' entitlements are protected. But they also have important secondary functions, and there should be no shame about that; there's no problem with their providing important services, including safety advice and services. Regarding the Heydon royal commission, apparently we're supposed to vote for this because it came out of a dodgy royal commission. I mean, give me a break: it's the same old conservative trick that we've seen through the decades. It started I think with the Queensland conservative government having a witch-hunt royal commission on, as they say, 'Red Ted' Theodore, when he was the Commonwealth Treasurer back in 1929-30. We saw the same outrageous, garbage trick played by the Court government on Carmen Lawrence when she was a senior minister in the Keating government. We see exactly the same trick that conservatives always pull: they misuse the powers of a royal commission. In this case, it is to get the opposition leader in the dock, get him on tellie being investigated by a former High Court judge. It is completely outrageous. He attended a Liberal Party fundraiser and we give it no credence whatsoever.


You really have to look at the context. We have made some important points in the second reading amendment. This fundamentally is a desperate attempt. If you say 'fair work' in the title, perhaps the government thinks that someone might be fooled that this is in some way fairer, in some way going to improve workplaces—



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  Indeed. Thank you, member for Brand. You are my muse here in this chamber. We have a packed gallery.


This is a desperate attempt to distract public attention from the fact that the government has no agenda to address wage stagnation or underemployment or rising inequality, and to distract people from remembering that the government is really only focused, as you see from their budget and legislative priorities, on the top end of town. We all get a tax cut. Everyone earning over $180,000 in this country gets a tax cut. Let's give it away! Fire up the nation's ATMs—$65½ billion company tax cut, including for Gina Rinehart and her mates in the next tranche! Defend to the death the unjust and highly regressive damaging and unsustainable tax breaks that go to high-income earners overwhelmingly. Not just stagnant wages though—and this is the piece de resistance—



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr HILL:
  That's right. Pop that into Hansard—is to actually cut wages. And, as the second reading amendment shows, the government could legislate now. They could put this bill aside, push it down the Notice Paper, let the parliament do its job, let us work through it clause by clause, let us reconcile it to your dodgy royal commission report and see whether it is one of the reasonable bits in there, and focus on stopping the wage cut for 700,000 low-income workers. That should be a priority for the parliament to legislate. 


Indeed, there is a bill on the Notice Paper—you shouldhave had enough time to look at it because it has been hanging around for months—that the Opposition Leader introduced to do exactly that. Perhaps, if plebiscites and surveys are the order of the day, you can have a survey and see what the Australian people think about penalty rate cuts. Try that on for size. 



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr HILL:
  No. Call an election. Try that. With regard to the penalty rate cut for hospitality, fast food, retail and pharmacy awards, fundamentally this is a wage cut for 700,000 workers. You can dress it up however you want; it is a wage cut, a wage cut, a wage cut. It is the thin end of the wedge, as we are already seeing, for millions of others. 


This is not a blank sheet. We are not designing society or the economy from scratch. We need to consider reality as we find it in the real world, outside this building, not on the IPA's magical happy place or on the whiteboard where they dream this rubbish up, but in the real world, in families and communities where young people and women will bear the brunt of these wage cuts, as the second reading amendment points to. 


The first point I would make is this is not inevitable. We are told there is a sense of inevitability. 'Oh well, the Fair Work Commission said this. It's a neoliberal happy trickle-down world. It's inevitable.' It's not. We choose. We can, and we have the responsibility to actively choose the kind of society we want. This is an unwanted and unnecessary change to the long-established economic and social structure in Australia. It goes to the heart of the kind of society we want to be. 


Labour is not—this is news to those opposite, the bean counters, the widgets, the Daleks—a normal economic input like electricity or rent, at least not outside the IPA's happy whiteboard place. Ethical and human concerns must be taken into account in workplace relations laws. The Australian community has long valued people working unsociable hours. They miss family events, they miss time with kids, they miss sports and they miss social events. Everyone else can have a day or a night out, but not those people working unsociable hours. And this stuff is important to the fabric of our communities, to the kind of place and country we want to be. It is often thankless work—shop workers, shelf packers, cleaners—people who make everyone else's Sundays relaxed should be valued. 



Ms Madeleine King interjecting—




Mr HILL:
  You're on my side, Member for Brand. Reducing penalty rates reduces the necessary respect and the value of time that should exist between employers and employees. Remember? Key point: it is not a normal economic input. These are human beings, with families and lives; they are part of society, not just rent or electricity. As a society we have every right to shape our economy to suit our way of life. We can choose to keep these arrangements, and the economic arguments that we somehow just have to ditch them are wrong.


The second point I would make is that penalty rates are a necessity for millions of Australian households. They rely on them to cover their expenses. They're not optional extras or executive bonuses. So what this wage cut for 700,000 people means—that the government is too gutless to actually stand up and stop—is that people will be forced to try and work more hours just to maintain their family's take-home pay, which of course is impossible for most people because of family or caring responsibilities or study. 


Secondly, if they can't work more hours to keep their same take-home pay, guess what? They lose household income, which worsens inequality, because, unsurprisingly from this mob, these wage cuts overwhelmingly affect lower-income workers. That in turn reduces spending in the real economy, because the people affected by these wage cuts spend every dollar of their pay. They are not pouring thousands of dollars extra into superannuation; they are not spending it on enormous overseas holidays; they are not piling it up in the bank. They spend it on their daily lives.


In terms of the economic impact, cutting wages is not an efficient way of boosting productivity or growth. It actually does the opposite, because reducing domestic spending reduces turnover in exactly the kind of businesses that are cutting wages. It is an unvirtuous reinforcing cycle. An average $3,500 per year will be reduced from full-time employees' wages. Thousands of people will be unable to spend thousands of dollars in local economies. Instead, these funds will be pocketed by businesses as profit for high-income earners, which means a less-positive impact on the economy, because these people, probably people in this room here, are more likely to save this money or spend it overseas, which doesn't add to our national prosperity.


With regard to employment, we're told that somehow you have to just roll over and suck it up, grin and bear it, because, somehow, it will create more jobs overall. This is based on a flawed version of the discredited trickle-down myth, which goes something like this: make doing business cheaper and it will increase aggregate profits and therefore employment will somehow increase, as business has more revenue with which to employ staff, and businesses will also remain open for longer hours as the cost of labour reduces. Yet the Fair Work Commission finds that the aggregate impact on employment rates of cutting penalty rates is negligible. So, all we have is a very weak case based on theory and anecdote, and it is not a proper basis on which to make policy or to justify such a massive change. The evidence, of course, is that larger businesses do not choose to remain open for longer and they don't invest labour savings into more jobs. Larger businesses, of course, employ as many people as they need to do the job—no more, no less. If they need more people they will employ them.


If a few businesses do open a bit longer, that doesn't mean that consumers will spend more. Most businesses in the affected industries are already open for long hours. There are plenty of opportunities for consumers to spend their money. Longer trading hours don't mean more money in the average consumer's pocket. People can't spend money they don't have—who knew! For any extra hours created here or there, as I said at the start, back to where we began, existing workers will be working those extra hours just to try to maintain their take-home pay. It doesn't create new jobs overall. It forces people to work longer for the money they already have.


If you think about timing—timing is everything, they say—even if you believe this nonsense theory this is the worst possible time in years, decades really, to cut wages, because wages have stagnated for the last five years. We are in the 20th quarter, I think probably the 21st consecutive quarter, since mid-2012 of falling wages growth for private sector workers. The most recent rate of growth was only around two per cent, the lowest since 1991. This consistent reduction in wage growth rate has resulted in real wages remaining stagnant for over 4.5 years, and in many cases actually declining in real terms.


We have the government over there introducing voluminous legislation to implement supposedly critically urgent recommendations from a dodgy royal commission that has hung around for ages—it is still unclear why it is so urgent—instead of focusing on something that actually matters to Australians. As I said, I dare you to have a plebiscite or a survey to see what people think of penalty rates cuts.


This is happening at the worst possible time. It shrinks the whole economy, because we create a negative cycle where wages remain depressed. Most sensible mainstream economists cite that average everyday Australians have identified lack of wage growth as one of the biggest problems facing the economy. It makes the cost of living even more difficult, it worsens inequality, it is bad for business, consumers spend less and, of course, it threatens budget projections.


The final point I want to touch on is something we've been whacked over the head about. When the Fair Work decision came out we said, 'This is going to set a pattern. This is going to flow on to other industries and other sectors.' We were told that that was wrong, it was not fair and we were making it up. Labor said it was the thin end of the wedge. We were told by the government: 'You're running a scare campaign. It's only these awards.' Well, now we're seeing the true agenda. This decision is spreading, right now: other awards, other sectors, other workers and other industries are pursuing these pay cuts. We've seen the application, already, from the restaurant and catering industry. There's talk of the hairdressing industry and many others. 


The decision itself is flawed, and that's why we should be prioritising legislation to fix this decision, not mucking around with voluminous legislation, shoving it through the House when the case hasn't been made. Some findings in the Fair Work Commission decision about fact and law do go beyond these industries. It's not a Labor scare. This is a considered, detailed analysis that commentators have made, and we are now seeing it happen in the Fair Work Commission. The kind of factors which the Fair Work Commission said justified these wage cuts include: existence of entry-level jobs, consumer expectations of weekend public holiday service, the potential for increasing jobs, and the disutility for employees not, on balance, preventing a reduction in rates. The fact that employees were earning just enough to cover their weekly expenses wouldn't prevent a reduction in rates. 


These exact same factors apply in numerous other industries. That's the text of the decision, and that's what we're seeing other sectors now jumping on board with, salivating for a wage cut, so they can pocket some profits. The industries most at risk are aged care and health care, nursing, transport, security, cleaning, construction, teachers, education workers working on weekends—such as sports coaches, mining workers, social, community, disability and homecare nurses. I'll probably be told by those opposite that that's a scare campaign. But it's not. Exactly the same conditions that underpin this flawed decision are flowing to other sectors right now. The decision is wrong. It was a flawed legal framework. There's a need to prevent it from being implemented and to fix the legislation. 


The final thing I'll point out is that it will also affect people on enterprise agreements. Some commentary is saying that people on enterprise agreements are immune. That is, frankly, rubbish, because in the real world the relevant award becomes a measuring stick. This will flow through. It is flowing through elsewhere, over time, even within this sector. If the government had a shred of decency and had any contact with the real world, they would introduce legislation now to fix this flawed decision.

Mr ROB MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (17:32):  I feel for the member for Bruce. He was hoping to get an answer, but, clearly, no-one on the government side wants to defend this dodgy piece of legislation. I rise to speak about the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017 which was introduced to the House last week. You can just guarantee it: another day, another government bill designed to attack workers' pay and conditions. The government has, once again, managed to find another way to try and rob Australians of their rights in the workplace. This time, they're targeting workers' entitlement funds, funds which were set up, due to the countless complaints against phoenix companies, to provide better security to employees against loss of their entitlements. 


In the manner that we've come to expect from this government, they're doing all they can to stop us from properly scrutinising this bill and from undertaking any real consultation with stakeholders. They want to rush this bill through the House faster than they can down a Cristal champagne or two by the harbour side. At the end of the day, it's just another measure to continue the government's absurd war against unions. It's clear that they simply don't understand the need for workers' rights, or the vital role that unions have played throughout the years. The minister is under some strange illusion that unions have become big businesses, focused on making profit instead of protecting the people they represent. It is an utter load of rubbish. 


This kind of arrogance could only come from those opposite, who have never done a hard day's work in their lives. They've never been a worker, never understood a worker, and never, ever, stood up for a worker. Maybe if they left their marble offices and their big velvet chairs once in a while they would see that Australia is made up of hardworking people—people who will be gravely affected by the loss of penalty rates of up to $77 a week. Workers' entitlement funds are put in place to make sure that workers' entitlements are protected, that workers are adequately trained, that the proper funding of OH&S officers is guaranteed, and that employees can access fundamental services like counselling support and suicide prevention. I'd love to see those opposite own up to this disgrace of a bill and tell Australians what it really means. It means the government are backing away from what is right, once again showing they're putting dollars first, even when it means ripping off everyday Australians.


The absurdity doesn't end there. The government have told us that they've based this bill on 10 recommendations by the Heydon royal commission—the Heydon royal commission. It isn't that hard to see that the previous pieces of legislation based on this disgraced royal commission have been a flop, and they simply can't be trusted. Put simply, the disgraced royal commission was a political witch-hunt, using $100 million of taxpayer money that has delivered nothing better for workplaces. In what universe is it appropriate that their hand-picked royal commissioner attends a Liberal Party fundraiser in the middle of a commission to do the government's political bidding? What did the disgraced commissioner do when we raised this inappropriate behaviour? He investigated himself! He thought he'd go and talk to the tough cop on the beat! So he sat there and said, 'Commissioner, have you done the wrong thing?' 'No, Commissioner, I haven't done the wrong thing.' 'Are you sure?' 'Yes, I'm positive. I'm 100 per cent sure.' 'That's okay, then. All is good. All is forgiven. Let's move on.' You couldn't make up this stupidity. 


Effectively, the government is trying to take away the independence of crucial unions and employers around Australia and put them under the umbrella of incompetent organisations like the IPA. You can be sure that all this does is replace real union advocacy with bureaucratic nonsense. The government want to stack these independent boards with Liberal Party stooges in an attempt to destroy fair working standards in this country. From a government that spruiks the need for less red tape, this measure is another broken promise as they push back efficiency to allow rolls and rolls of red tape to come in. The government claims these will be run by good people. Those are the minister's own words: 'good people'. Who exactly are they talking about? If we're talking about some of the government's good people, we're talking about Nigel Hadgkiss and Michael Lawler. What about Kathy Jackson or, of course, the Prime Minister's favourite, good old Godwin Grech? We know, when it comes to good character, the government has no credibility whatsoever. 


We on this side see that workers' entitlement funds benefit workers. They are managed transparently and responsibly, and are spent for the genuine benefit of Australian workers. You only have to look at the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to see how fast the government is to kick aside the matter of workers' rights. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was put in place to pay truck drivers a fair wage and to make sure, when they're out on the road, they can pay their bills and feed their families. But the second the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal attempted to bring in minimum wages in order to combat unsafe contracts—which are causing death and serious injuries on our roads, and in the trucking industry—the government went into an absolute frenzy: 'We can't have people being paid proper wages!' 


More than 200 truck drivers die in Australia each and every year. The government took the easy way out. Instead of addressing these deaths and protecting Australians, it completely destroyed the RSRT, turning a blind eye to the unbelievable conditions and pressures that truck drivers are expected to work under. This government, time and time again, ignores the advice of experts. When the National Transport Commission demonstrated the clear link between safety outcomes and truck driver pay rates, the government feigned ignorance. By axing the RSRT, the government took away protections for whistleblowers in the industry who were concerned about the safety of their workplaces, and took away their right to take leave without losing contracts. It was and is an appalling, short-sighted move by the government—just a way for them to point at something tangible, to give them a win during their time in government. 


We on this side of the House know better than to gamble with the lives of Australians. It's not a win when you make it easier for truckies to die on our roads while they're trying to make a living. It's not a win when, for political gain, you drive good men and women truck drivers to suicide. But just like the trucking industry, the construction industry has one of the highest levels of worker vulnerability. The construction industry relies on entitlement funds for payments regarding leave, termination of employment, contracts, awards or agreements provided for an employer to make to an employee.


Quite often the government will come in and want to attack the CFMEU. It's their plaything. I really think John Setka should be panicking about what the Prime Minister's up to. Is he looking over his fence day in day out? Why is he always on his back?


My son-in-law works in the construction industry, and I'm more than proud to stand with the CFMEU to know that they are going to, each and every day, make sure he can come home, make sure he has a safe workplace. Even today, we had a construction worker die on the job. And where was the government's empathy for the family or for the workers? It was nowhere to be seen. They just want to keep sprouting proven false allegations. And the disgusting work in question time today: fair dinkum; I don't know whether anyone had the misfortune of watching that. I remember the chief of the ADF saying, 'The standard you set is the standard you walk past.' Well, today we've seen the lowest standard of the most morally and ethically bankrupt and corrupt government in this nation's history. It was wrong. The CFMEU stands up each day and makes sure people have safe workplace practices. I like the idea of knowing that my six-month-old granddaughter is going to know that her dad's going to come home each day because the CFMEU is standing up to make sure that he's looked after—to make sure that he's paid and gets the entitlements that he's due, to make sure that he can come home safely and go to work again tomorrow. That's what it's about.


The government just want to kick the union as a plaything, but they've got no understanding, because of their arrogance and ignorance—just as they are ignorant and arrogant towards the 700,000 Australians who are going to be losing up to $77 a week. That's $77 a week that a family in Mernda could use to pack their kids' lunches. It's $77 a week that a young couple in Sunbury could set aside to pay their mortgage. And it's $77 a week that this government is taking out of the pockets of hardworking Australians. Why does the government think families shouldn't be able to sit around the table to share a meal and have some quality time? You see just how little they care when you look at their attacks on penalty rates. The fact is that penalty rates are in place because people working on weekends or working unsociable hours are missing out on what we value in Australia. My father was a printer at News Limited. It hurts me to say that he worked at News Limited! But he worked all his life. He missed out on birthdays, Christmases—you name it: everything—because he worked at night-time, just so he could have the rag out in the morning.


The McKell Institute report found that McEwen will be the second-worst impacted by penalty rate cuts in the whole of Australia. We're set to lose approximately $19 million a year out of the economy that this government is doing nothing about. I have heard countless stories from constituents who are affected by these penalty rate cuts. At our local Amcal Pharmacy in Craigieburn pharmacists are fighting for their fair share in wages. Amcal turned over a $50 million profit last year. And how did it repay its staff for their hard work? By cutting the pay of their workers, who already earned as little as $27 an hour, thanks to this government and to big businesses ripping off hardworking employees and making it harder for them to make ends meet. While our local pharmacists serve our community 24 hours a day, seven days a week, this government sits idly by while they lose out. The government is so completely out of touch that it thinks cutting penalty rates will improve job opportunities. The irony is that the government's own information shows that's factually untrue. The government fails to see outside the Sydney Harbour bubble. In the small towns in McEwen, where more businesses are being opened, that doesn't actually mean more jobs or a huge boost in trade. Cutting penalty rates means that people throughout Australia and in McEwen will have less money to spend, which means they won't be visiting those restaurants and shops. Small-town economies are bound to suffer, and that's just unacceptable. In electorates like McEwen, a high proportion of retail and hospitality workers earn less than their city counterparts already.


When regional workers are employed by firms that are not locally owned, the benefits leave our communities. The McKell Institute study shows that workers in 45 regional communities will lose $667 million per year from penalty rate cuts, and $289 million of that is expected to leave our regional electorates altogether—just to line the pockets of corporations in the city and, even worse, overseas. The research shows that more than 277,000 workers in regional communities will be hit by the cut to Sunday penalty rates. Most of the savings businesses owners stand to make will not feed back into local communities. 


The government are trying to stop unions from being part of the Australian workforce. They are trying to stop unions from providing crucial services to workers. We simply will not stand for that. They've done it before and they're doing it again with this bill. They'll keep coming and coming. Australian families and Australian workers know that the Australian Labor Party is there to stand in the way of these right-wing ideologues that run this pathetic government. It's disgusting, it's unjust and it just goes to show that, when it comes to Australian workers, only the Labor Party can be trusted.


The Prime Minister presides over the worst wage stagnation in years, though he did pretty well giving himself a $16,000 tax cut on 1 July. He keeps that nice and quiet, doesn't he? This government wants to continue to undermine workers and the unions. It's all words and no action when it comes to the government's plans to address wage stagnation, underemployment, rising inequity and really anything else, for that matter. Under this government big business gets tax cuts while Aussie workers get wage cuts. Labor will not stop fighting for workers' rights and exposing the truth behind this government's flawed and convoluted plans to empty workers' pockets and make sure that big businesses are looked after. If this bill were a dog, you'd take it out the back and shoot it. Maybe that's what needs to be done now.

"Khalil, Peter, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (17:46):  I too rise to speak on the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017. I cannot commence talking about this bill without making initial comments about the absolutely extraordinary attacks by this government on the union movement that played out this afternoon. We've seen outrageous raids on the offices of the Australian Workers' Union in Sydney and Melbourne. On the same day that this parliament is told that Malcolm Turnbull's cuts to the Australian Federal Police have meant serious crimes like drug smuggling cannot be properly investigated we see the extraordinary use of the AFP and taxpayer dollars to raid the offices of the Australian Workers' Union in Sydney and Melbourne.


The Turnbull government has openly directed the commission to start this witch-hunt. It's entirely responsible for this turn of events. It's an alarming misuse of ministerial power. It's an abuse of power, and it needs to be called out for that. The Liberals have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on their witch-hunt into unions. Their visceral anger and hatred towards the union movement and towards workers and their rights is absolutely disgraceful. They will stop at nothing in attacking workers and their representatives. We've seen that play out this afternoon in these extraordinary raids on the AWU.


Of course, this is a bit of deja vu. It's about the political incompetence and desperation of this government. We're seeing the NBN raids play out all over again. What did that get us? Absolutely nothing but more wasted taxpayer dollars. I believe that the Australian people will see this for the desperate act it is. It's an act of desperation by a desperate, pathetic government in the last throes of trying to figure out what to do with itself. 


At the outset, we're also extremely concerned that we're debating this bill, given that it has five schedules, running to a total of 80 pages, and was introduced only last Thursday, 19 October. Barely five days, including the weekend, is hardly sufficient to get across an extremely dense and technical bill. I note, too, that the member for Gorton, as shadow minister for employment, received a departmental briefing on this bill only yesterday. Several questions put on notice to the head of the department have not yet been answered. The government is clearly attempting to avoid scrutiny of this bill. In everything they do they seek to avoid scrutiny, responsibility, accountability and transparency. It's being rushed through this parliament and that is simply unacceptable. The government claims that this legislation's purpose is to implement various recommendations of the Heydon royal commission. We remember that, don't we? Tens of millions of dollars was wasted on that royal commission, on that witch-hunt. The Heydon royal commission, as many will remember, was presided over by an individual who attended Liberal Party fundraisers and whose sole aim was to do the political bidding of the then Abbott government. 


The explanatory memorandum states that this bill amends five separate pieces of legislation, and it will: first, put additional requirements on the government's financial reporting and financial disclosure requirements of 'worker entitlement funds'; second, prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from requiring or permitting contributions to any fund other than a superannuation fund, a registered worker entitlement fund or a registered charity; third, prohibit awards or enterprise agreements from permitting or requiring employee contributions to a union election fund; fourth, prohibit coercion of employers to pay amounts to a particular worker entitlement fund, superannuation fund, training fund, welfare fund or employee insurance scheme; fifth, put additional financial management and disclosure obligations on registered organisations; and, sixth, introduce new penalties for registered organisations' non-compliance with financial management disclosure and reporting requirements. 


It is quite clear, even in this summary, that this bill has significant implications for both unions and employer groups. But it is entirely reasonable to say that a detailed examination of the technical provisions in the bill is essential in order to fully ascertain what the full impact of the bill is and which groups will be affected. On this basis I note that Labor has attempted to have the bill examined by the Senate employment committee—in my view an extremely appropriate approach, given the density of this particular bill. Regrettably, the government has joined with a group of senators, led by departing Senator Nick Xenophon, to block Labor's efforts on that front. The inquiry the Senate is having on this bill will be forced to report on 10 November 2017, setting an almost impossible deadline for stakeholders to prepare submissions and evidence. This proposal represents yet another chapter in this government's relentless attacks on unions. I know the media is focused on what we're seeing play out at the AWU offices this afternoon; nonetheless, this is part of this government's relentless attack against unions and it is no less important, given how they're trying to rush this through the parliament. 


Of course, we know why they are doing this—the Liberals have always loathed the trade union movement. They've always hated the trade union movement. That's part of their DNA. Particularly disturbing is that those opposite remain obsessed with this ideologically driven antiworker agenda given the current environment of low wage growth and rising cost-of-living pressures. The latest Department of Employment Trends in federal enterprise bargaining report provides more evidence that the Turnbull government is presiding over record low wages growth and a 22-year low in approved enterprise agreements. According to the latest data, wages growth for enterprise agreements approved in the June quarter fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.7 per cent in March—a 26-year low. In addition to low wages growth, there were only 845 approved enterprise agreements in the June quarter—the lowest since 1995. It's staggering, then, that the International Monetary Fund and the OECD have both warned that declining union density and collective bargaining are contributing to stagnant wages and growing inequality. 


This government wants to further undermine workers and their unions. Cost-of-living pressures are a very real problem and are having a real impact on people's lives, and those people demand real solutions. Instead we have this bill, hastily introduced by those opposite. They hope they can sneakily rush it through the parliament, probably while all these raids are occurring this afternoon on the TV screens, hoping that no-one fully understands what they're actually doing because they haven't had the time to assess the bill. It's extremely telling that the government, in their disreputable attitude to this debate, are seeking to squeeze union-backed worker entitlement funds, such funds being defined as funds which are for the purpose of paying worker entitlements, including those in respect of leave, payments in lieu of leave, payments in relation to termination, other payments due contractually or under an award, and death benefits. These very funds were designed and set up by the unions to protect their workers and ensure that their lawful entitlements were paid by employers, something that we know does not always happen.


This bill seeks to limit when a worker entitlement fund can become or stay registered, including defining what sort of organisation can operate a fund. It prescribes what the make-up of the board can be and the way in which the assets of the fund can be used. The bill further establishes a subset of worker entitlement funds called single-employer funds, which are funds that are controlled by a single employer for the benefit of its own employees. It would appear that these single-employer funds essentially escape all of the regulations contained in the bill, other than the tax related ones, unless the operator of the fund elects for it to be a worker entitlement fund and applies to be registered. In reality, worker entitlement funds often operate in the interests of creating a source of finance for unions to provide training, OHS support and other services to their members, hence the bill's very real potential to undermine the benefits that some workers receive through these funds.


The bill also contains provisions which we understand would operate to prohibit enterprise agreements specifying that employers have to pay into training funds. To reiterate the question posed by the member for Gorton earlier, during his remarks: what is the justification for this, given that enterprise agreements are completely transparent, voted on by the workers, and Heydon himself, even given his background, conceded that the training funds provide a public good? What is the justification?


Several stakeholders have raised concerns about the significant uncertainty as to whether worker entitlement funds can continue to provide safety training and wellbeing services such as suicide prevention support and mental health and drug and alcohol counselling. These are extremely significant issues. At this point there are just too many unanswered questions about this bill for Labor even to get close to supporting it. Despite the minister's hot air in the media, where she laughably tried to cast unions as evil, profit-hungry entities, what the government is actually doing with this bill is limiting the legitimate activities of unions and limiting the legitimate sources of income for unions, which unions use, of course, to represent their members, as they are duty-bound to do. A press release issued by the Minister for Employment in September read:


Through cosy deals with big businesses, unions have become a big business in their own right, more focussed on making profits than representing people.


That is ridiculous. It shows the government's ideological and visceral hatred of the union movement. It's a slur. It's rubbish. Worker entitlement funds—which, by the way, are jointly established by unions and employers—operate, firstly, to ensure that workers' entitlements are protected and, secondly, to provide important services to workers: training, counselling support, suicide prevention and funding of OH&S officers, just to name a few. This government simply does not understand the genesis of worker entitlement funds and the important service that they provide. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it doesn't understand the basic needs of working Australians. That's apparent in its attacks today and in this bill.


In recent months we have seen this government stand idly by while some 700,000 hospitality workers nationwide have suffered cuts to their penalty rates and cuts in their take-home pay. According to research I commissioned from the Parliamentary Library, informed by figures in the ABS labour force survey, as many as 3,046 people in my electorate of Wills will be adversely impacted by these cuts. Some of the lowest-paid workers suffered an arbitrary pay cut of up to $77 per week. That's a lot of money for someone on a low income. It's the difference between putting food on the table or not. It's the difference between getting school clothes for your kids or not. It's the difference between being able to afford public transport or not. It is money that they could not afford to lose, and this government stood by and did nothing about it. It could have acted but it failed to do so.


I commend the second reading amendment moved by my friend the member for Gorton, as it once again calls on this government to do something for the 700,000 workers nationally who have had their take-home pay cut and to legislate to stop this egregious and unfair decision of the Fair Work Commission from taking effect. This government has no plan to arrest wage stagnation and no desire to do anything to protect workers. In stark contrast, the Labor opposition is committed to the strong economic conditions and fair and equitable industrial relations framework that will deliver a better standard of living for ordinary Australians.


We believe that every working Australian deserves a good wage and decent working conditions. We know that the best way to tackle poverty and reduce inequality is to ensure that every Australian who can work is able to get a decent job, and that's why Labor will always put jobs first. Labor is, of course, the party that works with the unions and union movement, business and industry. It's a party that works with all of these groups to create and secure decent jobs.


A couple of weeks ago, I was fortunate enough to hear Bill Kelty reflect on the role that he played as one of the authors of the accord between the trade union movement and the Labor governments of Hawke and Keating and the business community. This remarkably successful period in Australia's history is testament to the fruits of a productive relationship between capital and labour and what's potential and what's possible. It should be a lesson on the perils of the needlessly adversarial approach to industrial relations that is taken by this government. In cooperation, pay rises were achieved during this period, entitlements were expanded for workers, inflation was contained, unemployment numbers fell and the then Labor government was given the electoral authority to establish important public services, such as Medicare. I reflect on this golden era of Australian politics with some regret and angst because I know that this type of harmony and productivity will never exist under this government and Australians will be quite literally the poorer for it.


While we're not declining to give the bill a second reading in order for it to be subject to a Senate review—albeit an extremely short one—Labor do not support the proposition that is before the House. Labor will never support any measure which attacks workers and the unions who are so important to their livelihoods and, indeed, who are so important to the future of our nation.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (18:01):  I am a proud union member and I cannot possibly support this bill, the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017. I am proud to be a member of the Australian Services Union and I'm also proud to be a member of the Commonwealth Public Sector Union. I am a very strong believer in the power of the collective. That is the strength of the unions' work. It has only ever been the Labor Party and the unions who have fought for equality. This government seem to want to grow inequality. They want to achieve this by attacking the only people and entities that have ever stood up against the government's mistreatment of workers. There has been attack after attack, untruth after untruth, just so the government can assist their big business mates and give them a $65 billion tax cut without pesky Labor and the unions fighting for useful things like access to free health care, access to quality education for all, workers' rights and social inclusion and equality. There has been attack after attack by the Turnbull government and, with every blow, we stand united and fight back because workers united will never be defeated.


The unions that I am a member of are fighting against some of the shocking inequality and cuts that the Turnbull government is forcing on people. The Australian Services Union has been a strong advocate for the NDIS, but, under the guidance of the coalition, the aspirations for the NDIS in assisting the most marginalised group of people have been completely lost. The ASU has been vocal against the Turnbull government and its mishandling of the NDIS, and I am proud to be a member of a union that stands up to protect the NDIS and workers.


Then there is the CPSU. Haven't they experienced an absolute battering from the Turnbull government? There have been cuts to the Department of Social Services, cuts to the Australian tax office in Townsville and cuts to the services provided by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in Townsville. It has been cut after cut after cut. This union has stood up and fought not only for its members but for the most vulnerable people in our society. Their work is just amazing, and I want to particularly note the work of the National Secretary, Nadine Flood, and the Queensland state secretary, Bill Marklew, who have been relentless in their fight against the Turnbull government's unfair cuts.


Today we see another attack on unions with this bill. The Turnbull government is trying to rush this bill through the parliament without any proper scrutiny or stakeholder investigation. They are trying to undermine the process and get this nonsense bill, which is attacking unions, through the parliament as quickly as possible without the community uproar. This bill has significant implications for workers who benefit from their entitlements being protected through funds, including services like counselling, training, occupational health and safety, and support services that these funds invest in.


The government's purpose is to use this bill to limit the legitimate activities and source of income of unions, because they don't understand the genius of worker entitlement funds and the important services that they provide. A worker entitlement fund is defined as a fund that is for the purpose of, or purposes including, paying worker entitlements and death benefits. Worker entitlements are defined as including payments in respect of leave; payments in lieu of leave; payments in relation to termination of employment, whether ETPs or not; and any payments that contracts, awards or agreements provide for an employer to make to an employee. Worker entitlement funds—which, by the way, are jointly established by unions and employers—operate, firstly, to ensure that worker entitlements are protected, and, secondly, to provide important services to workers: training, counselling support, suicide prevention, and funding of occupational health and safety officers, just to name a few.


This bill puts additional requirements on the governance, financial reporting and financial disclosure requirements of worker entitlement funds; prohibits awards or enterprise agreements from requiring or permitting contributions to any fund other than a superannuation fund, a registered worker entitlement fund or a registered charity; prohibits awards or enterprise agreements from permitting or requiring employee contributions to a union election fund; prohibits coercion of employers to pay amounts to a particular worker entitlement fund, superannuation fund, training fund, welfare fund or employee insurance scheme; puts additional financial management and disclosure obligations on registered organisations; and introduces new penalties for registered organisations' noncompliance with financial management, disclosure and reporting requirements. 


This bill places limits on when a worker entitlement fund can be registered or stay registered, including what sort of organisation can operate the fund, the make-up of the board of the fund and the way in which the assets of the fund can be used. The stakeholders have raised concerns that there is significant uncertainty about whether worker entitlement funds can continue to provide safety training and wellbeing services, such as suicide prevention and mental health support, and drug and alcohol counselling. As someone who has had 15 years experience working in the mental health sector, I am particularly concerned about that fact. 


In particular, I am incredibly concerned over the impact this bill may have upon the excellent work undertaken by MATES in Construction, which is in the direct firing line of this bill. Changes in this bill have the potential to negatively impact upon MATES in Construction. MATES in Construction is a charity established in 2008 to reduce the high level of suicide among Australian construction workers. It was established in response to a major report on suicide, the AISRAP report, in the Queensland commercial building and construction industry. This report found that suicide rates in the industry were higher than the Australian average for men and that youth suicide in the industry could be as much as 2.38 times higher than it is for other young Australian men. Every year, 190 Australians working in the construction industry take their own lives. That figure is staggering, and MATES in Construction is there to assist construction workers and their families through these devastating and tough times. They do this by suicide prevention community development programs on sites. They support workers in need of help through case management and a 24/7 helpline. Together with OzHelp Foundation, they also provide Life Skills Toolbox training to apprentices and young workers. 


If you don't believe me, then allow me to read a letter I received from a Herbert constituent today regarding MATES in Construction and this bill. The constituent asks that I do not use her name, as she is fearful that her husband's employer may identify him. The letter reads:


To the Sitting Member, 


I bring to your attention as the wife of a union member the Bill the Turnbull Government are introducing into Parliament this week, the Fair Work Laws amendment (proper use of the workers benefits) bill 2017. 


My husband told me about this after a CFMEU sub-branch meeting last Thursday night. 


Our family has had to deal with the devastating tragedy of losing a child, personal illness and severe depression. 


Without the services of the Union's Mates In Construction, anything could have happened to my family. 


The threat of this Bill getting up and the blue-collar working class battlers losing the ability to use Mates In Construction suicide prevention assistance program and free counselling program for families including children would be devastating. I fear with this proposed bill all will be lost and many families will be disadvantaged, as we would have been. MATES in Construction gave us a funeral benefit that covered the cost of giving our child a dignified send-off. It will be a sad day if this bill gets over the line and a grim future for the generations to come if this government continues to take away the hard-fought entitlements that working-class people have continued to fight for to keep government from looking after the elite big end of town. 


Yours sincerely, 


Proud working-class union family in Townsville. 


Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, these are the lives of real families that you aim to detrimentally affect as a result of this bill. This is the story of a family who has been through hardships that no family should ever have to suffer, a family that sought hope and help from MATES in Construction. MATES in Construction was the beacon of light for this family in very tough times, and I will not allow the Turnbull government to attack this vital service. I will fight for the workers in the Herbert community. I will fight for my comrades, and I will fight against this bill. It is vicious and malicious that the Turnbull government would attack this program just because MATES in Construction partners include the AMWU and the CFMEU. Causing any sort of detriment to an organisation that is purely there to help those in the construction industry with suicide prevention and mental health awareness, and to do so purely because it has links to unions, is abhorrent and disgusting. There is union bashing and then there is this. This is just plain outrageous by the Turnbull government. To put MATES in Construction under pressure, an organisation that assists an industry to decrease high suicide rates, is just downright wrong. 


It is beyond comprehension, at a time when even the IMF and the OECD are warning that declining union density and collective bargaining are contributing to stagnant wages and growing inequality, that this government wants to further undermine workers and their unions. The Turnbull government is desperately trying to distract the public from the fact that it has no agenda to address wage stagnation, underemployment, unemployment and rising inequality—and, for that matter, anything else. Coalition governments will continually try to undercut and attack unions. But Labor and the unions will continue to do what we do best when we are under attack: stand up and fight back.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (18:12):  There is no limit to the willingness of this government to use the extraordinary powers of the state to go after their political opponents for political reasons. In this parliament today we have seen some extraordinary circumstances. The government, in the House of Representatives, had one of their ministers stand up in parliament and make some absolutely outrageous observations about their political opponents on the other side of the House. The reason they did this? Because we had the temerity to expose some weaknesses and some problems with their administration of the Australian Federal Police. 


A few moments before question time we saw the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police tell a Senate estimates committee that staff cuts to the Australian Federal Police—we understand about 117 jobs—and budget cuts to the Australian Federal Police were interfering with their capacity to conduct drug raids. We understand that the ABC has seen documents from senior sources within the New South Wales branch of the Australian Federal Police saying those very same things: staff cuts are interfering with their capacity to conduct drug raids. 


Yet, at the very same time that evidence was being given and the minister was standing up in the House saying all sorts of slanderous things, the police had the capacity to be planning and conducting a raid on union offices. 'Staff cuts mean we can't conduct operations against drug smugglers and criminals, but we've got enough staff to raid the offices of the Australian Workers' Union about an alleged event that is alleged to have occurred 10 years ago.' I am sure that most Australians are scratching their heads and saying, 'Where are this government's priorities?' 'We haven't got enough staff to go after drug smugglers, but we've got enough staff to put on an operation to go after our political opponents.'


We have become anaesthetised to this government's willingness to use the forums of parliament, day after day after day, to slander law-abiding Australian citizens who do nothing but dedicate their lives to protecting the rights and conditions of their fellow workers. They are a target as far as this government is concerned because they are political opponents as far as this government is concerned. We have become anaesthetised to this government's willingness to use the legislative instruments of this place to go after their political opponents. In fact, you know it's a sitting week in Canberra because the government's got a bill before the parliament which is going after workers and their representatives. That's how you know when parliament's sitting; they go after workers and their representatives. You've got that fool of a Treasurer who goes on the radio this morning and says, 'We've got to do something about inclusive growth.' Then, a few hours later, he stands up in parliament and attacks unions and the representatives who are trying to do something about dealing with inequality in this country. 


Australians are scratching their heads. They know that this government will leave no stone unturned in going after their political enemies, using the protections available in this place to slander and defame law-abiding citizens; and using the legislative instruments of this place to attack the very institutions whose sole purpose is to look after workers' rights, protect their rights and conditions and ensure that they get some wage equality in this country. They will leave no stone unturned to use the legislative instruments of this place to go after those organisations. 


And yet today we see that is not enough: 'We have to go further. We are going to use the police force to go after our political enemies.' This at the very same time that the police force is telling parliament, 'We do not have the resources to go after criminals and drug importers and other people who legitimately should be attracting the police enforcement efforts of this country,' because this government has cut the resources to the AFP. And the minister who is responsible for this legislation before the House today thought it was more important that she instruct the AFP and the Fair Work Commission to have them go after this union. It is nothing short of a disgrace! The minister deserves to be condemned. The Prime Minister needs to be condemned. Is it any wonder that there is no member of the coalition government who is willing to come into this place and defend their actions and defend their legislation? 


It's not only the legislative instruments and the police force of this country that the government are using to go after their political enemies; they are doing it as an employer as well. They are doing it as an employer as well. There is not a day in this country where good, hardworking members of the Australian Public Service aren't putting themselves on the line to represent the government and its policies, whether they agree with them or not, and to ensure that they are providing the service that the Australian public deserves and expects of their government. They don't get paid well. They don't get paid as well as you and me, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough. They certainly haven't enjoyed the pay rises that members of parliament and ministers of government have enjoyed over the last five years.


In fact, let's look at what's happening in the Federal Court of Australia. The work of the Federal Court and the Family Court is incredibly important to the Australian community. Court staff often deal with some of the most difficult cases. Funding and staffing of our federal courts have been a challenge for a long, long time. The courts have generally had a strong working relationship with their staff and their union representatives, but this has broken down in recent times. It has broken down under the decisions of this government. In June this year, staff overwhelmingly rejected an enterprise agreement, with a 90 per cent vote against it. After four years of a pay freeze, staff were offered an agreement which proposed substantial cuts to conditions and money in exchange for a one per cent per annum pay increase. Now, you don't need to be a member of Mensa to understand that a one per cent per annum wage increase is actually a pay cut, because of inflation and other cuts to conditions. But instead of attempting to negotiate in good faith with the staff and their representatives, the government is slamming the door shut.


Well, members on this side of the House understand the important role performed by members of our court's staff. We understand that they are on the front line, just as the staff in this place are often on the front line, standing between the politicians, the ministers and the government in this place and the members of the public and what they expect of their government. We on this side think they deserve a fair and decent pay rise. Labor supports a pay rise for these people that will at least see them keeping pace with the cost of living without having to trade off hard-fought-for conditions.


If we had to spend this afternoon debating a bill to do with industrial relations and the rights of workers and their representatives in this country, these are the issues we should have been dealing with—things that are within the direct control and interest of this government and that it turns its back on, at the very same time it is using the instruments, the forces—the police force—of our government to go after its political enemies. Is there no level to which this government will not stoop? If there is a decent member on the other side of the House, they will stand up in this parliament today and condemn the actions of their government as an employer, condemn the actions of their government as a legislator and condemn the actions of their government as an executive, for using the police force of this state for nothing more than political purposes and diverting resources away from their proper purpose.


If we are to debate an issue that matters to the Australian people, an issue that is relevant, these are the things and this is the legislation we should be debating today, not this stuff, which is nothing short of a political attack on those who seek to represent workers and those who are dedicating their lives to ensuring that people who go to work every day—whether in our courts, in our public sector, on a building site, in the transport industry or wherever, in a small business around the country—get the wages and conditions they deserve, and perhaps a bit of a pay rise, and the dignity they deserve day in, day out.


This legislation is nothing short of an attack on the political enemies of this government And I can tell you: the numbers of those who have a grudge with this government are growing day after day—this government's mismanagement of everything from the NBN to the economy, their attack on workers' rights, their failure to do anything about inequality in this country. The workers of Australia, the people of Australia, have worked them out, and they're coming after them.

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (18:23):  Like the member for Whitlam, I came in here prepared to speak on a bill before the House—the Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017—which of course I will do. But the raids today have to be dealt with. What an absolutely disgraceful misuse of government power to allow a police force to be used in this way, to use the power of the state against your political enemies. It should send a shiver down the spine of anybody who cares about the way a democracy should run—to use the power of the state, the police, against your political enemies. And what crime are we talking about? An allegation that 10 years ago some paperwork wasn't done. That warrants a police raid? It is absolutely outrageous, particularly when you think that just in the last few months Nigel Hadgkiss, the minister's hand-picked henchman at the building commission, resigned in disgrace for breaking the law. This man, the right hand of the employment minister, actually broke the law. Were the police called in? Was he dragged away in handcuffs? Was there a raid on the minister's office? No. The man quietly resigned, was quietly sent on his way.


And then we learnt that the minister knew of his transgression for a full year and kept him in the office. So it's okay when your friends break the law, but woe betide anybody you disagree with, woe betide anybody that disagrees with this government, because the full force of the state will be down on your head. There will be NBN raids against senators for speaking out against the NBN policy of this government. There will be AWU raids against the union from 10 years ago. It just beggars belief that we live in a democracy in the 21st century and these are the depths that this government and this Prime Minister—who, prior to being in politics, was well known as a lawyer and somewhat of a social progressive—will go to. This is how far he has descended. This is the abyss that he has come to in his desperate attempt to cling to government. Nothing is too low for this Prime Minister, as he clings to government, as he grapples with the right wing of his own party. 


I can't understand it. When I know police resources are stretched and we are told all the time that they have to make choices about what they can and what they can't do. In Tasmania, we've got five AFP officers for the entire state. I'm pleased to say that the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, has promised that a Labor government will restore AFP officers to Hobart Airport, and not before time. AFP officers were taken out of service by this government. We will restore those officers. 


Just yesterday, a pair of bikies was dragged off a plane at Hobart Airport. I believe Senator Abetz and Senator Bushby were on the plane. I'm not sure if the officers dragged the wrong people off the plane, but a pair of bikies were dragged off the plan. They weren't taken off the plane by AFP officers. That plane was on the tarmac and Tasmanian police had to be called in. They had to drive into the airport—because they're not based at the airport—and take the bikies off, and then the plane could go on its way. There was an hour delay, because Tasmanian police had to be called out because AFP officers are not based at the airport. That's the effect of this government. There are no AFP officers at Hobart Airport, but you've got AFP officers to raid union offices for alleged transgressions of 10 years ago. 


Why is this government so keen to push this latest legislation before us through? Because it deals with their political enemies. It is like groundhog day. Ten years ago, the former coalition government, the Howard government, thought it would be a brilliant idea to take on the workers of this country with that dreadful Work Choices legislation. 'That'd be a good idea!    Let's take on the unions and take on the workers of this country, cut their conditions, cut their pay, cut their penalty rates.' That worked out really well! Labor was swept into office in 2007.


We have an election in two years time. If you want to go to an election on this issue—the issue of taking on workers, reducing penalty rates, cutting workers' conditions, keeping wages flat and keeping work insecure—we would be very happy to accommodate you. The workers of this country—the employees, the cashiers, the office staff, the police, the nurses, the teachers—deserve better than what they're getting from this government. This government is trying to make it easier and easier to cut workers' pay, to cut workers' conditions, to make work more insecure, to make work more flexible for the employer, and to take away the rights, the conditions and the fairness of what it means to be a worker and a citizen in this country. 


We've just seen the disgraceful, unbelievable situation where penalty rates in this country were actually reduced, at a time when wages have never been flatter. Since records started wages have never been flatter, and you've reduced penalty rates. Corporate profits are at an all-time high, a record high. So let's reduce the penalty rates for people working on Sundays. Let's make it harder for them to make ends meet. With power prices going through the roof, let's make it harder for people who depend on Sunday penalty rates to pay their bills. Bravo! Bravo! While you're cutting taxes for millionaires and people earning over $180,000 a year, you're making it harder for people on modest incomes to make a living in this country. What an absolute disgrace you are. In Tasmania, United Voice—

"McBride, Emma, MP",ALP,2017-10-24,"



Ms McBRIDE
 (Dobell) (18:30):  Last week the Treasurer talked a lot about the latest jobs figures. What he didn't talk about was underemployment—the more than 1.1 million Australians looking for more work, needing more hours, or the 148,000 fewer apprentices and trainees in Australia since this government came to office, or unemployment, which is far too common among younger Australians. In my community on the Central Coast of New South Wales the latest jobs figures report that 17.6 per cent of 15- to 24-year-olds are looking for work.


While the overall increase in jobs for the month of September is welcome, what the Treasurer didn't talk about is the more than 30,000 commuters leaving the Central Coast each day for work. That's almost one in four working people on the Central Coast travelling over two hours each way door-to-door for work—commuters leaving Wyong train station at 6.05 am, only to arrive at Central at 7.51 am to change trains or catch a bus or walk before they get to their place of work. What the Treasurer didn't talk about matters. What the Treasurer didn't talk about was underemployment and unemployment, particularly in regional and rural Australia.


In the last five years the Central Coast population has grown by more than five per cent. My community is now home to almost 328,000 people. Forecasts project another 70,000 residents will call the Central Coast home over the next 20 years. We need more jobs in regional Australia. We need more jobs on the Central Coast. In fact, Regional Development Australia estimates 24,674 new jobs will be required in my region by 2031.


The job market is tough. The Treasurer might not recognise this, but it's a fact. It is particularly tough for young people starting out, for experienced workers retraining, for people who are employed casually or need more hours. Anglicare Australia's Jobs availability snapshot, released last week with the latest jobs figures, is a more accurate picture of working life in Australia today. It shows there are not enough entry level positions for people who need them. People with significant barriers to work are not benefitting from the increase in full-time employment. The growing casualisation of the workforce works against the ability of people with barriers to work to gain suitable and secure work. The market cannot be relied upon to fix these problems, without intervention.


The underlying issues driving unemployment, particularly amongst younger people, casualisation and underemployment must be addressed. For people living on the Central Coast, for my community, for regional Australians, it's time for a fair go. It's time for the state and federal governments to step up and back skills and training on the Central Coast and across regional Australia. On the coast we have higher numbers of people with trade qualifications than the national average, yet to upgrade a TAFE qualification, a plumber, like my brother Eddie, has to travel to North Sydney after doing a day's work on the tools.


Health and social assistance, my area of training and background, is one of the largest employers in our region, yet the government wants to introduce fees of up to $3,200 for Open Foundation and Newstep. Almost one in four commencing students at the University of Newcastle Ourimbah campus start their training through one of these programs—nurses like Michelle, who this year was recognised as Wyong Hospital Nurse of the Year, who wouldn't be a nurse today without enabling education, who wouldn't be serving our community without this program. But, rather than support plumbers like my brother Eddie or nurses like Michelle, this government is cutting TAFE funding and looking to introduce fees for Open Foundation and Next Step, putting obstacles in the way of apprentices and Open Foundation students—the most trusted pathway in my community for so many people to decent and secure work.


In the electorate of Dobell, the number of people who have followed this trusted path into decent work through an apprenticeship is higher than the national average. According to the latest census data, 57.7 per cent of people on the Central Coast with post-school qualifications have vocational education qualifications—10 points higher than the national average, which is currently sitting at 46.1 per cent. But this pathway is being undermined by conservative governments at state and federal levels. In the last 12 months alone, the number of new apprentices has dropped by 10.5 per cent. Australia, as I mentioned, now has 148,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than it did when this government was elected. TAFE and vocational education funding, as well as the number of supported students, is lower than it was a decade ago, despite a growing number of jobs requiring vocational skills. 


On the Central Coast, there are around 20,000 small businesses. Of these, around a quarter are in the construction industry. The residential construction industry is a major driver of the local economy. While building and construction courses are offered at TAFE campuses in Belmont and Ourimbah, the lack of local courses is a concern. Wyong TAFE, like many campuses in too many towns in regional centres across Australia, has had courses scaled back and fees increased. It's not surprising that between 2013 and 2015 employer dissatisfaction with the availability of vocational education in regional and rural areas has more than doubled. This includes employers like Ray from Ausiports in Berkeley Vale, who I spoke to, who is keen to put his new starters through training that just isn't available in their industry. Then there is Julie, who let me know that there is a proposal to remove the advanced diploma in WHS from the VET register and says: 'Surely this cannot be happening. The growing industry on the Central Coast is construction, manufacturing and warehousing. Tighes Hill, where this course is offered, is an industrial town.' People like Ray and Julie are just baffled by the government's inaction. Once you pass the first hurdle and you've found a course, the government then puts another obstacle in your way. It hikes up fees and cuts support, like cutting the Tools for Your Trade subsidy, which it cut in 2014, making it harder for people, particularly young people, trying to get a trade.


Our community on the Central Coast needs a new approach. For people living on the coast, the people of Dobell, it's time for the government to give them a fair go. Labor has a plan to invest in skills and apprenticeships, and I'm particularly pleased about the benefits this will bring to Central Coast apprentices, students and employers. Labor has set a target of one in 10 apprentices on all Commonwealth priority projects, including major government business enterprise projects. Labor will also invest in skills and apprentices by expanding pre-apprentice programs for young jobseekers. Labor will reverse this year's budget cuts in full and expand programs for young jobseekers and workers in transition. We'll also ensure apprenticeship targets for Commonwealth projects. Most importantly, Labor will guarantee at least two-thirds of public vocational education funding for TAFE, re-establishing TAFE as the public provider of quality vocational education across Australia. Labor's Building TAFE for the Future Fund will revitalise TAFE, the backbone of vocational education in Australia, particularly campuses and facilities in regional areas. This will be incredibly important for those on the Central Coast—for apprentices, for business.


The government often talks about choice, but choice is a privilege. Currently on the Central Coast only one in two students have the opportunity to finish high school, and more than 45 per cent of the working-age population have no post-school qualifications. Australia needs to invest in education, skills and training more than ever. But across the board this government has delivered nothing but cuts. They have cut $22 billion from Australian schools, like regional schools in my community on the Central Coast. They're trying to cut $3.8 billion from Australian universities, and campuses like the Ourimbah Campus of Newcastle University cannot afford these cuts. They have cut $2.8 billion from TAFE training and apprenticeships. Our future and the future of the Central Coast is at risk. Our prosperity—locally, regionally and nationally—is at risk from this approach. This government has been careless. This government is just not investing in regional Australia. It needs to change. It must change—for students, for trainees, for businesses and for our community on the coast.
