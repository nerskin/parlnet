"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation (Senator Ian Macdonald), the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan), to questions without notice asked by Senators O'Brien, Sherry and Buckland today relating to the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service and superannuation guarantee.
The Liberal government has been scheming illegally not to pay the superannuation guarantee to thousands of employees who are contractors within the Public Service—its own employees. Thousands of contractors who have worked in the Commonwealth Public Service since 1998 have not been paid their basic superannuation entitlement, the superannuation guarantee. How do we know about this? The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service entered into so-called contractual agreements with some 300 of its meat and veterinary inspectors in 1998—and the number has increased over time—and specifically excluded those alleged contractors from the payment of the superannuation guarantee. The superannuation guarantee in this country requires a payment at the present time of eight per cent into superannuation. That increases to nine per cent on 1 July. 
The Liberal government of Australia has been contriving illegally to avoid paying superannuation contributions for many thousands of members of its own work force. This is an issue that is not simply confined to meat inspectors and veterinary contractors, because there are literally thousands of such arrangements across the public sector. What is frightening about this issue is that none of the three ministers had any idea about what has been going on, and I find that particularly surprising when the quarantine service has actually admitted that it acted illegally. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service issued a letter to these workers, I understand, about a week and a half to two weeks ago. I have a copy of the letter, so I know what has taken place. In the letter, the quarantine service admits that, as the employer, it acted illegally—that the Liberal government of Australia acted illegally—in not paying superannuation guarantee payments to this particular class of workers.
It would take only a reasonably knowledgeable person to read the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 to know that this is the case. In section 12, the act defines employees and employers for superannuation purposes. Section 12(3) reads:
If a person works under a contract that is wholly or principally for the labour of the person, the person is an employee of the other party to the contract.
It is very clear that, under the act, this class of individuals should have been paid their superannuation guarantee. The consequence is that the quarantine service have to not only start paying the superannuation guarantee for government workers in this area but also back pay the superannuation contributions for 3¾ years and pay interest. They admit this in their letter to the meat inspectors and veterinary contractors.
I pose the question: how widespread is this in the public sector in general? There are thousands of individuals on these types of contracting arrangements who apparently have been denied their legal entitlement of the superannuation guarantee. How can you trust the Liberal government to protect the superannuation entitlements of Australian workers when they illegally schemed to deny superannuation guarantee payments to thousands in their own work force? Their own work force has been denied basic superannuation guarantee payments. It is an appalling situation that three ministers apparently know nothing about.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2002-06-18,"—The Liberal-National coalition went to the last election with one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching superannuation agendas ever presented to the parliament. Part of today's motion to take note of answers to questions covered that very wide agenda of about seven major initiatives which are going to be of great assistance to the Australian community. What is interesting to note, of course, is that the opposition spokesman on superannuation, Senator Sherry—
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. My point of order goes to relevance. I took note of the three questions relating to the non-payment by the government of the superannuation guarantee—nothing else. Whilst I respect Senator Watson's knowledge and contributions from time to time, he is not speaking to the relevant motion before the chair, which is the superannuation guarantee and the failure of this government, a Liberal government, to pay the superannuation guarantee—nothing else.
—This is always a wide-ranging debate, and I am sure that Senator Watson is about to draw his remarks to the answers.
—The issue of paying the superannuation guarantee is on the basis of an employer-employee type relationship. All honourable members of this Senate know, for example, that when you employ an independent contractor there is no superannuation guarantee, but there is often a fine line between a contractor and an employee. This question as to when a person is an employee and when a person is an independent contractor has been debated at great length, especially by the Australian Taxation Office in relation to this and other matters. In recent years the Australian Taxation Office, in particular, has tried to narrow that difference to bring a lot of employment that would essentially be in the nature of a contractor type relationship into the scope of being an employer-employee relationship. Those cases are well documented. Following the narrowing of that definition and bringing many contractors within the scope of an employer-employee relationship, the question, naturally, of a number of people who are employed as independent contractors came within the ambit of scrutiny. 
Following recent advice, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has taken steps to meet its responsibility under the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. As a result, a retrospective liability of something like $2.75 million was calculated independently and audited by Ernst and Young. That was an acknowledgment of this focus of bringing so many people who were previously under contracts within the scope of the employer-employee relationship. That was something that emerged over time. It was not the illegality that Senator Sherry referred to; it was a changing recognition of what the law was meant to espouse. Individual contractors were formally advised of their entitlements and, as a result, they will shortly be contacted by the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust with the details. I would point out that AGEST is the body responsible for handling the superannuation arrangements for these particular people.
AQIS, the employer body, is making arrangements to retrospectively contribute its superannuation liabilities to the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust in accordance with normal procedures, whereby an employer is required to meet certain superannuation obligations on behalf of their employees. Efficiencies from the contractor arrangements and the government's 40 per cent export assistance funding will assist in ensuring that this particular cost will not impact on AQIS fee levels for the meat processing sector for 2002-03. This is good news for the industry. Because this is a cost that could impact on export prices and export returns, it is very important for the industry to know that those costs will not and cannot be passed on.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-06-18,"—It is amazing that in this debate Senator Watson attempts to categorise the actions of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, AQIS, as some misunderstanding of the intricacies of whether a contractor is an employee or a contractor. This is not a matter that is determined in the ordinary course of the law. In fact—and this not what I say; this is what AQIS says—under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992, certain independent contractors are deemed to be employees for the purposes of the act. One of the exclusions is an independent contractor who is incorporated. I understand that what these so-called independent contractors are doing is providing labour—providing their professional services personally, not in any other form. So it was not a case of misunderstanding the intricacies of case law; it was a case of not understanding the government's own legislation. Probably more to the point, it was a case of seeking to skate around it so that these employees would not be paid their superannuation entitlements.
I asked a question of Senator Macdonald today as he had answered a question on notice for me in May this year, through the questions on notice process, where he adverted to AQIS taking advice on this matter, but he did not advise me in response to my question that AQIS knew as late as last year that there was—this is the term AQIS use— `potential liability'. In fact, what I believe happened is they were told they were liable and they decided to have that matter checked by the tax office and by the Department of Finance and Administration. So both Senator Minchin's department and Senator Coonan's department have been involved in this matter since last year. But what did we see today in the Senate? Senator Macdonald apparently did not have a brief on the matter, Senator Minchin did not know about the matter and Senator Coonan did not apparently know about the matter in answer to questions in question time today. Does that mean that they have not been briefed by their department? I suspect not. But in relation to this matter, where the government has denied their employees— 
Government senators interjecting—
—It is very interesting that Senator Ferguson and Senator Watson and Senator Hill are saying this matter is not important. I thought that Senator Coonan answered a dorothy dixer in the chamber today about how important superannuation was, praising the government for its actions but ignoring the fact that it was trying to dud its own employees. And Senator Minchin could not fess up to the fact that this has actually been policy of the previous minister in relation to the department of finance advising other departments on how they could avoid their obligations—obviously badly, because in this case AQIS mucked up to the extent they are going to have to pay these people, or pay their superannuation contributions into AGEST. And they are going to have to pay interest on those contributions. That is shoddy administration, and the fact of the matter is that it was deliberately shoddy in an attempt to avoid paying these people their rightful superannuation contributions.
Another point of my question which I am anxious to receive an answer on is whether AQIS will now try and reduce the pay of these inspectors. AQIS allege that they took the superannuation payments into account when they set the hourly rate. The implication is that they are now going to try and, in the next negotiation, ratchet down the payments for these officers who are responsible for protecting our borders—one of this government's claims to the so-called high moral ground. But they are going to in this process, I suspect, try and take pay away from—
—But they have not.
—Well, we will see the answer, Senator Watson. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation: Contractors</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-06-18,"—Once again the Labor Party are on the big pictures: they are raising the major issues in the Senate chamber when we only have a couple of weeks of sitting before we finish. And the one issue they can raise is brought up by Senator Sherry, the opposition's major nitpicker in superannuation, who I see is not here now anyway, having made his small contribution. I am also disappointed, of course, that Senator Conroy is not here, because he was always going to make a major play in relation to superannuation comment. But I can understand why he is not here: because the three-million-dollar man, Senator Carr, is back—the man who cost the government $3 million when it comes to answering questions on notice at estimates. I thought Senator Conroy would be here so he could keep in close consultation with his new leader, Senator Carr, from the Victorian Socialist Left, now that Senator Conroy no longer controls—
—Would you like to address the question, please?
—Madam Deputy President, as you well know, Senator Conroy has a very keen interest in superannuation and I was quite sure that he would be here to hear this debate. In relation to all matters relating to superannuation, the Labor Party now continues to nitpick and run second. They never come up with any new ideas. As a matter of fact, the last major opposition that I saw from the Labor Party in relation to superannuation was when the government, in 1996, introduced a superannuation surcharge. And do you know that, for all of that time, Senator Sherry completely opposed the imposition of a superannuation surcharge? Now that the government intends to reduce that superannuation surcharge by a small percentage, an incremental percentage, where do we find Senator Sherry? Opposing the reduction. He did not want a surcharge in the first place and now he opposes any incremental reduction in the surcharge, which is the government's policy. Our policy is to have lower taxation, which will benefit the Australian people. But not Senator Sherry; he only opposes things for the sake of opposition. He opposed the introduction of a surcharge and, now that the surcharge has been introduced, he opposes the incremental reduction of the surcharge.
One wonders what Labor Party policy on superannuation in general will be at any stage. I am quite sure that they do not know. They have no idea what their policy on superannuation is, or will be in the future, because they have never presented a complete superannuation policy package to the Australian people whenever we have had an election. So we have got to the situation where they feel they have found one discrepancy. When Senator Sherry asked the question, the minister said he would take it on notice. Senator Sherry has not waited for the answer; he has decided he is going to bore in full steam ahead, regardless of what answer might come from Senator Minchin in response to his question. The senator quite rightly took the question on notice because, if he did not have brief on this particular matter, then it was only right and proper that he should wait until he has a full answer before he can respond to Senator Sherry's concern. 
The one thing we know about the Labor Party is that they will criticise this government for not keeping its election promises and commitments. The real problem is that they will not let us keep our election promises. They are trying to stop us from making good our election promises, and one of those promises was to make an incremental reduction in the surcharge. The Labor Party needs to make its mind up: does it support us keeping the election promise or does it wish us to be unable to go forward with the promise we made to the electors who overwhelmingly re-elected our government?
I notice Senator Greig is sitting in the chamber. I am quite sure he is not going to talk on superannuation; I am sure he has something else in mind. Senator Greig's party does not want us to keep our promises either. I do not know whether that is because of pressure from his leader, whether it is a decision that they have made jointly or whether they have decided that for pure cheap political populism they will say, `I don't think the people would like us to do that.'
—I take your point, Senator Watson. They are now described as an opposition party. In the paper today, it talks about the opposition `parties' opposing things. I always thought that the official opposition sits on that side of the chamber and the party that sits in that far corner is something different.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-06-18,"—I am not too sure where Senator Ferguson was going there, but he certainly was not addressing the question of the disgrace that has occurred relating to AQIS employees, albeit under the guise of contractors. He seemed to be more interested in what other parties were doing or what they were called, so I do not think we can count on any part of his contribution. Along with my colleagues, I asked questions of the minister today relating to the payment or non-payment of superannuation for AQIS employees. Senator Coonan was unable to answer. I take it in good faith that she will, indeed, get us a response. Given the age of this issue, I am surprised that she did not have a brief or at least understand the enormity of the problem that exists.
In an answer to Senator Chapman, Senator Coonan made the comment that the government is committed to an effective way for Australians to save for their future, and that, indeed, superannuation was that effective way. If that is correct, why is it that the government has denied superannuation to employees of AQIS who are employed as meat inspectors and vets? It appears to me that, on putting this group of workers under contract—this new, you-beaut way of ridding yourself of workers, but still having them there and reducing wages in the general sense—the government used people who were not very experienced to draw up those employment agreements. In my years of dealing with industrial agreements and awards, there was never an occasion when a new provision was made without thorough scrutiny of that provision to ensure that no illegality was involved. But here we are with a government department negotiating with its workers and including an illegal clause within the agreement.
The agreements that these workers are provided with have a number of components that are quite offensive—the fact that they provide their own steel and their own knives. That may seem trivial, but that is how far AQIS went to look at ways of cost cutting. The other way was that they made it very clear that AQIS meat inspectors would make their own arrangements for taxation, superannuation, insurance and all other overheads. It is offensive to Australian workers that we should be doing that. It is more offensive that it is occurring at the direction of the federal government to its own employees. It is sending a terrible message to industry at large in relation to superannuation. 
The Australian Labor Party, unlike as suggested in the comments that were made by Senator Ferguson, has a proud history in relation to superannuation. Indeed, we are the ones who introduced this scheme for Australian workers. We can stand on our history as being those who are most concerned for those who are most at risk. We did it so that people could rightly have a way of saving for their future and for their retirement, so that they would not be totally dependent on handouts in the future. Senator Coonan was right, too, when she made the comments about it being an effective way for Australians to save for their future. However, she was wrong to think that, after the time that this issue has been around, as Senator O'Brien said— (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-18,"—by leave—I have a response to a return to order and would like to table a response and incorporate a brief tabling statement.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Could the Senate have notice as to what that return to order was, please?
—It is a tabling on behalf of Senator Helen Coonan. It is a return to order dated 16 May 2002 seeking a copy of a KPMG report in relation to an investigation into the affairs of certain small APRA superannuation funds, of which Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd was the former trustee.
The statement read as follows—
I present to the Senate a report by Mr Tony McGrath of KPMG, as the APRA appointed inspector, into the Small APRA Superannuation Funds that had invested in a unit trust known as the Enhanced Cash Management Trust (ECMT), formerly under the trusteeship of Commercial Nominees of Australia Limited (CNAL).
Mr McGrath was appointed by APRA on 19 March 2001, as an Inspector for the purposes of the conduct of investigations under Division 4 of Part 25 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act). Mr McGrath was asked to investigate the affairs of 227 Small APRA Funds (SAF), specifically as to whether there was sufficient evidence to establish fraudulent conduct or theft for the purposes of section 229 of the SIS Act.
Mr McGrath concentrated his report on 17 of the SAFs with the largest exposure to the ECMT as the conduct of CNAL in those 17 cases can be taken as indicative of all its conduct in the context of SAFs and the ECMT.
Mr McGrath concluded that there was sufficient evidence to establish fraudulent conduct or theft for the purposes of section 229 of the SIS Act on the part of CNAL and its officers. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator the Hon Helen Coonan, will have regard to these findings to assist in consideration of the applications for financial assistance under Part 23 of the SIS Act.
The Government would not ordinarily agree to the tabling of a report of this kind in the Parliament. This is because the report contains some information that would in normal circumstances give rise to privacy concerns. In particular the report contains the specific names of superannuation funds and the amount of superannuation savings contained in those funds. However, in this circumstance, the Government has determined that the report can be released as these details will be tabled when determinations are made for financial assistance to certain funds formerly under the trusteeship of CNAL with an exposure to the ECMT.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION: COMMERCIAL NOMINEES OF AUSTRALIA LTD</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,4,1

The government response read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO SENATE FINANCE AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT: COMMONWEALTH CONTRACTS: A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR ACCOUNTABILITY
WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS 1-4
The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee report—Commonwealth Contracts: A New Framework for Accountability was tabled in the Senate on 26 September 2001. The report was the conclusion of an inquiry into the mechanism for providing accountability to the Senate in relation to government contracts that commenced on 12 April 2000. The key objective of the inquiry was to analyse the “mechanism contained in general business notice of motion no. 489, standing in the name of Senator Murray, providing for accountability to the Senate in relation to government contracts”. 
The Government is keenly aware of the importance of transparency and accountability when managing Government contracts. 
Accordingly, Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (FMA) agencies operate under a robust accountability framework that enables detailed scrutiny of any contracts that they may enter into. The legislative and policy framework governing FMA agencies includes the:
·	Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997
·	Financial Management and Accountability Regulations
·	Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance;
·	Chief Executive's Instructions;
·	Freedom of Information Act 1982
·	Ombudsman Act 1976
·	Auditor-General Act 1997;
·	Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951;
·	Public Works Committee Act 1969; and
·	Mandatory Reporting of Commonwealth Contracts.
The current legislative and policy framework aims to provide an environment of accountability and transparency while also ensuring the positive economic benefits of contract management are not lost through excessive administrative requirements.
Recommendation 1: Amendments to the Senate Order
The committee recommends that the order passed by the Senate on 20 June 2001 be amended to read:
LISTS OF DEPARTMENTAL AND AGENCY CONTRACTS—ORDER FOR PRODUC-TION OF DOCUMENTS
(1)	There be laid on the table, by each minister in the Senate, in respect of each agency administered by that minister, or by a minister in the House of Representatives represented by that minister, by not later than the tenth day of the spring and autumn sittings, a letter of advice that a list of contracts in accordance with paragraph (2) has been placed on the Internet, with access to the list through the department's or agency's home page.
(2)	The list of contracts referred to in paragraph (1) indicate:
(a)	each contract entered into by the agency which has not been fully performed or which has been entered into during the previous 12 months, and which provides for a consideration to the value of $100 000 or more;
(b)	the contractor, the amount of the consideration and the subject matter of each such contract; 
(c)	whether each such contract contains provisions requiring the parties to maintain confidentiality of any of its provisions, or whether there are any other requirements of confidentiality, and a statement of the reasons for the confidentiality; and
(d)	an estimate of the cost of complying with this order and a statement of the method used to make the estimate.
(2A)	If a list under paragraph (1) does not fully comply with the requirements of paragraph (2), the letter under paragraph (1) indicate the extent of, and reasons for, non-compliance, and when full compliance is expected to be achieved. Examples of non-compliance may include:
i) the list is not up to date
ii) not all relevant agencies are included
ii) contracts all of which are confidential are not included.
(2B)	Where no contracts have been entered into by a department or agency, the letter under paragraph (1) is to advise accordingly.
(3)	In respect of contracts identified as containing provisions of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(c), the Auditor-General be requested to provide to the Senate, within 6 months after each day mentioned in paragraph (1), a report indicating that the Auditor-General has examined a number of such contracts selected by the Auditor-General, and indicating whether any inappropriate use of such provisions was detected in that examination.
(3A)	In respect of letters including matter under paragraph (2A), the Auditor-General be requested to indicate in a report under paragraph (3) that the Auditor-General has examined a number of contracts, selected by the Auditor-General, which have not been included in a list, and to indicate whether the contracts should be listed.
(4)	The Finance and Public Administration References Committee consider and report on the first year of operation of this order.
(5)	This order has effect on and after 1 July 2001.
(6)	In this order:
“agency” means an agency within the meaning of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997;
“autumn sittings” means the period of sittings of the Senate first commencing on a day after 1 January in any year;
“previous 12 months” means the period of 12 months ending on the day before the first day of sitting of the autumn or spring sittings, as the case may be;
“spring sittings” means the period of sittings of the Senate first commencing on a day after 31 July in any year.
Response: Agree in principle
On Thursday, 27 September 2001 Senator George Campbell moved, and the Senate passed, a motion that the Senate order on departmental and agency contracts be amended in line with this recommendation. 
The Government will comply with the spirit of the amended order on the same terms as the original order.
The amended Senate order clarifies that agencies' lists of contracts are to cover the period of 12 months ending on the day before the first day of sitting of the autumn or spring sittings (as the case may be). 
As ministers are required, under the Senate order, to table letters of advice in the Senate by not later than the tenth day of the relevant sittings, this clarification means that there is a relatively small `window' for agencies to bring their lists up to date, brief their ministers on the lists, including sensitivities, and for ministers to table their letters of advice. 
The Government notes that it will be challenging for agencies, particularly those with large numbers of contracts to be listed, to complete their preparations in sufficient time to enable the tabling deadline to be met. 
As material assessed as Commercial in Confidence (CIC) can change over time, agencies may need to periodically reassess their classification of contractual material.
The Government notes that the Auditor-General is examining a selection of the contracts listed on the Internet to assess whether there was any inappropriate use of confidentiality provisions, as requested in the Senate order.
Recommendation 2: Changes to the Gazette Publishing System (GaPS)
a)	The committee recommends that GaPS be amended to provide:
·	An extra field, or another additional facility to record data, that can be used to notify the public of the existence of each confidentiality clause; 
·	A set of codes that specifically indicate the reason for each restriction, for example, national security, personal privacy or commercial sensitivity (including the relevant ANAO criterion);
·	Information about the end date, renewal, extension of and amendment to, contracts listed; and
·	The capacity to sort information in GaPS by agency, contract value and whether the fields notifying confidentiality is filled.
Response: Noted
a)	The Department of Finance and Administration recently undertook a strategic and technical review of the Gazette Publishing System (GaPS). The aims of the review were to examine the current objectives of the gazettal of Government procurement information to determine the ongoing relevance of the objectives against emerging demands and stakeholder needs and to undertake an assessment of the capacity of the system to meet these needs.
The amendments to GaPS recommended by the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee have been considered as part of this review. 
The Committee will be advised of the Government's decisions on changes to the GaPS system once they are finalised. 
Recommendation 2: Changes to the Gazette Publishing System (GaPS)
b)	The committee also recommends that where the secretary of a department or agency head has decided to exclude a contract from notification in GaPS the reasons should be documented and made available to the Auditor-General on request.
Response: Agree
b)	The recommendation that reasons for excluding a contract from notification in GaPS should be documented and made available to the Auditor-General on request is consistent with current policy. 
The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 require that Chief Executives can issue a direction, in writing, not to gazette contracts or standing orders that are exempt matters under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. This direction should include the reason for non-gazettal and be kept on file for audit purposes. 
Recommendation 3: Changes to annual reporting requirements
The committee recommends that annual reports of Financial Management and Accountability Act agencies provide the following information:
·	The web address of lists of contracts of $100 000 more;
·	A report on compliance with the Senate order;
·	A report on training completed by officers undertaking procurement functions;
·	A report on the inclusion in RFTs and contracts of advice about public and parliamentary accountability responsibilities; and
·	A report on the agency's compliance with mandatory reporting requirements and steps taken to improve the integrity of its data in GaPS.
Response: Disagree
The recommendations are already largely accommodated by existing measures. Relevant agencies report against guidelines, called the Requirements for Annual Reports (the Requirements), approved on behalf of the Parliament by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit under subsections 63(2) and 70(2) of the Public Service Act 1999. 
The aim of the Requirements is to provide a clear and concise framework for annual reports which is consistent with standards of accountability but which also minimises duplication with other annual whole-of-government reporting, the availability of information through the Internet, and other reporting regimes such as applies under the amended Senate order.
The Government has provided additional clarification for each sub point of the recommendation below.
·	The web address of lists of contracts of $100 000 more;
In line with the amended Senate order, lists of appropriate contracts are posted on departmental and agency homepages. Department's are required to include their homepage addresses in annual reports under existing agency annual reporting requirements.
·	A report on compliance with the Senate order;
The requirement of the amended Senate order for letters of compliance to be tabled in the Senate twice a year provides transparency of agency compliance, exclusive of being included in the annual report requirements. This process would duplicate the tabling requirement and information already available in Hansard. 
·	A report on training completed by officers undertaking procurement functions.
Many agencies have devolved procurement functions throughout the organisation. Therefore, under the broad scope of “training completed by officers undertaking procurement functions”, some agencies would be required to report the training undertaken by the majority of their staff. 
While the Government does not support a separate reporting requirement on training, it notes that the Requirements detail that agencies must provide an assessment of their effectiveness in managing and developing staff to achieve objectives. This extends to key training and development strategies, the outcomes of training and development, and evaluation of effectiveness. Reporting on this training separately would duplicate effort.
·	A report on the inclusion in RFTs and contracts of advice about public and parliamentary accountability responsibilities.
The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 require that “Agencies should include provisions in tender documentation and contracts that alert prospective providers to the public accountability requirements of the Commonwealth, including disclosure to Parliament and its Committees.” 
Under Financial Management and Accountability Regulation 8 “an official who takes action that is not consistent with the Guidelines must make a written record of his or her reasons for doing so”.
·	A report on the agency's compliance with mandatory reporting requirements and steps taken to improve the integrity of its data in GaPS.
Reporting requirements are mandatory, therefore compliance is non-discretionary. As a result all agencies would be required to report full compliance. 
The recently completed Strategic and Technical Review of GaPS conducted by the Department of Finance and Administration examined data integrity issues. The Committee will be advised of the Government's decisions on changes to the GaPS system once they are finalised. 
Recommendation 4: Accountability to the Senate
The committee recommends that potential and actual partners to a government contract be informed that contracts and contract related material may be requested by Parliament and `that there are no areas in connection with the expenditure of public funds where any person has a discretion to withhold details or explanations from the parliament or its committee unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise'.
Response: Agree in principle
The Government is supportive of making suppliers to Government aware that contracts and contract related material may be requested by and provided to Parliament and its Committees, recognising, where appropriate, the application of public interest immunity. 
The Whole-of-Government response to ANAO report No.38: The Use of Confidentiality Provisions in Government Contracts, supported the recommendation that “agencies should include provisions in tender documentation that alert prospective tenderers or contractors to the implications of the public accountability responsibilities of agencies”.
The Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 require that “Agencies should include provisions in tender documentation and contracts that alert prospective providers to the public accountability requirements of the Commonwealth, including disclosure to Parliament and its Committees.”

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-18,"—I have a point of clarification, Mr Acting Deputy President. When the minister introduced the report and sought leave for its printing, I rose in my place to take note of the report. You did not acknowledge me.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—You spoke, Senator Harris, and as a result I must say that I gave you the call.
—That was in relation to the ASIO bill.

I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the report. 
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report. 
I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
—Is leave granted?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I take a further point of order which goes to another matter. I will certainly grant leave if the situation is as the senator has described it. I think you take those things at face value if a senator says they were seeking the call and no-one in the chamber was aware of that being the case. I want to take a separate point of order.
—Shall we deal with the matter first. You are taking a separate point of order, Senator Faulkner.

—My question only goes to seeking some advice from you. It is a minor matter, but I want to be clear on it for future reference. I thought it was unusual that the duty minister presented this report on behalf of a committee, and not the whip, another member of the committee or another senator in the chamber. I wanted to seek advice as to whether that was the case. I do not think it affects the status of such a report. This is not a report that goes to the minister's direct responsibility or representational responsibility. I think that is right, Senator Ellison, but I was seeking advice in relation to procedure. I did note it at the time, but because another senator was on his feet taking a point of order I did not rise on that point. But I now seek your advice in relation to that matter. It is a minor matter, but I want to be clear for the future about where we stand in this regard.
—You are right, Senator Faulkner: it is not usual. But I understand that it is not contrary to standing orders either.
—I am not suggesting it is contrary to the standing orders—there is clearly no standing order that says a minister cannot present a committee report—but it is unusual. I assume it was just a matter of circumstances. I wonder whether there is any intention by the government to change the normal procedures where the whip or the whip's representative present reports. If that is the case, we will get into problems if we are dealing with matters which go to ministers' responsibilities. I accept that it is not the case here; I accept that it is unusual. I do not want to create a precedent that may cause problems at a later stage.
—Would you care to clarify that, Senator Ellison?

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-06-18,"—Yesterday the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee took evidence from a large number of witnesses as part of its inquiry into the management of the United States beef quota issue. I must say that during my time in this place I have not witnessed such an intensity of feeling against a minister as that directed at the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, yesterday, and that intensity of feeling came across from such a large section of a major rural industry. This view was highlighted by the formal submission from the Australian Lot Feeders Association. In that submission, the association described claims by Mr Truss about his decision on the quota scheme as `deceitful'. The submission claimed:
 The blatant political interference by the Minister in fiddling with the allocation percentages has prostituted his position as Minister.
Those statements were not made in the heat of the debate but in a formal, considered written submission to the committee. A number of processors laid out for the committee the extent of the job losses they were concerned would flow if Mr Truss pushed on with his model. The tally is in the order of 5,700 direct jobs, many concentrated in small communities where meatworks are the major employers.
It was clear from these hearings that not only is there widespread anger within the beef sector directed at Mr Truss but additionally the relationships between some sectors of the industry have also been strained by the minister's management of this matter. I find it difficult to understand how the minister could make such a mess and alienate almost everyone in the process. We are, after all, talking about an industry worth billions of dollars and an export market that accounts for 40 per cent of the beef we export.
It is vital that this major industry now develop a strategy to move on from the chaos induced by the minister. What is required is not only a strategy to best manage the US quota—and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee will report on its views on that point some time, I hope early next week—but also a strategy to rebuild the focus of all beef sectors on our total export effort. That focus has been all but destroyed by Mr Truss. What is required is a plan to rebuild that focus, and I will be writing to all industry organisations proposing that a group be established that is representative of all industry interests. That group may need only to have a limited life and may be built around the existing Red Meat Advisory Council structure or some amended version of that structure. This industry is too important to simply allow the existing structures in place to continue to provide the basis for consultation where those structures are simply ignored by Mr Truss. All sectors of the industry must now review these structures. The new industry group that I hope will emerge from this process should develop strategies to build our global export effort. Its first task should be to address the issue of quotas.
The second issue that I want to touch upon tonight is the application by the Philippines to import bananas into Australia. The minister, Mr Truss, has refused to provide Australian banana growers an extension of time to consider and comment on a 391-page technical information paper. That paper, entitled Importation of fresh bananas from the Philippines, details possible pest and disease threats from imports to local industry and its farmers. The 30 days that the minister, Mr Truss, gave the banana industry to respond to the technical report expired on 5 June.
During the recent estimates hearings, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Troeth, to ask the minister to grant Australian banana growers adequate time to consider this important report. That was a request from the industry and, in my view, not an unreasonable request. I then wrote to Senator Troeth on 11 June to follow up my earlier request. Senator Troeth has not bothered to provide the Senate committee or Australian banana growers with the courtesy of a response to my direct request to her, nor has she bothered to reply to my letter. It is clear why Australian banana growers are dirty on this government, given the level of indifference to their concerns about the impact imported fruit might have on them, their families and their industry.
In providing growers with just 30 days to comment on what is a detailed technical document, in my opinion Mr Truss is in breach of his own guidelines. The latest administrative guidelines issued by the government state that stakeholders `will have 60 days to submit comments' on technical information papers. The guidelines quite rightly state: `This will be their'—that is, the stakeholders—`first opportunity for detailed input into the import risk assessment.' In fact, the technical report on the importation of Philippine bananas states that the risk assessment panel will take stakeholder comments on the report into account in the preparation of the import risk assessment: that is, this technical report will be the foundation upon which the import risk assessment is built. If there are flaws in the technical paper, it follows that there will be flaws in the import risk assessment. It is clear that Mr Truss and Senator Troeth are continuing to treat Australian banana growers like second-class citizens. I think that this key rural industry deserves better.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade: United States Beef Quota</title>,Adjournment,17,1
