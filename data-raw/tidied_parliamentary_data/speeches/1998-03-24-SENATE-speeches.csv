"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the financial interests of Senator Parer.
Both Senator Parer and the Prime Minister have claimed today that Senator Parer's companies sold their stake in Pan Australian Resources in 1995. It would appear that this claim is contradicted by current Australian Securities Commission documents which show both QCMM Group (ESP) and Kiskin on behalf of the Parer family trust as current shareholders in Pan Australian Resources Pty Ltd. We will be interested to hear Senator Parer's explanation in relation to that matter.
Senator Parer has been a minister in the Howard government now for just on two years. Let us have a look at what his performance has been in terms of meeting the very low standards of ministerial conduct that were put in place by Mr Howard at the start of his government's term.
The Prime Minister's own code requires ministers to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business in any area of their portfolio. But Senator Parer, the minister for coal, held a $2 million interest in a coalmine through his 
 family trust, personally held shares in an associated employee company, and also, as the minister for just about very other resource, held shares in Pan Australian Resources. That is the first breach of the Prime Minister's discredited code.
The code also states that the transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment. But Senator Parer now purports to satisfy the code by passing his trust holdings to his adult children. And this does not fit any reasonable reading of the Prime Minister's words. That is Senator Parer's second breach of the code.
The code also states that the minister should not intentionally mislead the parliament or the public. Senator Parer has misled this parliament and the public many times by not declaring his trust holdings as required by the parliament, by not declaring his personal shareholdings, by repeatedly failing to declare these interests when speaking or voting on relevant matters in the Senate on bills and legislation, by numerous public statements that he had fully disclosed everything when that was never the case, and also by his public statements that he never personally held shares in mining companies. That is five more breaches of the Prime Minister's own discredited code.
The code also says that ministers should avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private profit. But Senator Parer used a taxpayer funded trip to Japan to hold discussions with the two joint venturer partners in his coalmine, who, as the major customers for his coal, increased their coal orders from Jellinbah by over 25 per cent after that trip. That is breach No. 7 of the Prime Minister's code.
Of course, the code also says that a minister must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. But Senator Parer was dobbed in by Mr Harold Shand as having had ongoing contact with Mr Shand as the managing director of the coalmine operator and as having had conversations that included discussion of industry matters. 
As far as we are concerned, they are just eight examples of the minister having misled the Australian public about his personal interests conflicting with his public duties. We say that this code is discredited, that the Prime Minister is utterly discredited, that Senator Parer is completely discredited, and so is the government whom he represents in this chamber. He is so discredited that it really is a gall for him to remain a minister.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-03-24,"—What absolute hypocrisy on the part of the Australian Labor Party yet again. When the greatest rorter and conflicter of interests in recent times in this parliament, the then Leader of the Labor Party, was conflicting in his interests over the piggery, over tax and over the Commonwealth Bank for a long period of time, there was not a whimper from the Australian Labor Party. So it is obvious why the Labor Party has lost this issue.
I wish to oppose the motion before the chair—that is, that we take note of the answers from Senator Parer—and wish to move as an amendment that we take notice of the answers given by Senator Kemp and Senator Herron, because those answers and those questions were about the real issues confronting the Australian public, not the continual muckraking and slime dredging by the Labor Party. The real issues are about jobs and health. The questions that Senator Herron and Senator Kemp answered were about that.
—Senator Macdonald, are you seriously moving those amendments?
—Yes, if I can.
—No, they are not in order, because they do not relate to the subject matter that is before the chair.
—The subject matter before the chair is that we take notice of the answer from Senator Parer. My amendment is that we take notice of the answer by Senator Herron.
—Note or notice?
—Note—take note of.
—It is moving it to a different motion. Therefore, it is not in order.
—The motion before the chair is that we take note of the answers given by Senator Parer—just that we take note of his answers. My amendment is that we take note of the answers given not by Senator Parer but by Senator Herron. And it is simply a motion to take note of answers. I am suggesting that the motion should be amended to delete reference to the answer by Senator Parer and include Senator Herron's name in its stead .
—And I am saying—
—Madam Deputy President, could I suggest a way of approaching it. One of the concerns is that the whole half-hour could be taken up before we actually get to another opportunity to take note of an answer by Senator Herron. So if Senator Macdonald is allowed to simply add to it then that enables him to deal with this at the same time. If the others want to carry on about Senator Parer's answers, then they can do that as well.
—It is out of order because it is not relating to the subject matter of Senator Parer's answer.
—I realise that the Labor Party are just trying to stop me talking about the real issue confronting Australia, which is health. We want to talk about health.
—But you don't want to defend Parer.
—We do not have to defend Senator Parer. Senator Parer has had not an iota, not a skerrick, of evidence brought against him that he was in conflict. But we want to talk about the real issues. So I will speak to this motion by opposing it, saying we should not take note of the answer by Senator Parer, because there are other matters more important.
This issue of taking note of Senator Parer's answer is quite ridiculous. Not even the 
 Democrats raised this issue today, which shows how absolutely irrelevant it is. But the real issue, as all Australians know, is the health issue and what happened last week that Senator Herron and Senator Kemp have spoken about. It is with some regret that the state premiers left the meeting on health because, as all Australians should know, the Commonwealth was giving a 15 per cent increase—in real terms over a five year period—in health funding.
Furthermore, as the minister, Dr Wooldridge, has been saying, this government has negotiated an agreement that provides reimbursement of some $83 million a year to the states for any one per cent of further reduction in the number of people covered by private health insurance. Now these are the real issues which show what this government is doing to make sure that the health of all Australians is assured. The Labor Party do not want to talk about this health issue because their priority is to abolish—and take away from Australian families—the $450 a year subsidy that the Howard government introduced in the last year.
This is the only policy that the Labor Party have enunciated. You ask the Labor Party what their policies are on anything else, and you get former senator Gareth Evans talking about negative gearing. That was countermanded within six hours by his leader. So there is a policy vacuum over there in the Labor Party. Tell us what your policy is on health. As Senator Kemp has mentioned, it seems that your policy is to spend an extra $6.2 billion, with no indication of where that money is coming from. It is pretty obvious. And Senator Carr, we know that it is part of your socialist left philosophy to increase taxes all the time to pay for this additional $6 billion that your spokesman wants to spend. That is the difference—we have policies, you have none.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-03-24,"—Isn't it interesting that no Liberal opposite is willing to get up and defend Senator Parer on the specifics. We have got a daily event here called the Parer sprint. As soon as a question on Senator Parer is noted, we have a great sprint outside the chamber— 
 led by Senator Parer—every day. And the best they can do is send in the Claude Erskine-Brown of the Liberal Party—Senator Ian Macdonald—to run off a few distracting lines.
As an Australian who wants his country to do well—who never actually wants his country to be run by a second-rate Prime Minister—I feel just a little humiliated by his behaviour in the last two or three weeks. It has been demeaning to watch a Prime Minister changing, day by day, the definition of his own principles. I read in the newspaper the other day that Groucho Marx remarked, when someone rejected the principles he was putting forward: `Well, I've got another bunch of principles in here. How would you like to buy them?' That is the approach we have had.
We have had an approach whereby Senator Short and Senator Gibson were dismissed from office—by way of their own resignations—because they were involved in a perceived conflict of interest. That was a definition that the Prime Minister and Senator Hill himself constantly used in this chamber between 10 October 1996 and 15 October 1996—that Senator Short and Senator Gibson had to relinquish their offices because they were involved in a perceived conflict of interest. Then the definition drifts off, over time, to an apparent conflict of interest. But by the time we get to March 1998, it is an actual conflict of interest. And then there is a sub-interpretation put on it. It has to actually involve enrichment of the minister. So this definition of conflict of interest has changed constantly.
When the minister gets sprung, the minister panics. The minister decides to cut his losses—or his profits, in this case—cut those and move it all away from himself. He then goes into flagrant breach of another Prime Ministerial directive that says you cannot transfer those sort of assets to your family—it does not say dependent children here; it says family—or a nominee, implying that it goes well beyond family. So having done that, what does the Prime Minister's office do, but say: `Oh, sorry fellas, what we mean there is dependent children,' when it is quite clear from the Derryn Hinch interview that they did not mean dependent children then.
We have a Prime Minister constantly changing his definition to fit the behaviour of his ministers. If Senator Parer does not come out of this very well, at least he comes out of it a lot better than the Prime Minister of Australia. After all, these principles were tabled first of all in this parliament as something very new: as a fresh approach. A puffed-up Prime Minister comes in and says, `I am going to set higher standards than the previous government.' When you go to the estimates committee and find out where all these principles came from, we find out it comes from the previous government's cabinet handbook; so there was nothing new here, this was just a cheap stunt by a Prime Minister trying to grab the high moral ground. Well, give him a tick, he got the brownie points for it.
But what happens the moment ministers start to transgress? He does not dismiss them: Short and Prosser resign. This is not a sacking Prime Minister, as he likes to make out. The only person this Prime Minister sacks are his own resigned staff members, so they can get a higher payout than would have been the case if he had accepted their resignations. 	 We have a weak Prime Minister totally unable to enforce his own standards. All we get from him is, `This is the politics of envy.' This is the line we get from those opposite. We got it again today about trade union officials. Look who we have got sitting opposite: a lawyer in the number one position and a lawyer in the number two position; Senator Newman—a lawyer; Senator Vanstone—a lawyer—four in a row, when they are talking about representing the widespread community. Senator Ellison makes five out of eight. All you have got is a surgeon as the odd man out.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1998-03-24,"—Madam Deputy President, Senator Ray spoke of his embarrassment, but he should have looked at his own backbenchers when he addressed the chamber. There is one particular senator. It has all the look of the day after the attack on the Baillieus and the Natural Heritage Trust. They deserted the frontbench attack then and they have done the same now. This has all the look. The whole of question 
 time has completely conked out. I am happy to jump up and join my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald. He made the absolutely correct point that this is not the issue of the day; this is not the issue that is biting out in society. The real issue is related to policy. The sale of Telstra has been the No. 1 head issue.
It was only yesterday that Senator Abetz made this point and made it very well. An article in the Financial Review reported that of the 583 questions asked last year, in 1997, in this chamber, only 79 dealt with the economy. Of those 79, Senator Faulkner asked three—three questions on the economy. Yet he stands up in this chamber, gives himself a glowing character reference and glosses up his character as a man who would never slur anyone outside this chamber. But who hissed, Senator Ray? Who hissed? That is the question that has to be asked. The next thing we know, Senator Faulkner will be getting a call from the Women's Weekly. That is how much he glossed up his—
Senator Robert Ray interjecting—
—I knew that would get you back. That is how much Senator Faulkner has glossed up his own character. The point is, this has reached the end. It has now become a complete irrelevancy.
—You are a lying mongrel if that is what you are alleging.
—Order! Senator Ray—
—Point of order, Madam Deputy President—
—I am about to ask Senator Ray to withdraw the unparliamentary language.
—With respect, you should stand.
—I am about to ask him to withdraw. I am also about to ask Senator McGauran not to reflect upon members of either house.
—I withdraw. I point out that Senator Parer, I thought, accepted that those events did not occur.
—You only had to withdraw; you were not given leave to make a statement.
—That is right. Do you want to get up and have a say for once?  Just pay your speeding tickets and get on with it.
—Order! Senator Ray!
—The point is that, on any analysis of question time today, this has reached an irrelevancy because Senator Parer has made his disclosures to the Prime Minister and to cabinet. He has made his disclosures to the Senate. He has even taken it a step further and completely disinvested himself. So we have come to the end of the road of the Parer attack, just as we did with the Natural Heritage Trust.
But who is leading these two attacks? Of course, it is Senator Faulkner—the same man who glossed up his character today but who, in fact, owes this chamber an apology and owes the Baillieu family an apology for his attack on the Baillieu family. He said, backed up by Senator Ray, regarding the Woodhouse Pastoral Co. listed at 360 Collins Street, that Maurice Howard Lawrence Baillieu and Richard Percy Clive Baillieu benefited from the government's Natural Heritage Trust—benefited in some way directly by the government's handout.
The fact is, both these men have been dead—one for 37 years, and I believe the other one for around 50 years. That scandalous attack warrants an apology in this chamber, if we are at all to believe that Senator Faulkner has a character that would never slur anyone inside or outside this chamber—particularly outside this chamber.
Also, Senator Faulkner, who glossed up his character today, the man who said that he would never slur anyone inside or outside this chamber, the man that has the thick skin, is the same man who has been defending Senator Bolkus who was censured by the Senate—the first time an opposition frontbencher has been censured for some 30 years—with the support of the Democrats, with the support of the Greens and with the support of Senator 
 Harradine. The whole chamber, other than the Labor opposition, supported this censure against Senator Bolkus. Why? Because he was caught on film releasing quite sensitive court documents which has prejudiced the government's case and chase against Skase. If that does not warrant a sacking from the frontbench, then obviously no-one on that frontbench will go for any reason at all.
Just to reiterate, the point of the matter is that this has run its course. It has all the look of the Natural Heritage Trust, where apologies will have to be made at the end of the day.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1998-03-24,"—This is a case in which there is a clear breach of public duty by a minister, and where his public duty has been confused with his private gain. There is no question about that. The Prime Minister set down the test. It is in his guidelines. He called them at the time, I might say, his `code'; he now calls them his `guidelines'. There is a reason for that, and I will come to it in a minute.
Today in question time I asked Senator Parer about three decisions he made as a minister which affected the benefit of the coal industry. This is a minister who, when he made those decisions, had private investments in the coal industry. His defence was that they were generic, they affected the whole of the industry. Ergo, they affected his company too. If this is a question of justice being done and justice being seen to be done, the right thing being done or the right thing being seen to be done, his decisions—the three of them—affected his private fortune. There is no way in which that is not true.
—That is what you are sore about; it is the politics of envy.
—You can shout and rant. It stands there like a pikestaff before your eyes as a fact. It is a fact that that means he is in direct, flagrant contravention of the Prime Minister's own guidelines. What is the response of the Prime Minister in these circumstances? To reinterpret the guidelines. Remember when the Prime Minister told us these were codes? Now we have caught a minister, they are guidelines. They are not 
 codes—you do not have to abide by them. Now they are just guides to action.
I want to know from this minister why he will not answer my question. Three separate times he made decisions which affected his private fortune as a minister for this industry. Why won't he answer? In the second part of my question, I asked him, `Do you deny that Jellinbah coalmine, in which you and your family have a lucrative interest, has derived any benefit from the program at all?' Cast your mind back. When this government came to office—and we had some questions about this today, laughable though they were—it embarked in its 1996-97 budget on the biggest cost-cutting spree ever. It cut every program across the board. It kept this program—the coal export facilitation program, the CEF program—that benefited this minister.
I asked this minister if his company benefited from that program. Did he answer the question? No, he did not. If the program does not work to benefit coalmining companies, why keep the program?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That is exactly right. Why keep it when you are cutting everything else? Why, when you have got a scorched earth policy about budget cuts, do you keep this particular program if it does not benefit that particular company? That is what this minister now has to answer.
He has argued up until now there has been no conflict. `You have not caught me,' is his argument. This is the thief's argument. `I may have robbed the building, I may have the jewels in my bag, I may have got them to the fence; but I am innocent because you haven't caught me and you haven't proved that I did it.' That is the argument being put here—the thief's argument. There is now a clear case of there being three occasions on which he has made decisions on which his—
—Madam Deputy President—
—Of course you want to shut me up.
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I just want to clarify 
 whether Senator Cook is inferring that Senator Parer is a thief, because if he is he should withdraw it.
Senator Alston interjecting—
—Order, Senator Alston! Senator Cook, you may wish to clarify to whom you were referring and, if you were referring to the minister as such, then it is out of order. If you were not, if you were making a generic comment, it is not out of order.
—I said that he employed the thief's defence: `I stole. I've got the goods. I sold them. But you haven't caught me and, until you catch me, I am not guilty.' That is what I said and I am happy to repeat it.
There is a question here, front and centre, for this government. We now know that the Prime Minister has double standards. He defines promises and core promises. If you do not understand the difference between a promise and a core promise, bad luck—you lose. We now know that he has a code and a guideline. If you do not understand that guidelines are not meant to be kept, then you lose. We now understand that, if you have investments in your own industry, that is not an offence. Even if it is seen to conflict, the fact that you then have to prove that it does means it is not an offence. We now know that, if your family benefits, as long as they are adults and not children, that is not an offence either, although it is very directly front and centre in conflict with the Prime Minister's own guidelines.
We have here a Prime Minister who redefines the issue as he goes along to protect his ministers. This is a weak Prime Minister. This is someone without the guts to defend the position he puts publicly. This is a Prime Minister with no leadership power or strength. If he had any, he would enforce his own standards.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1998-03-24,"—I was interested to listen to Senator Cook's explanation of the point of order that Senator Calvert took on what Senator Cook, I am sure, said about Senator Parer. We will check Hansard  very carefully tomorrow to see just what Senator Cook did call Senator Parer. I think the Senate needs to be reminded that, on 7 April 1989, Senator Cook, the then Minister for Resources, was actually censured by this Senate for improper alteration of the Hansard  record of an answer that he gave in response to a question without notice. We know Senator Cook's track record, so it will be interesting to see the Hansard  tomorrow.
What is even more interesting is that, throughout this debate that we now have had raging over a number of days, the opposition cannot bear to look at their own record. They have pursued one minister in the Liberal government, the coalition government, after the other. But, when we look at what their track record is, I do not recall Senator Cook, Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray or anyone else on that side talking about Alan Griffiths owning a sandwich shop while he was Minister for Industry. I do not recall them complaining about Graham Richardson being a director of 2HD while he was Minister for Communications and not declaring his interests. I do not recall them complaining about Senator Richardson using his position as a minister to try to influence the President of the Marshall Islands on behalf of his cousin, Greg Symons—there was not a whimper.
I do not recall the opposition complaining about John Dawkins's mother owning Bell shares while Holmes a Court was trying to take over BHP. I do not recall them complaining about Bob Hawke being a personal friend of Sir Peter Abeles when Abeles was trying to crush the pilots union in 1989. I do not recall them complaining about Bob Hawke using his position as PM to collect $1 million from four Western Australian business leaders, otherwise known as the `gold tax' lunch, as Senator Cook would well remember.
They did not complain either about Gareth Evans. While foreign minister he wrote the blue book on diplomacy—that would be a 
 first, wouldn't it?—using ANU academics without acknowledging their contributions. That is otherwise known as plagiarism, of course. Paul Keating and Gareth Evans used their positions to attack Justice Marks in the royal commission on the Easton affair. The list goes on. I would need half an hour to go through this—I have got pages and pages of it. But not a whimper came out of the Labor opposition, the then government, saying, `You've got to go. You've disgraced the government. You've got to go.'
Yet opposition senators come in day after day attacking Senator Parer, who has not made one, single, solitary decision in conflict with his interests. These weak-kneed little people over the other side keep trying to bring successful people down. Why don't they concentrate on the main issues? Senator McGauran mentioned earlier, for example, that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, had asked three questions without notice on unemployment in 12 months. This amounted to three questions in 85 sitting days—and there would have been more sitting days than that now—but no questions on jobs since August 1997. Senator Cook, who is in the chamber at the moment and who supposedly represents the shadow Treasurer in the Senate and is the shadow minister for trade, has asked only two questions. Why don't they concentrate on the main issues?
At the end of 1997, the Labor Party had asked a mere 21 questions without notice on unemployment out of a total of 583 questions. That represents four per cent of the total questions asked, but certainly no direct questions on unemployment have been asked in 1998. It is just absolutely absurd. They do not want to focus on the main issue. At the end of last year, Labor had asked a lowly 79 questions out of 583 on the economy. Why? Because they do not like the message on the economy. They do not like all the good economic indicators. They want to muckrake. They want to go through the whole scaremongering exercise. They have just concentrated on diversions, muckraking and smears in the whole of 1997 and nothing at all has changed in 1998. They are not inter 
 ested in the real issues. They have not released one single, solitary policy in over two years in opposition. Where are the policies? Where is your health policy? Where is your tax policy? Where is your trade policy? Not one has been released.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-24,"—Let me commence debate on the issue before the Senate by actually taking a look at what the Prime Minister's own much vaunted, but now much discredited, code of ministerial conduct says. Of course this was a code that was launched with enormous fanfare back in April 1996. What does this actually say about conflict of interest? Section 5 of the code on ministerial conduct says:
It is vital that ministers and parliamentary secretaries do not by their conduct undermine public confidence in them or the government.
It says:
Although their public lives encroach upon their private lives, it is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes.
The nature of their duties is such that they may need to have regard to the interests of members of their immediate families (to the extent that ministers know their interests) as well as their own when ensuring that no conflict or apparent conflict between interests and duties arises.
It says:
Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if . . . retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty . . .
It says:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
That is what the code says. What does John Howard say on the public record about conflict of interest and the need for his ministers 
 to avoid conflict of interest? The Prime Minister gave a press conference on 16 October 1996 and canvassed this issue. He said:
We don't want a situation where there is the appearance of the potential for unacceptable conflict of interest, we don't want that.
He went on to say—and this was in relation to Senator Short:
I think in the case of Senator Short there was a clear failure to properly read a very clear guideline. I don't think there's any argument that somebody who is the Assistant Treasurer should have disposed of shares in the ANZ Bank . . . I've had a lot of talks with a lot of my colleagues in recent days, and I have very forcibly reminded them of their obligations. I have had in the past few days the head of my department go through all of the declarations and he's tendered me some comments and some advice in relation to those. But the reality is that when somebody is appointed a Minister, that person carries with them a responsibility to get their affairs in order, and this idea that the Minister can sort of hide behind the fact that interests have been declared to the Prime Minister and then say, well, you know, it's no longer my responsibility . . . I mean, Ministers have great privileges in our system.
That is what the Prime Minister himself said about conflict of interest.
The generally understood definition of conflict of interest in public life is when there can be a perceived or actual personal gain from a person's public activity, where one's personal benefit coexists with one's public duty. Any minister, for that matter any public servant, has to ask themselves: could my personal interests influence my public decisions? They have to ask themselves: could something that I tick off or approve have the potential or be seen to have the potential to benefit me perhaps to the disadvantage of someone else? If the answer is yes, that person should either divest themselves of their interest or get another job. The problem here is that Senator Parer cannot discern where the boundary lies between private interests and public duties. For Liberal businessmen like Senator Parer, Mr Prosser, and Mr Moore, it is Mr Howard's ground rules, his now discredited code of ministerial conduct, that conflict with their interests.
Mr Howard's definition of a conflict of interest now comes down to whether Senator Parer made a direct actual decision that advanced QCMM and the Jellinbah coalmine. That is what it comes down to now under Mr Howard's definition. According to Mr Howard's new definition, there is no conflict of interest, for example, in Senator Parer ticking off on $2,250,000 for the coal export facilitation program, advancing an industry in which the Parer family is a $2 million stakeholder. There is no conflict of interest under Mr Howard's new definition in his scrapping research funds for alternative energy sources. Those sorts of decisions now do not come within Mr Howard's new definition of conflict of interest. One of these decisions was money for jam. The other, we say, was the hobbling of a competitor because you are Old King Cole. That is what Senator Parer is—Old King Cole. He thinks it is a waste of time and money to be worrying about funds for alternative energy sources.
Apparently, neither Mr Howard nor Senator Parer think that there is a conflict of interest in Senator Parer discussing with his joint venture partner, the Marubeni Corporation, the construction of coal coking furnaces. They use the product from Marubeni and Senator Parer's own coking coal mine. Apparently, Mr Howard and Senator Parer see no conflict of interest in Senator Parer discussing with his joint venture partner Nissho Iwai his keenness to see increased exports to Australia. This is something that the executives of Nissho Iwai would regard as an intersection of interests. They probably could not believe their luck when their own business partner fronted up to a meeting and declared himself as a business partner and, lo and behold, he was Australia's Minister for Resources and Energy.
The only conflict of interest that they see is that the Prime Minister's code of conduct conflicts with Senator Parer's desire to camouflage a vast investment portfolio. Mr Howard sees no conflict of interest in giving Senator Parer the all clear, nor does his henchman, the guardian of ministerial probity and ministerial interests, Mr Max Moore Wilton, the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
You cannot say that Senator Parer and his wife meet the usual definition that John Howard uses of mum and dad  investors. Over the past few years they have had millions of dollars worth of shares in the mining industry. Mr Howard has also redefined the concept of family. As soon as you are not a little kid you are instantly some sort of distant relation and you can look after the portfolio investment that your parents have built up while mum and dad are temporarily inconvenienced. This is a very new concept. This is a generational Chinese wall that we have seen erected. Mr Howard's code states:
The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
This means the transfer of interests to a spouse, a son, a daughter or Great Aunt Geraldine is entirely unacceptable. That is what the code says. There is no mention of any age limit here—none whatsoever. This is a new and ludicrous concept.
As mentioned in question time today, the Prime Minister said on the Hinch program that such a practice is not on, but he has completely renovated his own code of conduct and he has done it to the detriment of the parliament and the interests of the people of this country. He has now devised his own loopholes. He has given the tick to family trusts, once removed as unacceptable investment engines, for his millionaire colleagues. He has redefined the family to exclude independent children. Try that redefinition in a court of law and see how you go with that.
The government says that the Labor Party is muckraking. I have to say that the opposition is deadly serious about the issue of conflict of interest. In our view, it sits at the heart of decent, transparent public decision making by government. It underpins the system of cabinet decision making.
Australian governments have, up until now, largely been able to avoid ministerial conflicts of interest with private business activities. In recent years other governments, such as the Japanese government and the unlamented conservative government in Britain, have allowed standards to slide and corruption to fester. A number of their ministers have been 
 infected by crony capitalism, insider trading and other conflict of interest type issues. In recent years, we have seen the quality and reputation of the public policy process in those countries decline.
John Howard's guidelines, as he has acknowledged for some time, are a consolidation of the principles and guidelines that have been in operation for many years. They closely reflect the guidance that is given to ministers in the cabinet handbook. We say that the Prime Minister's guidelines ought to be taken seriously. It is not a matter of muckraking. It is not matter of partisan politics.
There are good reasons for the guidelines. There are very good reasons for guidelines on divestment. There is a clear reason for the transparent declaration of interests that everyone—except Senator Parer—in this chamber has to comply with. In ignoring the rule that ministers should divest any shares that may affect their judgment in their portfolio area or that give rise to perceptions of conflict of interest and in allowing ministers to divest their interests to close family members, we say the Prime Minister has presided over a very significant weakening of the standards that have applied to ministers in this country.
We say that if millionaire businessmen want to make millions out of private shareholdings, that is fine. That is okay. But if they want to contribute to Australian public life as a government minister then they should sell their shares; they should divest themselves of their shares in the portfolio area that they are responsible for administering. They should not do both. John Howard once shared that view and it is the view, of course, that permeates the discredited code that the Prime Minister brought down when he rode into government on a white charger saying he would do something about ministerial and parliamentary standards; a view he espoused in his press conference of 16 October 1996. It is a view he has now discarded.
I know Senator Alston will follow and say that we are muckraking. But one thing you do know, when Senator Alston gets into the debate it is time to warm up the engine in the old limo to Government House, because you are the last card in the pack, Senator Alston, 
 if you are the best that the government can do to defend the indefensible. The truth of the matter is, there is no defence and Senator Parer should resign.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-03-24,"—There is a massive irony in this debate on the motion on political standards being led by someone who has had the sheer gracelessness to have refused to apologise for the inexcusable and indefensible slander on the Baillieu family. It is also quite ironic that Senator Ray should have been the one asking about DAS, when, of course, he was up to his eyeballs in ensuring that DAS entered into long-term leasing arrangements with the ALP in order to transfer very significant sums of money—millions of dollars—from the public purse to the ALP.
We have seen this in spades over the years with the way in which the union movement has had moneys laundered through it so it can give it back to the ALP at election time. So it is not surprising that they do not have any compunction about forgetting their own history and wallowing in this sort of muck, as they have been doing for the last week or so.
It is very important that we actually look at what is being said by Senator Faulkner at the outset. He said that ministers should not, by their conduct, undermine confidence in the administration of government, and I do not think anyone has demonstrated that Senator Parer has done that. He said that they should not use public office for private purposes. Again, I do not think there is any evidence that Senator Parer has done that. He said they may need to have regard to their family's interests. I cannot see anything controversial about that proposition. He said they should resign. I think he was talking about a divestment of private interests.
What they fail to ever address is the distinction between simply selling shares in a publicly listed company and effectively unloading a holding which is non-transferable, in the normal course of the term, particularly in the case of the corporate structure with which Senator Parer is involved. Given that there are pre-emptive clause arrangements, quite clearly any new purchaser could be deprived of 
 dividends, could therefore miss out completely and as a result the shares may well be worthless.
But, of course, we do not hear any suggestion on their part about how else these shares might be divested, or what other arrangements might be entered into, because there aren't any other arrangements. What Senator Parer has done recently, out of an abundance of caution and to try to somehow turn off this tap of invective and vituperation, is to take the advice of expert lawyers and accountants and provide for another trust structure.
What else, I ask, could he be expected to do? Give the shares away to the cleaners? Somehow ignore the fact that the beneficiaries of those shares have been members of his family to date? There is a significant difference between putting shares in the hands of dependent children over whom you effectively retain control, and putting them in the hands of adult children who are perfectly entitled to go their own ways. There is nothing to ensure that these children may feel in any way gratefully disposed towards the disposer of the interests. It comes back to the proposition that there is no other way of restructuring the affairs than has been undertaken by Senator Parer in recent days.
Fundamentally, this is all about an alleged conflict of interest. Senator Faulkner seemed to think that a conflict of interest was actual or perceived personal gain. Again, I do not think anyone suggested that Senator Parer has received any actual or perceived personal gain. Virtually all of what has been said is that the coal industry might be a little better off. Any decision taken by a Treasurer which affects interest rates presumably helps his own mortgage, helps the mortgage of everyone else in politics, and indeed, the country. Does that mean he has a personal interest in it? Of course it does not. Does it mean that someone who is a lawyer cannot be the Attorney-General because somehow he might be seen to be taking actions which will benefit his own profession, or that a doctor cannot be the minister for health? Of course it does not.
That is why there is a fundamental distinction between a generic benefit to an industry that might derive from a government decision 
 and a personal benefit. Unfortunately, Senator Short's decision in relation to the ANZ affected a company in which he held shares—a very direct personal link. That is a very different situation to the one here. There was nothing deliberate on the part of Senator Short—nothing deliberate at all. Not only that, he effectively accepted that he should resign in the circumstances.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-24,"—When the Prime Minister's guidelines were introduced in 1996 they were greeted with acclaim. They seemed to be born out of good intentions, out of the experience of parliamentarians, and to meet a very much expressed public need. But there were deficiencies in the Prime Minister's guidelines, his code of conduct, then, for ministers and parliamentary secretaries. The virtues were that those guidelines were public and were transparent; but they were devised, administered, policed and informed by the Prime Minister, a man who, in the cabinet, is both boss and colleague and therefore is not sufficiently at arm's length from the matters at hand. There were no independent review procedures, no audit procedures, no management procedures, and consequently the Prime Minister was visited with the troubles of numerous ministers and parliamentary secretaries resigning.
The code, the guidelines and their management were then tightened up. While internal review and audit was undoubtedly improved, it was still not independent and still not at arm's  length. We still have a situation where the rules are now even less respected than ever before and are differently interpreted to the expectation of the public, the media and the non-government parties.
It took Senator Minchin to sort out the travel entitlements mess inherited from his Labor and coalition predecessors. Someone like him or a parliamentary body needs to sort out the mess the Prime Minister has got himself into with his confusing and variable interpretation of his guidelines. These new standards so bravely introduced, so badly implemented, so badly audited, so badly managed and so badly applied have caused him to lose ministers and parliamentary 
 secretaries. They have caused him to lose the nickname `Honest John'. They have made a credible promise of new standards seem untruthful and dishonest and they have further reinforced the very low opinion that so many politicians are held in.
The Democrats believe it is in the interests of both houses and the cabinet to sort this out, to stop kicking each other to death and to search for a solution. The Australian Democrats wish to propose such a solution. Our solution is that the government recognise the mess they are in, recognise the problems that exist and recognise that the public are sick and tired of standards and rules that they cannot believe in and of politicians' standards and the manner in which they apply them.
We ask that the government appoint a joint house committee with all parties represented to review cabinet and parliamentary guidelines and codes of conduct, and to make recommendations within the short term. Those recommendations should be introduced within the short term. We believe that this review should be required to consider the appointment of an independent commissioner for parliamentary ethics and standards.
The very problem we experience is because the Prime Minister is too close to his cabinet and colleagues. Even when he acts in what he regards as the right way, he will still be regarded as somebody who is too close. You have to have an independent person to do this job. We suggest that the committee should examine the appointment of an independent commissioner for parliamentary ethics and standards. I am given to understand that such a person exists in Canada and possibly in other countries.
We would ask that such a committee review schemes for the administration, management, review and enforcement of those standards. We would ask that such a committee examine the appointment of a standing joint house ethics committee which would have both parliamentary and non-parliamentary members and would be given some teeth by the parliament. A former Democrat senator—now known as the lady in red—in 1995 proposed a joint house ethics committee and a parliamentary commissioner for standards, so I am 
 sure the ALP will now take up the long-promoted Democrat solution which they wrongly rejected in 1995.
It is time we started talking about solutions and not about the problem that is before us. When all this head kicking is exhausted we do need some long-term solutions. For ethics to become embedded in politics we all have to become activists on parliamentary standards. Conflicts of interest, allegation and counter allegation, smear and counter smear, and untrue imputations on motives or character all come from the same unethical approach to political life. The institutions and bodies that we have to manage these affairs just are not doing their job.
I think the Prime Minister is now in an impossible situation. Even if he continues to defend his ministers and his guidelines and regards them as acceptable, I am afraid the public perception is that they are somewhat tattered and shoddy. We really do need to turn things around and start to focus on more important issues whilst maintaining what the entire public demands—that is, a parliament where the ethics and the standards are those that we can be proud of and where the game is played to rules that we all understand and whose interpretation we can be sure of.
Whilst I have the floor I do want to remark about some irony. The Labor Party have spent the last week and a half of parliamentary time trying to establish the conflict of interest case for Minister Parer—and we agree there is a conflict of interest case—but they today voted with the government on export controls. The Labor Party led the debate twice to disallow the regulation to abolish export controls on the mining industry. They said that the controls needed to be there and they fought against Minister Parer's move to get rid of them. The ALP were the ones to reveal that Senator Parer had coal interests and they have spent the last week and a half and the previous week of parliamentary time building up their case on the conflict of interest. Indeed, today in question time Senator Faulkner asked Senator Parer why he had not declared his conflict of interest on the two votes on the export controls regulation, which Labor had moved to disallow.
One would think that Labor would have voted for our amendment to have the government re-examine those export controls specifically on the grounds of conflict of interest. Yet they did not. They sat with the government just as if the claims against Senator Parer had not occurred. This illustrates a problem. The perception is that this is a political activity; it is not really about a conflict of interest. When the conflict of interest is proven, then surely you should vote to show that.
The minister had a conflict of interest, we think, over the decision on export controls. And all the talk from Labor on transparency, probity and above-board codes of conduct fall in a heap if they are afraid to take their view of a conflict of interest to reviewing decisions by the minister in a number of fundamental areas—and that includes the area of export controls.
As you know, we are regarded in the community as a party that focuses on accountability. On this issue, our plea to the major parties is, `You know that accountability affects your reputation and affects our standing as a community of politicians in the community at large. We would urge you very strongly to take the negatives of what has been going on in this debate about Minister Parer and to transform them into positives which result in solutions which will prevent the sort of thing we have seen with ministers over the last two years happening again.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-03-24,"—I found Senator Murray's contribution interesting, but it is very difficult to take him seriously. He can be as sanctimonious as he likes but, when his former leader sat in this chamber for, it would seem, two years knowing in her heart of hearts that she was going to leave their party and go to the Labor Party, it really makes it a bit of a joke that he can come in here and be so sanctimonious in saying that his party focuses on accountability.
If the party on the other side ever gets back into government—and I hope they never will, or not for a very long time—Senator Murray's former leader, the lady in red, will join in leading the Australian public down the road 
 to being in the red. And that colour that she will be wearing on the front of the Women's Weekly will be absolutely and totally appropriate for one of the leading lights in the Labor Party, because red is the colour that symbolises the way they left the budget—in the red. For Senator Murray to pontificate about what should be done, when he really needs to think about the leadership of his party over the previous two years and whether you can focus on accountability when you had a leader who was sitting there knowing that she was going to change sides, really is a bit much.
I return to the issue at hand, which is the muckraking that has been going on in this chamber. It did not just start with Senator Parer.
—It started with Senator Baume, years ago.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, we sat here in absolute silence while there were speakers on the other side. Now, Senator Schacht comes in and wants to interject. He will have a chance, I presume, later on. I do not know whether he is on the speaking list. I presume he is down. No, he is not; he did not even get himself on the speakers list. We sat in absolute silence, and I would suggest that he keeps his silence until I have finished my speech. If he wants to argue with Senator Cook and take his spot, that is fine. In the Natural Heritage Trust exercise we saw—
—A rorted allocation of funds.
—We saw the Labor Party besmirching the name of a family in Melbourne. Two of those people have actually been dead—one of them for something like 30 years and one for 50 years—but they were accused of having some sort of financial gain. That is how little the Labor Party did their research. That is how inaccurate they were. They did not bother to apologise to that family.
Then one of the people on our side happened to have a small portion of his property in the catchment area of a natural heritage fund grant. He was in the top part of the 
 catchment area where he would get no benefit; in fact, he had spent his own money improving the land, which would improve the catchment area further on down the track. No, we besmirched him as well and we did not apologise. I notice he is sitting in the chamber. We besmirched him and his motives, and those of his family. But we never get up and apologise. We just besmirch him.
They also besmirched Senator Panizza before he died. They never got the opportunity to say, `I am sorry'. I hope that one day somebody will apologise to his family. They never said `Sorry' to him. He was mortified and hurt by that, and nobody on the other side ever apologised.
—What did Michael Baume do, Senator? He is a grub. In the Senate for 13 years, he was, and you made him Consul-General in New York.
—Then they came into the chamber the other day and claimed that Senator Parer, when he was in Japan, was advancing the interests of a coalmining company in which his family trust held shares—
—What did Senator Baume do?
—Order, Senator Schacht.
—Senator Schacht has verbal diarrhoea. I wish he would go and have some treatment for it. Regarding the claim that Senator Parer was advancing his own interests in Japan, Mr Howard, in answering a question in the chamber on 23 March, said:
The reality, as disclosed by the record of conversation taken by an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade during that discussion, demonstrates no such thing.
He said that Senator Parer had yesterday tabled `a minute from the relevant person from within Senator Parer's department attesting to the fact that at no stage was any decision taken by him that could represent a conflict of interest.' But no, they came in here and made some comment that when Senator Parer was in Japan he was advancing his own 
 personal wealth, his own personal benefits. There is someone from the department saying that is not the case. Do we hear them come in here and apologise? No. Leave that out in the ether.
It is another bit of muckraking, another perception that something has been done incorrectly, and they do not have the good grace to come in here to apologise. We have seen the Baillieus besmirched. We have seen Senator Crane besmirched. We have seen Senator Panizza besmirched before he died. And now we see the same thing happening with Senator Parer. They just have a tradition of this sort of hatred, of this sort of muckraking, of this sort of failing to get the facts right, and of never coming in and apologising when it has been shown that they are wrong.
Senator Ray had the good grace to say on 11 March in this chamber:
I would never think for a moment that Senator Parer would consciously and directly take a decision affecting the coal industry to directly benefit himself.
And there has been not one skerrick of evidence to demonstrate that he had. Mr Acting Deputy President, if you were the minister for science and technology—
—My God, heaven forbid!
—We will just pretend for a moment, Mr Acting Deputy President. If you were the minister, and if you were to give a grant to a research organisation for improving the quality of wheat and you happened to be a wheat farmer, do you think somebody could say that that was a conflict of interest? No. Senator Parer has said over and over again that decisions he has made have been generic decisions about the coal industry, not specific instances which would give him direct personal gain. Can the Treasurer not make a decision that would change interest rates? In fact, we have made such decisions, which has sent them down. Is he not to be Treasurer because he has a mortgage? Does he sell his house and rent a house? And then there will be some decision about renting.
What we have is the Labor Party consistently besmirching people, including Senator Parer, to hide the fact that their situation is 
 really one of sitting down, mixing up and baking a giant policy meringue—all sugar on the outside and no substance. Once you put a bit of heat on it, it disappears—no policy; actually, a policy wasteland. No; I should not mislead the Senate. We did have a policy about negative gearing announced last week.
—How long did it last?
—Mr Gareth Evans came out with a skerrick of policy in the middle of all this besmirching. He said that they were going to abolish negative gearing. How long did that policy last? Like a meringue, it disappeared overnight. Twenty-four hours and it was gone—no policy.
We heard Senator Kemp today indicate that the Labor Party has promised $6 billion in spending on health. With all due respect to Senator Kemp, he forgot to mention the money that the shadow minister for aged care is going to be spending, too. I suppose he will add that in another answer—add on to the $6 billion the money that is going to be dished out in aged care, because they are going to find the money from somewhere to patch up the $500 million that is needed to bring nursing homes up to the standard that they were told years ago ought to be done, and they neglected that advice; they would not bite the bullet.
Week after week in this place this year we have seen this Labor Party going on about issues, trying to find a quarter of a catchment area—what was it?
—One per cent.
—One per cent of the catchment area, right up at the top part of it, which was Senator Crane's, and they made it a whole issue that he had had some sort of gain out of it. Instead of focusing on the issues that really matter for Australians, such as health, jobs, foreign debt—and on all the other issues that they neglected for years—they have done nothing. When you look at their record and see what sorts of questions they have asked—and the reason they are doing this is that they have no policies, absolutely none—you see, as we saw in the paper just recently, that Senator Faulkner, who put forward this matter of public import 
 ance, has asked three questions on unemployment in 86 sitting days. That is three questions in a year. The Financial Review  on 9 March said that Mr Beazley had asked only one question this year on jobs.
When it comes down to the really important issues facing Australians, where are the Labor Party to be seen? Nowhere. They do not ask questions on important issues. They have no policies. All they are prepared to do is run around digging up things they think are going to destroy a minister or bring somebody down, besmirching a person who has actually presided over growth in the resources industries, a minister who knows the portfolio back to front. They could not damage him by asking him questions because he knew too much. Whenever they ask him questions from the other side of the House, Senator Parer gets up and answers those questions; he knows his portfolio backwards. You cannot damage him that way, so what do you do? You attack him personally. That is the style of the Labor Party. Attack the person, not the issues. They have done it time and again. They have besmirched people and ruined their reputations with little or no evidence.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,12,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-24,"—Of course, this is the government that came to office sprouting statements of how good it was going to be in terms of ministerial accountability. This is the government that produced the guidelines for the code of ministerial conduct. May I remind the government that it was Senator Hill who came into this chamber on 14 October 1996 and said:
It is true that the guidelines set a very high standard and we do not apologise for that. We believe that the Australian people are entitled to that. The Prime Minister has said that ministers are expected to keep those guidelines. As a result of the breach that just occurred of those guidelines, even though there is no suggestion there was any intention of personal benefit that would flow from that breach, a minister has paid a very high price . . . 
Today we had a number of attempts to divert us from the real issue in this debate. One of them was Senator Alston's throwaway line about Senator Robert Ray, when he alleged that Senator Ray was, I think he used the term, `Up to his eyeballs in the DAS decision 
 for long-term rent arrangements for Centenary House.' Of course, there was no basis at all for that allegation. If Senator Alston had it, we would have heard it in this chamber before. The fact is that at the time that Senator Robert Ray was the Minister for Defence, he had no involvement in the matter and, indeed, although he was involved in the administration of the ALP through the national executive, he deliberately excluded himself from any meetings which were discussing the administrative arrangements of the party relating to other relevant transactions that had any impact on the government, and the minutes would, indeed, show it.
If Senator Alston had any basis for making that statement he would have produced it. But it was just a throwaway line, just a distraction. This government has a code of conduct which it has trumpeted around the place. That code says:
Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.
It goes on:
The transfer of interests to a family member—
It does not say child. It does not say mother, father or anyone else. It says, `A family member.'
or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
In this case, I have to think that my state colleague Senator Gibson must feel quite aggrieved, as would former Senator Short. Their real breaches of the guidelines were in the form of holding shares in the areas of their portfolio responsibilities. What they did in relation to that subsequently was irrelevant. The holding of the shares breached the guidelines. These were the guidelines that this government trumpeted as being important for cleaning up the area of ministerial answerability and keeping transparent the fact that this government was going to be clean and honest in its dealings with the public.
I wanted to touch briefly, in the limited time I have today, on some material I obtained from the historic House Hansard. I want to quote a couple of passages, just to put 
 this present debate in context. The first quote goes as follows:
All the bobbing and weaving and squirming of the Prime Minister, his redefinition of rules that he laid down—
in 1996—
. . . his contradiction today of what he said yesterday, his colleague's contradiction yesterday of what he had said earlier in that same day, the fact that the Government has now adopted such an absurd position on this issue that it no longer has a tenable position on the disclosure of material interests—
I am sorry, I misread that. I should have said `1983' not `1996', because, you see, I am quoting from a speech by a Mr Howard, the member for Bennelong, on 11 April 1986 when he was attacking Prime Minister Hawke over the fact that Mr Dawkins's mother held shares in BHP, and Mr Dawkins was the Minister for Trade. Mr Howard moved this censure motion:
This House censures the Prime Minister for
1. His weak and abject failure to dismiss the Minister for Trade;
I might interpose there. It might just as well today say `the Minister for Resources and Energy'. It goes on:
2. Condoning the failure of the Minister for Trade—
same comment—
to make full and frank disclosure of matters which may have given rise to a conflict of interest;
3. Allowing the Minister for Trade to remain within the Ministry despite his proven record of poor judgment and a failure to understand the propriety demanded of a Minister;
4. Breaking his promise that Ministers in his Government would disclose any matters which may involve a conflict of interest;
5. His failure to maintain proper standards of ministerial conduct;
6. His blatant double standards relating to ministerial propriety;
7. His expedient and opportunistic interpretation of rules he himself has laid down for the conduct of Ministers—
If you have a look at that and the situation today—what an expose of this Prime Minister! This Prime Minister, in 1986, was criticising the Labor government because Minister Dawkins then was in the circumstances where his mother had shares in BHP; 
 and this was the motion that was being moved.
He said in his speech a number of other things which I would like to quote. It is important that they be on the record, because it displays the hypocrisy of the current situation. This is another quote:
I now go on to a comment by none other than the Prime Minister on 16 November 1977:
If a man . . . shouts from the roof tops that those in high office should be subject to scrutiny he should have exactly those same standards applied to himself.
He continued:
How relevant are those words. How prophetic of the Prime Minister to say in 1977 that if a person shouts from the rooftops about propriety in high places he should watch out that those words do not come back to bite him.
Well said, Mr Howard, in 1986. Look at what you are doing now, Mr Prime Minister, because they apply exactly to you. In 1986 he also said this:
There is only one thing involved and that is whether or not, in the circumstances applying to the Minister for Trade,—
I interpose there that we could equally say `the Minister for Resources and Energy'—
there was a potential for a conflict of interest to arise.
The Prime Minister cannot hide behind the narrow definition of the immediate family. He cannot hide behind that kind of legalistic approach.
I have to say that this seems to be the basis for the ministerial code of conduct that the Prime Minister introduced in 1996. Later in the speech he said:
Everybody knows that if a man who stands to gain as a beneficiary under an estate to the tune perhaps of a quarter of a million dollars goes out of this Parliament and tries to tell the average Australian that he may not have a conflict of interest in that kind of situation, there is not a man or woman who would believe him.
Look at those comments again, Mr Prime Minister, because you are asking the average Australian to believe that, even though Senator Parer now stands to benefit from shares which are worth $2 million and which have returned over $800,000 in the last three years in dividends—and they are in the coal industry, the area of the minister's portfolio—there 
 is no conflict of interest. You do not have a hope of convincing them of that, Mr Prime Minister. He also said, in 1986:
The public, the electors of this country, are entitled to have confidence in the integrity of their elected representatives; to know that Ministers of the Government will perform their duties without fear or favour; to be reassured that a Minister's private interests, whatever they may be, do not conflict with his or her public duties in holding the high office of a Minister in the Federal Government.
It seems that this Prime Minister has stepped right away from that statement—because that was the situation in the original Cabinet code of conduct, as adapted by this government in its guidelines of ministerial conduct—and now is saying that the tests of conflict of interest are much higher, that the bar is a lot higher, and so it is a lot easier to get under it.
But I think the quote of quotes has got to be this. In 1986 the present Prime Minister said:
The Prime Minister, by his actions and weakness, his inability to discipline and expel from the Ministry the Minister for Trade and by breaking a promise has further confirmed in the minds of the Australian public that, when it really comes to the crunch, when he really has a gut issue upon which to make a decision, when he has to choose between duty which might be lonely, hard, unpopular and give him a few sleepless nights but it is still the right thing to do, and cronyism, he will take the latter course. When one has to make that choice, but one has an alternative, and that is to smooth it all over, to pretend it has not happened, to stand by one's cronies, to serve the interests of factional survival, one can be absolutely certain that yours truly, the present Prime Minister, will always choose the latter course of action.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-03-24,"—I too rise to speak on this motion. There is one thing which Senator Murray said that I very much agree with. That is that one would have thought that, when we came back to this place two and a half sitting weeks ago, there would have been more important issues for the Labor Party to focus on than the slur program that they have set out on.
It is now very clear, as Senator Patterson has said, from what occurred in the case of me and my family, then the Baillieu family and now this attack on Warwick Parer, that 
 there was a deliberate decision made by those on the other side of the chamber to attack—to try and get away from the issues about which the Australian public are concerned. There are many of those and I wish to address them in my contribution.
In doing that, I particularly want to deal with the motion before us and some of the words and points in it that I think need explaining here. Firstly, no other Prime Minister of this country has applied such strict guidelines for the operations of his ministers. A number of ministers and parliamentary secretaries have, as we know, fallen foul of these guidelines. We certainly cannot point to anything during the 13 years of the Labor government that remotely goes near the standards or the high bar that our present Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, has set.
I particularly make reference, as did my colleague Senator O'Chee the other day, to a former Prime Minister, Mr Keating. I make particular reference to Mr Keating; Danpork; the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Crean; and the arrangement they tried to put in place to allow semen and genetic material into this country. The then Prime Minister tried, in effect, to get around the rules and put an industry at risk. When we compare the two situations, it can be seen that Mr Howard's performance in terms of responsibility and ministerial conduct is much higher than we have seen before.
Secondly, it is a guide—I repeat, a guide—to ministerial conduct. The reason that we have this motion before us today is very simple: despite the three efforts that it has made, the Labor Party have failed to lay a blow on any of the particular subjects they have attacked. I refer particularly to Senator Parer. The opposition set out to demonstrate that Senator Parer was, to use the words that Senator Faulkner used, `using to your own advantage in terms of a conflict of interest'. They have not been able to lay one single glove on Senator Parer. They have tried to throw in coal export controls. They have tried to draw in what aptly has been described by the minister as `generic' decisions.
We in this particular place all know that ministers right across the board in this government and in previous governments—Treasurers, when they deal with taxation, are a classic example—make decisions which relate to generic matters which go across the board. Of course they, as do Australian citizens, benefit from those particular decisions if there is, for example, a reduction in tax. I think it is very dangerous for the opposition to run this particular line that, because a person makes a generic decision, they may have had or have had some involvement in a particular thing which is a conflict of interest.
—None of us had investments in companies that benefited from this decision. That is the point.
—You have not proved it. You have not laid one glove on Senator Parer. The opposition have not laid one glove on Senator Parer to demonstrate that he had a conflict of interest or that he or his family personally gained from any of the decisions he has had to make as a minister of the Crown—a very good, successful minister, I might add. These are some of the issues that we need to deal with.
Thirdly, the opposition have tried to liken this situation to the situation in relation to Senator Short. Like Senator Parer, former Senator Short was, I believe, one of the gentlemen of this place. He was also a very honest man. In his particular case, Senator Short, for whatever reason—it is in the Hansard record—did not declare some shares. He then came into this chamber and announced that he was getting rid of those shares. It was around 10 October, I think. Some days after that, he discovered that he had in fact made a decision where there was very clearly a conflict of interest. Senator Short then resigned from that particular position; he declared that there was a conflict of interest and he resigned.
In this particular case, the Labor Party have done everything in their power to discredit the Hon. Warwick Parer, and they have not been able to lay a glove on him. Therefore, they changed their attack. They are now attacking the ministerial guidelines. They will try a different way of going around it just to keep 
 this rolling, because they do not want to deal with the issues before us. What about the Wik legislation and the importance of that? What about tax reform and the importance of that? If ever we have seen a policy free zone in a parliament it is right over there on the other side of the chamber.
—What is your tax policy? Tell us. You have a GST, that is all.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, could you please ask that rabbit on the other side of the chamber to have some manners—to abide by the standing orders? He consistently interjects when he comes into this place. He seldom says anything of benefit to this place. I have not heard one word out of him about policy. All we have is this carp, carp, carp, yap, yap, yap that is consistently delivered here all the time.
Let us deal with a few of the things that Senator Parer has done. We have seen some real industry reform; industry reform that has been very beneficial to both my state and Senator Cook's state, because we both happen to come from the same state. Madam Acting Deputy President, there have also been benefits to your state of Queensland. You come from Queensland, as does Senator Parer. These decisions have benefited the mining industry right across the board. They are decisions that should have been taken 10 years ago.
—There is nothing new about it, though.
—No, nothing new at all, as Senator Patterson says. I want to quote a few of these things, and to explain why the opposition wants to get people's eyes off the ball. It is because Senator Parer is so successful. Why are the opposition now taking their eyes off Senator Parer and attacking the Prime Minister? Because they have not been able to lay a glove on Senator Parer. They have not been able to demonstrate any conflict of interest. This is a deliberate tactic to pull down the real benefits that are progressing through our government to the community.
Let us look at this for a moment: 40 new projects have been commissioned in the past 12 months, $7 billion worth of investment; 
 and 120 resource and energy projects are currently either under construction or been committed to, $20 billion which will create 7,000 direct and 20,000 indirect permanent jobs. God only knows this country needs permanent jobs, and yet we have this diversion that has been delivered in this place over the last few sitting weeks. The opposition have hardly bothered to raise a particular issue of concern to the Australian public.
The feedback that I am getting from the Australian public—and I am sure other senators are getting similar feedback—is that they happen to like successful people in parliament and think it is a good thing that we have a few people on this side of the chamber who are actually successful and have been able to prove themselves out in the hard world of the nitty-gritty.
—Who have taken risks.
—Absolutely, they have taken risks, as has been said before. The broad population approve of that. They want it to happen and it just makes one wonder why the people on the other side want to attack people who are not only successful in their private life but successful as ministers.
A couple of months ago I was with Senator Parer in Kalgoorlie, which is, I would say, the heart of the mining industry in this country, if there is such a thing. We met with prospectors. We met with exporters. We met with miners. We met with construction people and what have you. All they could say to us was, `We want to get on with the job. We want to increase the wealth of this country. We want to give young people opportunities. We want to give the Aboriginal communities opportunities. We will take them on board and train them.' That was the message that we were being given.
I just have to say that this attack on our colleague Senator Parer is designed purely and simply to get people's eye off the ball in terms of what is important as far as the Australian community is concerned. I have to say—coming back to what Senator Murray said—that there are far more important issues that the community wants to see us debating, dealing with and getting on with, such as some of things I have mentioned whether they 
 be in the rural sector, health, aged care or a whole range of things. They want to hear us debating social and economic issues. They want to hear how the people on the other side of the chamber are going to deal with these issues. They want them to present themselves as an alternative government. They know, as we know, that sometime in the next 12 months there will be another election. We have a situation where they have nothing.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1998-03-24,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present report No. 357 entitled Jindalee Operational Radar Network  and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard  and to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, in June 1991 Defence entered into a contract with Telstra—or Telecom as it then was—to acquire a wide-area surveillance capability based on an over-the-horizon radar technology which had been developed in Australia.
From the beginning, Madam President, the JORN Project has been bedevilled with technical and management problems which have so far resulted in an increase in the contracted price of over $600 million and a four year delay in the schedule. On current estimates, Australia will not have a fully operational over-the-horizon radar network—which is a crucial element of our surveillance system—until the year 2002.
The Committee's inquiry revealed deficiencies in almost every aspect of the JORN Project: in the process of selecting the prime contractor; in the supervision of the prime contractor (Telstra) by Defence; in the management of the project by Telstra; and in the performance of a key sub-contractor, GEC-Marconi.
In selecting the prime contractor Defence ignored the report of an internal review team which con 
 cluded, early in the process, that the best approach would be to select a contractor experienced  in over-the-horizon radar technologies and with a proven  track record in managing major defence projects. The review team had favoured a US-based prime contractor with an Australian company in partnership. The Committee is critical of Defence's actions in establishing a review team for the particular purpose of making recommendations on acquiring an over-the-horizon radar network, only to ignore the fundamental assumptions on which its recommendations were based. It is ironic that the company now responsible for completing the JORN Project is an American company—Lockheed Martin—with an Australian company in partnership.
The Committee found that Defence exhibited weaknesses in its supervision of the prime contractor. For example, Madam President, Defence did not intervene early enough or with sufficient rigour to put in place formalised and systematic risk assessment procedures (as required by the contract). Nor did Defence insist on greater Telstra consultation with DSTO—world renowned experts in the field of over-the-horizon radar. Defence's unwillingness to give progressive approval to Telstra's system designs, while understandable given the terms of the contract, contributed to Telstra's difficulties in finalising and progressing a design capable of meeting JORN's very demanding performance specifications.
Telstra's lack of experience in Defence contracting and its unfamiliarity with contracts written in terms of required functions and performance became evident in the early stages and were to have damaging consequences for the project. The Committee also found lack of commitment by senior Telstra management to the JORN Project. Telstra failed to access relevant expertise in Defence project management or systems engineering, failed to develop an effective relationship with DSTO and encountered significant difficulties in its management of a major sub-contractor, GEC-Marconi.
The original sub-contract between Telstra and GEC-Marconi set out a cumbersome division of responsibilities which contributed to a breakdown in the commercial relationship between Telstra and GEC-Marconi. Remaining unresolved for over three years, the problem of poorly specified interfaces, and the lack of a coherent plan to manage and control hardware and software interface configurations, significantly influenced Telstra's management of the sub-contract and impeded progress on the project.
The Committee is critical that GEC-Marconi, given its experience elsewhere, did not anticipate the difficulties that were inherent in the original sub-contract with Telstra. Moreover, the Committee 
 was told in the course of the inquiry that GEC-Marconi's inability to deliver transmitters and receivers and associated drivers to quality, performance and time requirements had an adverse impact on the project's cost and schedule.
As you are aware, Madam President, Telstra has relinquished its management role to a Lockheed Martin/Transfield joint venture company. The future of the JORN Project is, however, far from clear. Although Defence asserts that the radar network's performance requirements are technically achievable and the partners in the joint venture company have expressed confidence that the radar network can and will be completed, the Committee believes that there are good reasons for a more cautious assessment to be made.
Although much has been done to mitigate the technical risks that are still to be confronted, the fact remains that it is in the last years of the project that the high-cost, high-risk systems integration phase will take place. As Defence's New Submarine Project has shown, systems integration and testing can be particularly troublesome and time-consuming.
Madam President, since 1983 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has examined a number of Defence projects and programs which have revealed Defence's consistent inability to gain value for money. It is essential that Defence addresses project management shortcomings and establishes sound procedures which will ensure that high cost projects are completed within allocated budgets and time-frames.
The Committee believes that it is critical that Defence obtain the best  project managers, if necessary from overseas, for major acquisition projects. The problems encountered in the JORN Project demonstrate conclusively that Defence should choose appropriately experienced consortiums or companies to acquire its major defence capabilities—with a particular focus on choosing the best project managers.
Madam President, a broader issue to emerge during this inquiry was the extent of the Commonwealth's liability for cost overruns incurred by the JORN Project. In 1991 Defence had negotiated a ceiling price  in its contract with Telstra. However, given Telstra's status as a Commonwealth business entity, any additional costs incurred by Telstra over and above the ceiling price to be paid by Defence are costs to the Commonwealth in terms of reduced dividend payments to the Government and its shareholders. This is a matter of immense concern to the Committee.
In conclusion, the Committee expresses its appreciation to those people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at both public and in camera  hearings. The Commit 
 tee also thanks John Alcock from the Department of Defence and Ray McNally from the Australian National Audit Office for their assistance.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-03-24,"—Yesterday, I was in the process of detailing to the Senate a number of case studies where people who had been unfairly dismissed had availed themselves of the current appeal provisions and had been reinstated. I just want to state for the record some of those cases and point out some of the people who, under the government's proposal, will no longer be able to avail themselves of the appeal mechanisms.
Case one involved a worker who was dismissed because she would not enter into an arrangement which constituted a breach or rip-off of the tax system. She was dismissed. Case two saw a worker dismissed because he would not sack a subordinate because she was pregnant. He was dismissed. Case three saw another worker dismissed because he refused to certify that an unroadworthy vehicle was in fact roadworthy. He was dismissed. They appealed, and all of these workers were reinstated because they had been unfairly dismissed.
This proposal is saying to these workers, `Under our legislation, you would not even get a guernsey in terms of appealing. Not only would you not be reinstated, you would have nowhere to go to put your case.' As these cases highlight, not only will employees be worse off but also the public will clearly be at the mercy of the small proportion of business people who are unscrupulous in relation to wilful, malicious, capricious, unfair dismissals.
The Labor Party will not be a party to this unwarranted and needless attack on workers. It is most important to note, as I said before, that these cases are confined, they are small in number. But, to those unscrupulous employers whom I outlined previously, this legislation essentially gives them a legislative imprimatur to hire and fire at will. This legislation is saying to employers, `You have the government's blessing to hire and fire your employees at will—on a whim, in fact.'
Since the defeat of the last attempt to push this unwanted measure on Australians, Minister Reith has been very busy impressing on the Australian community why we need this exemption. He has continually chosen to 
 ignore all the evidence put before him. Instead, when he realised he had no empirical data upon which to predicate the need for this legislation, he paid for his own survey. He commissioned a survey through the Yellow Pages, paid $5,000 out of taxpayers' money—thank you very much—and released his own what I regard as fairly contorted results of the survey. But we never got the questions—and, of course, everybody would be aware that, in terms of any kind of survey, the questions are critical, not simply the answers.
The minister chooses to ignore the fact that unfair dismissal applications under this government's legislation have almost halved in the last year. The minister chooses to ignore the fact that only 154 claims were determined by arbitration. The minister chooses to ignore the fact that most unfair dismissal applications are not against small business employers. I would like to pay tribute to Senator Murray in this regard, given he got several brickbats from us yesterday, for being quite assiduous in urging Minister Reith to provide him with empirical data and also in terms of making out the case that this is in fact politically driven legislation.
According to the February 1998 Yellow Pages survey, small business approval in federal government policies per se still remains negative. The survey clearly showed that work and sales remain the major concern for small business. What a surprise! What is the major concern for business? Demand, not whether they can sack their workers at will. It is demand. They want sales. They want some genuine economic activity.
That brings me to the Bell report, which was into the needs of small business. Did the Bell report recommend a change to the government's newly adopted unfair dismissal laws? No, it did not. It did say there ought to be a review, perhaps after 12 months. So the government report into small business failed to recommend the exemption, but the minister, without any supporting evidence, decided to push ahead with an exemption anyway, ignoring his clear statement and that of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to Australian workers that there would be no exemptions. 
All the empirical evidence as to why this legislation is not necessary has been stated and is clearly documented in the Labor minority report—and I urge those senators who are interested to read it. I am sure the government does not want to hear this evidence because it is inconsistent with the propaganda that the government is perpetuating. This government has consistently shown that, when it states that the workplace relations system provides a fair go all round, it really means that only some workers are entitled to a fair go, and this fair go only applies to workers when it suits the government's needs.
With this legislation, the government is actively attempting to discriminate against one-third of the Australian work force. One-third of the Australian work force is going to be affected by this decision, not in substantial numbers, I would suggest—2.8 million workers. There is no justification at all for this legislation. It is a con. It is an excuse for the government to get a double dissolution trigger. It is something the government said it would not do not only just before the election but also after the election and after its own industrial relations legislation was implemented. So it is a pure political stunt. The government is playing with the needs, aspirations and fears of average workers with regard to job insecurity for its own political end. This discrimination will leave these employees with no right of appeal and no protection from harsh, unjust and unreasonable dismissal. We of course, will continue to oppose it.
In conclusion, we say this to the government: this is the line in the sand for the Labor Party. We say, `Enough is enough.' If this government wants an election based on the protection of the jobs of three million Australians, we say, `Bring it on.' If this government wants an election based on whether it is acceptable for average Australians to be sacked on a whim without recourse to appeal, we say, `Bring it on.' If this government wants an election based on what is right, fair and just for all Australians, we say, `Bring it on.' We will have an election on this. Some 2.8 million Australians need to be protected from this measure and from what is a direct 
 con with regard to the Australian people and a blatant and transparent attempt to ensure that the government has yet another double dissolution trigger. We maintain our stringent opposition to this, and we call upon all senators to do the same.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-03-24,"—The Australian Democrats, as is well known, will reject the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  outright. In doing so, I want to put the case for that. During the 1996 election, the coalition promised to replace Labor's unfair dismissal laws with what they described as `a fair go all round' for employers and employees. Little detail was provided at that time because it was the coalition's practice to run a policy free zone until the last five weeks of the election. But it was clear that all workers would have access to the regime, and that the test for unfair dismissal would be closer to the pre-1993 rules when Labor's laws were changed.
The Democrats, prior to the election in 1996 and since, supported the coalition's policy direction on unfair dismissals. During the election campaign, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, known as COSBOA, asked the coalition, the Democrats and Labor to support an exemption for small business from the unfair dismissal laws. It is important to note that all three parties refused on the basis that it would breach the `a fair go all round' approach. So, going into the election, all three parties refused to do what the government is now putting before us.
The 1996 Workplace Relations Act passed through the Senate with the Democrats' support, implementing the `fair go all round' approach and implementing the unfair dismissal regime. The unfair dismissal regime now relies mostly on the corporations power rather than the external affairs power allowing the act to avoid the procedural difficulties which it had before. It is a much simplified act with regard to unfair dismissals. In our view, the current laws are pro-business and pro-employment—to such an extent that it is Labor's view, as I understand it, that they go too far.
There were 10 key changes by the coalition with our support to Labor's laws on unfair dismissals. They were: a change in the onus of proof—instead of an employer having to prove they had a valid reason for the dismissal, the employee now needs to prove the dismissal was unfair, harsh or unjust. Hearings are now held in the commission instead of proceedings being in the Federal Court. Costs may be awarded against employees if an employee proceeds with a frivolous or vexatious claim. An application fee of $50 applies and acts as a disincentive to speculative applications. The fee is waived only if the employee is in financial difficulty. The viability of an employer is taken into account in damages. The commissioner is required, among other things, to take into account the viability of the employer in deciding whether to award damages for termination in lieu of reinstatement. Procedural fairness is no longer a mandatory requirement—a fair dismissal cannot become unfair because of a technicality, as could happen before. Probationary employees are excluded—the new act extends the eligibility period for probationary employees to three months, so for three months they can be dismissed without regard to the unfair dismissal laws. Casual employees cannot apply for unfair dismissal until they have been employed for more than 12 months. For employees on specified term contracts, the exemption is excluded, so those employees are not covered by the unfair dismissal laws. Lastly, state systems are reinforced.
All those changes have resulted in a reduction of federal unfair dismissal claims by 49 per cent. In our view, the act is now working and working well and only genuine cases are being heard. The percentage comes to 0.7 per cent of all employers. About half of those might be expected to have to agree to a settlement. I suggest that it would be defying the bounds of commonsense or reason to imagine that there are no rogue employers at all in small business, and that none of this 0.7 per cent are likely to abuse their power or their rights in this regard.
We believe strongly that it is a vital function of our society to protect the human rights of Australians. We think that the federal 
 unfair dismissals law is part of that human rights situation. That is why for us this is a matter of principle. We think it is unacceptable that up to 2.9 million Australian employees could lose the right to challenge an employer who has sacked them harshly, unjustly or unfairly, which is the test in the act.
As the parliament and much of the country know, the Workplace Relations Act was passed as the result of an agreement between the Democrats and the coalition. Within that agreement, we came to the view with government that no further major change would occur to the act until the next election, in which case every party was entitled to put forward whatever policies they wished. In our view, this proposition put forward by the government is specifically a breach of that agreement. This is not a technical amendment; it is a breach of the principles which the government, the Democrats and Labor agreed in 1996 should apply; and those which the government and the Democrats agreed after the election on the format, as with the new bill. We are deeply disturbed by any government that would be willing to break an agreement in this manner.
The next area I wish to deal with is the area of facts and statistics. I mentioned earlier that federal unfair dismissal applications have fallen by 49 per cent. I have spent more than a year vigorously pushing the government to provide the statistics, which they were unwilling to do, and which I now put before you. Firstly, the federal unfair dismissal applications have fallen from 14,533 to 7,463 under federal law. It was always my belief that many of the unfair dismissal applications involved big business and not small business. Finally I was able to push that point through, because I was able to get the information out of government.
We have discovered that 65 per cent of federal unfair dismissal applications are from big business and only 35 per cent are from small business. We are now down to 2,580 federal unfair dismissal applications. Of those 2,580, based on percentage figures supplied to me by the minister, in certain states such as Tasmania and Western Australia that 
 translates to as few as 16 federal unfair dismissal applications. Listeners might well say, `What is all the fuss about?' The fact is that the majority—60 per cent—of all unfair dismissal applications in this country are under state laws, not federal laws.
If the government has a problem at all, it is with the lack of harmonisation and consistency in the laws of this country which lead to great confusion. That confusion is exhibited in every letter I get from small business organisations. I do not blame them. You cannot expect people standing behind a till, working a lathe or working at a computer to know whether they fall under state or federal laws. Neither can you expect them to understand or to know what the laws are.
I still get people writing to me complaining about Labor's laws who do not realise that they fall under the state law not the federal law. We have a situation in which the largest number of unfair dismissal applications falls under state laws not Commonwealth laws. The largest number relates to big business not small business, and the number of federal unfair dismissal applications is relatively minute.
The government has made the claim—and it was repeated in the second reading speech to this bill—that the exemption from unfair dismissal for small businesses with 15 employees or less would create jobs. The government repeats COSBOA's estimate of 50,000 jobs. I have made it my business to inquire where that number of 50,000 jobs comes from. It turns out that it is a guess. There was no survey, no empirical study, no evidence, no research—it is a guess.
I think it is the guess of the chief executive of that organisation, whom I have been told said, `Oh well, there are a certain number of small businesses out there. Let's assume that a certain percentage of them would employ one person extra.' It is extremely difficult to accept the proposition that a guess at job employment of that kind should generate a bill which would destroy the rights of those who now put their case for unfair dismissal and who are mostly genuine cases.
This bill gives a small minority of employers, of which even fewer would be rogue 
 employers, the right to sack workers unfairly. The government says that this will only apply to new employees of small business. What is the turnover rate of staff in small business companies? I have not been provided with that figure, but anecdotal evidence tells me that it can reach up to 60 per cent. Within a couple of years you have a turnover in many small businesses which would result in many people who presently fall outside the scope of this act falling within it.
We think this is a stalking-horse for big business anyway, because all businesses—and we understand that—and particularly small businesses want as little regulation and law controlling them as possible. One chair of a small business committee said to me, `Look, if I want to employ or fire somebody because they have got blue eyes and fair hair, I should be allowed to do that.' That is how they think. I understand that but, as a legislator, I am certainly not going to agree with it.
Right from the beginning we have thought that this bill is predicated on the need for the government to have a trigger for a double dissolution. We think there is no other reason. The government has had a great deal of difficulty in arriving at bills to provide it with a double dissolution trigger. According to what I have seen statistically, this Senate is the most cooperative in seven years. As at December 1997 from the election in 1996, this Senate has passed 317 bills. The number of bills carried forward from 1997 to 1998 is the lowest that I have seen for seven years. No bills are being held up apart from the five that we know about.
Let us go through those five bills. The first is the  Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2] —the unfair dismissal exemption bill for federal small business, not state small business—which is before us. Indisputedly, if that bill is rejected by the Senate it will form a double dissolution trigger. The next one which would have formed a double dissolution trigger was the  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 [No. 2] —otherwise known as the optional honesty bill—but Labor has advised us that it has agreed to let that through, so that cannot form a trigger.
Then there are three sets of bills—the Public Service bills, the legislative instruments bill, and the native title bill—which were laid aside in the lower house. The advice that the Senate has had from the clerk is that that makes them constitutionally suspect. The government says that it has contrary advice, and well it might, but we all know that we have been pushing it hard to provide that advice. My assumption is that if the government cannot front up, it must have a shaky case, so this is the only bill on which it can really deliver a double dissolution trigger. I think that is what it has been about all along.
Minister Peter Reith is a very intelligent, experienced politician. If anyone out there honestly thinks he believes this exemption for federal small businesses below 15 employees, a law which only affects 2,580 small businesses, is going to deliver 50,000 jobs, they underestimate his intelligence. No, this is just straightforwardly a cynical political device which, unfortunately, is supported by small business organisations who, I think, should know better.
The protection of rights is the responsibility of every section of the community. It is no good small business screaming, and quite rightly screaming, about standover tactics from landlords on tenants or from franchisors on franchisees or any other kind of supplier of heavy-handedness and say, `It is okay. We can go and give our employees a whack.' Everyone's rights are the responsibility of everyone else. I think it is most unfortunate that the workers of Australia, the working battlers of Australia, are subjected to this kind of discrimination between one class of workers and others.
The case of the government is that the public good of generating jobs justifies the private harm done to this minority of employees. But if you cannot prove your case, if you have no empirical basis, no logical rational basis for saying that 50,000 employees will be created by taking away the rights of 2,580 Australians, then the entire credibility of your case, the entire moral justification for it, falls away. 
The Australian Democrats believe that this bill should be rejected on the grounds of human rights, on the grounds of economics and on the grounds of plain commonsense. Why do we say economics? Because the statistics we have from the ABS show that from November 1996 to August 1997, which are the latest figures I have, small business employment rose anyway by four per cent whilst large business employment fell by 1½ per cent. During the time of Labor's laws alone, job growth in small business under those laws, which were regarded both by us and the coalition as going too far, was still double that of large business. The problem for small business, as exhibited in the recent yellow pages Index of Small Business Attitudes, is economic conditions and finance conditions. They are still paying about the highest real interest rates in the OECD. So on economic grounds this does not match up.
We do not think Mr Reith can guarantee that all 890,000 small business employers in Australia will treat their workers fairly and justly if we allow him to remove the minimum protection they enjoy. He has not offered any additional funding for management training. He has not proposed to make it easier for small business to expand in other ways. Whilst he has addressed some of his responsibilities about the concerns of small business, those he has not attended to. In summary, we say the federal laws work, that they deal only with genuine cases, and that it is a minority of small businesses affected.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-03-24,"—The government is obviously working on the theory that third time is lucky in relation to the changes before us today. The Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  is in fact the third attempt by this government to impose its fundamentalist and discriminatory proposal to exempt businesses employing no more than 15 workers from the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. In late June 1997 the Senate voted to disallow regulations under the act which would have had the same intent as this bill. The bill was rejected in the Senate on 21 October 1997 and now we have 
 the bill before us today. On both previous occasions I voted for the disallowance and I see no reason to change my position.
There are some very fundamental issues that are being missed by the government. One would have to suggest that they are being deliberately missed. One is that they forget that low wages—and they are pushing very hard for reducing wages  and conditions to be `internationally competitive'—equals lack of spending power equals reduced market for small businesses' goods and services. The largest part of the market for small businesses is in fact the local economy. Added to that we have another simple equation: job insecurity equals lack of consumer confidence. What does that mean to small businesses' goods and services? Are you likely to spend on goods and services if you are unsure of whether you will continue to have a job tomorrow, the next day or the next week? Those things are fairly basic.
We currently have a government the Prime Minister of which talks about a nation relaxed and comfortable, a nation of shareholders. What I can say to that is: get real. We have in fact a nation of growing working poor, a nation of people who no way in a million years would be able to purchase Telstra shares, who no way in a million years would be able to be involved in the speculative international economy. There are a few players in Australia involved in that. We know that it is a very big part of the banks' agenda in Australia, but we know it does not represent the average Australian.
What does it really mean if, for instance, 35 per cent of the unfair dismissal claims in the courts are associated with small business? What it means is that small business in fact is underrepresented in relation to unfair dismissal claims. It means that less employees of small business are currently going to that court. It means that we should look at the outcome for those types of people who are involved in those kinds of court cases.
The 1996-97 annual report of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia highlighted that 58 per cent of contested unfair dismissal cases were decided in favour of the employee. Instead of the government saying, as it always 
 seems to, `Oh, gosh, this is a cost for the employer,' I would say, `My goodness, this means that the court has found that 58 per cent of those people were found to have been unfairly dismissed.' It is dreadful to suggest that this kind of behaviour will be rewarded by the government—it will make it easier to treat those people unfairly. The median amount of compensation was around $6,000. We know the government has restricted the ceiling on payments that can be made to those people claiming unfair dismissal.
We have to decide what we do for those vulnerable people in our society who may face the fear of not having protection against being treated unfairly. That is what the court is required to decide. We are in a nation of the growing working poor. We are in a nation where the Prime Minister thinks that the nation can afford to buy Telstra shares. But we are in fact in a nation where the government believes the primary goal of government is to push for wages and conditions to be reduced so that we can be competitive in the international free market.
I would say that there is something missing from that argument. What is missing are the people who will be affected—that is, people who are working, people who are unemployed because they have been shed in the push for international competitiveness and downsizing and those people who are going to treated unfairly in this system. All the small businesses that are actually going down the tubes because of the concentration on corporate systems and international free markets will also be affected.
It seems to me that the government has lost the plot. It has left the community out of the equation. This is just another example. It is getting people through the door that is the main concern of the majority of small businesses in Australia. If they have not got people with the money and inclination to buy their goods and services they can sack people to their hearts content and things will not get better for them in the medium or long run. That is what this government has failed to address. The Greens will not be supporting this bill.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-03-24,"—The second reading speech on the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  states:
The bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business—and it is necessary, to ensure continuing growth and employment in small business
That is not quite correct. If you look at the bill you find that it states:
Insert:
(5A) An application under subsection (1)—
that is the wrongful dismissal provision in the Workplace Relations Act—
may not be made on the grounds referred to in paragraph (1)(a), or on grounds that include that ground, by an employee (other than an apprentice) whose employment has been terminated by the employer . . .
The only impact the amendment would have on the act is to remove those grounds set out in (1)(a) which entitle an employer to terminate the employment of an employee. Those grounds are that the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable. So that if the employer terminates a worker and that termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable, then the worker cannot take any action against his employer. But he or she can, if the grounds are those set out in 170CB. If the termination of the worker is on the grounds set out in sections 170CK, 170CL, 170CM or 170CN, then the employee can take action.
It is a most peculiar situation where you have an act—if this is passed—which allows an employee to take action if he or she is dismissed on the grounds of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. If an employer who employs 15 or less people sacks his employee on those grounds, then that employee can take action; or if the employee is sacked because he or she was temporarily absent from work because of illness or injury, within the meaning of the regulations; or if he or she had a trade union membership or participated in trade union 
 activities outside working hours or, with the employer's consent, during working hours; or if he or she is sacked because they are not a member of a trade union, the person can take action under subdivision B.
The interesting thing is why. I have read this already, but if you look at what is said in the second reading speech, you will see that this is to help small business by taking away the ability of the employees of small business to sue when they are wrongfully dismissed. If that is going to encourage the growth of employment in small business, why does the government go halfway and halfway only?
It just seems absurd that you would have an act that allows a small employer to dismiss his, her or its employees on certain grounds and those certain grounds would not entitle the person to sue for wrongful dismissal, but allows that person to sue for wrongful dismissal if it is on other grounds. So an employer can be as harsh, unjust or as unreasonable as he, she or it wants and the employee cannot sue. But if the dismissal is in any way connected with race, colour, sexual preference—and that would include I suppose, transsexual people—age, physical or mental disability, marital status, then the employee can take proceedings.
The philosophy behind this act must mean that the government does consider that there are many grounds—and they are set out in the act—in respect of which it is fair and reasonable that the worker can take action if the employer has sacked him or her on that basis. But—and I keep repeating this because it is such an amazing matter—although the philosophy behind the government is to allow any employee to take such action on those other grounds that I have mentioned, it does not allow an employee to take action if the termination was harsh, unjust or unreasonable.
It just seems a patent nonsense that legislation could be brought into the chamber which allows that situation to exist. In other words, the government's legislation is saying, `Oh yes, we do think there are grounds upon which it would be wrong for a small employer to sack his, her or its employee, but there are other grounds where we don't.' That approach would be consistent with the propo 
 sition that this is really populist legislation; that the government, in bringing forward this legislation, thinks that the small business people will be attracted to voting for the government because it changes the wrongful dismissal legislation. At the same time, the government realises the reaction against doing that might be too great if it went too far, so it cuts back the grounds upon which dismissal can take place without there being a right to go to the commission.
We heard speakers before—Senator Mackay, for example—talking about people who did suffer a great injustice in the way they were dismissed from their employment. Listening to what Senator Mackay had to say, it seems a dreadful business that this legislation should be allowed to go on in this way.
A lot of the problems raised by the government are problems of process. They said it is going to cost small business a lot to take proceedings and it is awkward to go to court. But it seems quite a ridiculous situation to say, `Because our legal system has flaws in it, people are going to have their rights taken away.' I can understand an argument that says the legal system leaves a lot to be desired; therefore we will try to fix up the legal system—`The system before the Industrial Relations Commission is such that they have to improve it.' But we should not allow the defects in the system to resonate through the community in terms of people being deprived of rights that they should have as workers. The second reading speech states:
The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, only. Employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, seeking a certified agreement or in AWA industrial action.
It is not as if the government does not know the inconsistencies in this legislation. It is not as if the government does not know that it is picking and choosing as to on what grounds employees might be able to take action. It cannot plead that it does not know what its legislation means about small business be 
 cause that is set out in the second reading speech.
It just seems a most peculiar approach to a fundamental right that people should be able to have some protection. It is said that the employer would be put at risk if it had to go to litigation, but of course so would the employee. There is a balance between the two. It seems that, if there is an unfairness, if there is a hardness and if there is an injustice, then it is proper that the umpire, the person we always refer to in these situations, should have a say about what should be the result of an action.
True enough, a small business might be concerned about putting people on if they cannot dismiss them, but that would be the same sort of argument that a big employer could use. So it seems a little pointless to say, `Because people will not be taken on if we do not take away the wrongful dismissal law, we ought to abolish it in respect of small business.' We ought to be saying the same for big business, but we do not. So the whole argument that is put forward by the government in this instance is well beyond understanding, seems to be contradictory and seems not to be the sort of legislation that a responsible Senate would put through. The least we could ask is that there be some consistency.
 It is clear that the community not only in the employment field but generally is feeling great insecurity. There are lots of laws passed that take away those sorts of rights that we have as citizens—rights of privacy, rights to have a telephone conversation that is not tapped and rights of migrants to have their cases properly heard. This is yet another right that hits at the very heart of the community. It hits at the working community of Australia. Most growth in employment is going to occur, it is always said, in small business.
People should not have a regime thrust upon them where they have no security. They would have no security if the employer could just sack them willy-nilly—do it harshly, do it unjustly and do it unreasonably. The employee would have no come back. It is a situation which you could not in justice ask the workers of Australia to tolerate. We cannot in justice allow this legislation to go 
 through. If it is the occasion of a double dissolution, then it would be interesting to hear what the people who are looking for security and have not had it under this government will say about the one entitlement they have to feel some security in their employment—that is, to take the employer to court and for the umpire to decide the issue. I hope this legislation is defeated, as it should be, a second time.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1998-03-24,"—May I congratulate my colleague Senator Cooney on an excellent contribution. I would like to pick up on the points that he was making at the conclusion of his speech. This is unjust legislation. This is legislation which clearly discriminates against a vulnerable—some might say the most vulnerable—section of the work force in this country. This is legislation that is also completely unnecessary. It is legislation that is founded upon rhetoric, upon scaremongering, upon an ideological obsession.
Since this government came to office, the solid commitments made by John Howard, then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister, and Mr Reith, now minister for industrial relations, have been thrown out the window. What were those commitments? There was the all-embracing commitment of the Prime Minister that he wanted an Australia where people felt relaxed and comfortable. Clearly, this legislation does not make employees of small business relaxed and comfortable. The one protection they have against unfair dismissal is being removed.
The other commitment with respect to industrial relations was that no Australian worker would be worse off under this government's proposed industrial relations changes. The document Better pay for better work released in February 1996 clearly stated:
The coalition believes that employees should have access to a fair and simple process of appeal against dismissal—based on the principle of a `fair go all round.'
There is no fair go all round in this legislation. Rather, this legislation discriminates against a particular section of the work force by removing their right, a right that should not be fettered before the law.
Furthermore, in late February, Mr Reith, the then spokesperson for the opposition, said:
Our position is very clear. If you've been unfairly dealt with at work, then you should have a right to appeal.
But now once again we have legislation before this parliament which seeks to remove that right. It seeks to remove the right of individual employees. We know that this government does not like trade unions. We hear that constantly every day from senators on the other side. They actually think that trade unions are some sort of pariah in society. I do not want to deal with that issue today, but it is clear that their whole modus operandi in terms of industrial relations is about breaking down representation and/or rights of workers.
Firstly, they attack trade unions, the concept of collective representation. Then, when dealing with a particular section of the work force that very often is not unionised—where there may very often be, say, only one employee in a small business—their approach is to destroy the rights of that individual. I can remember a former senator in this place, now a minister in the other place, Mrs Bishop, lecturing us ad nauseam about the benefits of individualism over collectivism. Yet when it comes to a pretty fundamental right for an individual worker—as I said, very often in a small business there might be only one or two workers, maybe not in a union—what is this government's approach? It is to remove their rights to take action against unfair dismissal. So much for the commitment to liberalism or liberal principles from this coalition.
I want to return to some comments I made in November 1996 when the first workplace relations legislation went through this parliament. At that time I referred to an editorial in the Sydney Morning Herald of February 1996 entitled `Fair and unfair dismissals'. I commented at the time that this was an important editorial because it actually spelled out the lie in the campaign being run by employers and by the then opposition about how unfair dismissal legislation was the root of all evil and the cause of unemployment. The Sydney Morning Herald has never been noted for being a pro-Labor or pro trade union news 
 paper. Later in my speech I want to refer to some more recent comments in terms of assessing this issue, but the editorial at the time stated:
Statistics released by the Industrial Relations Court in December—
that is, December 1995—
suggest that the operation of the law has not been as onerous as commonly implied. In 1994-95, 87 per cent of the 7,749 unfair dismissal claims lodged that financial year were either settled or discontinued before determination by the court and another 4 per cent were settled or discontinued before the determination process had started. Of those determined by the court, 56 per cent were decided in the employee's favour and 44 per cent in favour of the employer. And in the 219 cases where compensation was awarded, 74 per cent involved amounts less than $10,000, about 22 per cent involved amounts between $10,000 and $20,000, and less than 4 per cent involved amounts of $20,000 or more.
This suggests that much of the criticism of the law has stemmed from perceptions of its operation rather than its practice.
It will be recalled that that editorial and that commentary were in regard to the legislation that existed under the previous Labor government, legislation that this government had so stridently attacked, suggesting that it was causing employers, particularly in small business, not to employ people.
There was a massive campaign—we all remember it—to run the line in the public arena that small business would not employ people because it was too hard to sack them. That has always been the atttitude of this government. It is more concerned about ensuring that employers have rights to sack people than it is about getting employers to employ people—how to increase employment in this country.
During the period that the Labor government's unfair dismissal law was in operation—and, I might say, that was the amended unfair dismissal law which had given further concessions to employers—what did the employment figures show? The fascinating feature was that during the period between March 1994 and March 1995 employment in small business in this country grew. In one calendar year it grew by 176,000 employees. Small business in this country grew. In fact, 
 it was the only section in terms of the employment profile where there was significant growth. In the manufacturing and large business sector employment remained fairly constant. In the public sector there was a decline in the level of employment.
The figures tell the opposite story to what has been the rhetoric of this government—certainly when it was in opposition and now in government. Looking at a longer period—over the last 10 years or so since 1985—one finds that in this country small business has grown by 1.1 million employees. Since 1985 employment in the larger business sector has grown by approximately 410,000 whilst, in the public sector, employment has declined—and we all know that—because of cutbacks in the level of public service employment.
 The Sydney Morning Herald had it right when it said there was never a problem, and there is still no problem, with respect to the propensity for small business to employ people in this country vis-a-vis unfair dismissal laws. In all of the years during which the Labor government's legislation was in place, which the Liberal/National parties said was a restraint upon small business employing people, employment in small business actually rose. That in itself demonstrates that this legislation is totally unnecessary. This is a straw man argument. The government is saying that there is a problem, that employers will not employ people in small businesses, and then it says that we have to fix the problem by getting rid of unfair dismissal laws. It is an absolute furphy.
The second point I wish to make is that this legislation will have very little impact upon small business in any event because the bulk of small business employees in this country are not employed under federal awards. Generally, they are employed under state awards—state common rule awards—which have general application across the industry. In New South Wales, for instance, shop assistants and employees in the retail sector, the clerical sector and a whole range of other areas are employed under common rule state awards, particularly in small business. They are not generally employed under federal awards. The legislation is clearly nothing 
 more than window dressing to create an impression in the community that the government is doing something about improving employment in small business. It is not. I quote from an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review on 4 November last year:
Unfair dismissal laws have been damned as the obstacle to job creation, and held to blame if small business does not employ new staff.
While governments and industry groups exchange volleys on the issue, does small business really care?
Most small businesses—86 per cent—fall under State, not federal, law. So it is of scant interest to them that the Federal Government failed in the Senate to push through provisions that exempt businesses with fewer than 15 employees from unfair dismissal provisions.
Few small businesses, except in Victoria and the Territories, will have access to those federal laws.
The article goes on to say:
In a recent survey of 300 small businesses, which asked about impediments to job creation, unfair dismissal laws were rated last. Only 7.1 per cent of the businesses—80 per cent of which employ fewer than 20 people—saw unfair dismissal legislation as a bar to job creation.
Further on in the article it states:
The federal president of the Australian Small Business Association, said unfair dismissal legislation was not regarded as a major issue by its members.
""When small businesses rate the issues which affect them (eg unfair trading, taxation) in order of importance, unfair dismissal is always around the bottom of the list. While there is a perception that unfair dismissal law is a threat, there will be small businesses which will avoid employing people.""
As the article demonstrates, this issue does not rate when it comes to the problems faced by small business in this country. I can give specific examples of the concerns in the area in which I live, as I am sure other members of the Senate and the parliament can. For example, what are the shopkeepers in my area concerned about? They are concerned that Woolworths has built a huge shopping mall and may drive a number of small businesses out of business. This includes the butcher, the greengrocer and possibly the person who operates the local petrol station because now the major supermarket chains are into petrol 
 retailing. In fact, there is virtually no product that you cannot buy in a supermarket.
I am not here to argue the case, as it were, on those issues but to point out that that is what small business is concerned about—the ever-increasing squeeze placed upon them by the big retailers who can clearly undercut them on price because of economies of scale. They are concerned about the amount of regulation and paperwork and they are concerned about unfair trading. They are not concerned about unfair dismissal laws. It is a hollow and false argument—indeed, I would suggest it is completely hypocritical—for this government to say that all we have to do to increase employment in the small business sector by, say, 50,000 employees is to get rid of the unfair dismissal laws. That is an absolute and total untruth.
In conclusion, I point to the hypocrisy of this government in that, whilst it waxes lyrical and is intent upon bringing this legislation forward into this chamber again—as Senator Mackay has said, to provide it with another trigger for a double dissolution—and whilst it talks about unfair dismissal laws, what is it doing about the workers at Grafton meatworks, or at Cobar mines, or at Woodlawn mines?
—Quite a lot, actually.
—You are not actually doing anything, Bill. I know you have had a few chats with a few people but this government has done nothing on that issue—not one thing. That is a pressing issue. The real issue the government should be concentrating on is the situation facing workers who have lost up to $20 million in entitlements because of the actions of their employers. The government should have introduced legislation into this parliament to deal with that. That is the real issue about employment. It is about protecting the jobs of the workers and the livelihoods of those workers and their families. But, no, there has been no move whatsoever. I have not heard one speech from a government member in either house on the situation at the three locations I have just mentioned.
There has been no indication that any legislation will be forthcoming from the government to fix the problem of unfair 
 dismissal or unfair determination of those employees. It is the Labor Party that has taken the action through a private member's bill in the other place to try to address the issue. Those are the unfair dismissals that the government should really be focusing on, and not trying to create a phoney war about unfair dismissal laws and their impact upon small business.
I can assure Senator O'Chee and other government members that this con trick will not work. Small business does not believe the government. Small business is deserting the government every day because it has not delivered on any of the major issues that small business is concerned about. This sort of trick will not change the position and the attitude of small business to this government. Small business is finished with this government, just as we will finish off this legislation.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1997 [No. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-03-24,"—I oppose the Workplace Relations Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]. It is interesting to note that, for something that potentially will act as a trigger for a double dissolution and therefore has great importance, one would expect, for the government, the speakers list on this bill is limited to one government speaker—and that is Senator Alston. Obviously it does not play an important role for the government but, nonetheless, it provides a political tool by which the government can achieve a double dissolution, as speakers before me have said, including Senator Murray from the Australian Democrats.
This piece of legislation is back here for the second time and is quite reprehensible because the legislation itself seeks to discriminate against a specific group of workers. Senator Cooney and Senator Forshaw have clearly outlined how a select group of people who have no other sin—if we can term it that—other than to work for a small business, are going to be discriminated against in this nation. And that really is quite a tragedy because here we are singling out a group of people and telling them that their rights are going to be denied to them because their employer employs a specific number of employees.
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) in his second reading speech quoted Mr Bastian from the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia as saying that 50,000 jobs would be created if this bill went through the Senate. Senator Murray has already picked up on the fact that this is a gross exaggeration and that there is no proof. Obviously what COSBOA was doing was handing out some sort of carrot to the government, some inducement, to get it to pass this legislation so that, as a result of passing the legislation—
—He's right; 50 per cent get the sack and 50 per cent are employed.
—That is right, Senator Harradine. What we are seeing here is an inducement to the government to somehow get around the problem that it has yet to tackle—the massive problem it said it would tackle but has not done so—and that is the problem of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, in this nation. We had a debate in this chamber only last Thursday on the problems that the long-term unemployed in this nation are suffering as a result of this government—not as a result of any previous government, but as a result of this government. It can clearly be seen that the long-term unemployed are increasing in the categories 52 weeks to 104 weeks unemployed and over 104 weeks. So this offer by COSBOA in no way addresses the employment issue. Obviously it has been hung out as some sort of inducement for the government and, of course, the government is now trying to use this flimsy excuse—and that is all one could say it would be—as a reason for presenting this bill in the chamber again.
But if one looks at the words `50,000 jobs', it does not even say whether those jobs are full-time jobs, part-time jobs or casual jobs. If this government were sincere in trying to do something to offer people security in employment, they would be dropping this bill rather than putting it forward. This bill will not provide people with security and will encourage employers to sack those people in full-time jobs who are able to sustain them 
 selves, who are able to eke out a reasonable living on some occasions.
The job argument is not a valid argument at all. It is my experience that, in the past, major newspapers have announced: `1,000 jobs here, 1,500 jobs there, 2,000 jobs there', particularly with the opening of major shopping centres. Yet, when one looks into the figures, one finds that a substantial number of these jobs are casual jobs—casual jobs of from five to 10 hours work per week. If the government were to pass this legislation, the offer by COSBOA rings hollow indeed. One would not expect that one would see massive numbers of full-time jobs which would have a meaningful impact on the long-term unemployed. What we have here is sheer gamesmanship on the part of COSBOA to try to dupe this government into passing legislation that, at the end of the day, will do nothing other than deny a select group of people their rights. So, on that basis alone, the legislation that is presented here again stands totally condemned.
There is no guarantee in the minister's second reading speech that COSBOA are offering any ironclad guarantee that jobs will materialise as a result of this legislation. It is a throwaway line—and a cheap throwaway line at that. If we look further at the minister's second reading speech, we get into the funny parts of the speech: not funny in the sense that they are laughable, but funny in the sense that they can reasonably be ridiculed. When this legislation was defeated previously, the government apparently called upon Yellow Pages to do a survey, which was conducted between 30 October 1997 and 12 November 1997. The minister actually included the results of that survey in his second reading speech. The results are laughable, because again they offer no guarantee of employment.
Let us look at the results of that survey. The survey said that 33 per cent of small businesses reported that they would have been more likely to have recruited new employees if they had been exempted from unfair dismissal laws in 1996 and 1997. That is a load of rubbish—that is the only way it can be described. There is no promise of jobs there. 
 The words were most specific, `would have been more likely to'. There was no undertaking whatsoever; it was purely, `We might do it if we feel like it.'
The survey went on to say that 38 per cent of small businesses reported that they would be more likely to recruit new employees if they were exempted from the current unfair dismissal laws. Again, there is no promise there whatsoever. It is purely a spurious claim because it appealed to the employer. The survey asked, `Would you create more jobs if we were able to exempt you from the unfair dismissal laws?' What would you expect from the employers? The natural reaction, `Sure, you exempt us; we would employ more people.'
That is as banal a survey as trying to prove that the population in Brisbane are Christians by standing outside St John's Anglican Cathedral on a Sunday as people come out of the service asking them if they are Christians and then saying, `I've done a survey that shows that 99 per cent of people in Brisbane are Christians.' That would have exactly the same credibility as this survey—none whatsoever—and yet this government is resting on this as a potential trigger for a double dissolution. As one of my colleagues said earlier, it is very hypocritical. I find that what the government are doing has no sincerity about it whatsoever.
Further in his second reading speech, the minister talks about helping small business to `grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future'. I am all for helping small business grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future, but this government have done nothing to assist small business whatsoever. They were the first to embrace small business, yet they are the first to do nothing positive for small business. This step does nothing to help small business grow, employ and export because, if one looks at the legislation, one finds that there is a ceiling there—a ceiling of 15. What does a small business do when it wants to employ the sixteenth person? There is no incentive for small business to grow beyond 15 employees.
What the government did is they linked this tenuously into the termination, change and 
 redundancy provisions. There is no sensible relationship between the termination, change and redundancy provisions—as came out of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—and what is being proposed in this bill. They are like chalk and cheese. The termination, change and redundancy provisions were designed to protect the rights of workers, and the exemption for small businesses with 15 or fewer staff was because many of those small businesses were not making major changes brought about by technological advancement—major plant refits and so on. So it is a very poor but tenuous link that the government have tried to use in linking this to the issue of termination, change and redundancy.
Of course, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the magic number of 15 should then be used as justification for excluding a class of employees from their fundamental basic human rights—none whatsoever. This provision, if it were to get through, would act as a disincentive to employment in the longer term. If the government were serious about helping businesses to grow, helping businesses to employ and helping businesses to export, then they would drop this legislation rather than cynically use it as a means of achieving a double dissolution.
So why 15? Why not 12? Why not 10? Why not five? There is no rhyme, no reason, no justification, other than that tenuous link put up by the minister, which completely destroys itself. What we are seeing with this piece of legislation is a piece of legislation designed to destroy the fundamental rights of people in the work force.
The government are saying, `This really doesn't have any effect on existing employees.' But as Senator Murray pointed out, and rightly so, many of these small businesses have a very high turnover of staff, so what we will see in a very short space of time is this legislation taking effect a lot quicker than even the government would be prepared to admit. We would have people exposed a lot earlier than even the government would be prepared to concede.
What we see in the legislation is fundamentally a denial of justice to a certain class of 
 employees. It certainly could not be described as being fair to the employees who work for small businesses wherein there are 15 or fewer employed. The employees are not protected from the harsh and oppressive employers—and there are harsh and oppressive employers out there in the real world. They cannot all be painted as being Latter-day Saints. Certainly, many of them are quite disgusting in the way they treat their employees.
If one looks further at the second reading speech, one would see again the cynicism that exists in the government's approach. The minister said:
The new system is more balanced and fair to both employers and employees. It is less legalistic and costly, with an emphasis on conciliation. Employers are protected from frivolous and malicious claims—
This is just a load of nonsense. What we are talking about here are the fundamental basic rights of these people. The minister said in his second reading speech that, if this legislation is passed, the employers will be protected from frivolous and malicious claims and will thereby, in some way, benefit. What we are going to see is the denial of people's rights, and people in this nation have got to make up their minds what comes first—people's rights or employers being protected from frivolous and malicious claims.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1998-03-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to take note of this report because it is an encouraging report for several reasons. It describes in detail the excellent year the organisation has had. It provides evidence of how good marketing and clever export strategies can significantly boost the fortunes of the rural sector, and it represents the fulfil 
 ment of another election commitment—that is, the complete restructure of the Wheat Board.
This government has been and is committed to the reform of all key rural industries. It is committed to extracting government from activities that industries can and should do for themselves, and it is committed to putting the people with the most practical knowledge and experience back in charge of their own industries.
Under the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, we have overhauled the sugar industry, the marketing of red meat and the marketing of wool, and now the government has substantially met the expectations of the industry by restructuring the Australian Wheat Board, which is the country's major national and international grain marketing organisation. The reforms are certainly starting to bear results.
The board is Australia's fifth largest exporter, selling and marketing grain on behalf of Australia's 40,000 wheat growers. It is now in the process of moving from a statutory authority to a grower owned and controlled organisation and, in partnership with the growers, the government has assisted this change. Full privatisation is scheduled for 1 July 1999 and some of the preparation for this is described in this 1996-97 report.
On 1 July 1999, the Australian Wheat Board will become a stand-alone corporation—Australian owned and operated under the Australian Corporations Law and run by its own elected board with a capital base of around $550 million. The only real area of government involvement is the board's current work—that is, the provision of underwriting on the borrowings of wheat growers to fund advance payments to growers, which will cease in 1999, and the single desk export powers on wheat, which will remain.
In 1999-2000, the Australian government will review this single desk structure as part of its national competition policy. In connection with the finalisation of the package for the conversion of the AWB to a grower owned company from July 1999, I personally am very pleased that the Grains Council has unanimously endorsed the dual class share grower company to replace the AWB after 
 that time. I am convinced that this is the best means to meet with the government's and industry's objectives for a self-reliant, fully commercialised marketing structure under grower ownership and control.
The government will now consider the post-1999 package and legislation, and will take account of the matters put forward by the Grains Council for inclusion in the memorandum and articles of association of the new company to strengthen pooling arrangements and grower control. I am aware and note that the Australian Stock Exchange has confirmed that the grower control arrangements for the company could be retained if the company were listed, so long as the company is primarily involved in grain trading, and growers would have the controlling say in whether or not the company does continue as a grain trader.
Some of the board's key achievements during 1996-97 form part of the report's introduction. They include a range of successes—namely, the increase in sales revenue of seven per cent to an all-time high of $4.7 billion; the increase in export sales volumes by over 40 per cent to 19 million tonnes, the highest level ever achieved; and an enormous increase in export sales, which were achieved to Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Indonesia and Yemen. This is a fine organisation. It is doing the right thing by its growers and by the Australian government. In the interest of all Australians, it should be congratulated on the work that it has carried out over the last 12 months.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Wheat Board</title>,Documents,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-03-24,"—I note in the annual report that, in the financial year ended June 1997, the sales revenue of the Australian Wheat Board was $4.682 billion. Importantly, the holdings of the wheat industry fund at the end of that year were $444 million, which involved $70 million in levies on the wheat industry. Of course, we have heard about the restructuring of the wheat industry from Senator Sandy Macdonald, which was one of the key items on Mr Anderson's agenda back when he was appointed Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in March 1996.
This process was actually kicked off by the former government, but he was charged with the responsibility of carrying the reform through. However, I have to say that, under Mr Anderson's management, the process of reform has been an extremely tortuous one. The reason is simple—that is, a lack of leadership on his part. I hasten to add that the Australian Wheat Board reform is not the only area in the primary industry portfolio that has suffered from this problem. The reform of the meat industry, the reform of the export meat inspection service and the development of an effective management plan to deal with Ovine Johnes disease have also suffered badly from a lack of direction from the minister.
The debate within the industry over the future of the Australian Wheat Board has been a difficult one, and that is understandable. The industry is dealing with its future and is quite rightly concerned that the structure which is finally agreed to ensures that the future is sustainable. The biggest problem has not been the process of debate within the industry; it has been the fact that no-one really knows the detail of what the government will finally propose to parliament.
The legislative framework to implement this process was split into two bills. This parliament was asked to vote on, and the industry was asked to endorse, a privatised Australian Wheat Board with only half of the information on the table. But, despite the failing of the minister in the process, we are now at a point where the industry broadly supports a model which is acceptable to the government. There are still some concerns in Western Australia, as I understand it. The Labor Party will certainly look to the view of the industry when determining its position on the second tranche of legislation when that finally appears. I assume that industry support is subject to the detail contained in this second piece of legislation.
The industry support, however, is also subject to four key conditions. They are: that the articles of the Australian Wheat Board post-1999 contain a limit on the capital of the trading subsidiary of $100 million; that the articles of the Australian Wheat Board post- 
 1999 include three external directors elected by A-class shareholders to the board of the pool company subsidiary; that the taxation expectations of the Grains Council of Australia are granted in full by the government—and that has been a fundamental issue to the industry all the way along; and, that the preservation of cooperation principles in the pooling company are maintained.
I understand the Grains Council has advised the minister that support for the model as is currently presented will be withdrawn by all states if any of the above conditions are not met by the government. This is a matter now well and truly back on Mr Anderson's ministerial desk. It is his responsibility to address the above conditions required by the industry, and it is a matter for him to ensure that the second bill accurately reflects what the Australian industry rightly expects.
As with a number of other key policy areas, the minister has attempted to take a back seat on this important reform. He has argued that rural industries must determine their own destinies and, therefore, he should not involve himself. There is a big difference between interfering and leading. This minister, as well as a number of other ministers in this government, has a key role to play in the development of key rural industries such as wheat. It is about time he started exercising his responsibility.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Australian Wheat Board</title>,Documents,16,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,1998-03-24,"—I know it is months until we have Australia's greatest horse race, the Melbourne Cup. But there is another political race well under way, and the winner's prize is going to be equally glittering. Those taking part in the race are the aging thoroughbreds of the Australian Labor Party, and they are running in the Hypocrites Cup. These old stallions, the old bush brumbies, and a couple of fillies on the track as well, are lining up for the Telstra prize to be awarded to the most effective hypocrite on the field. They are still bunched up; they are each looking for a winning opening, but their collective equine mantra remains the same: privatisation is good when you are in government but bad when you are in opposition.
The stakes in this particular steeplechase are prized and the rewards for the first past the post are highly sought after. We are offering the prize—the opportunity to share in the ownership of our number one company Telstra. We want to give hundreds of Australian men and women a chance at that prize—to invest in our nation and to profit from that investment. Our plan has another benefit for all Australians. It is an historic opportunity to reduce government debt; to use the dollars from the sale to repay the massive debts left by one of the noisiest stallions on the field—the one from the West who has been spelling for a little too long in the front paddock.
The first partial sale of Telstra was so popular that even a couple of runners bought in—an Irish brumby and one of the more mature fillies, I am told. In fact, more than 14 per cent of Australian adults made a direct investment in the first sale of Telstra shares. 
 Many more invested indirectly through superannuation funds, trusts and managed investments. In November 1997, Telstra shares cost Australians $1.95 and they are now worth $3.94. That represents a 94 per cent profit—not a bad return in less than 12 months.
At least 90 per cent of the people who bought into Telstra still own those shares. In fact, 92 per cent of Telstra employees seized the opportunity last year to buy shares in their own company. Without doubt, many of them were members of the trade union that covers the communications industry. What a wise decision those people made.
The coalition is helping to create a nation of shareholders. We now live in a country where share ownership has soared to a record 40 per cent. More than 5½ million adult Australians now have a direct stake in the domestic share market. What an achievement. Unlike Labor, we are not selling off the farm overseas; we are selling it back to Australian companies, Australian families and Australian investment funds.
The initial one-third sale of Telstra was not only good for Australian shareholders, but the sale also financed the magnificent $1 billion Natural Heritage Trust fund—the largest environmental rescue package in Australia's history—and the $250 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to help regional Australia. Australia now has an increasingly competitive telecommunications industry, with better service and lower prices. People with families living in states distant from their homes can now make phone calls at greatly reduced prices. I was delighted that on St Patrick's Day Telstra was able to offer special rates to people to phone their families overseas. That was a very wise investment.
The Prime Minister has made it very clear that not only will the privatisation of the remainder of Telstra help people who choose to buy into it, but it will also yield a social bonus, the details of which are yet to be announced.
Despite the success of the initial float, those running in the Hypocrites Cup cannot tell us why they oppose the further sale of Telstra. One of the fillies was heard to say—but, importantly, it was said before this race got 
 under way and before she was stabled with the other runners—that it is pretty hard for them to sound credible on Telstra and difficult for them to carve out a positive reason for people to vote for them. She said that when she was in a smaller stable, before she joined the bunch which is on the field now.
I am not much of a punter myself but my money for the winner of the Hypocrites Cup is on the bulky stallion from the West, who was heard to say—again before the race even started—that he would cancel the whole darned thing and take the Telstra Prize back from the entire Australian community—he's got some chance of doing that! We know that the real winner in the Telstra race is the Australian community—the thousands of men and women who will again invest in our number one company and justifiably reap the rewards due to them from that decision.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Telstra: Privatisation</title>,Adjournment,17,1
