Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:07):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like the opportunity to make a statement.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Xenophon, are you seeking leave to make a statement?




Senator XENOPHON:
  I seek leave to make a statement, but I also need to seek leave to table a document as well.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  What's the document? We haven't seen it, Nick.




Senator XENOPHON:
  It is a letter from the minister.


Leave granted.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Thank you. I will make a short statement. Mr Acting Deputy President Fawcett, you are quite right, as a result of discussions I have had with the minister's office, I would like to inform my colleagues in this place that I will not be continuing with my amendments to these bills at this stage. I want to emphasise that this is not because I have altered my view on the need for these amendments; however, in deference to the fact that these bills need to pass this year I have reached agreement with the minister that I will move these amendments when the government introduces further anti-dumping legislation next year. I have a written agreement from Minister Clare that further debate on these amendments will be facilitated when the new bills are debated, which is likely to be in the first half of next year.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank the minister and his advisers for their time and assistance on these matters. These issues will not go away, but I also understand the imperative to deal with this legislation at this time. There is a raft of amendments that I will be moving with the next tranche of government bills relating to anti-dumping measures. I look forward to further debate on these issues and to further engagement with the minister's office, and indeed with the opposition and other key stakeholders, because this is a critical issue in terms of dumping, countervailing measures and the impact on our manufacturing industry. I table the letter from Minister Clare that I referred to, dated 26 November 2012.

Senator HUMPHRIES 

(
Australian Capital Territory
)
 (
13:29
)
:  I rise to speak on the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914, the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act 1979, the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, the Customs Administration Act 1985 and, for good measure, the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. On behalf of Senator Brandis, the shadow Attorney-General, I wish to note that the majority of Commonwealth law enforcement officers, whose behaviour and conduct is in a sense affected by this legislation, need to be recognised as honest, hardworking, good people who are dedicated to protecting their communities. However, it is a fact that criminals do target law enforcement officers due to the nature of their work as they have often obtained or have access to sensitive information, which makes them potential targets. Corrupt conduct can take many forms including improper association, conflict of interest, abuse of power or office, fabrication or destruction of evidence, inappropriate disclosure of information, theft and fraud. Some kinds of corrupt behaviour involve committing a criminal offence; however, other kinds of corruption, while not criminal, may still undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth law enforcement agency they work for. The coalition firmly believes that there should be zero tolerance for corruption in the public sector. We urge the government to take steps towards eradicating corruption which undermines the integrity of our agencies and their ability to achieve their mission to protect our communities and our borders.


Integrity tests are operations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a simulated or controlled situation in a manner that is illegal or would contravene an agency's standard of integrity. Examples of integrity testing include leaving valuable goods or money at a simulated crime scene to test whether an officer steals the item or, often, putting false information into a database to catch an officer suspected of unlawfully disclosing information. It is important to note that integrity testing is not entrapment or inducement. Entrapment is where an officer is induced to commit an offence they would not otherwise have committed, whereas the aim of integrity testing is to give an individual clear and equal opportunities to pass a test or to fail a test. It has been reassured to the coalition that the tests encompassed in this legislation will be carefully designed and carried out in a way which upholds this important distinction. The introduction of integrity testing at the Commonwealth level was recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity on 21 November 2011. In evidence provided to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the ACLEI inquiry, a number of issues associated with integrity testing were raised including cost, impact on morale, legal issues such as inducement and the effectiveness of integrity testing as an integrity measure.


The bill also makes significant changes to ACLEI's jurisdiction. Consequently, increased powers need to be thoroughly examined to ensure any privacy or use and disclosure of information issues are addressed appropriately. The Australian Federal Police Association, in their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee inquiry, noted:


It is commendable that the AFP executive is considering the implementation of an integrity testing regime at a time where there is no known widespread corruption in the organisation. This provides a stark contrast to the often cited example of wide-spread corruption in New York City during the 1980s and 1990s which lead Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to commission the Mollen report. The results of that report lead to targeted testing being adopted and soon thereafter it was consequently in every Australian state jurisdiction, including the Northern Territory. 


The coalition is of the firm view that, for the most part, our agencies are not plagued with widespread corruption. However, it is important to ensure Australia never approaches anything like the level of corruption seen in New York and other jurisdictions around the world.


The amendments contained in schedule 1 will firstly introduce targeted integrity testing for staff members of the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service suspected of corrupt conduct. Secondly, it will increase the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, ACLEI, to include CrimTrac, AUSTRAC and prescribed staff at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.


The purpose of schedule 2 is to enhance the powers of the CEO of the Customs Service to deal with suspected corrupt conduct and to bring those powers in line with powers currently available to the AFP Commissioner and the Australian Crime Commission CEO.


I want to expand upon the amendment in schedule 1, which is to introduce integrity testing for the Customs Service. In their submission to the Senate inquiry, the Customs Service said:


Having regard to the significant increase of Customs and Border Protection's role at the border, in controlling the import of prohibited items including weapons and drugs, access to highly sensitive and classified information and working closely with other law enforcement agencies. The consequences of corruption or misconduct in connection with the service's law enforcement role are very serious. 


I have to say that it is a shame that this Labor government has not seen fit to couple this legislation with an increase in funding for our Customs Service to help them perform these integral duties such as controlling the import of illicit drugs. In the 2008-09 budget Labor cut $58.1 million in funding for customs cargo inspections. As a result, customs has been placed under great pressure and have been asked to do more with less—putting customs officers at risk of being vulnerable to being used by organised criminal syndicates.


In March this year, Customs were unable to detect 220 guns which were smuggled into Sydney through the Sylvania Waters post office, which is in the electorate of the shadow minister for immigration, Mr Morrison. New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione called this alleged smuggling operation 'perhaps the biggest illegal syndicate doing this type of illegal gun trafficking that Australia has seen'. However, this Labor government refused to refer this incident to a specific inquiry into either Customs or Australia Post. Labor refused to ask themselves the hard questions about the effects that their damaging budget cuts have had on our border and law enforcement agencies. I ask the question: how can the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Jason Clare, continually deny that the $58.1 million cut in funding that Labor implemented, stripping air and sea cargo screening of valuable resources, has contributed to illegal weapons being smuggled across our border and into our communities. 


Air cargo inspections have dropped from 60 per cent under the former Howard government to a dismal 8.3 per cent under this Labor government. With these kinds of drastic cuts to cargo screening, illicit drugs and weapons are flowing through with ease onto our streets and into the hands of organised criminal syndicates. Customs, in their submission to the Senate committee, also noted: 


This measure was formerly referred to as 'loss of confidence'. This terminology has been changed to better reflect the intent of the legislation and provide assurance to workers and the community as to how this power will be implemented. 


If Labor were serious about the integrity of our borders, they would stop the spin and look to reinstate the damaging funding cuts which they have made to the Customs Service and which are damaging the integrity of our borders. That would be an appropriate response to the present situation. 


Let me conclude by saying that the coalition takes the issue of corruption very seriously and supports efforts to prevent corruption in Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. Corruption and abuse of power not only are threats to Australia's national security but also compromise the trust the community has in the role of those vital agencies. The coalition supports the bill in principle and supports measures to eradicate corruption in the public sector but recognises that more than simply passing a bill of this kind needs to occur to make our fight against those things more tangible and more effective. It is with those reservations that I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-11-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (13:39):  I rise to make some brief remarks in support of the Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. Last year, I was privileged to sit as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity that considered the possible introduction of a law enforcement integrity testing framework. Many of the submissions to that inquiry supported the introduction of integrity testing within certain Commonwealth law enforcement agencies such as the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. They were all supportive of the concept of introducing integrity testing. That committee inquiry and report considered integrity testing as an important investigative tool and one of the many measures that may be in place to combat infiltration by organised crime groups and corrupt conduct in law enforcement agencies. 


Integrity testing provides another tool for combating corruption. As one stakeholder said:


It will not be a panacea and it will not be the right method for every agency or in every instance; however, for the right situations, it will be useful to have the ability to conduct integrity testing.


This bill seeks to implement the recommendations of that committee, which investigated this concept thoroughly—namely, that targeted integrity testing be applied to Commonwealth law enforcement agencies to increase resistance and respond to corruption. The bill does this in a way that maintains oversight and accountability for such integrity testing, which is extremely important. For example, agencies will be required to notify the Integrity Commissioner as soon as practicable after the authorisation of each integrity test. In addition, the Ombudsman maintains powers under relevant legislation to inspect records of controlled operations, surveillance device warrants and authorisations and occasions where information obtained through covert powers is used or communicated. This will include records made in relation to integrity tests. For these reasons, the Australian Greens support the passage of this bill this year.

Senator BOB CARR
 (New South Wales—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (13:42):  I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I would like to thank as well the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its inquiry into the bill and its recommendation that it be passed by the Senate. 


The Law Enforcement Integrity Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 will ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the powers they need to prevent, detect and investigate corruption. It will allow for officers of the Australian Federal Police, Australian Crime Commission and Customs suspected of corruption to be subject to targeted integrity testing. I am familiar with this principle, having introduced it into the New South Wales Police Force after the Wood royal commission. It was a big step, back in the mid-nineties, and of course raises the question of entrapment or provocation, but properly oversighted it is an indispensable weapon in detecting and eliminating corruption. 


The bill expands the jurisdiction of ACLEI to include all staff in the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre and CrimTrac and prescribed staff in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It increases the power of the CEO of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. We know that most of our law enforcement officers are honest, hardworking individuals, but it is an unfortunate fact that all systems can be penetrated by officers not so motivated or not so characterised. Therefore, we need to ensure that we have the right legislation and the right frameworks in place to identify corruption where it occurs, to weed it out and to prevent it in the first place. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:02):  Mr Deputy President, on 22 November 2012 during question time, Senator Whish-Wilson asked me several questions as Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Minister Bourke has provided the following answers to the Senate as questions, and I seek to leave to incorporate.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—





Question



1. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water! Is the minister aware of media reports that Seafish Tasmania is allegedly looking at options to fish the small pelagic fishery quota with a large, 90-metre factory freezer trawler? Has the minister or his department met with Seafish Tasmania Pty Ltd in regard to a new trawler with different specifications to the FV Abel Tasman operating in the Australian small pelagic fishery?




Response



1. The Minister and officers from the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities have met with Seafish Tasmania representatives on two occasions — 21 August 2012 and 11 October 2012. At the second of those meetings, Seafish Tasmania sought to raise alternative proposals and the Minister asked them to put any alternative proposals in writing.


The Minister is aware of the media reports and can confirm that the company has written to the Minister seeking guidance on two proposals; one to modify the Abel Tasman; the second to use a smaller factory trawler.


The Minister has written to the company seeking further information about its proposals as they may raise uncertainty about the environmental impacts.




Question



2. Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Minister. Are you aware that the definition of a 'specific vessel' in the final declaration of 2012 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, section 390SF, provides a conspicuous loophole for operators to execute commercial fishing activities with the same or potentially even greater uncertainty about the environmental impacts as the supertrawler FV Abe/ Tasman? Was this loophole your intention?




Response



2. The final declaration relied upon each of the elements specified in the new laws passed by the Parliament.


In order to make the final declaration, the Environment and Fisheries ministers had to agree that:


1. there was uncertainty about the environmental impacts of the commercial fishing activity


2. that it was appropriate to establish an expert panel to conduct an assessment of the environmental impacts of the commercial fishing activity, and


3. that the commercial fishing activity should be prohibited while the expert panel conducts the assessment.


The final declaration was made because there is uncertainty about the environmental impacts of large mid-water trawlers operating in the Small Pelagic Fishery that are greater than 130 metres in length, have on-board processing facilities and have storage capacity for fish or fish products of over 2000 tonnes.


It was not the Minister's intention to ban all new commercial fishing in Australian waters.


If there is uncertainty about other new commercial fishing activities, then these too may be subject to a declaration and therefore prohibited while an assessment is undertaken. It was the Minister who initiated the legislation because of concern about the potential environmental impacts.




Question



3. Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. Thank you again, Minister. Can the minister indicate whether the expert panel to conduct an assessment of the commercial fishing activity in question and report on the matter will be appointed? Will the minister ensure that the expert panel will contain genuinely independent members who are not receiving a pecuniary benefit from the commercial fishing industry and consult with all stakeholders, including recreational fishers and conservationists, before reporting on the matter?




Response



3. The Minister has asked his Department for advice about membership of the expert panel. The expert panel will be independent. The Minister has asked his Department to prepare draft terms of reference in consultation with Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry before he formally consults the Fisheries Minister on the terms of reference, as required under the legislation. The terms of reference will set out the matters to be assessed by the panel and provide guidance on how the assessment should be undertaken. Its role is to provide expert advice on the potential environmental impacts of the declared commercial fishing activity.


There will be transparency in this process of scientific assessment about environmental impacts.


The views of stakeholders informed the Government's decision to initiate the legislation.

You know a government is embarrassed by its failures when the relevant minister in question time refuses to confirm what are facts that are put to her and in fact the minister actually says in relation to a question that I asked, 'I cannot confirm what Senator Cash is saying.' She then went on to say that she completely rejected the premise of my question. All I can say to that is that the minister is clearly so embarrassed by her government's failures that she wanted to 'take me to task' in relation to the undisputed fact that, under the former Howard government in the 2002-03 financial year, the number of boats that arrived was zero and the number of people who arrived was zero.


Perhaps the minister could explain, when she next answers one of my questions, why she was taking me to task in relation to that fact. This is a government that continually says to the people of Australia, 'We want to stop the boats.' I would have thought that you would actually celebrate the fact that you can, as a government, implement policies that do as this government tells the people of Australia it wants to do. It is a fact, even if Senator Lundy would not confirm it—that five years ago when the Howard government left office there were four people in detention. That is an undisputed fact. It is also a fact, even if Senator Lundy did not want to confirm it, that now more than 2,000 people attempt to enter this country—in fact, they do not attempt; they do enter this country—illegally under the current government's policies. It is also a fact—again, even if Senator Lundy is too embarrassed to confirm it—that there are now more than 12,000 people in detention; and, because there are more than 12,000 people in detention the government has had to adopt a policy of actually releasing the thousands that are still there into the community. For a government that says that it wants to stop the boats—I have to say, based on their record to date, that 30,408 people have arrived on 521 boats—there are two possible scenarios that arise. You actually do not mean what mean what you say—and there is a very good chance that that is actually true given that this government is the government that said to the people of Australia, prior to the 2010 election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


So maybe they actually do not mean it. Alternatively—this is probably the more likely scenario—the Gillard Labor government are truly incapable of securing Australia's borders. To add insult to injury, more than half of the 30,408 people who have arrived in Australia have arrived under the Gillard Labor government. Former Prime Minister Rudd, former Minister for Foreign Affairs Rudd and nearly now backbencher Mr Kevin Rudd must quite literally choke on his Wheaties in the morning. He must choke because one of the reasons that was given by the Labor caucus at the time for having to politically execute Mr Rudd was, as stated by Ms Gillard, that 'Mr Rudd had fundamentally failed when it came to border protection in Australia', and as a result Mr Rudd had to lose his job and be sent to the backbench.


If Mr Rudd had failed in his responsibility to properly secure Australia's borders, I really do not know the turn of phrase that the Australian public would use when it comes to Ms Gillard. It is a fact that the former Howard government stopped the boats. So those on the other side cannot say that they cannot implement policies that do not stop the boats. I want to read into the Hansard record these figures: 2002-03, zero boats, zero people; 2004-05, zero boats, zero people; 2006-07, four boats, 133 people. Governments can stop the boats. The former Howard government did, but those on the other side just do not have the political backbone— (Time expired)

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (15:07):  I rise to take note of answers by Minister Lundy on the government's asylum seeker policy. I firstly need to take umbrage at the continual use of the terms 'illegal arrivals' and 'illegal immigrants' and the like. In using these terms, the opposition show their true colours in this debate. They highlight that they are interested only in perpetuating the fear of the unknown that unfortunately abounds in sections of our community. This government is committed to continuing to break the people-smuggling trade. We are committed to stopping people from getting on boats to make a very dangerous journey to Australia, and we are committed to an orderly migration program. 


The government sought to implement the Malaysia agreement but this place voted it down. We then moved to seek recommendations from an expert panel chaired by former Chief of Defence Force Angus Houston. The Houston report includes numerous pieces of evidence gathered by the trio who worked on that inquiry. Air Chief Marshal Houston, Mr Aristotle and Professor L'Estrange provided clear recommendations to the parliament in their report. The government said at the time of announcing the review that to break the policy impasse it would accept the recommendations of this review in full. This has seen the government work through an extraordinarily difficult process, looking at thousands of people in need, people seeking help from a rich country like Australia—and those opposite seek to demonise these people. 


The Houston inquiry report recommended action that was very different from what was put forward by the Pacific solution. The report drew clear differentiation between what happened in the past and what their recommendations said. The government committed to come back into this place and implement what was said in the Houston inquiry report. Senators need to pay close attention to the whole of the Houston inquiry report. They need to look closely at all of the recommendations as a package, as a process to achieving regional cooperation, as a process to stopping people from getting on leaky boats and risking their lives and as a process to increasing Australia's humanitarian intake of refugees. We have committed to implementing the recommendations as a suite, and we continue to do so. It has been constantly stated that you cannot just choose elements of the recommendations. You cannot pick and choose the politically expedient ones. You have got to look at all the processes, all the steps, and you have got to ensure that they work together. You cannot just explain three specific policies as being the silver bullets to this difficult policy issue. 


Labor will continue to look at the issues of those who seek asylum and will work to ensure that people are treated with dignity and respect. In doing so, we want to remove the incentives for these people to take the decision to go onto these dangerous boats, to leave their place of refuge and face an unknown future—but this process will need to have the commitment of all people in this parliament. We need to appreciate the desperation of the people who are caught up in the horror of seeking asylum. What those opposite seek to do is to demonise people who are seeking asylum. 


On that note, I congratulate the producers of the television series Go Back to Where You Came From. This show had six high-profile Australians, including former coalition Minister for Defence Mr Peter Reith. The six Australians faced intense danger on the streets of some of the world's most dangerous cities. Three were taken to Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and the other three were taken to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. All six experienced time inside the walls of the Christmas Island detention centre. All six took part in a voyage, south from the Indonesian coastline, on a wooden fishing boat. But, most importantly, this show put these six high-profile Australians in direct contact with asylum seekers in Australia and across the world. It showed the desperation of these people, who want a better life, free from persecution. It showed that the baseless attacks from many of those opposite on these people can be combatted—combatted through conversation, through basic dialogue about humanity. The desperation of the people who take to these boats is admitted across the board. 


The government is committed to a process that seeks to break the trade of the people smugglers. That is why we commissioned the Houston report. We are seeking to implement the suite of its recommendations to achieve a regional framework for assisting refugees. We need to stop the dangerous rhetoric of turning back the boats. (Time expired)

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2012-11-27,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:12):  I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Lundy to questions asked by Senator Cash. I have to note that, as I was looking at Senator Lundy, as I do many of those opposite as they speak about border protection—I am a great observer of people—I think I have got the answer. It has taken me a long time but I think it is one of those presentations by people who are often confronted by their own inadequacies—and that is denial. Denial is quite a well-known and well-written about presentation, and certainly the senator opposite, in terms of her answers to the questions, was presenting that. 


I suppose it is something that really can be applied throughout the Labor Party and particularly to those ministers who have been responsible for this appalling failure in border protection. When they have been basically staring their failures in the face, I have often wondered why they have not moved to change their place. It is probably a little bit like Alcoholics Anonymous in this regard when people are continually in denial that they in fact have a problem with grog. 


The Labor Party—and this time it concerns Senator Lundy—should simply stand and declare: 'I now know that our border control policies are a complete failure.' Unless you can declare that you have got it so badly wrong, you will not move out of denial. When you move out of denial, you can heal thyself. You can start looking at alternative lifestyles and, in this case, alternative policies. But every time I come into this place people stand up and say, 'No, it's all okay.' We have just heard from the good senator, and she says, 'There are ebbs and flows.' That is not bad! The ebb was when we had no boats under the previous government, and now we have their flows. That is a term of denial. I have a few drinks! The flows are 512 vessels. That—unremarkably, probably—is twice the size of the Spanish Armada. Those vessels have suddenly arrived when they are saying, 'Oh, there's bit of a flow, a couple of boats—not really too much to worry about.' Sadly, I do not really think you are going to change anything unless you get over it.


Perhaps they should just consider a bit of a list. This is their policy approach and how they go. Since the Malaysian announcement—we can remember that—there have been 279 boats, and 18,000 people arrived. I am not sure how that went for you, but I do not really think you could give that a bit of a tick as working. We then had the signing of the Malaysian deal on 25 July. Since then 286 boats have arrived, carrying 18,389 people.




Senator McLucas:
  You didn't support the Malaysian deal. That's why. You didn't support the Malaysian deal.




Senator SCULLION:
  No, that was your answer. I will take the interjection. That was your answer, and as a consequence of that policy another 18,000 people arrived on boats. Don't be in denial. Accept it. It is the way. Accept that you have completely failed. Then you can actually get better at it.


I can tell those senators on the other side that tragically it goes on. Remember when, on 25 November 2011, you decided to make the bridging visa announcement: 'That'll fix it.' We said, 'Look, you really need a whole suite of things.' Two hundred and sixty-four boats have arrived since that announcement. It does not sound to me as if it is stopping too much. It does not sound as if it is stopping anything at all. Nothing that is associated with your policy has stopped the boats and the misery associated with them. Again, we have had another crack on: 'We've decided that we'll do the single-assessment system. We'll bring in the single-assessment system on 24 March.' How did that work for you? Another 233 vessels, with 14,496 people. I do not think that is working for me. I do not know about you, but it does not appear that that is something that is really going to change anything at all.


Sadly, to once again get the sort of response we have had from the other side is just a presentation of denial unless you change your policies significantly. I think we have been pretty open-hearted about this. We have offered policies that work. We have simply said, 'Adopt the entire suite of policies from the Howard government, who had zero people and zero boats'—not a bad thing to aim for. I think it is quite reasonable. Our claim to stop the boats and the misery, of course, is based on good policy, and I think that we will not accept that those on the other side have any idea about how to control our borders through good policy unless they first of all stand and say, 'I have failed.'

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  Senator Lundy did reject the premise of the question put by Senator Cash, and rightly so, because the premise of that question was incredibly wrong. Temporary protection visas under the Howard government did not work. Their system of temporary protection visas did not work, so the minister, Senator Lundy, was correct in rejecting that premise. But the sad, sad thing about taking note of this issue on immigration policy is the fact that there are those opposite that simply cannot recognise that there are some things that are more important than political wins or political losses, however you want to look at it, and this is one of those issues that are more important than political wins, because it is about humanity. It is about people's lives, and therefore it is the responsibility of every member of parliament and every senator to forget about the politics and look at ways in which we can work together to ensure that we get a good outcome so that, yes, people do not drown at sea, risking their lives trying to find a safe haven to live in into their futures.


We know that in the past eight months or so something like 300 people have drowned attempting to make that dangerous voyage to Australia. So of course we do not want people to do that, because we do care for the basis of humanity: that people can live a safe life and, of course, be able to seek asylum in Australia—something that is legal, not illegal. The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, and those opposite continue to like to use that kind of absolutely appalling language, as though they are not talking about human beings. We are talking about human beings, and we are talking about humanity. That is why we have received the Houston report and accepted the recommendations provided in that report, because we know that we need to rise above claiming these kinds of political victories that have been thrown about through slogans like 'We're going to stop the boats' in the past of those opposite. We need, bluntly, to concede that the Houston report praises some aspects and rejects or criticises other aspects of both government policy and the opposition's policy. The fact is that we need to reach a compromise to stop the people that have drowned and the ongoing potential of people drowning at sea. So we recognise that, and that is why we have accepted the report and accepted that we need a broad-ranging approach to immigration policy in this country.


We are up for it, for tackling this tough policy issue, unlike those opposite, who do not want to find a solution but instead want to continue to throw politics at this issue. It is a difficult issue. It is an emotive issue because you are dealing with human beings, you are dealing with people's lives. But we do not want to demonise people, to call them 'illegals', or to use slogans to encapsulate important immigration policy for this country. We want to get into the detail, into the nitty-gritty, into the important facets needed to ensure that we have a robust, broad and all-encompassing immigration policy in this country for those who seek asylum and for those who come by other means. That is why we have accepted the Houston report. You cannot cherry-pick that report, picking one bit of their policy and leaving out the rest. We have taken it and accepted it as a whole.


We need to remember that since that report the Australian humanitarian program has been increased to 20,000, the largest increase in 30 years. I am proud of that fact. Australia is now the leading resettlement country globally per capita, which is a very good thing, and it is the first time that has happened in 30 years. It never happened under the Howard government. We now have the increase in place to ensure we are addressing some of the important issues for those risking their lives, which we do not want to continue to happen. (Time expired)

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (15:23):  I was going to begin on a very positive note and share with the Senate the contribution that the Leader of the Liberal Party and of the coalition set out this morning at our regular party meeting. But, before I do that, let me make this very clear response to Senator Singh's comments: you do not do humanity or human beings any justice by encouraging them, or the people smugglers who would like to benefit from the trade in their hope or their search for a better life, with a set of policy prescriptions that only encourage them to travel dangerous distances over dangerous seas to our shores. Labor's conscience is rightly bruised by this shameful policy approach it has taken to protecting our borders—a policy approach that has failed.


On a more uplifting note to begin my contribution to this debate, it was pleasing this morning at our regular party meeting for Tony Abbott to use the last opportunity in this session for a meeting of coalition members and senators to recommit himself and our party to build a better life for the Australian people, to build a better life for the forgotten families of our country. In his very eloquent speech he committed the coalition to a positive plan to deliver a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. Not surprisingly, and in response to the very many calls Australians have made of their coalition representatives, he committed himself to securing our borders, to stopping the boats by putting in place policies that we know can work in the future because they have worked in the past.


We have heard this afternoon that this government is 'committed' to breaking the people-smuggling trade, to slowing down illegal arrivals and to putting in place an orderly immigration program. But, I am sorry, commitment is not enough. What the community want is real, effective action. They are not seeing that from this government. What they want to see is a policy program that delivers results; a policy program that will work because it has been proven to work in the past.


We heard from Senator Lundy about the 'ebb and flow' of illegal arrivals in our country as somehow excusing this government's failure to secure Australia's borders. I think that, instead, 'ebb and flow' better describes the government's policy thinking: its indecision, its poor policy choices of the past and its constant failing when it comes to protecting our borders. Please! We also heard from one government senator that the government can defend its policy failure, defend the arrivals of thousands of illegal immigrants on hundreds of boats, by talking up a television series. The virtues of a television series are now being used to defend the government's poor policy making on border protection.


Hardly a day goes by without another boat arriving to remind Australians, as if they needed reminding, that this government has comprehensively botched the management of our borders. On Saturday we marked—I deliberately do not use the word 'celebrated' but, rather, marked—five years since Labor won office. Looked at another way, this means it is five years since Australia had in place a suite of comprehensive, effective policy measures that actually stopped the boats. The Howard government had solved the problem, thanks to its tough stance and its use of temporary protection visas. People had ceased risking their lives by making the dangerous boat journey to Australia. But, as we all know, this Labor government took a solution and created a problem.


When the Rudd government won office there were just four—the same number as there were in the Beatles; the same number as there are seasons—just one, two, three, four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat. Five years later, that number is around 12,000. We have approximately 2,000 people arriving by boat every month, and this government has no earthly idea what to do about it.


Recall the sorry history: the Prime Minister seized the leadership from Kevin Rudd because, she said, this was one of the big three issues she was going to fix. She started by launching her East Timor solution. She then moved on to the Malaysia solution. Alas, the Prime Minister failed again, that one shot down by the High Court. (Time expired)

The speech read as follows—



FAIR WORK (REGISTERED ORGANISATIONS) AMENDMENT (TOWARDS TRANSPARENCY) BILL 2012


The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Towards Transparency) Bill 2012 will amend the Fair Work Registered Organisations Act 2009 to improve protection for the hundreds of thousands of members who belong to these organisations, by strengthening the financial disclosure rules, enshrining higher duties for officers, and increasing penalties to provide a genuine deterrent against misuse of position and power.


In April this year the Coalition released a Plan for Better Transparency and Accountability of Registered Organisations. This plan is designed to protect the interests of Australians who join trade unions or employer associations.


The Coalition's plan will improve standards of governance and financial accountability by, among other things, aligning the rules for registered organisations more closely with the laws that exist for companies under the Corporations Act 2001.


The worst aspect of the ongoing HSU scandal is that 70,000 low paid workers had their hard-earned money misspent by union officials on political campaigns and escort services. Earlier this year, Fair Work Australia found that HSU officials had used union members' money for personal advantage, failed to act in the best interest of members, and breached financial management rules.


Since that time the list of scandals, revelations, and unanswered questions involving some registered organisations has continued to grow. It is clear that real change is needed now.


This bill will give effect to three key elements of our policy:


To ensure that financial reports are lodged on time and in compliance with the relevant provisions of the RO Act by clarifying circumstances where a report is non-compliant, and increasing the penalty for late filing and non-compliance;


To deter malfeasance by creating new penalties for organisations, their officers and employees who do not act in good faith, or use their position or information, to directly or indirectly create a financial gain for themselves or someone else to the detriment of the organisation; and


To deter non-compliance with court orders by creating new penalties for organisations, their officers and employees who do not comply with the order of a court.


This will provide a genuine deterrent against misuse of position and power.


Registered organisations are a central part of the Fair Work regime and they must operate to the highest of standards. The Coalition believes that the members of registered organisations deserve transparent and accountable representation. Australian workers who join trade unions deserve to know that their membership fees are being used for proper purposes.


The Coalition's bill should be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of registered organisations and their officers who do the right thing and have nothing to hide from their members.


The Coalition calls on the Government to support this bill.


If the Government refuses to support this bill, it will be further evidence that Labor under Ms Gillard is not committed to the good governance of employer associations and unions.

Senator FIFIELD:
  The coalition oppose this motion because we do not believe that it is the path to peace and reconciliation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Our concern is that the drive for greater recognition at the United Nations is an attempt by the Palestinian leaders to internationalise the conflict by bringing action against Israel through various international courts. This is likely to escalate and prolong the conflict rather than lead to a resolution of disputes. The only path to peace is for the Palestinian leadership to officially recognise the right of Israel to exist and to halt the firing of rockets and mortars as part of a campaign by militants to terrorise and kill Israeli citizens. Australia has long supported the two-state solution and the right of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to live peacefully and in safety within internationally recognised borders. We urge both sides to resume negotiations towards a lasting peace in the region.

That the Senate take note of the statement on the apology to people subjected to sexual or other forms of abuse in Defence.


I make this statement on behalf of my friend Senator David Johnston, the shadow minister for defence, who is unable to be in the Senate today. The coalition offer our strong and unqualified support to the government as it offers a formal apology to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have suffered abuse in the course of their service to our nation.


Ours is a unique fighting force, a small but potent military that has delivered a disproportionate effect upon every battlefield upon which it has fought. We have a rich military history and can rightfully hold our heads high in the concert of nations when it comes to defending freedom. Our history of military endeavour is second to none. Yet, despite our overwhelming battlefield success, there have been a flood of complaints, some going back to the 1950s, of abuse within the ranks. By any standard, the litany of abuse allegations is completely unacceptable, let alone by the standards of the finest fighting force in the world, the ADF. This conduct does not accord with the values of our society, let alone the values of our military. Our military is a disciplined force; however, the DLA Piper review has made it clear that there have been elements and individuals within the ADF that have abused their power or position and inflicted abuse on those who sought only to serve our nation.


We deeply sympathise with and say sorry to those who have experienced abuse at the hands of those who were to be trusted with their leadership and care. This was a great betrayal. This abuse should never have happened. Every effort must be made to ensure that it does not happen again. Our military must train hard and fight hard, but, as they do, we must not allow our men and women to suffer abuse in any form. This is not who we are as a country and it is certainly not who we are as a military. Abuse destroys lives, limits our operational capability and undermines public confidence in our military.


We are at our best when we pause and walk in the shoes of others and reflect on their experiences, acknowledge their pain and then commit to right that which is wrong. That is the start of the process. Accordingly, the government enjoys the full support of the coalition as it establishes its Defence abuse task force. We will provide every support to the senior defence leadership and we have faith in their capacity to work with the task force both to assist it in its work and to implement its recommendations. The coalition stands with the government with an absolute commitment to care for all of those who care for us.

We note that Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, referring to the inquiry she led into the treatment of women in the Australian Defence Force, said:


…by its nature, the ADF is a workplace involving inherent risks.


Experiencing sexual misconduct, harassment, bullying, victimisation and sexual abuse, however, should never be one of them. The reality is that sexual harassment and abuse exists today in the ADF.


The Greens commit to giving the government what support it needs to make sure this inquiry has the power it needs to establish what happened, why it was able to happen and what must be done to ensure it never happens again as well as to enforce recommendations.


Determining the facts of individual cases and compensating the victims is important, but it cannot end there. We must make the changes necessary to protect the people who join the defence forces from this kind of horrendous treatment in the future.


Concern that compensation has been capped at the seemingly arbitrary figure of $50,000 per case is something that we share with some of the victims' groups. We urge the government to reconsider that element and we hope that in the course of the inquiry that might be something that is able to be reconsidered. However, we do take on board the fact that at least the government has made a commitment to compensation in this regard.


We want to ensure that broader issues about the Defence justice and complaints system and the Defence culture are able to be pursued, even if that is separately—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! It being 4 pm, the debate is interrupted pursuant to an order made by the Senate earlier today.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:00):  I rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012. The Australian Greens support the aims and objectives of this bill, in particular the unification of the National Privacy Principles and the Information Privacy Principles into the new Australian Privacy Principles that apply to both Commonwealth agencies and private sector organisations.


The bill amends the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988. It has been developed following numerous reviews and inquiries, which have included significant consultations with stakeholders. However, as was pointed out during this inquiry process, the reforms have been a long time coming. For example, this is the first major reform to credit reporting since its introduction in the 1990s. While there was majority support for the contents of this bill amongst stakeholders, some concerns were expressed that although the bill did improve on the current position—that is because it is an important step towards that goal of harmonisation and simplification—it could not necessarily be said that it was an enhancement. Indeed, during the Senate committee inquiry into the bill three different stakeholders expressed some concerns that this bill was a missed opportunity and it did not go far enough in either streamlining provisions or in providing consumers and citizens with better protections.


Changes to Australian law to modernise, strengthen and streamline privacy and credit reporting provisions are important. In doing this we need to be careful that we strike the right balance between privacy rights and the free flow of information. The Australian Greens strongly support the strengthening of Australian law to ensure enhanced compatibility with our obligations under international human rights law. As a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, Australia has an obligation to promote and protect the right to privacy. Indeed, article 17 of the ICCPR provides that:


1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his—


And I use that word advisedly; it is slightly anachronistic—


privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. 


2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. 


In signing up to the ICCPR Australia has agreed to take all the necessary steps to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.


We agree with the findings and recommendations made in the committee report, and we made some additional comments directed at improving consumer protection and privacy rights. We acknowledge that the government has agreed to implement many of those changes and is putting forward amendments today. However, we feel that a couple of additional changes should be made to improve consumer protections. I will turn to these now.


In relation to proposed paragraph 6Q(1), the Australian Greens would have preferred to go further than what was recommended by the Senate committee. We are of the view that a default listing should not occur until at least 30 days after a default notice has been given. In practical terms that gives a borrower sufficient time to receive the notice, which may be subject to the vagaries of the post, contact the credit provider and/or try to rectify a default before a listing can be made, and is consistent with other credit laws. This recommendation was made in the inquiry by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre NSW. The Consumer Credit Legal Centre submitted that the current provisions in the bill essentially enabled a credit provider to list a default immediately after issuing written notice to an individual, and submitted that this is procedurally unfair as it is the notice that is important in notifying the consumer that there actually is a default. It is more than possible to be unaware of the default simply because there was a bank error in direct debits—that is given as an example.


The Consumer Credit Legal Centre has significant expertise in providing consumer assistance advocacy and representation. It sees how these sorts of legal provisions work in practice and how they can impact on, particularly, vulnerable Australians. I think it is important that we respect this expertise and on-the-ground knowledge, which often speaks on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Credit Legal Centre recommended that the bill should be amended to require 30 days to have elapsed from the date of the written notice, before listing can occur, to avoid unintended and unfair consequences.


The submission of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network also suggested that a listing should not occur until the credit provider has made 'reasonable attempts' to contact the debtor and has provided a specific warning regarding the default listing.


We recognise the practical reality for consumers who face financial strain, and we think that it is important they are provided with sufficient notice about overdue payments and the consequences of failing to pay such overdue payments. For this reason we support the recommendation by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre that the bill should be amended to require 30 days to have elapsed from the date of the written notice, before a default listing occurs. For that reason the Australian Greens will be moving an amendment to that effect.


We also support he recommendations made by consumer advocates that the threshold minimum amount for which a consumer credit default listing can be made should be increased. During the Senate committee inquiry stakeholders also suggested that the threshold overdue amount that gives rise to a default listing was unrealistic. The Energy and Water Ombudsman NSW, the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre advocated for increasing the overdue amount from $100 to $300. The purpose of increasing the threshold overdue amount is to exclude small utility bills from the adverse consequences of credit listing. It also recognises increases in costs of living over recent years.


The Australian Greens agree that there should be an amendment to reflect recent changes in the cost of living and we suggest that the threshold amount be changed from $100 to $150. We also note that there is provision in the bill for a higher amount to be prescribed by regulation, which provides flexibility in responding to consumer concerns and cost-of-living increases down the track when $150 is not sufficient. However, we think that this minor change goes some way towards a more realistic situation. We feel that these changes will improve consumer protections in the Privacy Act.


During the inquiry process we noted that some concerns were raised by consumer advocates that the amendment to the definition of 'serious credit infringement' would not address the serious problems that this definition currently creates. As serious credit infringement is, apart from bankruptcy, the most serious type of listing that can be made—and it will ordinarily remain on a credit report for seven years—it is very significant and has substantial ramifications for individuals. For these reasons, consumer advocates such as the Consumer Action Law Centre, considered that it is essential that such listings are proportionate to the type of credit infringement and are accurate and based on clear evidence. The Consumer Action Law Centre, CALC, expressed concerns with the amendment to the bill that requires that a serious credit infringement cannot be listed unless six months has elapsed since the credit provider last had contact with the debtor. It appears that the intent of this change is to ensure that credit providers attempt to make contact with the debtor so as to avoid an incorrect listing. By its intent, the amendment seeks to enhance consumer protections. However, as CALC points out, there is no guarantee that this amendment will achieve its purported aim as the credit provider is not required to be proactive and attempt to make contact. The only requirement is that the credit provider waits six months before listing a serious credit infringement.


CALC referred to a previous submission by consumer advocates and recommended that the definition of 'serious credit infringement' should be replaced with two new definitions: 'uncontactable default' and a 'never paid flag'. The Australian Greens gave serious consideration to this stakeholder recommendation. We considered it in detail in our additional comments and raised it with the government. However, we are not satisfied that the recommendation could be adequately implemented so as to take into account instances where there was intentional fraud, and we were of the view that, practically speaking, it was not appropriate to remove the fraud from the definition of 'serious credit infringement'. We do however understand the concerns raised by stakeholders and we will endeavour to follow up with them as to how this could be reconsidered in the future.


Finally, we note that, during the inquiry process, significant concerns were raised by the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre regarding the lack of determinations that have been made under section 52 of the act. As a result of this history, the Australian Privacy Foundation, the APF, is apprehensive about the effectiveness of new reform under section 96, which provides a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions by the commissioner to make a determination of a complaint under section 52(1) or 52(1A). In its view, this new right of appeal is of little use unless complainants can require the commissioner to make formal decisions under section 52 of the act. It recommends that the Privacy Commissioner should be required to make a determination under section 52 wherever a complainant so requests and for complainants to be informed that they are entitled to such a formal resolution of their complaint.


The Australian Law Reform Commission, the ALRC, in its Report 108: for your information: Australian privacy law and practice,made a similar recommendation in 2009. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner provideda supplementary submission to the inquiry and noted that the government specifically rejected the recommendation of the ALRC in 2009 on the ground that, as an independent statutory officer, the Australian Information Commissioner should be responsible for exercising the administrative decision-making powers under the Privacy Act. We understand the tension here and the importance of promoting and respecting the independence of the OAIC, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, and we believe that it would be prudent for the government to reconsider this matter and conduct a review of the functions and powers of the OAIC in relation to its system for managing complaints, conciliations and determinations. In our additional comments to the Senate committee, we recommended that, 12 months after the enactment of the bill, the government should conduct a review into the effectiveness of the OAIC's system for managing complaints, conciliations and determinations because, if there is a right to appeal against a determination but no determination is made, essentially there is no right of appeal.


The Australian Greens take an interest in ensuring that the privacy rights of Australians are adequately promoted and protected and we will be monitoring the impact and effectiveness of this bill when it becomes law. While we have some concerns with this bill, overall we feel that it improves and streamlines privacy laws and we support its passage. We note that the government is introducing some amendments which respond to many recommendations put forward by the Senate committee and we will be putting forward our own amendments. On this basis, we support the passage of this bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-11-27,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:13):  I indicate my support for the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012, with amendments. I believe it makes a number of important and necessary changes in relation to privacy law in Australia. However, I would like to express my concerns in relation to the credit reporting provisions in this bill. I agree that Australia needs a strong and robust credit reporting system. I know that some organisations have concerns about privacy in relation to disclosing credit history and I believe there must be checks and balances in place to address those concerns. But we need to remember that credit reporting forms an important role in our banking and finance sector. It gives credit providers the information they need to make informed decisions about risk. We do not want to see greater risk in this area, particularly in the current financial climate.


I am very concerned about the fact that lenders mortgage insurers have not been included in the parties allowed access to credit history information with respect to this bill. Lenders mortgage insurance has been part of the Australian housing and mortgage market since the 1960s. Insurers offer protection to lenders if a borrower defaults on their loan, and the insurance products are usually required where borrowers have contributed less than 20 per cent of the purchase price as a deposit. This insurance means that lenders have a safeguard in place and it also means that they have the flexibility to allow borrowers to rectify the loan in cases of default.


So, lenders mortgage insurance is a critical part of the housing market and it is a critical part of finance in this nation, and without it housing would be less affordable and fewer Australians would be able to have access to that finance. Overall, the insurers provide a level of protection and security to the market. They also act as an additional level of scrutiny by assessing risk in terms of loan conditions and credit history. It is simply not in the insurer's best interest to cover high-risk loans, given that they bear the risk of borrowers defaulting on their loans.


Lenders mortgage insurers currently have access to credit reporting information. I understand the need for privacy protection in these circumstances, but I am concerned that it will come at the cost of overall increased risk in this area. I know that there is the possibility for lenders to pass on that information to insurers under the bill. I believe that this is not good enough; it should not be up to mortgage insurers, who bear their own risk and who have their own financial structures and models, to rely on a third party to pass on information. Insurers need access to independent, accurate information, such as credit reports, firsthand.


There are also concerns that this will lead to lenders acting as gatekeepers of such information and choosing to insure the low-risk loans themselves, leaving only the higher risk loans for independent insurers. That is untenable in the impact it would have on the market. There are also further concerns that with this increase in self-insurance, lenders may take greater risks themselves or not make appropriate allowances to cover debts. The likely outcome of this in the long term is less choice, and worse, for consumers as insurers fold under the strain of covering high-risk loans. It is important to note that in similar jurisdictions, such as Canada, which operates in a similar regulatory system, insurers have direct access to credit-reporting information.


Lenders mortgage insurance is regulated by APRA, and there are currently specific controls on how credit-reporting data can be used. Insurers are also licensed under consumer credit protection laws and regulated by ASIC. There are multiple reasons why providers of lenders mortgage insurance should be granted access to credit-reporting information. To this end, I have had some very useful discussions with Senator Brandis and his office, the Australian Greens and Senator Williams in relation to this, and that is why I have circulated an amendment in the names of a number of parties in order to rectify this. I understand that the government will be moving its own amendments in relation to this to deal with the same issue, and that is welcome. I really query why it had to come to this, but I do welcome any changes that will rectify what is a glaring anomaly in respect of mortgage insurers.


So I look forward to discussing this amendment further in the committee stage, but it is a problem that must be fixed. With that caveat, I support this legislation.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:17):  I would like to thank senators for their contributions to this debate. I would also like to put on the record my thanks to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its report and detailed work in considering this bill.


The Senate committee made 21 recommendations. The government has accepted 20 in full or in principle, and has noted the final recommendation, which calls on the Senate to pass the bill. The Senate committee has asked that a number of issues be addressed through amendments to the bill and in the revisions to the explanatory memorandum.


I foreshadow that opposition senators have also sought revisions to the explanatory memorandum and review of certain provisions. The government has carefully considered these requests and agreed to them. These changes will result in privacy laws that balance more appropriately the privacy of individuals and the legitimate activities of government agencies and the private sector.


The bill is ultimately the culmination of an extensive process of consultation with stakeholders and, of course, scrutiny by this parliament. It will implement more than half of the Australian Law Reform Commission's 295 recommendations. The bill will bring Australia's privacy regime into the digital age, reflecting our new approach to providing personal information over the internet. In particular, consumer privacy protection will be strengthened; and can I add that the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner will also have the power to get an enforceable outcome—an apology, a retraction, a takedown notice or compensation from a court. The commissioner will be able to apply to the courts for a civil penalty, and there are new civil penalties for serious repeated breaches of privacy, for which companies may be liable for a significant penalty.


In dealing with this bill in the summing-up stage, can I then say that the bill contains what this government considers the most significant reforms to privacy law since Labor introduced the act in 1988. They are long-overdue reforms that will give effect to key aspects of the ALRC's landmark report on privacy in Australia. I take this opportunity to thank the numerous stakeholders, from the industry associations to the law reform and privacy advocates, and also those opposite and on the cross benches, for the detailed discussions, arguments and feedback to finalise this bill before parliament.


In conclusion, I add that I am confident that we have struck the right balance in privacy law for Australia in this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN

Senator Edwards

Senator LUDWIG:
  I do note that Senator Xenophon has an issue with one, as I understand it. It would seem that we could move government amendments (1) to (40), but noting that government amendment (17) is in conflict with Senator Xenophon's. It is a question of whether you want me to pull that one out and move (1) to (40), save (17) and then deal with that afterwards? It is probably an easier way of doing it, and then we could deal with that one separately. In doing otherwise, we then have a problem.


So, I seek leave to combine (1) to (40), save (17)—

In dealing with these amendments, I may also touch on government amendments (17) and (27) on sheet BP262. I note that the addendum to the explanatory memorandum was tabled in the Senate on 22 November 2012. It addressed recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee in its report on the bill, which was tabled on 26 September 2012. The government is introducing certain amendments to items in schedules 1, 2 and 4 of the bill. Many of these amendments, as I think I indicated in my second reading speech, respond to the recommendations of the committee report on the bill.


The amendments to schedule 1 of the bill respond to recommendations 1, 2 and 8 of the committee's report and will improve the effectiveness and operation of the proposed Australian Privacy Principles. These amendments are as follows: amendment (8), clarify the pseudonymity principle in Australian Privacy Principle 2; amendment (11), remove the word 'prohibition' from the subheading of APP 7, which deals with direct marketing, to more accurately reflect the content of the provisions; amendments (9), (10), (11), (12), (13) and (14) will add notes under those APPs that refer to permitted general situations and permitted health situations to provide useful cross-references to those meanings of those terms; and amendment (7) makes a minor amendment to the provisions dealing with medical research. The government will also expand the list of provisions that will be reviewed 12 months after commencement. The review commitment was given in response to a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. As a result of discussions with the opposition, the government will add APP 7, which deals with direct marketing, to that list of matters to be reviewed.


The amendments to schedule 2 of the bill respond to recommendations 10 and 15 of the committee's report about the credit reporting provisions. The amendments to schedule 2 will also address a number of additional stakeholder concerns. These amendments are as follows. We will deal with amendment (27) shortly. Amendments (18), (19) and (20) broaden the identification provisions to permit research to be generally about credit. The Australian link requirement will be redrafted to ensure credit providers can continue to undertake various offshore processing activities in relation to credit eligibility information, clarify the scope of the managing credit and debt collection provisions, and make a number of related changes. We will deal with amendment (17) later. Amendments (16), (25) and (26) add regulation, making powers to allowed prescribed credit providers that are not licensees, such as Indigenous Business Australia, to access repayment history information, exempt and prescribe credit providers, such as IBA, from certain obligations to be a member of an external dispute resolution scheme and allow additional relay services that may be developed in the future to be exempt from the requirements to obtain prior written authorisation where the prescribed service is used to assist an individual and access seeker to communicate for the purpose of obtaining access to their credit reporting information.


Amendments (1) to (6) will extend the commencement period of the bill to 15 months after royal assent. This longer commencement period will ensure industry has sufficient time to make necessary changes to their systems and procedures. Amendment (40) will add a note to the civil penalty provisions in schedule 4 of the bill to clarify the matters that a court must consider in determining an appropriate penalty for multiple breaches of the act. That will ensure that a court will take into account all relevant circumstances in deciding on the total penalty to impose where there have been multiple breaches relating to the same conduct. In summary, we may be able to deal with any questions related to those issues that may have arisen, but I commend those amendments.


Before I conclude, it seems I could, by leave, add government amendment (17) on sheet BP262 to the government amendments, as it is a more efficient way of dealing with it, if there is no objection. I understand that there is not, but I seek leave to do that.


Leave granted.




Senator LUDWIG:
  I move government amendment (17) on sheet BP262:


(17) Schedule 2, item 72, page 77 (lines 7 and 8), omit all the words from and including ""recipient"" to and including ""licensee"", substitute:


recipient of the information is:


   (a) a credit provider who is a licensee or is prescribed by the regulations; or


   (b) a mortgage insurer.


Having moved that amendment, I will speak briefly on it. Amendment (17) permits credit reporting bodies to disclose repayment history information to mortgagee insurers.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:29):  I just want to say a few words on behalf of the opposition in relation to the government's amendments. The bill, in its exposure and first reading considerations, attracted a great number of representations and submissions from affected stakeholders, including from the telecommunications, utilities, banking, insurance and direct marketing sectors.


Fifty-nine submissions were received by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported on 25 September.


I want to take the opportunity to thank the committee for the comprehensive nature of its hearings and its report. I want in particular to thank my colleague and, indeed, my parliamentary secretary, Senator Gary Humphries, for his tremendous industry in the work of the committee. The majority of the committee made 21 recommendations including substantive amendments, new transitional provisions and a comprehensive review within 12 months of the passage of the bill. The coalition members of the committee made an additional four recommendations.


I will speak momentarily to amendment (17) among the government amendments. That amendment is to substantially the same effect as an amendment jointly circulated in my name and the names of Senators Xenophon, Williams and Wright. Given that government amendment (17) is to substantially the same effect, I just indicate to the minister that we are happy for it to be considered among the government amendments. But let me speak briefly to it.


That amendment, government amendment (17), raises an issue specifically identified in the hearings by coalition members of the committee. In their report, the coalition members of the committee said:


Proposed new subsection 20E(1) (item 72 of Schedule 2) of the Privacy Act prohibits a 'credit reporting body' which holds 'credit reporting information' about an prohibits a 'credit reporting body' which holds 'credit reporting information' about an individual from using or disclosing that information. There are a number of exceptions to this general prohibition (proposed new subsections 20E(2)-(3)); however, under proposed new subsection 20E(4) a 'credit reporting body' cannot disclose 'credit reporting information' derived from 'repayment history information' to recipients who are not 'licensees' under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, including, for example, lenders mortgage insurers (LMIs), … which are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.


The Insurance Council of Australia highlighted that LMIs assume the same risk as lenders:


[I]mpeding their ability to assess this risk by denying direct access to the full range of credit information is likely to significantly affect the LMI providers' ability to actually provide [lenders mortgage insurance]. This will impact on the availability and accessibility of borrowers (particularly first home buyers).


Coalition Senators note that such an outcome would be contrary to some of the benefits of privacy reform identified by the Attorney-General in her second reading speech and, in particular, the enhanced ability of the finance and credit industry to make more accurate risk assessments. Consistent with the introduction of more comprehensive credit reporting, Coalition Senators consider that, with the appropriate safeguards, there is no sound justification for disallowing LMIs from receiving 'credit reporting information' from a 'credit reporting body'.


And that is the effect of the amendment, government amendment No. (17). I acknowledged Senator Gary Humphries a moment ago, but I should also acknowledge Senator John Williams, who was a participant in the hearings of the committee and who, I think, had a particular interest in this amendment. As to the rest of the government amendments, as I have indicated, the opposition supports them. They are in each case a reflection of the recommendations of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and their adoption is the result of a very productive discussion that took place between the Attorney-General, myself and Senator Humphries last Tuesday afternoon. So the government amendments have the support of the coalition.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:34):  I note the comments of Senator Brandis and also acknowledge the role that Senator John Williams has played in relation to that particular amendment with mortgage lending insurance, because it would have been quite anomalous for this bill not to include that. To not give mortgage lending insurers access to credit reporting information would have caused chaos in that industry and would have had quite severe effects. 


I am also grateful for the discussions that I have had with Senator Wright from the Australian Greens in relation to this. I think that common sense has prevailed. The weight of numbers in any event is such that the combination of the coalition and the Greens and myself would have been overwhelmingly one of needing to fix up the anomaly, and so it has been fixed. I am very pleased that the government has moved this amendment which, in effect, reflects the amendment that was in the joint names of Senators Brandis, Williams, Wright and myself. I am pleased that this has been fixed, much to the relief of the mortgage lenders, and I think to home lenders and intending homeowners in Australia as well.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-11-27,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:35):  I would just like to add some comments following Senator Xenophon. For some 46 years, I think, mortgage insurance companies have had access to individual credit history and I believe that it is very important that the status quo remains. Those mortgage insurance companies have got to provide the insurance and they need to know who they are insuring. 


I do not know whether this was an oversight by the government or by the Attorney-General when this legislation was brought in to the other place. I hope it was just an oversight not with some other meaning as far as the mortgage insurance companies go. I do welcome the government's amendment, which is basically the amendment put forward by Senators Brandis, Xenophon, Wright and myself. It was a serious problem and I am glad that that problem has been solved.


I thank Senator Brandis for his input to this very important issue, and his staff. I thank Senator Xenophon and I acknowledge Senator Wright as well. Through the weight of numbers, as Senator Xenophon said, I am glad the government has listened to this very important issue. No doubt they have had plenty of meetings and plenty of people knocking on their door, saying, 'You have got this wrong.' The Senate inquiry has obviously had the problem highlighted by coalition senators, and it is a pleasing result. Mortgage insurance companies will have that problem fixed so that they can access credit history, knowing what sorts of individuals they are dealing with when they put their money at risk. That is only fair and, as I often say, life is about fairness.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:37):  I want to make a few comments on all the amendments the government has moved, except amendment (17). I welcome this raft of amendments, which in part exhibits a responsiveness and attentiveness to coalition senators' concerns in a dissenting report. We are unaccustomed to this but welcome that tendency by the government in this case at least to take these matters on board and to move amendments that respond to them. I particularly welcome the extension of the commencement date of the legislation. It was very clear from the inquiry that the new regime will be very complex and the stakeholders themselves made clear that the time frame originally provided for—nine months from royal assent for the commencement of the legislation—was too short. The Australian Bankers Association, for example, said:


… as far as the general privacy provisions are concerned, the proposed implementation timeframe in the Bill will be insufficient for our members to implement those reforms effectively.


It has taken four years since the Law Reform Commission initiated this process of improving our privacy regime until the legislation was tabled this year. It would be a pity if such a long period of time had elapsed and then the implementation were so rushed that the process was not effectively consummated.


I also note what the minister said about Australian Privacy Principle 7 and the issue of direct marketing. I welcome the fact that the drafting of that privacy principle has been amended to make it clear that not all direct marketing is prohibited—except that which is expressly exempted by the principle. I want to put on record that I am aware of still serious concerns in some parts of industry, in this case particularly the online sector, that this issue is not yet resolved. They have concerns that the model used for marketing on platforms such as Yahoo, Facebook and so forth is not accommodated by this legislation as currently drafted. They remain concerned that they may not be able to deliver, because of the arrangements in place with our privacy principles outlawing direct marketing based on the private information supplied to those platforms by their customers, a product to Australian customers which they can deliver to customers pretty well anywhere else in the world.


I believe the minister said he would be ensuring a review was conducted. I welcome that. I hope that inherent in that there would not be any prosecution of parties in circumstances where current business practices were continued which have been thought and understood by suppliers of those services to be acceptable under these new arrangements but which in fact are not covered by the new legislation. Those matters are not clear. I hope the government will exercise restraint in addressing its discussions with the online sector as to how it overcomes any differences of view about how these changes are to be implemented.


Having said that, I think these amendments take this legislation to a better place. I personally welcome them.

 (South Australia) (16:41):  Some concerns were raised in the inquiry process by stakeholders. We feel that the majority of these have been addressed through the government's response to the committee report. They are actually now in the form of these amendments. As a result, we feel the bill has been significantly improved. I acknowledge the government's willingness to be responsive in this event both to the report and to concerns raised by the Australian Greens, my colleague Senator Xenophon and the coalition about mortgage insurance as well.

 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:42):  I want to deal with Senator Humphries's last issue. I think it is worth putting on the record the way the government would expect it to work. For the online group, if I can generally call them that, the Privacy Commissioner will develop guidelines. You would expect the commissioner—and I cannot direct the commissioner—would develop those guidelines in consultation with the online industry. That will take a certain amount of time, one would expect, but in doing that the online community can express the issues Senator Humphries also raised. That would fall prior to the review, so one would expect that those issues would be managed in that way.


Question agreed to.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-11-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:43):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (1) and (3) together:


(1) Schedule 2, item 69, page 65 (after line 27), after paragraph 6Q(1)(b), insert:


(ba) at least 30 days have passed since the day on which the notice was given; and


(3) Schedule 2, item 72, page 102 (line 35), omit ""a reasonable period has"", substitute ""at least 30 days have"".


These amendments relate to the time period after which notice is given before a default credit listing can occur. The Australian Greens are of the view that a default listing should not occur until at least 30 days after a default notice has been given. In practical terms that gives a borrower sufficient time to receive the notice, to become aware of the fact that there is an amount owing—there may be vagaries of the post that interfered with the delivery of that notice—to contact the credit provider and/or to try to rectify the default before a listing can be made. This is consistent with other credit laws.


In some cases the listing may arise out of an event of which the borrower is not aware—for instance, if there is a bank error—and it will give them time to become acquainted with that and to do something to rectify it. This was a recommendation that was made by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre of New South Wales, which submitted that the current provisions in the bill essentially enabled a credit provider to list a default immediately after issuing written notice to an individual. That is clearly procedurally unfair as it is the notice itself that is important in notifying the consumer that there actually is a default. It is more than possible to be unaware of the default where, for instance, it is out of the control of the borrower—as I said with the bank error.


The Consumer Credit Legal Centre has significant expertise in providing consumer assistance advocacy and representation and it sees how these sorts of legal provisions work in practice and how they can impact on vulnerable Australians. I think it is important that we respect this expertise and avoid unintended consequences by applying on-the-ground knowledge, and it often speaks on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Credit Legal Centre recommended that the bill should be amended to require 30 days to have elapsed from the date for the written notice before listing can occur. The submission of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network also suggested that a listing should not occur until the credit provider had made reasonable attempts to contact the debtor and provide a specific warning regarding the default listing.


We recognise the practical reality for consumers who face financial strain and we think that it is important that they are provided with sufficient notice about overdue payments and the consequences of failing to pay such overdue payments. For that reason we support the recommendation by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre that the bill should be amended to require 30 days to have elapsed from the date of the written notice before a default listing occurs.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:46):  The government does not support the motion. The government has, in the alternate—and as I think we will be doing—accepted the committee's recommendation to require at least 14 days to elapse after a notice has been provided to an individual before default information about the individual can be included in the credit reporting system. The government has agreed with the committee's view that a 14-day period provided sufficient time for an individual to receive the final notice warning them that a default would be listed for the overdue payment and to contact the credit provider to make appropriate arrangements for the payment of the overdue amount. The government has looked at the issue of extending it to 30 days and does not believe it is appropriate. I note, if you put it in this context, that an individual must be 60 days overdue in making a payment before a credit provider can send the individual a notice warning them that their default will be listed. A 30-day period before listing would mean that the individual was overdue by at least 90 days and has not contacted the credit provider in that time to make alternative arrangements. The government considers that that is an excessive period of time. It is more important that the credit provider can contact and talk to the creditor in those instances. It is, of course, only a minimum period. The government notes that the credit reporting code of conduct may provide additional obligations in relation to listing defaults, including addressing situations where a longer time period may be appropriate. The credit reporting code will be developed by all stakeholders and, once registered by the Information Commissioner, compliance with the code will be mandatory for all credit providers. Having given that short synopsis, those are the reasons why the government will not be supporting the Greens amendments.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:48):  The opposition will not be supporting Greens amendments (1) and (3) either, essentially for the reasons recited by the minister. Under the way the legislation works, a notice cannot be issued until there has been a default of at least 60 days so the mischief identified by Senator Wright, which these amendments would correct, really does not arise because already there has been a default for a period of two months. While I am on my feet I might say that Greens amendment (2)  does seem to us to be reasonably innocuous and therefore we have no objection to it.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:49):  I move Greens amendment (2) relating to the threshold for overdue payments:


(2) Schedule 2, item 69, page 65 (line 31), omit ""$100"", substitute ""$150"".


The Australian Greens are seeking to extend the threshold from $100 to $150. There was evidence given in the committee inquiry from various stakeholders, including the Consumer Credit Legal Centre who said:




We now have a generation of young people with mobile phones. Over 50 per cent of the default listings on the current credit reporting list are for telcos. It should not be, under any circumstances, that people
'
s lives completely stop for five years over a hundred bucks. A hundred bucks is just too small an amount. We need to put that up to $300. A hundred bucks is just too small an amount. We need to put that up to $300. Another example is electricity: many, many people are struggling with paying their electricity bills. A hundred dollars for a default listing is catastrophic; it should be higher. I understand that some of the energy and water ombudsmen are advocating for that minimum listing to be increased. I also understand the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman is as well. 


In its submission, the centre said:


The overdue amount needs to be commensurate with the detriment caused by a default listing. A listing for $200 being a small amount remains on a consumer's credit report for 5 years. This is a severe detriment for a small amount of money overdue. … The overdue amount needs to reflect rising loan amounts. Many years ago $100 would be a reasonable amount but now as loans get larger, it is inappropriate to list a default over such a small overdue amount. For example, it is possible to have a home loan and an investment loan and suddenly be unable to refinance due to a mix up at the bank on the payment amount over a 60 day period in the amount of $200 on a $400,000 home loan. … There are a number of utilities where it is very common for consumers struggling with living expenses and other financial hardship to be a bit behind on payments. As it stands that ""bit behind"" in the Bill would be $100. With rising electricity prices and problems with capping costs on mobile phones, it is essential that consumers are given a bit more leeway than $100 overdue before they are prevented from getting a home loan, credit card, personal loan etc. for 5 years.


That came from the submission by the centre. 


Comments by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre for increasing the overdue amounts from $100 to $300 were supported by the Energy and Water Ombudsman New South Wales and the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network. The purpose of increasing the threshold of overdue amount is to exclude small utility bills from the adverse consequences of credit listing. It also recognises increases in the cost of living over recent years.


The Australian Greens agree that there should be an amendment here to reflect recent changes in costs of living and, after some negotiation and an awareness of what is likely to be agreed to by the chamber, we suggest that the threshold amount be changed from $100 to $150. We also note that there is a provision in the bill for a higher amount to be prescribed by regulations, which provides flexibility in responding to consumer concerns down the track that $150 is not in fact sufficient. However, we do think that this minor change will go some way towards a more realistic situation. We feel that these changes will improve consumer protections in the Privacy Act.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-11-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (16:00):  I rise to speak on the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012. The Australian Greens support the aims and objectives of this bill, in particular the unification of the National Privacy Principles and the Information Privacy Principles into the new Australian Privacy Principles that apply to both Commonwealth agencies and private sector organisations.


The bill amends the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988. It has been developed following numerous reviews and inquiries, which have included significant consultations with stakeholders. However, as was pointed out during this inquiry process, the reforms have been a long time coming. For example, this is the first major reform to credit reporting since its introduction in the 1990s. While there was majority support for the contents of this bill amongst stakeholders, some concerns were expressed that although the bill did improve on the current position—that is because it is an important step towards that goal of harmonisation and simplification—it could not necessarily be said that it was an enhancement. Indeed, during the Senate committee inquiry into the bill three different stakeholders expressed some concerns that this bill was a missed opportunity and it did not go far enough in either streamlining provisions or in providing consumers and citizens with better protections.


Changes to Australian law to modernise, strengthen and streamline privacy and credit reporting provisions are important. In doing this we need to be careful that we strike the right balance between privacy rights and the free flow of information. The Australian Greens strongly support the strengthening of Australian law to ensure enhanced compatibility with our obligations under international human rights law. As a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, Australia has an obligation to promote and protect the right to privacy. Indeed, article 17 of the ICCPR provides that:


1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his—


And I use that word advisedly; it is slightly anachronistic—


privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. 


2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks. 


In signing up to the ICCPR Australia has agreed to take all the necessary steps to respect, protect and fulfil human rights.


We agree with the findings and recommendations made in the committee report, and we made some additional comments directed at improving consumer protection and privacy rights. We acknowledge that the government has agreed to implement many of those changes and is putting forward amendments today. However, we feel that a couple of additional changes should be made to improve consumer protections. I will turn to these now.


In relation to proposed paragraph 6Q(1), the Australian Greens would have preferred to go further than what was recommended by the Senate committee. We are of the view that a default listing should not occur until at least 30 days after a default notice has been given. In practical terms that gives a borrower sufficient time to receive the notice, which may be subject to the vagaries of the post, contact the credit provider and/or try to rectify a default before a listing can be made, and is consistent with other credit laws. This recommendation was made in the inquiry by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre NSW. The Consumer Credit Legal Centre submitted that the current provisions in the bill essentially enabled a credit provider to list a default immediately after issuing written notice to an individual, and submitted that this is procedurally unfair as it is the notice that is important in notifying the consumer that there actually is a default. It is more than possible to be unaware of the default simply because there was a bank error in direct debits—that is given as an example.


The Consumer Credit Legal Centre has significant expertise in providing consumer assistance advocacy and representation. It sees how these sorts of legal provisions work in practice and how they can impact on, particularly, vulnerable Australians. I think it is important that we respect this expertise and on-the-ground knowledge, which often speaks on behalf of consumers. The Consumer Credit Legal Centre recommended that the bill should be amended to require 30 days to have elapsed from the date of the written notice, before listing can occur, to avoid unintended and unfair consequences.


The submission of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network also suggested that a listing should not occur until the credit provider has made 'reasonable attempts' to contact the debtor and has provided a specific warning regarding the default listing.


We recognise the practical reality for consumers who face financial strain, and we think that it is important they are provided with sufficient notice about overdue payments and the consequences of failing to pay such overdue payments. For this reason we support the recommendation by the Consumer Credit Legal Centre that the bill should be amended to require 30 days to have elapsed from the date of the written notice, before a default listing occurs. For that reason the Australian Greens will be moving an amendment to that effect.


We also support he recommendations made by consumer advocates that the threshold minimum amount for which a consumer credit default listing can be made should be increased. During the Senate committee inquiry stakeholders also suggested that the threshold overdue amount that gives rise to a default listing was unrealistic. The Energy and Water Ombudsman NSW, the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre advocated for increasing the overdue amount from $100 to $300. The purpose of increasing the threshold overdue amount is to exclude small utility bills from the adverse consequences of credit listing. It also recognises increases in costs of living over recent years.


The Australian Greens agree that there should be an amendment to reflect recent changes in the cost of living and we suggest that the threshold amount be changed from $100 to $150. We also note that there is provision in the bill for a higher amount to be prescribed by regulation, which provides flexibility in responding to consumer concerns and cost-of-living increases down the track when $150 is not sufficient. However, we think that this minor change goes some way towards a more realistic situation. We feel that these changes will improve consumer protections in the Privacy Act.


During the inquiry process we noted that some concerns were raised by consumer advocates that the amendment to the definition of 'serious credit infringement' would not address the serious problems that this definition currently creates. As serious credit infringement is, apart from bankruptcy, the most serious type of listing that can be made—and it will ordinarily remain on a credit report for seven years—it is very significant and has substantial ramifications for individuals. For these reasons, consumer advocates such as the Consumer Action Law Centre, considered that it is essential that such listings are proportionate to the type of credit infringement and are accurate and based on clear evidence. The Consumer Action Law Centre, CALC, expressed concerns with the amendment to the bill that requires that a serious credit infringement cannot be listed unless six months has elapsed since the credit provider last had contact with the debtor. It appears that the intent of this change is to ensure that credit providers attempt to make contact with the debtor so as to avoid an incorrect listing. By its intent, the amendment seeks to enhance consumer protections. However, as CALC points out, there is no guarantee that this amendment will achieve its purported aim as the credit provider is not required to be proactive and attempt to make contact. The only requirement is that the credit provider waits six months before listing a serious credit infringement.


CALC referred to a previous submission by consumer advocates and recommended that the definition of 'serious credit infringement' should be replaced with two new definitions: 'uncontactable default' and a 'never paid flag'. The Australian Greens gave serious consideration to this stakeholder recommendation. We considered it in detail in our additional comments and raised it with the government. However, we are not satisfied that the recommendation could be adequately implemented so as to take into account instances where there was intentional fraud, and we were of the view that, practically speaking, it was not appropriate to remove the fraud from the definition of 'serious credit infringement'. We do however understand the concerns raised by stakeholders and we will endeavour to follow up with them as to how this could be reconsidered in the future.


Finally, we note that, during the inquiry process, significant concerns were raised by the Australian Privacy Foundation and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre regarding the lack of determinations that have been made under section 52 of the act. As a result of this history, the Australian Privacy Foundation, the APF, is apprehensive about the effectiveness of new reform under section 96, which provides a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against decisions by the commissioner to make a determination of a complaint under section 52(1) or 52(1A). In its view, this new right of appeal is of little use unless complainants can require the commissioner to make formal decisions under section 52 of the act. It recommends that the Privacy Commissioner should be required to make a determination under section 52 wherever a complainant so requests and for complainants to be informed that they are entitled to such a formal resolution of their complaint.


The Australian Law Reform Commission, the ALRC, in its Report 108: for your information: Australian privacy law and practice,made a similar recommendation in 2009. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner provideda supplementary submission to the inquiry and noted that the government specifically rejected the recommendation of the ALRC in 2009 on the ground that, as an independent statutory officer, the Australian Information Commissioner should be responsible for exercising the administrative decision-making powers under the Privacy Act. We understand the tension here and the importance of promoting and respecting the independence of the OAIC, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, and we believe that it would be prudent for the government to reconsider this matter and conduct a review of the functions and powers of the OAIC in relation to its system for managing complaints, conciliations and determinations. In our additional comments to the Senate committee, we recommended that, 12 months after the enactment of the bill, the government should conduct a review into the effectiveness of the OAIC's system for managing complaints, conciliations and determinations because, if there is a right to appeal against a determination but no determination is made, essentially there is no right of appeal.


The Australian Greens take an interest in ensuring that the privacy rights of Australians are adequately promoted and protected and we will be monitoring the impact and effectiveness of this bill when it becomes law. While we have some concerns with this bill, overall we feel that it improves and streamlines privacy laws and we support its passage. We note that the government is introducing some amendments which respond to many recommendations put forward by the Senate committee and we will be putting forward our own amendments. On this basis, we support the passage of this bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-11-27,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:13):  I indicate my support for the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012, with amendments. I believe it makes a number of important and necessary changes in relation to privacy law in Australia. However, I would like to express my concerns in relation to the credit reporting provisions in this bill. I agree that Australia needs a strong and robust credit reporting system. I know that some organisations have concerns about privacy in relation to disclosing credit history and I believe there must be checks and balances in place to address those concerns. But we need to remember that credit reporting forms an important role in our banking and finance sector. It gives credit providers the information they need to make informed decisions about risk. We do not want to see greater risk in this area, particularly in the current financial climate.


I am very concerned about the fact that lenders mortgage insurers have not been included in the parties allowed access to credit history information with respect to this bill. Lenders mortgage insurance has been part of the Australian housing and mortgage market since the 1960s. Insurers offer protection to lenders if a borrower defaults on their loan, and the insurance products are usually required where borrowers have contributed less than 20 per cent of the purchase price as a deposit. This insurance means that lenders have a safeguard in place and it also means that they have the flexibility to allow borrowers to rectify the loan in cases of default.


So, lenders mortgage insurance is a critical part of the housing market and it is a critical part of finance in this nation, and without it housing would be less affordable and fewer Australians would be able to have access to that finance. Overall, the insurers provide a level of protection and security to the market. They also act as an additional level of scrutiny by assessing risk in terms of loan conditions and credit history. It is simply not in the insurer's best interest to cover high-risk loans, given that they bear the risk of borrowers defaulting on their loans.


Lenders mortgage insurers currently have access to credit reporting information. I understand the need for privacy protection in these circumstances, but I am concerned that it will come at the cost of overall increased risk in this area. I know that there is the possibility for lenders to pass on that information to insurers under the bill. I believe that this is not good enough; it should not be up to mortgage insurers, who bear their own risk and who have their own financial structures and models, to rely on a third party to pass on information. Insurers need access to independent, accurate information, such as credit reports, firsthand.


There are also concerns that this will lead to lenders acting as gatekeepers of such information and choosing to insure the low-risk loans themselves, leaving only the higher risk loans for independent insurers. That is untenable in the impact it would have on the market. There are also further concerns that with this increase in self-insurance, lenders may take greater risks themselves or not make appropriate allowances to cover debts. The likely outcome of this in the long term is less choice, and worse, for consumers as insurers fold under the strain of covering high-risk loans. It is important to note that in similar jurisdictions, such as Canada, which operates in a similar regulatory system, insurers have direct access to credit-reporting information.


Lenders mortgage insurance is regulated by APRA, and there are currently specific controls on how credit-reporting data can be used. Insurers are also licensed under consumer credit protection laws and regulated by ASIC. There are multiple reasons why providers of lenders mortgage insurance should be granted access to credit-reporting information. To this end, I have had some very useful discussions with Senator Brandis and his office, the Australian Greens and Senator Williams in relation to this, and that is why I have circulated an amendment in the names of a number of parties in order to rectify this. I understand that the government will be moving its own amendments in relation to this to deal with the same issue, and that is welcome. I really query why it had to come to this, but I do welcome any changes that will rectify what is a glaring anomaly in respect of mortgage insurers.


So I look forward to discussing this amendment further in the committee stage, but it is a problem that must be fixed. With that caveat, I support this legislation.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (16:17):  I would like to thank senators for their contributions to this debate. I would also like to put on the record my thanks to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for its report and detailed work in considering this bill.


The Senate committee made 21 recommendations. The government has accepted 20 in full or in principle, and has noted the final recommendation, which calls on the Senate to pass the bill. The Senate committee has asked that a number of issues be addressed through amendments to the bill and in the revisions to the explanatory memorandum.


I foreshadow that opposition senators have also sought revisions to the explanatory memorandum and review of certain provisions. The government has carefully considered these requests and agreed to them. These changes will result in privacy laws that balance more appropriately the privacy of individuals and the legitimate activities of government agencies and the private sector.


The bill is ultimately the culmination of an extensive process of consultation with stakeholders and, of course, scrutiny by this parliament. It will implement more than half of the Australian Law Reform Commission's 295 recommendations. The bill will bring Australia's privacy regime into the digital age, reflecting our new approach to providing personal information over the internet. In particular, consumer privacy protection will be strengthened; and can I add that the Commonwealth Privacy Commissioner will also have the power to get an enforceable outcome—an apology, a retraction, a takedown notice or compensation from a court. The commissioner will be able to apply to the courts for a civil penalty, and there are new civil penalties for serious repeated breaches of privacy, for which companies may be liable for a significant penalty.


In dealing with this bill in the summing-up stage, can I then say that the bill contains what this government considers the most significant reforms to privacy law since Labor introduced the act in 1988. They are long-overdue reforms that will give effect to key aspects of the ALRC's landmark report on privacy in Australia. I take this opportunity to thank the numerous stakeholders, from the industry associations to the law reform and privacy advocates, and also those opposite and on the cross benches, for the detailed discussions, arguments and feedback to finalise this bill before parliament.


In conclusion, I add that I am confident that we have struck the right balance in privacy law for Australia in this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:56):  The coalition welcomes a number of aspects in the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012 but also has great reservations about a number of other aspects. To set the scene for the debate that we are having today it is necessary to remind ourselves that there was no regulatory impact statement when the Fair Work Act was implemented. As a result, the government was required to have a review within two years. Finally, on 20 December last year, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Bill Shorten, announced the review.


The review, colleagues will remember, was a review undertaken by hand-picked panellists whose pedigree was that they were Labor sympathisers. We had the good professor who, after only two months of Work Choices, was able to make definitive statements about it and yet, two years after the Fair Work Act, came up with the lame description that it required 'more time' before we could tell its impact. This is the same professor who railed against the use of the corporations power for coalition workplace relations policy yet has remained strangely silent when it comes to the use of the corporations power for Labor workplace relations legislation. So, a very simple approach: Liberal, bad; Labor, good. Hardly what you would expect from an academic and hardly what you would expect from a person who would provide an independent mind and judgement to these matters of great importance to our nation and of great importance to individual workers right around Australia.


I could go on with other panel members but I will not. What we do know is that the terms of reference under which this cherry-picked, hand-picked panel had to work with were skewed. How do we know that? We know because, after many questions not being answered, my office finally undertook a freedom of information request which showed the documentation and the email trails where the department quite rightly had expressed concern that fundamental issues such as union militancy, red tape and productivity were not part of the terms of reference. Long story short: hand-picked panel, skewed terms of reference. Nevertheless, it provided a report which was, as one might expect, disappointing.


But, nevertheless, there were 53 recommendations, and a majority of those recommendations were recommendations with which the coalition agreed, recommendations where—despite the biased nature of the panel, despite the skewed terms of reference—reality mugged the panel to such an extent that they had to accept a number of recommendations. As a result, there are a number of issues here where the coalition is in full agreement. But I might add that instead of implementing all of the 53 recommendations or seeking to deal with them, Mr Shorten has done a political act in relation to this and has only dealt with 17 out of the 53 recommendations. Let me go through a few of them.


One of them is that the panel recommended that the Fair Work Act be amended to expressly empower Fair Work Australia to strike out an award variation application that is not made in accordance with the Fair Work Act, is frivolous or vexatious or has no reasonable prospects of success. Good, sensible stuff; the coalition fully supports it. I move on to the implementation of recommendations 44 and 45, where the panel recommended that the President of Fair Work Australia give consideration to requiring applicants to provide more information about the circumstances of the dismissal in the initial documentation lodged with Fair Work Australia. That is in relation to unfair dismissals. Similarly in relation to unfair dismissals there is the suggestion that costs orders be able to be made.


I indicate that as a coalition we have been talking about that for about two years and, yes, the ACTU, unable to help itself, had to come out and condemn us. Interestingly enough, the Fair Work Act review panel came to the conclusion that in effect what we as a coalition were saying was right. Small business has suffered, and suffered terribly, under this extreme unfair dismissal regime and it is a credit to the Labor government that they are willing to address these issues at least in part. It is somewhat strange that when the coalition make such recommendations, the ACTU is out there opposing it; when the government finally get mugged by the reality that these things do have to be changed, the ACTU is deafeningly silent because other trade-offs have been made with them.


Allow me to turn to those aspects of the bill where we as a coalition have very real issues and where we will be seeking to move amendments during the committee stage. First of all, this bill also contains matters extraneous to the Fair Work Act review panel's recommendations. A matter that the coalition have long been concerned about is the default superannuation schemes in the modern awards. We believe that they should be opened up for competition so that workers can get the best deal possible. But of course when you have industry super funds that are run by union and employer groups and they are the organisations making representations to Fair Work Australia, guess what? There is always a consent agreement that these superannuation funds should be part of the award, part of the default superannuation mechanism. It has always been the coalition's view, and my personally strong view, that these superannuation funds should not be allowed to be default funds just because two sectional interests happen to agree because they have certain benefits.



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Farrell interjects and says, 'I think that they are the best funds.' My view is, very clearly: let them prove that they are the best funds. And if they are, they have nothing to fear from an expert panel examining them and determining whether they are worthy. In fact, that is what the government's own review, conducted by the Productivity Commission, actually recommended. But what do the government do? They do not implement the Productivity Commission's recommendations, because they are hell-bent on protecting the gravy train of certain of the industry super funds from which the trade union movement in particular does exceedingly well. This is not serving the interests of Australian workers, it is not serving the interests of superannuation generally, it is not serving the best interests of our nation as a greater proportion of the population need to rely on their own retirement funds and are no longer able to rely on the pension. As a result, we will be moving amendments, and I will be expanding on that later, to have those schedules removed.


Another aspect of this bill, which is gobsmackingly arrogant, gobsmackingly vain of this Prime Minister, is the government's refusal to accept that the name of Fair Work Australia should be changed. That was the finding of the review panel. It is the considered opinion of the President of Fair Work Australia. It is the considered opinion of the trade union movement. It is the considered opinion of employer groups. It is the considered opinion of the Independent Contractors Association, the Council of Small Business of Australia, the Housing Industry Association. Do you know who else is on the list? The Maritime Union of Australia. So we have this absolute clean sweep across the board, from the MUA right through to employer organisations to the President of Fair Work Australia, and the recommendation of the President of Fair Work Australia itself. And their strong recommendation: delete the name 'Fair Work' from the name 'Fair Work Australia'. Why? Because the brand has been trashed. Why has the brand been trashed? Because of the way Fair Work Australia has conducted the Health Services Union inquiry. I have given speeches about that in the past and will not dwell on it for too long. Further, the brand has been trashed by the appointment of an endless tribe of ex-trade union bosses to sit on the bench of Fair Work Australia. Furthermore, the name 'Fair Work Australia' is Orwellian if ever there was such an example. 


That is why every single sensible contributor—and it is not often I will be saying that about the Maritime Union of Australia, might I add—from the Maritime Union of Australia right through all agreed that 'Fair Work' should be deleted from the name. But we have the vanity of this Prime Minister saying, 'Nobody will stand in the way of Fair Work Australia remaining.' If Labor and the Greens want to combine here in this place and retain the trashed brand of 'Fair Work Australia', they can be our guest, but in so doing they will be doing a disservice to the workplace relations system in this country. They know it, the panel knew it, the President of Fair Work Australia knows it, the union movement knows it, the employers know it. Everybody knows it other than the woman that gave it the name—namely, the current Prime Minister, who was then Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Gillard. It is her vanity that stops the name change that would be such an improvement and cultural change that is so vitally important. That is why we will be recommending that the name should be changed to the 'Australian Workplace Relations Commission'.


More important for us is the amendment being moved by the government to the Fair Work Act to create two new vice-presidential positions. Out of the 250 submissions to the Fair Work Act review, did anybody raise this issue? No. Was it recommended by the review panel? No. From where did it come and why is it so urgent? Nobody can explain other than this is a blatant attempt by this government, thinking that it is in its death throes, to try to future-proof Fair Work Australia from any attempt at getting a balanced bench. We know that the new president—and I mean him no disrespect by this—of Fair Work Australia could only have gotten the job, I am sure, because in a previous life he was an assistant secretary of the ACTU. You then have a look at the endless tribe of ex-trade union officials that have been appointed to Fair Work Australia. You then ask yourself the question: why do we need these two extra positions, at a cost to the taxpayer of $1.5 million per annum? That is the estimate from the department. When the government budget is haemorrhaging everywhere, we are creating two new positions to try to leapfrog all the other senior officials in Fair Work Australia. 


Is this just the coalition being concerned? No, it is not. No less a body than the Law Council of Australia has come out in condemnation of this proposal, because they see it for what it is: an undermining of this quasi-judicial body by creation of new positions to try to sideline other people who have seniority within Fair Work Australia. Of course, who are these two people with seniority in Fair Work Australia? Former Howard government appointees, Mr Lawler and Mr Graeme Watson—or should I call them vice-presidents Lawler and Watson. The government has put no argument to us as to why this is such an important amendment, such an important proposal, other than to try to ensure that they so stack out Fair Work Australia that no government will be able to correct the balance for a long, long time. It is shameful, it is transparent and it is another indication that Mr Shorten in this role as workplace relations minister does not understand that he has an overriding responsibility to the national interest. He still sees himself as a trade union boss just wearing a different hat and, as a result, he will do that which he believes is necessary to advance the cause of ex-trade union bosses. That is not what provides confidence to the Australian people and to Australian workers and Australian businesses that Fair Work Australia will provide sound, balanced decisions in this difficult and vexed area.


Further, the government needs to explain why this legislation was rushed into the House of Representatives one day and then passed the very next day—forced through. Then we have it moved in the Senate today that the bill be exempted from the cut-off. We had the embarrassment yesterday of the government doing this with another workplace relations bill only to be scrambling around with amendments to try to fix it up. That is why there are these time gaps between legislation moving from the House to the Senate. That is why bills should lay on the table. That is why proper consideration by Senate committees should be allowed. But since the Greens and Labor have got control of this place the Senate committee system has fallen into disrepute.


This important bill was given four witnesses to be heard and was rushed through in one day.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  We hear Senator Polley's interjection, which is very unwise because we know that, since the Greens-Labor alliance have got control of this place, they have thus far guillotined 150 bills since the last election. When the coalition had control of the Senate, those opposite condemned us because we had guillotined less than one-third of that number in the whole three-year period of the government. They have now gone strangely silent because the Greens-Labor alliance opposite know how they are abusing this chamber and are ensuring that legislation is not being properly considered. So much for the Greens and the country Independents promising a new paradigm of legislative transparency, that the parliament would be made to work as it should. Here we have bills rushed through the House, rushed through the Senate, no proper Senate committee stages and, as a result, bad legislation getting passed.


The coalition's view on this legislation is that there are a lot of good things in it which we support. There are also many bad things in it which we oppose. We will pursue each and every one of our amendments to a division. We will seek to put on record our very important concerns. If at the end of the day it is the Senate's view that the legislation should be unamended—and it is quite clear what its view will be—we will not oppose.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-11-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:16):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. The Australian Greens will be seeking leave to move amendments—we are calling them the better work/life balance amendments—that mirror the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 introduced by my colleague Adam Bandt in the other place.


Statistics constantly tell us that in Australia there is often a mismatch between the hours that people actually work and the hours that they want to work. On average, full-time employees would like to work about 5.6 hours less per week while part-time workers would like to work around four hours less than they are currently working. In addition, as a country we perform $72 billion of unpaid overtime each year. It cuts the other way too: there are many people—though, according to the studies, a lesser number—who would like to work more hours than they are currently working but are unable to.


A 2010 study on the health and working conditions of approximately 78,000 working Australians concluded:


…it may be counterproductive for employers to expect long working hours as employees are likely to take more time off and work less efficiently.


The study also commented that there is considerable evidence of an association between work demands and poor health. We have a situation where just over half of all Australians want to change their hours of work, even if this might impact on their income.


The Australian Work and Life Index—AWALI—is an annual study by the Centre for Work and Life at the University of South Australia. I am familiar with the work of AWALI, and it is held in great respect. The authors use the term 'work/life interference', and the 2012 data shows it is persistent and for some people getting worse. The report noted that around one-quarter of the Australians surveyed report that work frequently, often or almost always interferes with other life activities. Women's work/life outcomes are worse than men's when we take into account differences in work hours. Long hours and a poor fit between actual and preferred working hours are both associated with worse work/life outcomes. Most of those who work long hours would prefer not to. I am sure it is not a sentiment that would be understood by members of this chamber or the other place, but apparently that is the case in Australia!


Unfortunately, things are getting worse for women working full time. Work/life interference for this group has increased from 2007 to 2012. Full-time women's dissatisfaction with their work/life balance has risen from 15.9 per cent in 2008 to 27.5 per cent in 2012. In 2012 the gap between full-time women's actual and preferred hours is the largest since 2007. On average, they would prefer to work 8.7 hours a week less than they actually do. 41.8 per cent of mothers in full-time employment would prefer to work part time. This is the largest proportion since 2007.


There is no doubt that many good employers already recognise the benefits of providing flexible working arrangements; however, this recognition is not as widespread as it could or should be. The Australian Greens want people to have more control over their time and working arrangements. We need a better match between the hours people want to work and the hours they actually work. At the moment, people do not have an enforceable right to request flexible working arrangements. At the moment, under the Fair Work Act you can request a change to your working hours but, if the employer says no, there is nowhere for you to go—no appeal, no recourse, no prospect of improvement in your work/life balance. You are stuck with it.


These amendments would ensure that requests for flexible working arrangements are treated seriously. Employers would not be forced to agree to every request, but they must give them proper consideration. These amendments that the Australian Greens will be moving will extend the right to request flexible working arrangements to all employees unless there are reasonable business grounds for refusal. In addition, the right to request would be strengthened for those with caring responsibilities, with employers only able to say no where there are serious countervailing business reasons. In all instances ongoing employees must have performed a minimum of 12 months service before the request can be made.


If an employee's request for flexible working arrangements is refused, Fair Work Australia would be empowered to hear an appeal and, where appropriate, make flexible working arrangement orders. Flexibility is a concept we hear about commonly from employers and employer organisations, but it does need to be a two-way street. That is what flexibility is. People need to have more control over the hours they work, the location they are working and the arrangement of those working hours.


The Australian Greens' amendments would give all employees an enforceable right to request arrangements that will deliver a better work-life balance. Of course, this must be balanced against legitimate operational needs of employers, and that is exactly what these amendments will do. They will provide a test that would make it easier for carers to obtain flexible working arrangements but would still allow any disputes to be resolved in Fair Work Australia by an independent umpire. It is important to note that these amendments are not radical or unprecedented, in fact. This proposal is actually quite a modest proposal by international standards and brings us into line with many other countries. 


The United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany have been doing this for a number of years and their experience is illustrative. A review of flexible working arrangement laws in these countries showed that a number of valuable lessons had been learned and a number of myths dispersed regarding the laws. There was a reasonable but manageable level of requests. The Netherlands had the highest level of requests with 14 per cent of employees, while the UK had only 3½ per cent and Germany recorded less than one per cent. Significantly, the majority of requests in each country were acceptable to employers. Costs were not a major problem with implementation and sometimes even resulted in savings. In addition, interestingly, very few requests ended up in dispute. In the Netherlands and Germany, fewer than 30 requests per country resulted in court action in the first two years of the law. 


So the overseas experience suggests that being obliged to provide flexible work for employees may in fact help companies by ensuring that they examine alternative models that they may not have been willing or able to consider previously. An expanded right to request flexible working arrangements does not have to override management prerogative; it simply ensures that full and proper consideration is given and provides an enforceable right and oversight from Fair Work Australia. 


I note that the 2012 Australian Work and Life Index report recommends that the right to request flexible working arrangements be widened and that workers be given protection from unreasonable refusal. The amendments that the Australian Greens will be moving will deliver on that recommendation and deliver a better work-life balance for Australian workers.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-11-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:24):  Before I make my contribution on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, I want to make a couple of comments about Senator Wright's contribution and the amendments that she will move on better work-life balance. This is not a radical move. We are not running sheltered workshops here. The UK is illustrative of the impact of this type of legislation on small businesses. When we talk about wanting better work-life balance for our workers, I have to say that as a daughter of a small business owner—and Mr Deputy President, I know that you were involved in small business as was Senator Scullion, who is in the chamber—work-life balance for workers is fantastic, but what about the work-life balance for those who actually produce and drive our economy—the small- to medium-sized enterprises in our communities? I can actually attest to the fact that their work-life balance is not particularly healthy. Yet they are out working, not always bringing in the big bucks but enjoying the independence that being a small business owner brings. 


I rise to speak today on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, and I say from the outset how disappointing it is that the Labor government is rushing through legislation—in this case, legislation that will affect every employer, every employee and every independent contractor—without allowing the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations adequate time to hold a thorough inquiry to investigate the detail of the bill. I am concerned that we are required to consider this bill in the Senate prior to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights completing its report and before the responsible minister responds to the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills regarding inappropriate delegation of power and possible undue trespass on personal rights and liberties. This government should stop shirking scrutiny and permit the Senate and its senators to fulfil their duties. 


The bill seeks to make several amendments as part of the government's first tranche of changes to the Fair Work Act, based selectively on reports from the Fair Work Act Review Panel and the Productivity Commission inquiry into default superannuation funds in modern awards. Many listening, including those in the chamber, will recall that the terms of reference for the Fair Work Act review were widely criticised for their limited scope, the omission of productivity, the impact of union militancy and the monetary impact of red tape. Indeed, we discovered that the Department of Finance and Deregulation and its Office of Best Practice Regulation shared the concerns of the coalition and the business sector. It was therefore no surprise to learn that the minister's political advisers had drafted the terms of reference to achieve Labor's political goals. They are probably the same advisers who draft the media releases that drive so much of this government's policy conversation with the Australian people. 


The bill's provisions include amending unfair dismissal provisions to align time frames at 21 days and an attempt to improve the integrity of application and hearing process. They include changes to the structure and operation of Fair Work Australia, including renaming it to the Fair Work Commission. There is also a provision to create two additional vice-presidential appointments. The desire of this government to simply rename, rebadge, things, as if we will not notice a change or the cost involved in doing so each and every time, seems to be its modus operandi at the moment, when we consider some of the bills that we discussed last week. The provisions also introduce a process for determining the most appropriate default super fund, clarify who can vote and participate in protected industrial action and who can rightfully act as a bargaining representative, as well as amendments to enterprise agreements, particularly for individuals. 


A number of submitters to our inquiry—I sit on the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations—expressed disappointment about the government's failure to address critical flaws with the existing legislation in the first tranche of changes. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 


Unfortunately, the report and its recommendations, as well as the first tranche response, will do little to address the problems identified by Australian employers … 


Apparently, Senator Wright, it is not a two-way street. The ACCI went on to say:


This includes the majority of SME business owners, many of whom have mortgaged the family home while trying to create valuable employment opportunities and build wealth for all Australians.


By simply ignoring the problems will not make them go away. 


Priority matters raised by submitters to our inquiry included the costly requirements to respond to trade union applications prior to bargaining being agreed; ensuring capacity to make greenfield arrangements without exorbitant wage and condition outcomes or unnecessary project delays; and ensuring protected industrial action can be taken only as a last resort. Multiple submitters opposed moves to prohibit single-employee enterprise agreements on the basis that it would disadvantage small business operators. A number of amendments were proposed, including limiting the provision to proprietary limited companies and excluding partnerships and sole traders or simply improving the 'better off' test for allowing enterprise agreements, regardless of the number of staff.


The Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry were one of the many peak bodies standing up for small businesses, saying they were:


… invariably award dependent, without in-house workplace relations expertise, and are most vulnerable to the inequities and uncertainties of the legislation of the day.


They went on to say:


… many VECCI members have described the policy outcomes of the Fair Work reforms as detrimental to the capacity of business to do business productively, flexibly and efficiently, and have not provided an appropriately modern regulatory framework for modern workplaces and business structures. More specifically, while the Federal Government promised that the Act would not increase costs, the cost of doing business has increased as a consequence of the Act—along with the administrative and practical on-costs of regulatory uncertainty, coupled with uneven and two or three track economic conditions many industries face.


One of the 'systemic defects' identified in the Master Builders Australia submission was bargaining provisions. They stated:


… many of the pattern agreements which are being rolled out across the country on a ""sign up or else"" basis, by the CFMEU in particular, contain provisions which adversely affect the efficient operation of building sites. Greater balance in the bargaining laws is a pressing reform. 


In my home state of Victoria, the CFMEU were condemned for approving illegal industrial action at Grocon sites earlier this year. It was illegal, it was disruptive and it was violent. Workers took out full-page ads in the state daily newspapers declaring they did not support their union's actions. Tens of thousands of dollars in members' fees were forked out for legal costs and a further $10.5 million is possibly payable to cover Grocon's losses due to union bosses choosing to act outside the law.


I take this opportunity to highlight a court judgment on a matter even closer to home, in my patron seat of Bendigo. The High Court delivered a landmark ruling in the Barclay v Bendigo TAFE case on adverse action in September, showing that union officials will not be immune from disciplinary action if they fail to perform in their job or breach employment conditions. Disappointingly but hardly surprisingly, Labor intervened in the matter on the side of—think about it; wait for it—the AEU official, arguing that it was the intention of the Fair Work Act to make union bosses untouchable even if they did the wrong thing. In a statement released on the judgment, Justice Heydon said the intervention of the workplace relations minister had increased the costs awarded against the union by around 15 per cent. He said 


… the Minister's stance before and during the oral hearing was not that of an intervener, but that of a partisan.


It is a damning assertion.


There are numerous examples of union officials failing to act in the best interests of their members, breaching financial management rules and using members' money for personal advantage that have hit the headlines this year—most noticeably the HSU scandal. The cost of the HSU investigation to Fair Work Australia is in excess of $1.8 million, not including the cost of its court action against the formerly Labor member for Dobell, following findings that he had used HSU funds to pay for escort services and other improper purposes. The coalition is firm in its view that this must stop. That is why we are currently seeking to amend related Fair Work acts to increase penalties to five years prison and/or up to $220,000 for those in breach, to improve protection for the members of these organisations.


Undeniably, Fair Work Australia's reputation took a hit during the protracted HSU investigation. The review panel recommended a name change that included the word 'commission' and removed the tarnished brand 'Fair Work'. It is a little surprising—but only a little, given that this is probably thematic every time I stand up to deliver a speech. It does not matter whether it is the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, Senator Back, or Indigenous affairs, Senator Scullion, or education policy or Senator Cash's work in equal opportunity for women last week. We changed the name. Let's see if we get a different outcome. We doubt it. So I am only a little surprised that the Prime Minister intervened and that subsequently, in a clear contradiction of the recommendation, the legislation seeks to change Fair Work Australia's name to the 'Fair Work Commission'. The coalition believes the review-recommended name of 'Australian Workplace Relations Commission' is more appropriate and will move an amendment to that effect. While there is apparently no monetary implication for this bill, I would be most interested to learn what the rebranding exercise will cost taxpayers.


Further on monetary implications, this bill includes provision to introduce two new vice-president appointments. The coalition shares the deep reservations expressed by many submitters to the EEWR inquiry, who noted that this was not recommended by the review panel—but don't let that get in the way of a piece of government legislation. It stinks of 'jobs for the boys' and is perhaps the minister's primary reason for suddenly pushing this legislation through parliament. I anticipate a couple of union mates are about to get a nice Christmas present. While cost implications have not been declared in the explanatory memorandum, the Deputy Secretary of DEEWR told our committee during the inquiry that there would be costs in the vicinity of $1.5 million per annum for these positions. The coalition strongly opposes the creation of the two additional vice-president positions and has moved amendments to that effect.


In the limited time remaining, I will touch briefly on amendments impacting superannuation. Minister Shorten took forever and a day to ask the Productivity Commission to conduct a much-needed inquiry into this matter and then cherry-picked its recommendations that essentially maintain the status quo. So, instead of introducing legislation that would ensure genuine competition and improve transparency, we have a bill that seeks to impose yet another layer of government intervention in the default fund market. Given that the MySuper bill has gone through the Senate this week, the coalition believes all MySuper products should be eligible to be selected under the award and proposes that the bill be amended to that effect.


The Liberal-National coalition is disappointed by government's failure to address the concerns of Australian employers and employees regarding its industrial relations laws. The coalition senators' dissenting report to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee's inquiry report into the Fair Work Amendment Bill, tabled yesterday, recommends several amendments to the bill at hand. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, will be moving those amendments to address the many flaws identified in the bill and I give them my full support.


For regional Australia, the whole concept of small to medium enterprises and their crucial underpinning of our local economies cannot be underestimated. I am not just talking about farmers or greengrocers. According to the ABS, if we divide our nation into the urban areas and those not in a capital city, we have 700,000 small businesses right across this nation that are outside of our capital cities. They employ 4.3 million people and their turnover is $200 billion a year. Some of them, like my own family business, are employing a father and some very recalcitrant children—Senator Back, I tell you, we had better take this one to Fair Work Australia, sorry, the commission—at two dollars a day. I think that was probably in 1978, but even if we extrapolate from that it is probably still under award. 




Senator Back:
  Very generous!




Senator McKENZIE:
  It taught me a lot about the value of hard work, listening to your father and getting on and saving, because clearly, at that rate, I was not going to get to my target goal purchase—which I think back then was a pair of rollerskates—anytime soon. 


Our small businesses out there in regional Australia provide 75 per cent of our employment. So these big-stick approaches do not work in companies where people are working alongside each other to ensure that the small business grows and develops. The employer wants his boss to succeed, wants the business to grow, wants to work hard so that he can not only maintain his job but his boss's business can contribute to the local footy club or the local surf lifesaving club. The employer and the employee have to fight fires together. They have to play footy on, hopefully, the same team because otherwise it could lead to some issues on a Monday morning, depending on what the game was.


Essentially, though, the way small business operates outside of capital cities is with a more collaborative approach. Small to medium enterprises underpin our local economies in the regions. We encourage the Greens and Labor to support our amendments to the bill so that we can make it the best piece of legislation going forward for industrial relations.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:40):  Deputy President, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. I intend to commence my contribution with a quiz but, because everybody in this chamber and certainly most people watching or listening would know the answers, there will not be a prize. I am going to give some quotes and then rhetorically answer the time and the person. The first quote is this:


I give you this as an absolute guarantee here on your program. I will not be prime minister of this country and appoint some endless tribe of trade union officials to staff or ex trade union officials to staff the key positions in this body. That's not my intention. That's not the way in which it's going to work.


Of course, all of you put your hands down now because you know who it is. It was the then leader of the Labor opposition, Mr Kevin Rudd, in 2007, prior to the 2007 election. As we know, by June 2010 his party was sick of him so they got rid of him. For those of you who did not get that one right, I move on to the next quote and again I ask you who the person was and the place. The quote is this:


The Labor Party is the party of truth telling. When we go out into the electorate and make promises, do you know what we would do in government: we would keep them. When we say them we mean them.


The same person said, 'The question of truth is not a game and it is not my game.' The same person also said:


On the question of standards in government—openness, accountability, divorcing the workings of government from the influence of peddlers and the donors—we need to be absolutely right, not just better by comparison.


On the question of how we treat each other, we must show our values in action.


Those latter quotes, as you will know, are from the now Prime Minister of this country, Ms Gillard. Whilst my final quote is not exactly relevant to the debate, I think it is very timely in the context of 27 November 2012, and it is this from the now Prime Minister, speaking on Newcastle radio in November 2006:


… question time is supposed to be one of our key accountability mechanisms. If there is a big scandal or a corruption allegation, you are supposed to be able to get to the matter in question time.


Madam Acting Deputy President, there is no need for you to take notes because I will be providing you with a script of what has been said.


We are dealing today, regrettably, with something that flies in the face of the sense and the words of everything that I have just quoted, and that is the indecent haste with which this Fair Work Amendment Bill is being rushed into and possibly through this place. I was a participant in the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee process at its meeting last Wednesday evening in which I had the opportunity to question only four witnesses. There were many more who wished to express their concern at the speed, the haste and, indeed, the accuracy of what we have seen leading to the bill before us today. More time should always have been allowed. If Ms Gillard's words were to be anything other than an empty bell in a cathedral then she should have directed her Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister Shorten, to comply with and allow full transparency, full dialogue, a full consultation process and the democratic process of witnesses being allowed to come before a committee of the Senate and put their views before committee members. In most instances, they were denied this.


I do not intend to go at length over areas that our leader, Senator Abetz, did or, indeed, Senator McKenzie did when she was contributing to this discussion this afternoon, except to speak briefly to the superannuation issue. I think that Senator Farrell made a contribution whilst Senator Abetz was speaking. As has been said—




Senator Farrell:
  A very good one!




Senator BACK:
  I am sure that Senator Farrell himself stands as testament to the fact that competition is far and away the best outcome for employees, for employers and for those who provide the services.


As has been said in the last few minutes, the MySuper legislation has passed through this place this week. And yet, perversely, we are not going to see the full allowance of competition in superannuation finding its way into this legislation proposed today. Indeed, it should. There were circumstances put to us the other night that there will be instances with some small employers where there will only be a choice of two and up to a maximum of 10. I ask: if an insurer is fully compliant under the MySuper provisions, why should the full range of competition not be available so that employers and employees alike can benefit from those superannuation provisions? I see no reason for it; no logic has been presented and, of course, we know that it has been roundly argued and disputed, including by those who appeared as witnesses.


Incidentally, the superannuation industry were denied the opportunity. So in the hearing the other night, it was only the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Mining and Metals Association that were able to contribute to that discussion on their behalf. But openness, transparency and the full competitive process should be the guidance by which this legislation goes through. I look forward to support from all sides of the chamber to ensure that full competition does find its way, and so the flawed legislation may be a little less flawed at the end of it.


The Financial Services Council said:


We believe the market structure proposed in this Bill for default super/MySuper will limit competition in the $1.4 trillion superannuation industry and result in reduced fee pressure and innovation for consumers.


There are the two characteristics, the two indicators: reduced fee pressure and innovation. And who might be the winners? Of course, we all know: the union-dominated super funds. That is not acceptable. As we know from the OECD, all OECD countries fundamentally rely on competition in product markets to organise production. Those are the justifications for the reason we must proceed.


I turn to the Fair Work review itself. Whilst I do not want to go back at great length, I could be reminded of Mr Rudd's comments about not stacking with endless tribes of trade union officials or ex-trade union officials, or indeed those sympathetic only to one side of the political process. But we know that in December last year Minister Shorten announced the details of the review of the Fair Work Act. In doing so, he was at a position where two things at fault happened: the first was in his choice of those who were to do the review, and the second was the very, very limited scope which he gave those people. Indeed, he insulted them; he insulted their professionalism in so limiting them.


As it is known, the coalition has flagged its general support for the review. But look at those reviewers—Professor Ron McCallum, Dr John Edwards and the Hon. Michael Moore. As I said, they were given skewed and limited terms of reference. In fact, I think we used the analogy from the situation of a horse on a race track; that is, with their blinkers on. The terms of reference failed to address the essential ingredients of productivity, flexibility and union militancy. Those areas were deliberately denied the reviewers. You have to ask why that could be the case in the first review.


Because I have introduced it into the written report, I do not propose to comment adversely on the participants themselves, except to say that they could hardly, at least in two cases, have been regarded as fully independent in terms of what they have said or written in the past about the process, and except to say that Professor McCallum raged against the use of the corporations power by the coalition when in government, but he has been strangely silent on its use under the Fair Work Act. In these circumstances an opportunity was lost—an opportunity to look at productivity, flexibility and union militancy. And this bill will be the poorer because of it.


If I may turn to the question of productivity, I will quote a Western Australian colleague, Michael Chaney. Chaney chairs Woodside Petroleum, he chairs the National Australia Bank, and he was the chief executive of WesFarmers when he took that organisation into ownership of Bunnings and when he extended the WesFarmers organisation considerably. As we know, under his successor, Richard Goyder, that organisation has gone further and taken over Coles. He is the sort of person one would listen to—the sort of person who has created the employment opportunities around this nation that everybody so proudly trumps as their own. It is the Michael Chaneys of this world who are the ones who are the champions when it comes to creating long-term, high-quality, high-value employment. What is Chaney saying? I quote:


Australia will find it difficult to achieve meaningful economic growth without boosting productivity through micro-economic reform.


'Labour market reform urgently needed,' says Chaney:


I'm concerned that if we don't manage to lift our productivity, we are going to find it very difficult to achieve any real economic growth.


He was talking about high terms of trade, high levels of investment up to now, strong population and workforce growth.


This is not the sort of the man who ought to be ignored. He should not have been ignored by Minister Shorten. Nor should the review panellists have been denied the opportunity to actually examine some of these issues.


It goes, of course, to the fact that we asked the department during the inquiry about two key performance indicators. We asked about productivity, especially as measured through work days lost due to industrial action, and it was not possible in the committee hearing to learn of any improvements in productivity as a result of the Fair Work Act coming into existence. At a time when Europe is in its demise and when so many countries in Europe would be bankrupt if they were companies, at a time when the United States of America is looking very, very jaded in terms of its economic outlook, and at a time when even China—that powerhouse that has kept Australia alive and its head above water over the last few years—is now looking at a downturn, it is an opportunity lost that this review did not address itself to those issues associated with productivity improvement and union militancy.


The issue of the vice-presidents of Fair Work Australia has been canvassed here this afternoon. As was said a few moments ago, it was originally the view that there was a no-cost implication to this particular legislation. Of course, when I asked the representative from the department, he concurred with me that there was an estimated $1.5 million of added cost as a result of this introduction. Senior Deputy President Kaufman wrote to the President, Iain Ross, recently, questioning the need for two new vice-president positions, saying that it was reintroducing a level of seniority at the tribunal that was removed under the Fair Work Act in 2009. Senior Deputy Presidents Watson and Richards have written to Justice Ross of their concerns that the government will use the opportunity to install government-friendly appointees. The review panel themselves were not of a view that there should be new appointees.


A commitment was given to us in the hearing the other night that this process would be open and transparent and that there would be advertisement undertaken. The officer said to me, 'No, the department has not given any advice to the minister and, as far as the department is aware, the minister has not started the process because he wants it to be seen to be as at arms-length.' Let us work out into the future whether that is the case. It was Mr Knott from AMMA who, appearing before us, said:


I think this does give the opportunity … to really damage the independence or the perceived independence and impartiality of the tribunal. We have senior appointments made to the tribunal which, through the political cycle—there are people who are appointed by one side who may not be appointed by another side, but that is the way it goes over the fullness of time in the political cycle.


And, as Senator Abetz quoted from the submission of the Law Council of Australia:


As a general principle, once a person has been appointed to sit on a Court or independent Tribunal with designated powers and privileges, any change that would have the effect of removing or reducing that particular person's powers or privileges while not affecting the powers and privileges of other Members of that Tribunal—


and this is the key point—


has a tendency to undermine the independence of the Court or Tribunal.


These are very important points. They go to amendments that will be debated later in this place, and I look forward to there being agreement based on those concerns of very, very diverse and independent people.


There has been discussion of the term 'the Fair Work Commission'. We know that the panel recommended that there be a change, that the words 'fair work' be removed. I believe the MUA recommended a change. AMMA and other employer based groups have recommended that there be a change, and it will be the recommendation of the coalition that the term 'the Australian Workplace Relations Commission' or similar becomes the title. It is interesting that the most simple of the panel's recommendations, being the change from Fair Work Australia to something akin to the Australian Workplace Relations Commission, has been rejected by the Labor government, despite its support from a broad sector, including the President of Fair Work Australia, the Law Council, the maritime workers union, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Australian Mines and Metals Association. They have all recommended the change but we know, of course, that it is Prime Minister Gillard, whose quotes I commenced my contribution with, who is the one who has demanded that we continue that circumstance.


There were opportunities lost in this review. Senator McKenzie mentioned the case of Barclay v Bendigo TAFE. It was the High Court which came down with its adjudication and decision in this area. There were recommendations that could indeed have found their way into these changes we are talking about today. It is most interesting that Justice Heydon of the High Court said in his judgement, speaking about the intervention by the responsible minister, Minister Shorten:


… the Minister's stance before and during the oral hearing was not that of an intervener, but that of a partisan. For example, some of the Minister's oral submissions were directed to factual material. This is hardly the province of an intervener.


What a damning statement about the minister responsible for this portfolio.


'This is hardly the province of an intervener'—I would certainly not want that said about me.


Recommendation 47 of the review panel, which time prevents me from reading out, went to the very points of Barclay v Bendigo. The other one of course was the full Federal Court in JJ Richards and, again, the review panel itself made recommendations to deal with that inequity, which of course played its way out through the courts, and, again, at the direction of the minister, this also failed to find its way into the recommendations. I commend the amendments that we are to deal with and I certainly do not like the text of the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,17,1
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (18:00):  I am surprised that I have to follow Senator Back and that we do not have too many speakers from the other side. Despite three-quarters of Labor senators being ex-union bosses, not one of them aside from the minister, I understand, can bring themselves to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. 


This bill will have a significant impact on every employer, employee and independent contractor in this country, and now the labour movement is allowing the legislation to go through without a murmur, at least from the representatives of the movement in this chamber. Not one of them wants to come in here and defend the provisions that we are debating here today. Not one of them wants to come in here and debate workplace relations out in the open. They prefer to do those deals in those smoke-filled rooms, move the amendments at the national conference and then put them up and hope that no-one will oppose them or have anything to say about them.


Well, we will debate them. We will talk about them. The reason we do so is that, as I said before, the Fair Work Act is a very important act, one of the most important acts before us in this chamber. The opposition are disappointed that this act was not the subject of a full-blooded independent review. A number of my colleagues have discussed that in some detail. I will not go over the same ground, except to ask: what has the government got to lose from a full-blooded review? If we are confident of the impact of this act on the wellbeing of this country and on various parameters of that wellbeing, what did the government have to lose from having a full-blooded review, an independent review? While three eminent persons were given the job of undertaking this review, they were members of the club. They were insiders. In many ways they were being asked to review their own handiwork, or handiwork that they strongly supported or for which they had an ideological disposition. It is fine to have an ideological disposition, but the fact of the matter is that we have an obligation as a parliament to look more impartially and objectively at the impact of legislation on the economic condition of our country, the social condition of our country, and all of those desiderata that are important in considering public policy. 


Unfortunately, on this occasion we had an insider review. It was only through freedom of information legislation that we were able to glean that there had been a debate within the Public Service about the terms of reference for the review and the fact that the Public Service in the tradition of giving frank and fearless advice said that there should be fairly broad terms of reference so that the review could look at all those issues around productivity and flexibility which are so important when you discuss industrial relations. One of the members of that review, Professor John Edwards—former economic adviser to Paul Keating, former journalist, and I think now a member of the Reserve Bank board—has argued on many occasions that there is not much of a linkage between the industrial relations system and productivity. This is not right, there is a major linkage. But it was surprising that he, as an eminent economist, would make that sort of point. The reason I mention it here is that this was precisely the reason he was chosen to do this review, because of the disposition he brought to the review. So we ended up with hamstrung, politically determined terms of reference which largely guided, I think, the committee or the panel to the recommendations that they made. 


There will be some areas in which we will support certain of the recommendations, because we think that they will advance certain issues that we have identified in our consultations with business, both large and small. But on the whole we are disappointed by the way that this review has gone forward. We should not be surprised that that was the method of carriage, because this has been a government which is owned lock, stock and barrel by the trade union movement. They bought this government with their 'Your rights at work' campaign in the run-up to the 2007 election.


It is true that the dragon of Work Choices did rouse some of the slumbering members of the union movement from the last part of the Howard years. That is true. But while Labor in parliament, particularly in that other place, argued about case studies of employees being allegedly exploited by employers, the real motive behind the trade union movement and its opposition to Work Choices came from the fact that they saw it somehow as an existential threat to them. 


It was not an existential threat to them. In a competitive marketplace you earn the right to represent others. They were afraid of competition, they were afraid of contestability, therefore they put all their resources behind electing a government that would not only remove Work Choices but also turn the clock back on industrial relations even to pre the Keating era. It was the Keating government that, after the 1993 election, made the first major moves in the direction of enterprise bargaining. It was the Keating government that moved on enterprise bargaining even though they twinned it with some backward steps on unfair dismissals, which I will discuss later. But the point is that the bargain that was struck between the Parliamentary Labor Party and the trade union movement was to put in place this legislation which turned the clock back on industrial relations and undid some of the good work of not only the Keating period but also the Howard period, particularly in relation to things like Australian workplace agreements which added another layer of flexibility to the labour market.


That is the context in which all of this occurred. In fact in 2007, Julia Gillard came up with an extremely pro-union draft industrial relations policy that Kevin Rudd had to water down because of employer resistance in the run-up to the 2007 election. He became so worried about losing business support that he watered the policy down.


Then when they were in government the policy was implemented. It was an election commitment. A commitment was made that after two years there would be in effect a post-implementation review. That is where the review we are talking about today originated.


In the meantime, government has not only moved to put in place a more retrograde industrial relations system but also complemented it by a whole series of other measures that further entrench the role of trade unions in the workplace and the role of productivity-reducing employment practices. I am referring here to specific packages in areas like the shipping industry. The shipping reform package essentially gave concessions to shipping companies and gave important benefits to the Maritime Union of Australia. The Maritime Union of Australia promised, hand on heart, that there would be a productivity compact between the shipping companies and the MUA that would deliver major productivity gains that would offset the costs of the package we are talking about in the shipping industry. We are yet to see the colour of their money on the productivity compact, and we will be waiting awhile.


In the road transport sector we had the establishment of the transport remuneration tribunal under the guise of promoting driver safety. We all support greater driver safety, but this has become a mechanism for further regulation of wage rates in the transport sector. That tribunal works as a subset of Fair Work Australia so its genesis and outlook are very much from within that framework of Fair Work Australia.


In the building and construction industry we had the watering down of the Building and Construction Commission. It was defanged. In 2007 the now government said, hand on heart, that it would not water down the cop on the beat in the construction sector, but it has. We are seeing the impact of that in a number of industry sectors, particularly obviously construction and building. You just have to go to Victoria to see some of the disputes going on. In the centre of Melbourne there is the Grocon dispute and in Geelong as well there is a dispute. The one in Geelong I think involves the CFMEU. But my point is that the Fair Work Act is buttressed by a whole series of other actions that this government has taken to entrench trade union privilege in the Australian economy.


I turn now to superannuation, another area where the government allegedly is moving in the direction of greater contestability—in this case in relation to the default funds that workers can use for their superannuation. Again what will happen here is that advice will be provided by a panel and Fair Work Australia will make those judgements. Again it will therefore not be a genuinely open, contestable and transparent process where any eligible fund can be a default fund but it will be one which is very much controlled within the framework of Fair Work Australia.


This is where we come up against one of the greater achievements of the labour movement—that is, the way some of these organisations are staffed. In the case of Fair Work Australia we have had the debate in the context of this bill about the creation of two new senior vice-presidential roles. There has been much speculation as to the sorts of people who will occupy those roles. We have had speculation about Jeff Lawrence, a former Secretary of the ACTU, being appointed. It has been the tradition over the years to have employer and employee advocates and representatives become members of some of these quasi-judicial bodies. The speculation has been that it might be Jeff Lawrence, a former Secretary of the ACTU, or Josh Bornstein, a lawyer. Those who watched the ABC miniseries about the waterfront dispute will know that Josh Bornstein played a role in the waterfront dispute by sort of advising I think the MUA at that stage. Lately he has been tweeting advice to the Prime Minister about how to handle the AWU matter or seeking to promote her cause in that regard. He was recently quoted talking in a lecture about the lack of a link in economics between industrial relations systems and frameworks and productivity. Those are some of the potential candidates for senior vice-presidential roles on Fair Work Australia.


Any government has the right to appoint whomever it wants, but you need to have a process which gives confidence to people in the marketplace—employers and employees—that they will face a group of people who will be impartial, objective and consistent with the objects of the act in carrying out their duties. That is not what you would get here if you get these sorts of players promoted to these roles. We already know something about the sorts of players on these bodies. An overwhelming number of people appointed to Fair Work Australia have a trade union pedigree, including Bernie Riordan, a former official of the Electrical Trade Union, who was appointed in the last round. He mysteriously had civil proceedings against him settled the day before his appointment. If I recall correctly, Mr Riordan comes out of New South Wales and he not only was a trustee of his industry super fund but also was involved with a group called Chifley Financial Services, which provided services to that fund. That goes to the issue about the conflicts of interest that exist through the relationship between the trade union movement and some of the industry super funds and the fact that some of these industry people also provide services to some of these funds. 


If I recall correctly, Mr Riordan at one stage was also one of the leaders of the opposition to the privatisation of electricity assets in New South Wales. At a time when you have Martin Ferguson, an ex-President of the ACTU and one of the real straight talkers in this government, calling on state governments to privatise their electricity assets in order to create a more competitive and more efficient national electricity market you have people like Bernie Riordan floating around Fair Work Australia bringing his age of the dinosaur views, if I can put it like that, into play on industrial relations. That is the nature of what we are dealing with here.


There has been debate in the context of this bill about the name of Fair Work Australia and the fact that 'fair work' will be retained. The reason 'fair work' will be retained is, as I understand it, that the Prime Minister herself intervened, because obviously she wants to create that link with the policy she took to the 2007 election. What that tells you is that they are unreconstructed, that there is no appetite for taking reform forward. I have said it before and I will say it again: the trade union movement of 2012 is not a patch on some of the trade union leaders of the eighties and the nineties who were prepared to be in the vanguard of economic reform in the national interest. Yes, they got benefits for their members out of it but the point is they did something that was also in the national interest. They were able to balance the two in a way that was beneficial for all of us.


There has been discussion in recent days in another place about matters to do with the Australian Workers Union. All I will say on that point is that that discussion has highlighted a culture in parts of the union movement of standing over businesses in order to get contributions, accountability for which—as we have seen in certain parts of the AWU in the 1990s—was not what it should be. This culture of standing over companies and getting money—money which was not used for the purposes for which it was allegedly raised—raises important questions about the governance of the trade union movement. I think a future coalition government should take a very good look at the structure and governance of the trade union movement. It should be subject to a no-advantage test, as is the way I would put it; in other words, to create a level playing field between unions and other bodies that want to represent workers. What we want to create is a situation where it is a competitive marketplace in representing workers and where workers have all sorts of options, because it has got to be a system which is driven by the interests of the worker, the customer, and not driven by the interests of a union hierarchy—because today the government is driven by the interests of a union hierarchy and so is the labour movement. So we need that culture to change and you can only change it through competition and contestability.


I now want to turn to unfair dismissal. Here the government is making some adjustments in relation to the rules around unfair dismissal which we welcome in the context of dealing with potentially vexatious claims. Let me make this point in the context of my work with the Coalition Deregulation Taskforce, a very good task force of which Senator Bushby was deputy chairman and did an excellent job around the country. One of the areas on which we got a lot of feedback was unfair dismissal and that the concept, principle or phenomenon of going away money had returned, that it was much easier for an employer just not to have to worry about dealing with the matter through the fair work system and that an employer would in fact be getting advice from Fair Work Australia that the best thing would be 'just to settle this and move the person on'. Now that just creates an extra tax, a tax borne by employees, because if it becomes harder to fire there is less of an incentive to hire. Particularly when it comes to small business, we need to be doing everything we can to reduce the burden of regulation, compliance and paperwork on small business. So their having to shell out $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 or whatever it is simply to settle with an employee because they cannot be bothered to go through the process, given the time that is required to deal with it in a more rigorous and thorough way, is a condemnation of the system as it stands. So for us any support for reform in that direction is welcome and we will of course support that.


We believe that the fair work review should have gone further. It should have looked not only at the matters discussed here today but also particularly at what is happening in the building and construction industry. There should be more focus on this. Martin Ferguson, the Minister for Resources and Energy, made it very clear recently that he was concerned about the upsurge in costs associated with infrastructure investment and building and the impact that would have on our competitiveness in the mining and resources industries. He called an end to the price boom in the mining and energy market. What he was talking about was that now was the time for the hard yakka of extracting the volumes and that to extract the volumes required being competitive. It does not mean cutting people's wages but it means restraining our costs and boosting our productivity, and these are all issues that the government has tended to sweep under the carpet. These are all issues for which the government has tended to in effect say, 'Well, look, if costs are high in Australia it's because we've got a high exchange rate and that explains most of it.' Well, it does not explain most of it. The high exchange rate is a factor but the fact of the matter is any respectable international survey will show you that over the last five years our cost structure has gone up considerably. We are one of the highest cost locations in the world, both in a consumer sense and an industry cost sense, and it is getting worse.


The challenge we face in the years ahead, as the terms of trade settle given all the rest of it, is that the hard yakka to create jobs and to create higher real incomes and living standards will come from improving our productivity and improving our competitiveness. This bill in its current form does nothing to address any of those issues. It is window dressing of the type that we have come to expect from this government. There will be no change on this front until we have an honest discussion about the parameters around industrial relations policy and we have a government which is willing to enforce the law and make everybody, including the trade union movement, subject to the law.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (18:20):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. Whilst the coalition has some serious concerns with this bill, as Senator Abetz has advised we will not be opposing it, albeit Senator Abetz will be moving amendments during the committee stage. The coalition supports a majority of the recommendations from the fair work review. However, we note, in relation to this bill, that the government has yet again failed to stand up to the union bosses and is only implementing non-controversial recommendations from the fair work review in the short term. That is hardly surprising to anybody on this side of the chamber. Why would the government want to stand up to the people who are their best mates? In relation to the fair work review itself, the coalition believes that the terms of reference deliberately excluded the vital ingredients of productivity, flexibility and union boss militancy and were clearly, without a doubt, skewed towards a predetermined outcome.


Coalition senators understand, as do the majority of the Australian people, that when a Labor government that is made up of former union bosses, and held accountable only by and to its union mates, makes changes to the industrial relations system in Australia, those changes are never about increasing productivity. They are never about, as Senator Sinodinos so eloquently said, furthering the Australian economy and they are never about what is truly fair for the average worker or for the person who is employing the average worker. They are only ever about Labor delivering on a promise that it has made to one of its union mates. That is hardly policy that has been made in the national interest.


Despite the review being a disappointing document on so many levels, we do note that in relation to certain issues there is no doubt that the reviewers, albeit that they were hand-picked by the Labor government, were without a doubt mugged by the reality that the current system is just not working. I take the Senate to some of the recommendations that the fair work review panel made: that Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman should actively encourage more productive workplaces through the promotion of best practice model productivity clauses for modern awards and agreements; changes to the individual flexibility agreements to make them more attractive to both employers and employees, including an increase in the minimum term from 28 days to 90 days; changes to the way in which greenfields agreements are reached and provisions for protracted negotiations; and changes to the good faith bargaining provisions of the act to rectify very serious problems that were identified in the JJ Richards case.


The recommendations that I have just read out, which were made by Labor's own fair work review panel, are recommendations in relation to issues that the coalition has for some time now been drawing attention to and that, I note, both the Labor Party and the union bosses have consistently attacked us on. However, what do we have now? We have Labor's own hand-picked review panel picking up on the issues that the coalition has been highlighting for some time and making recommendations in that regard. One can only hope that, after the government has once again freely spent a million dollars of taxpayers' money and now finally has a review in its hot little hands, it may at some point in the future decide to give consideration to what are very good recommendations coming out the review going forward.


In relation to the bill itself, we are yet again disappointed that the government has rushed through the relevant committee a significant bill that will affect each employer, each employee and each independent contractor in Australia without, once again, the parliament being able to undertake a fulsome inquiry. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives at 4.30 pm on 30 October. The bill was then called on for debate the next morning, on 31 October, and a vote was taken later on that day. To date, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has given no explanation to the parliament as to why there is a critical need to pass this legislation without subjecting it to the scrutiny to which it should be subjected. In that regard, I echo the comments of Senator Sinodinos, whom I am following in this debate. If one looks at the speakers list on this exceptionally important piece of legislation, you would actually think that the only people who care about industrial relations in this country and who are concerned about the negative impact that this bill may have are coalition senators. There does not appear to be anyone other than the minister on the Labor side of the house who is prepared to come into this place and justify why the government is not implementing more of the recommendations from the fair work review.


One might say that perhaps those on the other side are a little embarrassed that one of the things that this bill will do is create two additional jobs for their mates. In fact, maybe their mates have already been hand-picked and they are just waiting for the announcement. I can only assume that those on that side do not care about industrial relations in this country or do not care about the negative impact this bill may have on productivity going forward, or perhaps they are just too embarrassed to come in here and explain why, contrary to evidence given to a Senate inquiry, they are going ahead with creating additional jobs for their mates.


The bill itself purports to implement the first tranche of 17 recommendations arising from the government's review of the Fair Work Act. The bill also seeks to make changes to the internal architecture of Fair Work Australia and provide the Fair Work Australia president with further powers. In addition, the bill implements the government's response to the Productivity Commission review into default superannuation arrangements in modern awards. This response will see the continuation of the process where conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia will continue to select default super funds under modern awards.


The coalition has a longstanding position in relation to this and we believe that any MySuper compliance superannuation fund should be eligible for selection as a default fund. For the Labor Party, though, it is all about their mates in industry funds. In fact, when the Prime Minister said, 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' she would perhaps have been better off saying, 'There'll be no competition in relation to superannuation funds under a government that I lead,' because that is exactly what we are seeing as a result of this legislation. The coalition is deeply disappointed that the government has introduced legislation into parliament which, instead of ensuring genuine competition—but the government does not like competition; it does not like competition because it might be shown up—will impose an additional layer of government intervention in the default fund market. The coalition is also extremely concerned that Minister Shorten has been so desperate to protect the vested interests of his friends in the union movement that he has actually lost sight of his responsibility as a minister of the Crown to act in the public interest.


I alluded to the fact that this legislation is creating further jobs for Labor government members' mates—jobs for the boys; jobs for unionists. Well, it does. The bill also contains the creation of two additional vice-president positions at Fair Work Australia, two of the highest officers in the organisation. Minister Shorten has completely failed to explain to the parliament why these positions are necessary or justified, apart from the department's submission that the President of Fair Work Australia sought the additional roles. These two positions would slot into the second and third most senior officers of the tribunal. Since the announcement of these two additional positions, there has been widespread community concern, including from within Fair Work Australia.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:56):  The coalition welcomes a number of aspects in the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012 but also has great reservations about a number of other aspects. To set the scene for the debate that we are having today it is necessary to remind ourselves that there was no regulatory impact statement when the Fair Work Act was implemented. As a result, the government was required to have a review within two years. Finally, on 20 December last year, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Bill Shorten, announced the review.


The review, colleagues will remember, was a review undertaken by hand-picked panellists whose pedigree was that they were Labor sympathisers. We had the good professor who, after only two months of Work Choices, was able to make definitive statements about it and yet, two years after the Fair Work Act, came up with the lame description that it required 'more time' before we could tell its impact. This is the same professor who railed against the use of the corporations power for coalition workplace relations policy yet has remained strangely silent when it comes to the use of the corporations power for Labor workplace relations legislation. So, a very simple approach: Liberal, bad; Labor, good. Hardly what you would expect from an academic and hardly what you would expect from a person who would provide an independent mind and judgement to these matters of great importance to our nation and of great importance to individual workers right around Australia.


I could go on with other panel members but I will not. What we do know is that the terms of reference under which this cherry-picked, hand-picked panel had to work with were skewed. How do we know that? We know because, after many questions not being answered, my office finally undertook a freedom of information request which showed the documentation and the email trails where the department quite rightly had expressed concern that fundamental issues such as union militancy, red tape and productivity were not part of the terms of reference. Long story short: hand-picked panel, skewed terms of reference. Nevertheless, it provided a report which was, as one might expect, disappointing.


But, nevertheless, there were 53 recommendations, and a majority of those recommendations were recommendations with which the coalition agreed, recommendations where—despite the biased nature of the panel, despite the skewed terms of reference—reality mugged the panel to such an extent that they had to accept a number of recommendations. As a result, there are a number of issues here where the coalition is in full agreement. But I might add that instead of implementing all of the 53 recommendations or seeking to deal with them, Mr Shorten has done a political act in relation to this and has only dealt with 17 out of the 53 recommendations. Let me go through a few of them.


One of them is that the panel recommended that the Fair Work Act be amended to expressly empower Fair Work Australia to strike out an award variation application that is not made in accordance with the Fair Work Act, is frivolous or vexatious or has no reasonable prospects of success. Good, sensible stuff; the coalition fully supports it. I move on to the implementation of recommendations 44 and 45, where the panel recommended that the President of Fair Work Australia give consideration to requiring applicants to provide more information about the circumstances of the dismissal in the initial documentation lodged with Fair Work Australia. That is in relation to unfair dismissals. Similarly in relation to unfair dismissals there is the suggestion that costs orders be able to be made.


I indicate that as a coalition we have been talking about that for about two years and, yes, the ACTU, unable to help itself, had to come out and condemn us. Interestingly enough, the Fair Work Act review panel came to the conclusion that in effect what we as a coalition were saying was right. Small business has suffered, and suffered terribly, under this extreme unfair dismissal regime and it is a credit to the Labor government that they are willing to address these issues at least in part. It is somewhat strange that when the coalition make such recommendations, the ACTU is out there opposing it; when the government finally get mugged by the reality that these things do have to be changed, the ACTU is deafeningly silent because other trade-offs have been made with them.


Allow me to turn to those aspects of the bill where we as a coalition have very real issues and where we will be seeking to move amendments during the committee stage. First of all, this bill also contains matters extraneous to the Fair Work Act review panel's recommendations. A matter that the coalition have long been concerned about is the default superannuation schemes in the modern awards. We believe that they should be opened up for competition so that workers can get the best deal possible. But of course when you have industry super funds that are run by union and employer groups and they are the organisations making representations to Fair Work Australia, guess what? There is always a consent agreement that these superannuation funds should be part of the award, part of the default superannuation mechanism. It has always been the coalition's view, and my personally strong view, that these superannuation funds should not be allowed to be default funds just because two sectional interests happen to agree because they have certain benefits.



Senator Farrell interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Farrell interjects and says, 'I think that they are the best funds.' My view is, very clearly: let them prove that they are the best funds. And if they are, they have nothing to fear from an expert panel examining them and determining whether they are worthy. In fact, that is what the government's own review, conducted by the Productivity Commission, actually recommended. But what do the government do? They do not implement the Productivity Commission's recommendations, because they are hell-bent on protecting the gravy train of certain of the industry super funds from which the trade union movement in particular does exceedingly well. This is not serving the interests of Australian workers, it is not serving the interests of superannuation generally, it is not serving the best interests of our nation as a greater proportion of the population need to rely on their own retirement funds and are no longer able to rely on the pension. As a result, we will be moving amendments, and I will be expanding on that later, to have those schedules removed.


Another aspect of this bill, which is gobsmackingly arrogant, gobsmackingly vain of this Prime Minister, is the government's refusal to accept that the name of Fair Work Australia should be changed. That was the finding of the review panel. It is the considered opinion of the President of Fair Work Australia. It is the considered opinion of the trade union movement. It is the considered opinion of employer groups. It is the considered opinion of the Independent Contractors Association, the Council of Small Business of Australia, the Housing Industry Association. Do you know who else is on the list? The Maritime Union of Australia. So we have this absolute clean sweep across the board, from the MUA right through to employer organisations to the President of Fair Work Australia, and the recommendation of the President of Fair Work Australia itself. And their strong recommendation: delete the name 'Fair Work' from the name 'Fair Work Australia'. Why? Because the brand has been trashed. Why has the brand been trashed? Because of the way Fair Work Australia has conducted the Health Services Union inquiry. I have given speeches about that in the past and will not dwell on it for too long. Further, the brand has been trashed by the appointment of an endless tribe of ex-trade union bosses to sit on the bench of Fair Work Australia. Furthermore, the name 'Fair Work Australia' is Orwellian if ever there was such an example. 


That is why every single sensible contributor—and it is not often I will be saying that about the Maritime Union of Australia, might I add—from the Maritime Union of Australia right through all agreed that 'Fair Work' should be deleted from the name. But we have the vanity of this Prime Minister saying, 'Nobody will stand in the way of Fair Work Australia remaining.' If Labor and the Greens want to combine here in this place and retain the trashed brand of 'Fair Work Australia', they can be our guest, but in so doing they will be doing a disservice to the workplace relations system in this country. They know it, the panel knew it, the President of Fair Work Australia knows it, the union movement knows it, the employers know it. Everybody knows it other than the woman that gave it the name—namely, the current Prime Minister, who was then Deputy Prime Minister, Ms Gillard. It is her vanity that stops the name change that would be such an improvement and cultural change that is so vitally important. That is why we will be recommending that the name should be changed to the 'Australian Workplace Relations Commission'.


More important for us is the amendment being moved by the government to the Fair Work Act to create two new vice-presidential positions. Out of the 250 submissions to the Fair Work Act review, did anybody raise this issue? No. Was it recommended by the review panel? No. From where did it come and why is it so urgent? Nobody can explain other than this is a blatant attempt by this government, thinking that it is in its death throes, to try to future-proof Fair Work Australia from any attempt at getting a balanced bench. We know that the new president—and I mean him no disrespect by this—of Fair Work Australia could only have gotten the job, I am sure, because in a previous life he was an assistant secretary of the ACTU. You then have a look at the endless tribe of ex-trade union officials that have been appointed to Fair Work Australia. You then ask yourself the question: why do we need these two extra positions, at a cost to the taxpayer of $1.5 million per annum? That is the estimate from the department. When the government budget is haemorrhaging everywhere, we are creating two new positions to try to leapfrog all the other senior officials in Fair Work Australia. 


Is this just the coalition being concerned? No, it is not. No less a body than the Law Council of Australia has come out in condemnation of this proposal, because they see it for what it is: an undermining of this quasi-judicial body by creation of new positions to try to sideline other people who have seniority within Fair Work Australia. Of course, who are these two people with seniority in Fair Work Australia? Former Howard government appointees, Mr Lawler and Mr Graeme Watson—or should I call them vice-presidents Lawler and Watson. The government has put no argument to us as to why this is such an important amendment, such an important proposal, other than to try to ensure that they so stack out Fair Work Australia that no government will be able to correct the balance for a long, long time. It is shameful, it is transparent and it is another indication that Mr Shorten in this role as workplace relations minister does not understand that he has an overriding responsibility to the national interest. He still sees himself as a trade union boss just wearing a different hat and, as a result, he will do that which he believes is necessary to advance the cause of ex-trade union bosses. That is not what provides confidence to the Australian people and to Australian workers and Australian businesses that Fair Work Australia will provide sound, balanced decisions in this difficult and vexed area.


Further, the government needs to explain why this legislation was rushed into the House of Representatives one day and then passed the very next day—forced through. Then we have it moved in the Senate today that the bill be exempted from the cut-off. We had the embarrassment yesterday of the government doing this with another workplace relations bill only to be scrambling around with amendments to try to fix it up. That is why there are these time gaps between legislation moving from the House to the Senate. That is why bills should lay on the table. That is why proper consideration by Senate committees should be allowed. But since the Greens and Labor have got control of this place the Senate committee system has fallen into disrepute.


This important bill was given four witnesses to be heard and was rushed through in one day.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  We hear Senator Polley's interjection, which is very unwise because we know that, since the Greens-Labor alliance have got control of this place, they have thus far guillotined 150 bills since the last election. When the coalition had control of the Senate, those opposite condemned us because we had guillotined less than one-third of that number in the whole three-year period of the government. They have now gone strangely silent because the Greens-Labor alliance opposite know how they are abusing this chamber and are ensuring that legislation is not being properly considered. So much for the Greens and the country Independents promising a new paradigm of legislative transparency, that the parliament would be made to work as it should. Here we have bills rushed through the House, rushed through the Senate, no proper Senate committee stages and, as a result, bad legislation getting passed.


The coalition's view on this legislation is that there are a lot of good things in it which we support. There are also many bad things in it which we oppose. We will pursue each and every one of our amendments to a division. We will seek to put on record our very important concerns. If at the end of the day it is the Senate's view that the legislation should be unamended—and it is quite clear what its view will be—we will not oppose.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-11-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:16):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. The Australian Greens will be seeking leave to move amendments—we are calling them the better work/life balance amendments—that mirror the Fair Work Amendment (Better Work/Life Balance) Bill 2012 introduced by my colleague Adam Bandt in the other place.


Statistics constantly tell us that in Australia there is often a mismatch between the hours that people actually work and the hours that they want to work. On average, full-time employees would like to work about 5.6 hours less per week while part-time workers would like to work around four hours less than they are currently working. In addition, as a country we perform $72 billion of unpaid overtime each year. It cuts the other way too: there are many people—though, according to the studies, a lesser number—who would like to work more hours than they are currently working but are unable to.


A 2010 study on the health and working conditions of approximately 78,000 working Australians concluded:


…it may be counterproductive for employers to expect long working hours as employees are likely to take more time off and work less efficiently.


The study also commented that there is considerable evidence of an association between work demands and poor health. We have a situation where just over half of all Australians want to change their hours of work, even if this might impact on their income.


The Australian Work and Life Index—AWALI—is an annual study by the Centre for Work and Life at the University of South Australia. I am familiar with the work of AWALI, and it is held in great respect. The authors use the term 'work/life interference', and the 2012 data shows it is persistent and for some people getting worse. The report noted that around one-quarter of the Australians surveyed report that work frequently, often or almost always interferes with other life activities. Women's work/life outcomes are worse than men's when we take into account differences in work hours. Long hours and a poor fit between actual and preferred working hours are both associated with worse work/life outcomes. Most of those who work long hours would prefer not to. I am sure it is not a sentiment that would be understood by members of this chamber or the other place, but apparently that is the case in Australia!


Unfortunately, things are getting worse for women working full time. Work/life interference for this group has increased from 2007 to 2012. Full-time women's dissatisfaction with their work/life balance has risen from 15.9 per cent in 2008 to 27.5 per cent in 2012. In 2012 the gap between full-time women's actual and preferred hours is the largest since 2007. On average, they would prefer to work 8.7 hours a week less than they actually do. 41.8 per cent of mothers in full-time employment would prefer to work part time. This is the largest proportion since 2007.


There is no doubt that many good employers already recognise the benefits of providing flexible working arrangements; however, this recognition is not as widespread as it could or should be. The Australian Greens want people to have more control over their time and working arrangements. We need a better match between the hours people want to work and the hours they actually work. At the moment, people do not have an enforceable right to request flexible working arrangements. At the moment, under the Fair Work Act you can request a change to your working hours but, if the employer says no, there is nowhere for you to go—no appeal, no recourse, no prospect of improvement in your work/life balance. You are stuck with it.


These amendments would ensure that requests for flexible working arrangements are treated seriously. Employers would not be forced to agree to every request, but they must give them proper consideration. These amendments that the Australian Greens will be moving will extend the right to request flexible working arrangements to all employees unless there are reasonable business grounds for refusal. In addition, the right to request would be strengthened for those with caring responsibilities, with employers only able to say no where there are serious countervailing business reasons. In all instances ongoing employees must have performed a minimum of 12 months service before the request can be made.


If an employee's request for flexible working arrangements is refused, Fair Work Australia would be empowered to hear an appeal and, where appropriate, make flexible working arrangement orders. Flexibility is a concept we hear about commonly from employers and employer organisations, but it does need to be a two-way street. That is what flexibility is. People need to have more control over the hours they work, the location they are working and the arrangement of those working hours.


The Australian Greens' amendments would give all employees an enforceable right to request arrangements that will deliver a better work-life balance. Of course, this must be balanced against legitimate operational needs of employers, and that is exactly what these amendments will do. They will provide a test that would make it easier for carers to obtain flexible working arrangements but would still allow any disputes to be resolved in Fair Work Australia by an independent umpire. It is important to note that these amendments are not radical or unprecedented, in fact. This proposal is actually quite a modest proposal by international standards and brings us into line with many other countries. 


The United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany have been doing this for a number of years and their experience is illustrative. A review of flexible working arrangement laws in these countries showed that a number of valuable lessons had been learned and a number of myths dispersed regarding the laws. There was a reasonable but manageable level of requests. The Netherlands had the highest level of requests with 14 per cent of employees, while the UK had only 3½ per cent and Germany recorded less than one per cent. Significantly, the majority of requests in each country were acceptable to employers. Costs were not a major problem with implementation and sometimes even resulted in savings. In addition, interestingly, very few requests ended up in dispute. In the Netherlands and Germany, fewer than 30 requests per country resulted in court action in the first two years of the law. 


So the overseas experience suggests that being obliged to provide flexible work for employees may in fact help companies by ensuring that they examine alternative models that they may not have been willing or able to consider previously. An expanded right to request flexible working arrangements does not have to override management prerogative; it simply ensures that full and proper consideration is given and provides an enforceable right and oversight from Fair Work Australia. 


I note that the 2012 Australian Work and Life Index report recommends that the right to request flexible working arrangements be widened and that workers be given protection from unreasonable refusal. The amendments that the Australian Greens will be moving will deliver on that recommendation and deliver a better work-life balance for Australian workers.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2012-11-27,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (17:24):  Before I make my contribution on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, I want to make a couple of comments about Senator Wright's contribution and the amendments that she will move on better work-life balance. This is not a radical move. We are not running sheltered workshops here. The UK is illustrative of the impact of this type of legislation on small businesses. When we talk about wanting better work-life balance for our workers, I have to say that as a daughter of a small business owner—and Mr Deputy President, I know that you were involved in small business as was Senator Scullion, who is in the chamber—work-life balance for workers is fantastic, but what about the work-life balance for those who actually produce and drive our economy—the small- to medium-sized enterprises in our communities? I can actually attest to the fact that their work-life balance is not particularly healthy. Yet they are out working, not always bringing in the big bucks but enjoying the independence that being a small business owner brings. 


I rise to speak today on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012, and I say from the outset how disappointing it is that the Labor government is rushing through legislation—in this case, legislation that will affect every employer, every employee and every independent contractor—without allowing the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations adequate time to hold a thorough inquiry to investigate the detail of the bill. I am concerned that we are required to consider this bill in the Senate prior to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights completing its report and before the responsible minister responds to the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills regarding inappropriate delegation of power and possible undue trespass on personal rights and liberties. This government should stop shirking scrutiny and permit the Senate and its senators to fulfil their duties. 


The bill seeks to make several amendments as part of the government's first tranche of changes to the Fair Work Act, based selectively on reports from the Fair Work Act Review Panel and the Productivity Commission inquiry into default superannuation funds in modern awards. Many listening, including those in the chamber, will recall that the terms of reference for the Fair Work Act review were widely criticised for their limited scope, the omission of productivity, the impact of union militancy and the monetary impact of red tape. Indeed, we discovered that the Department of Finance and Deregulation and its Office of Best Practice Regulation shared the concerns of the coalition and the business sector. It was therefore no surprise to learn that the minister's political advisers had drafted the terms of reference to achieve Labor's political goals. They are probably the same advisers who draft the media releases that drive so much of this government's policy conversation with the Australian people. 


The bill's provisions include amending unfair dismissal provisions to align time frames at 21 days and an attempt to improve the integrity of application and hearing process. They include changes to the structure and operation of Fair Work Australia, including renaming it to the Fair Work Commission. There is also a provision to create two additional vice-presidential appointments. The desire of this government to simply rename, rebadge, things, as if we will not notice a change or the cost involved in doing so each and every time, seems to be its modus operandi at the moment, when we consider some of the bills that we discussed last week. The provisions also introduce a process for determining the most appropriate default super fund, clarify who can vote and participate in protected industrial action and who can rightfully act as a bargaining representative, as well as amendments to enterprise agreements, particularly for individuals. 


A number of submitters to our inquiry—I sit on the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations—expressed disappointment about the government's failure to address critical flaws with the existing legislation in the first tranche of changes. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: 


Unfortunately, the report and its recommendations, as well as the first tranche response, will do little to address the problems identified by Australian employers … 


Apparently, Senator Wright, it is not a two-way street. The ACCI went on to say:


This includes the majority of SME business owners, many of whom have mortgaged the family home while trying to create valuable employment opportunities and build wealth for all Australians.


By simply ignoring the problems will not make them go away. 


Priority matters raised by submitters to our inquiry included the costly requirements to respond to trade union applications prior to bargaining being agreed; ensuring capacity to make greenfield arrangements without exorbitant wage and condition outcomes or unnecessary project delays; and ensuring protected industrial action can be taken only as a last resort. Multiple submitters opposed moves to prohibit single-employee enterprise agreements on the basis that it would disadvantage small business operators. A number of amendments were proposed, including limiting the provision to proprietary limited companies and excluding partnerships and sole traders or simply improving the 'better off' test for allowing enterprise agreements, regardless of the number of staff.


The Victorian Employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry were one of the many peak bodies standing up for small businesses, saying they were:


… invariably award dependent, without in-house workplace relations expertise, and are most vulnerable to the inequities and uncertainties of the legislation of the day.


They went on to say:


… many VECCI members have described the policy outcomes of the Fair Work reforms as detrimental to the capacity of business to do business productively, flexibly and efficiently, and have not provided an appropriately modern regulatory framework for modern workplaces and business structures. More specifically, while the Federal Government promised that the Act would not increase costs, the cost of doing business has increased as a consequence of the Act—along with the administrative and practical on-costs of regulatory uncertainty, coupled with uneven and two or three track economic conditions many industries face.


One of the 'systemic defects' identified in the Master Builders Australia submission was bargaining provisions. They stated:


… many of the pattern agreements which are being rolled out across the country on a ""sign up or else"" basis, by the CFMEU in particular, contain provisions which adversely affect the efficient operation of building sites. Greater balance in the bargaining laws is a pressing reform. 


In my home state of Victoria, the CFMEU were condemned for approving illegal industrial action at Grocon sites earlier this year. It was illegal, it was disruptive and it was violent. Workers took out full-page ads in the state daily newspapers declaring they did not support their union's actions. Tens of thousands of dollars in members' fees were forked out for legal costs and a further $10.5 million is possibly payable to cover Grocon's losses due to union bosses choosing to act outside the law.


I take this opportunity to highlight a court judgment on a matter even closer to home, in my patron seat of Bendigo. The High Court delivered a landmark ruling in the Barclay v Bendigo TAFE case on adverse action in September, showing that union officials will not be immune from disciplinary action if they fail to perform in their job or breach employment conditions. Disappointingly but hardly surprisingly, Labor intervened in the matter on the side of—think about it; wait for it—the AEU official, arguing that it was the intention of the Fair Work Act to make union bosses untouchable even if they did the wrong thing. In a statement released on the judgment, Justice Heydon said the intervention of the workplace relations minister had increased the costs awarded against the union by around 15 per cent. He said 


… the Minister's stance before and during the oral hearing was not that of an intervener, but that of a partisan.


It is a damning assertion.


There are numerous examples of union officials failing to act in the best interests of their members, breaching financial management rules and using members' money for personal advantage that have hit the headlines this year—most noticeably the HSU scandal. The cost of the HSU investigation to Fair Work Australia is in excess of $1.8 million, not including the cost of its court action against the formerly Labor member for Dobell, following findings that he had used HSU funds to pay for escort services and other improper purposes. The coalition is firm in its view that this must stop. That is why we are currently seeking to amend related Fair Work acts to increase penalties to five years prison and/or up to $220,000 for those in breach, to improve protection for the members of these organisations.


Undeniably, Fair Work Australia's reputation took a hit during the protracted HSU investigation. The review panel recommended a name change that included the word 'commission' and removed the tarnished brand 'Fair Work'. It is a little surprising—but only a little, given that this is probably thematic every time I stand up to deliver a speech. It does not matter whether it is the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, Senator Back, or Indigenous affairs, Senator Scullion, or education policy or Senator Cash's work in equal opportunity for women last week. We changed the name. Let's see if we get a different outcome. We doubt it. So I am only a little surprised that the Prime Minister intervened and that subsequently, in a clear contradiction of the recommendation, the legislation seeks to change Fair Work Australia's name to the 'Fair Work Commission'. The coalition believes the review-recommended name of 'Australian Workplace Relations Commission' is more appropriate and will move an amendment to that effect. While there is apparently no monetary implication for this bill, I would be most interested to learn what the rebranding exercise will cost taxpayers.


Further on monetary implications, this bill includes provision to introduce two new vice-president appointments. The coalition shares the deep reservations expressed by many submitters to the EEWR inquiry, who noted that this was not recommended by the review panel—but don't let that get in the way of a piece of government legislation. It stinks of 'jobs for the boys' and is perhaps the minister's primary reason for suddenly pushing this legislation through parliament. I anticipate a couple of union mates are about to get a nice Christmas present. While cost implications have not been declared in the explanatory memorandum, the Deputy Secretary of DEEWR told our committee during the inquiry that there would be costs in the vicinity of $1.5 million per annum for these positions. The coalition strongly opposes the creation of the two additional vice-president positions and has moved amendments to that effect.


In the limited time remaining, I will touch briefly on amendments impacting superannuation. Minister Shorten took forever and a day to ask the Productivity Commission to conduct a much-needed inquiry into this matter and then cherry-picked its recommendations that essentially maintain the status quo. So, instead of introducing legislation that would ensure genuine competition and improve transparency, we have a bill that seeks to impose yet another layer of government intervention in the default fund market. Given that the MySuper bill has gone through the Senate this week, the coalition believes all MySuper products should be eligible to be selected under the award and proposes that the bill be amended to that effect.


The Liberal-National coalition is disappointed by government's failure to address the concerns of Australian employers and employees regarding its industrial relations laws. The coalition senators' dissenting report to the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee's inquiry report into the Fair Work Amendment Bill, tabled yesterday, recommends several amendments to the bill at hand. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Abetz, will be moving those amendments to address the many flaws identified in the bill and I give them my full support.


For regional Australia, the whole concept of small to medium enterprises and their crucial underpinning of our local economies cannot be underestimated. I am not just talking about farmers or greengrocers. According to the ABS, if we divide our nation into the urban areas and those not in a capital city, we have 700,000 small businesses right across this nation that are outside of our capital cities. They employ 4.3 million people and their turnover is $200 billion a year. Some of them, like my own family business, are employing a father and some very recalcitrant children—Senator Back, I tell you, we had better take this one to Fair Work Australia, sorry, the commission—at two dollars a day. I think that was probably in 1978, but even if we extrapolate from that it is probably still under award. 




Senator Back:
  Very generous!




Senator McKENZIE:
  It taught me a lot about the value of hard work, listening to your father and getting on and saving, because clearly, at that rate, I was not going to get to my target goal purchase—which I think back then was a pair of rollerskates—anytime soon. 


Our small businesses out there in regional Australia provide 75 per cent of our employment. So these big-stick approaches do not work in companies where people are working alongside each other to ensure that the small business grows and develops. The employer wants his boss to succeed, wants the business to grow, wants to work hard so that he can not only maintain his job but his boss's business can contribute to the local footy club or the local surf lifesaving club. The employer and the employee have to fight fires together. They have to play footy on, hopefully, the same team because otherwise it could lead to some issues on a Monday morning, depending on what the game was.


Essentially, though, the way small business operates outside of capital cities is with a more collaborative approach. Small to medium enterprises underpin our local economies in the regions. We encourage the Greens and Labor to support our amendments to the bill so that we can make it the best piece of legislation going forward for industrial relations.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:40):  Deputy President, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. I intend to commence my contribution with a quiz but, because everybody in this chamber and certainly most people watching or listening would know the answers, there will not be a prize. I am going to give some quotes and then rhetorically answer the time and the person. The first quote is this:


I give you this as an absolute guarantee here on your program. I will not be prime minister of this country and appoint some endless tribe of trade union officials to staff or ex trade union officials to staff the key positions in this body. That's not my intention. That's not the way in which it's going to work.


Of course, all of you put your hands down now because you know who it is. It was the then leader of the Labor opposition, Mr Kevin Rudd, in 2007, prior to the 2007 election. As we know, by June 2010 his party was sick of him so they got rid of him. For those of you who did not get that one right, I move on to the next quote and again I ask you who the person was and the place. The quote is this:


The Labor Party is the party of truth telling. When we go out into the electorate and make promises, do you know what we would do in government: we would keep them. When we say them we mean them.


The same person said, 'The question of truth is not a game and it is not my game.' The same person also said:


On the question of standards in government—openness, accountability, divorcing the workings of government from the influence of peddlers and the donors—we need to be absolutely right, not just better by comparison.


On the question of how we treat each other, we must show our values in action.


Those latter quotes, as you will know, are from the now Prime Minister of this country, Ms Gillard. Whilst my final quote is not exactly relevant to the debate, I think it is very timely in the context of 27 November 2012, and it is this from the now Prime Minister, speaking on Newcastle radio in November 2006:


… question time is supposed to be one of our key accountability mechanisms. If there is a big scandal or a corruption allegation, you are supposed to be able to get to the matter in question time.


Madam Acting Deputy President, there is no need for you to take notes because I will be providing you with a script of what has been said.


We are dealing today, regrettably, with something that flies in the face of the sense and the words of everything that I have just quoted, and that is the indecent haste with which this Fair Work Amendment Bill is being rushed into and possibly through this place. I was a participant in the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee process at its meeting last Wednesday evening in which I had the opportunity to question only four witnesses. There were many more who wished to express their concern at the speed, the haste and, indeed, the accuracy of what we have seen leading to the bill before us today. More time should always have been allowed. If Ms Gillard's words were to be anything other than an empty bell in a cathedral then she should have directed her Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister Shorten, to comply with and allow full transparency, full dialogue, a full consultation process and the democratic process of witnesses being allowed to come before a committee of the Senate and put their views before committee members. In most instances, they were denied this.


I do not intend to go at length over areas that our leader, Senator Abetz, did or, indeed, Senator McKenzie did when she was contributing to this discussion this afternoon, except to speak briefly to the superannuation issue. I think that Senator Farrell made a contribution whilst Senator Abetz was speaking. As has been said—




Senator Farrell:
  A very good one!




Senator BACK:
  I am sure that Senator Farrell himself stands as testament to the fact that competition is far and away the best outcome for employees, for employers and for those who provide the services.


As has been said in the last few minutes, the MySuper legislation has passed through this place this week. And yet, perversely, we are not going to see the full allowance of competition in superannuation finding its way into this legislation proposed today. Indeed, it should. There were circumstances put to us the other night that there will be instances with some small employers where there will only be a choice of two and up to a maximum of 10. I ask: if an insurer is fully compliant under the MySuper provisions, why should the full range of competition not be available so that employers and employees alike can benefit from those superannuation provisions? I see no reason for it; no logic has been presented and, of course, we know that it has been roundly argued and disputed, including by those who appeared as witnesses.


Incidentally, the superannuation industry were denied the opportunity. So in the hearing the other night, it was only the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Mining and Metals Association that were able to contribute to that discussion on their behalf. But openness, transparency and the full competitive process should be the guidance by which this legislation goes through. I look forward to support from all sides of the chamber to ensure that full competition does find its way, and so the flawed legislation may be a little less flawed at the end of it.


The Financial Services Council said:


We believe the market structure proposed in this Bill for default super/MySuper will limit competition in the $1.4 trillion superannuation industry and result in reduced fee pressure and innovation for consumers.


There are the two characteristics, the two indicators: reduced fee pressure and innovation. And who might be the winners? Of course, we all know: the union-dominated super funds. That is not acceptable. As we know from the OECD, all OECD countries fundamentally rely on competition in product markets to organise production. Those are the justifications for the reason we must proceed.


I turn to the Fair Work review itself. Whilst I do not want to go back at great length, I could be reminded of Mr Rudd's comments about not stacking with endless tribes of trade union officials or ex-trade union officials, or indeed those sympathetic only to one side of the political process. But we know that in December last year Minister Shorten announced the details of the review of the Fair Work Act. In doing so, he was at a position where two things at fault happened: the first was in his choice of those who were to do the review, and the second was the very, very limited scope which he gave those people. Indeed, he insulted them; he insulted their professionalism in so limiting them.


As it is known, the coalition has flagged its general support for the review. But look at those reviewers—Professor Ron McCallum, Dr John Edwards and the Hon. Michael Moore. As I said, they were given skewed and limited terms of reference. In fact, I think we used the analogy from the situation of a horse on a race track; that is, with their blinkers on. The terms of reference failed to address the essential ingredients of productivity, flexibility and union militancy. Those areas were deliberately denied the reviewers. You have to ask why that could be the case in the first review.


Because I have introduced it into the written report, I do not propose to comment adversely on the participants themselves, except to say that they could hardly, at least in two cases, have been regarded as fully independent in terms of what they have said or written in the past about the process, and except to say that Professor McCallum raged against the use of the corporations power by the coalition when in government, but he has been strangely silent on its use under the Fair Work Act. In these circumstances an opportunity was lost—an opportunity to look at productivity, flexibility and union militancy. And this bill will be the poorer because of it.


If I may turn to the question of productivity, I will quote a Western Australian colleague, Michael Chaney. Chaney chairs Woodside Petroleum, he chairs the National Australia Bank, and he was the chief executive of WesFarmers when he took that organisation into ownership of Bunnings and when he extended the WesFarmers organisation considerably. As we know, under his successor, Richard Goyder, that organisation has gone further and taken over Coles. He is the sort of person one would listen to—the sort of person who has created the employment opportunities around this nation that everybody so proudly trumps as their own. It is the Michael Chaneys of this world who are the ones who are the champions when it comes to creating long-term, high-quality, high-value employment. What is Chaney saying? I quote:


Australia will find it difficult to achieve meaningful economic growth without boosting productivity through micro-economic reform.


'Labour market reform urgently needed,' says Chaney:


I'm concerned that if we don't manage to lift our productivity, we are going to find it very difficult to achieve any real economic growth.


He was talking about high terms of trade, high levels of investment up to now, strong population and workforce growth.


This is not the sort of the man who ought to be ignored. He should not have been ignored by Minister Shorten. Nor should the review panellists have been denied the opportunity to actually examine some of these issues.


It goes, of course, to the fact that we asked the department during the inquiry about two key performance indicators. We asked about productivity, especially as measured through work days lost due to industrial action, and it was not possible in the committee hearing to learn of any improvements in productivity as a result of the Fair Work Act coming into existence. At a time when Europe is in its demise and when so many countries in Europe would be bankrupt if they were companies, at a time when the United States of America is looking very, very jaded in terms of its economic outlook, and at a time when even China—that powerhouse that has kept Australia alive and its head above water over the last few years—is now looking at a downturn, it is an opportunity lost that this review did not address itself to those issues associated with productivity improvement and union militancy.


The issue of the vice-presidents of Fair Work Australia has been canvassed here this afternoon. As was said a few moments ago, it was originally the view that there was a no-cost implication to this particular legislation. Of course, when I asked the representative from the department, he concurred with me that there was an estimated $1.5 million of added cost as a result of this introduction. Senior Deputy President Kaufman wrote to the President, Iain Ross, recently, questioning the need for two new vice-president positions, saying that it was reintroducing a level of seniority at the tribunal that was removed under the Fair Work Act in 2009. Senior Deputy Presidents Watson and Richards have written to Justice Ross of their concerns that the government will use the opportunity to install government-friendly appointees. The review panel themselves were not of a view that there should be new appointees.


A commitment was given to us in the hearing the other night that this process would be open and transparent and that there would be advertisement undertaken. The officer said to me, 'No, the department has not given any advice to the minister and, as far as the department is aware, the minister has not started the process because he wants it to be seen to be as at arms-length.' Let us work out into the future whether that is the case. It was Mr Knott from AMMA who, appearing before us, said:


I think this does give the opportunity … to really damage the independence or the perceived independence and impartiality of the tribunal. We have senior appointments made to the tribunal which, through the political cycle—there are people who are appointed by one side who may not be appointed by another side, but that is the way it goes over the fullness of time in the political cycle.


And, as Senator Abetz quoted from the submission of the Law Council of Australia:


As a general principle, once a person has been appointed to sit on a Court or independent Tribunal with designated powers and privileges, any change that would have the effect of removing or reducing that particular person's powers or privileges while not affecting the powers and privileges of other Members of that Tribunal—


and this is the key point—


has a tendency to undermine the independence of the Court or Tribunal.


These are very important points. They go to amendments that will be debated later in this place, and I look forward to there being agreement based on those concerns of very, very diverse and independent people.


There has been discussion of the term 'the Fair Work Commission'. We know that the panel recommended that there be a change, that the words 'fair work' be removed. I believe the MUA recommended a change. AMMA and other employer based groups have recommended that there be a change, and it will be the recommendation of the coalition that the term 'the Australian Workplace Relations Commission' or similar becomes the title. It is interesting that the most simple of the panel's recommendations, being the change from Fair Work Australia to something akin to the Australian Workplace Relations Commission, has been rejected by the Labor government, despite its support from a broad sector, including the President of Fair Work Australia, the Law Council, the maritime workers union, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Australian Mines and Metals Association. They have all recommended the change but we know, of course, that it is Prime Minister Gillard, whose quotes I commenced my contribution with, who is the one who has demanded that we continue that circumstance.


There were opportunities lost in this review. Senator McKenzie mentioned the case of Barclay v Bendigo TAFE. It was the High Court which came down with its adjudication and decision in this area. There were recommendations that could indeed have found their way into these changes we are talking about today. It is most interesting that Justice Heydon of the High Court said in his judgement, speaking about the intervention by the responsible minister, Minister Shorten:


… the Minister's stance before and during the oral hearing was not that of an intervener, but that of a partisan. For example, some of the Minister's oral submissions were directed to factual material. This is hardly the province of an intervener.


What a damning statement about the minister responsible for this portfolio.


'This is hardly the province of an intervener'—I would certainly not want that said about me.


Recommendation 47 of the review panel, which time prevents me from reading out, went to the very points of Barclay v Bendigo. The other one of course was the full Federal Court in JJ Richards and, again, the review panel itself made recommendations to deal with that inequity, which of course played its way out through the courts, and, again, at the direction of the minister, this also failed to find its way into the recommendations. I commend the amendments that we are to deal with and I certainly do not like the text of the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,17,2
"Sinodinos, Sen Arthur",LP,2012-11-27,"



Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (18:00):  I am surprised that I have to follow Senator Back and that we do not have too many speakers from the other side. Despite three-quarters of Labor senators being ex-union bosses, not one of them aside from the minister, I understand, can bring themselves to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. 


This bill will have a significant impact on every employer, employee and independent contractor in this country, and now the labour movement is allowing the legislation to go through without a murmur, at least from the representatives of the movement in this chamber. Not one of them wants to come in here and defend the provisions that we are debating here today. Not one of them wants to come in here and debate workplace relations out in the open. They prefer to do those deals in those smoke-filled rooms, move the amendments at the national conference and then put them up and hope that no-one will oppose them or have anything to say about them.


Well, we will debate them. We will talk about them. The reason we do so is that, as I said before, the Fair Work Act is a very important act, one of the most important acts before us in this chamber. The opposition are disappointed that this act was not the subject of a full-blooded independent review. A number of my colleagues have discussed that in some detail. I will not go over the same ground, except to ask: what has the government got to lose from a full-blooded review? If we are confident of the impact of this act on the wellbeing of this country and on various parameters of that wellbeing, what did the government have to lose from having a full-blooded review, an independent review? While three eminent persons were given the job of undertaking this review, they were members of the club. They were insiders. In many ways they were being asked to review their own handiwork, or handiwork that they strongly supported or for which they had an ideological disposition. It is fine to have an ideological disposition, but the fact of the matter is that we have an obligation as a parliament to look more impartially and objectively at the impact of legislation on the economic condition of our country, the social condition of our country, and all of those desiderata that are important in considering public policy. 


Unfortunately, on this occasion we had an insider review. It was only through freedom of information legislation that we were able to glean that there had been a debate within the Public Service about the terms of reference for the review and the fact that the Public Service in the tradition of giving frank and fearless advice said that there should be fairly broad terms of reference so that the review could look at all those issues around productivity and flexibility which are so important when you discuss industrial relations. One of the members of that review, Professor John Edwards—former economic adviser to Paul Keating, former journalist, and I think now a member of the Reserve Bank board—has argued on many occasions that there is not much of a linkage between the industrial relations system and productivity. This is not right, there is a major linkage. But it was surprising that he, as an eminent economist, would make that sort of point. The reason I mention it here is that this was precisely the reason he was chosen to do this review, because of the disposition he brought to the review. So we ended up with hamstrung, politically determined terms of reference which largely guided, I think, the committee or the panel to the recommendations that they made. 


There will be some areas in which we will support certain of the recommendations, because we think that they will advance certain issues that we have identified in our consultations with business, both large and small. But on the whole we are disappointed by the way that this review has gone forward. We should not be surprised that that was the method of carriage, because this has been a government which is owned lock, stock and barrel by the trade union movement. They bought this government with their 'Your rights at work' campaign in the run-up to the 2007 election.


It is true that the dragon of Work Choices did rouse some of the slumbering members of the union movement from the last part of the Howard years. That is true. But while Labor in parliament, particularly in that other place, argued about case studies of employees being allegedly exploited by employers, the real motive behind the trade union movement and its opposition to Work Choices came from the fact that they saw it somehow as an existential threat to them. 


It was not an existential threat to them. In a competitive marketplace you earn the right to represent others. They were afraid of competition, they were afraid of contestability, therefore they put all their resources behind electing a government that would not only remove Work Choices but also turn the clock back on industrial relations even to pre the Keating era. It was the Keating government that, after the 1993 election, made the first major moves in the direction of enterprise bargaining. It was the Keating government that moved on enterprise bargaining even though they twinned it with some backward steps on unfair dismissals, which I will discuss later. But the point is that the bargain that was struck between the Parliamentary Labor Party and the trade union movement was to put in place this legislation which turned the clock back on industrial relations and undid some of the good work of not only the Keating period but also the Howard period, particularly in relation to things like Australian workplace agreements which added another layer of flexibility to the labour market.


That is the context in which all of this occurred. In fact in 2007, Julia Gillard came up with an extremely pro-union draft industrial relations policy that Kevin Rudd had to water down because of employer resistance in the run-up to the 2007 election. He became so worried about losing business support that he watered the policy down.


Then when they were in government the policy was implemented. It was an election commitment. A commitment was made that after two years there would be in effect a post-implementation review. That is where the review we are talking about today originated.


In the meantime, government has not only moved to put in place a more retrograde industrial relations system but also complemented it by a whole series of other measures that further entrench the role of trade unions in the workplace and the role of productivity-reducing employment practices. I am referring here to specific packages in areas like the shipping industry. The shipping reform package essentially gave concessions to shipping companies and gave important benefits to the Maritime Union of Australia. The Maritime Union of Australia promised, hand on heart, that there would be a productivity compact between the shipping companies and the MUA that would deliver major productivity gains that would offset the costs of the package we are talking about in the shipping industry. We are yet to see the colour of their money on the productivity compact, and we will be waiting awhile.


In the road transport sector we had the establishment of the transport remuneration tribunal under the guise of promoting driver safety. We all support greater driver safety, but this has become a mechanism for further regulation of wage rates in the transport sector. That tribunal works as a subset of Fair Work Australia so its genesis and outlook are very much from within that framework of Fair Work Australia.


In the building and construction industry we had the watering down of the Building and Construction Commission. It was defanged. In 2007 the now government said, hand on heart, that it would not water down the cop on the beat in the construction sector, but it has. We are seeing the impact of that in a number of industry sectors, particularly obviously construction and building. You just have to go to Victoria to see some of the disputes going on. In the centre of Melbourne there is the Grocon dispute and in Geelong as well there is a dispute. The one in Geelong I think involves the CFMEU. But my point is that the Fair Work Act is buttressed by a whole series of other actions that this government has taken to entrench trade union privilege in the Australian economy.


I turn now to superannuation, another area where the government allegedly is moving in the direction of greater contestability—in this case in relation to the default funds that workers can use for their superannuation. Again what will happen here is that advice will be provided by a panel and Fair Work Australia will make those judgements. Again it will therefore not be a genuinely open, contestable and transparent process where any eligible fund can be a default fund but it will be one which is very much controlled within the framework of Fair Work Australia.


This is where we come up against one of the greater achievements of the labour movement—that is, the way some of these organisations are staffed. In the case of Fair Work Australia we have had the debate in the context of this bill about the creation of two new senior vice-presidential roles. There has been much speculation as to the sorts of people who will occupy those roles. We have had speculation about Jeff Lawrence, a former Secretary of the ACTU, being appointed. It has been the tradition over the years to have employer and employee advocates and representatives become members of some of these quasi-judicial bodies. The speculation has been that it might be Jeff Lawrence, a former Secretary of the ACTU, or Josh Bornstein, a lawyer. Those who watched the ABC miniseries about the waterfront dispute will know that Josh Bornstein played a role in the waterfront dispute by sort of advising I think the MUA at that stage. Lately he has been tweeting advice to the Prime Minister about how to handle the AWU matter or seeking to promote her cause in that regard. He was recently quoted talking in a lecture about the lack of a link in economics between industrial relations systems and frameworks and productivity. Those are some of the potential candidates for senior vice-presidential roles on Fair Work Australia.


Any government has the right to appoint whomever it wants, but you need to have a process which gives confidence to people in the marketplace—employers and employees—that they will face a group of people who will be impartial, objective and consistent with the objects of the act in carrying out their duties. That is not what you would get here if you get these sorts of players promoted to these roles. We already know something about the sorts of players on these bodies. An overwhelming number of people appointed to Fair Work Australia have a trade union pedigree, including Bernie Riordan, a former official of the Electrical Trade Union, who was appointed in the last round. He mysteriously had civil proceedings against him settled the day before his appointment. If I recall correctly, Mr Riordan comes out of New South Wales and he not only was a trustee of his industry super fund but also was involved with a group called Chifley Financial Services, which provided services to that fund. That goes to the issue about the conflicts of interest that exist through the relationship between the trade union movement and some of the industry super funds and the fact that some of these industry people also provide services to some of these funds. 


If I recall correctly, Mr Riordan at one stage was also one of the leaders of the opposition to the privatisation of electricity assets in New South Wales. At a time when you have Martin Ferguson, an ex-President of the ACTU and one of the real straight talkers in this government, calling on state governments to privatise their electricity assets in order to create a more competitive and more efficient national electricity market you have people like Bernie Riordan floating around Fair Work Australia bringing his age of the dinosaur views, if I can put it like that, into play on industrial relations. That is the nature of what we are dealing with here.


There has been debate in the context of this bill about the name of Fair Work Australia and the fact that 'fair work' will be retained. The reason 'fair work' will be retained is, as I understand it, that the Prime Minister herself intervened, because obviously she wants to create that link with the policy she took to the 2007 election. What that tells you is that they are unreconstructed, that there is no appetite for taking reform forward. I have said it before and I will say it again: the trade union movement of 2012 is not a patch on some of the trade union leaders of the eighties and the nineties who were prepared to be in the vanguard of economic reform in the national interest. Yes, they got benefits for their members out of it but the point is they did something that was also in the national interest. They were able to balance the two in a way that was beneficial for all of us.


There has been discussion in recent days in another place about matters to do with the Australian Workers Union. All I will say on that point is that that discussion has highlighted a culture in parts of the union movement of standing over businesses in order to get contributions, accountability for which—as we have seen in certain parts of the AWU in the 1990s—was not what it should be. This culture of standing over companies and getting money—money which was not used for the purposes for which it was allegedly raised—raises important questions about the governance of the trade union movement. I think a future coalition government should take a very good look at the structure and governance of the trade union movement. It should be subject to a no-advantage test, as is the way I would put it; in other words, to create a level playing field between unions and other bodies that want to represent workers. What we want to create is a situation where it is a competitive marketplace in representing workers and where workers have all sorts of options, because it has got to be a system which is driven by the interests of the worker, the customer, and not driven by the interests of a union hierarchy—because today the government is driven by the interests of a union hierarchy and so is the labour movement. So we need that culture to change and you can only change it through competition and contestability.


I now want to turn to unfair dismissal. Here the government is making some adjustments in relation to the rules around unfair dismissal which we welcome in the context of dealing with potentially vexatious claims. Let me make this point in the context of my work with the Coalition Deregulation Taskforce, a very good task force of which Senator Bushby was deputy chairman and did an excellent job around the country. One of the areas on which we got a lot of feedback was unfair dismissal and that the concept, principle or phenomenon of going away money had returned, that it was much easier for an employer just not to have to worry about dealing with the matter through the fair work system and that an employer would in fact be getting advice from Fair Work Australia that the best thing would be 'just to settle this and move the person on'. Now that just creates an extra tax, a tax borne by employees, because if it becomes harder to fire there is less of an incentive to hire. Particularly when it comes to small business, we need to be doing everything we can to reduce the burden of regulation, compliance and paperwork on small business. So their having to shell out $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 or whatever it is simply to settle with an employee because they cannot be bothered to go through the process, given the time that is required to deal with it in a more rigorous and thorough way, is a condemnation of the system as it stands. So for us any support for reform in that direction is welcome and we will of course support that.


We believe that the fair work review should have gone further. It should have looked not only at the matters discussed here today but also particularly at what is happening in the building and construction industry. There should be more focus on this. Martin Ferguson, the Minister for Resources and Energy, made it very clear recently that he was concerned about the upsurge in costs associated with infrastructure investment and building and the impact that would have on our competitiveness in the mining and resources industries. He called an end to the price boom in the mining and energy market. What he was talking about was that now was the time for the hard yakka of extracting the volumes and that to extract the volumes required being competitive. It does not mean cutting people's wages but it means restraining our costs and boosting our productivity, and these are all issues that the government has tended to sweep under the carpet. These are all issues for which the government has tended to in effect say, 'Well, look, if costs are high in Australia it's because we've got a high exchange rate and that explains most of it.' Well, it does not explain most of it. The high exchange rate is a factor but the fact of the matter is any respectable international survey will show you that over the last five years our cost structure has gone up considerably. We are one of the highest cost locations in the world, both in a consumer sense and an industry cost sense, and it is getting worse.


The challenge we face in the years ahead, as the terms of trade settle given all the rest of it, is that the hard yakka to create jobs and to create higher real incomes and living standards will come from improving our productivity and improving our competitiveness. This bill in its current form does nothing to address any of those issues. It is window dressing of the type that we have come to expect from this government. There will be no change on this front until we have an honest discussion about the parameters around industrial relations policy and we have a government which is willing to enforce the law and make everybody, including the trade union movement, subject to the law.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (18:20):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment Bill 2012. Whilst the coalition has some serious concerns with this bill, as Senator Abetz has advised we will not be opposing it, albeit Senator Abetz will be moving amendments during the committee stage. The coalition supports a majority of the recommendations from the fair work review. However, we note, in relation to this bill, that the government has yet again failed to stand up to the union bosses and is only implementing non-controversial recommendations from the fair work review in the short term. That is hardly surprising to anybody on this side of the chamber. Why would the government want to stand up to the people who are their best mates? In relation to the fair work review itself, the coalition believes that the terms of reference deliberately excluded the vital ingredients of productivity, flexibility and union boss militancy and were clearly, without a doubt, skewed towards a predetermined outcome.


Coalition senators understand, as do the majority of the Australian people, that when a Labor government that is made up of former union bosses, and held accountable only by and to its union mates, makes changes to the industrial relations system in Australia, those changes are never about increasing productivity. They are never about, as Senator Sinodinos so eloquently said, furthering the Australian economy and they are never about what is truly fair for the average worker or for the person who is employing the average worker. They are only ever about Labor delivering on a promise that it has made to one of its union mates. That is hardly policy that has been made in the national interest.


Despite the review being a disappointing document on so many levels, we do note that in relation to certain issues there is no doubt that the reviewers, albeit that they were hand-picked by the Labor government, were without a doubt mugged by the reality that the current system is just not working. I take the Senate to some of the recommendations that the fair work review panel made: that Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman should actively encourage more productive workplaces through the promotion of best practice model productivity clauses for modern awards and agreements; changes to the individual flexibility agreements to make them more attractive to both employers and employees, including an increase in the minimum term from 28 days to 90 days; changes to the way in which greenfields agreements are reached and provisions for protracted negotiations; and changes to the good faith bargaining provisions of the act to rectify very serious problems that were identified in the JJ Richards case.


The recommendations that I have just read out, which were made by Labor's own fair work review panel, are recommendations in relation to issues that the coalition has for some time now been drawing attention to and that, I note, both the Labor Party and the union bosses have consistently attacked us on. However, what do we have now? We have Labor's own hand-picked review panel picking up on the issues that the coalition has been highlighting for some time and making recommendations in that regard. One can only hope that, after the government has once again freely spent a million dollars of taxpayers' money and now finally has a review in its hot little hands, it may at some point in the future decide to give consideration to what are very good recommendations coming out the review going forward.


In relation to the bill itself, we are yet again disappointed that the government has rushed through the relevant committee a significant bill that will affect each employer, each employee and each independent contractor in Australia without, once again, the parliament being able to undertake a fulsome inquiry. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives at 4.30 pm on 30 October. The bill was then called on for debate the next morning, on 31 October, and a vote was taken later on that day. To date, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has given no explanation to the parliament as to why there is a critical need to pass this legislation without subjecting it to the scrutiny to which it should be subjected. In that regard, I echo the comments of Senator Sinodinos, whom I am following in this debate. If one looks at the speakers list on this exceptionally important piece of legislation, you would actually think that the only people who care about industrial relations in this country and who are concerned about the negative impact that this bill may have are coalition senators. There does not appear to be anyone other than the minister on the Labor side of the house who is prepared to come into this place and justify why the government is not implementing more of the recommendations from the fair work review.


One might say that perhaps those on the other side are a little embarrassed that one of the things that this bill will do is create two additional jobs for their mates. In fact, maybe their mates have already been hand-picked and they are just waiting for the announcement. I can only assume that those on that side do not care about industrial relations in this country or do not care about the negative impact this bill may have on productivity going forward, or perhaps they are just too embarrassed to come in here and explain why, contrary to evidence given to a Senate inquiry, they are going ahead with creating additional jobs for their mates.


The bill itself purports to implement the first tranche of 17 recommendations arising from the government's review of the Fair Work Act. The bill also seeks to make changes to the internal architecture of Fair Work Australia and provide the Fair Work Australia president with further powers. In addition, the bill implements the government's response to the Productivity Commission review into default superannuation arrangements in modern awards. This response will see the continuation of the process where conflicted parties within Fair Work Australia will continue to select default super funds under modern awards.


The coalition has a longstanding position in relation to this and we believe that any MySuper compliance superannuation fund should be eligible for selection as a default fund. For the Labor Party, though, it is all about their mates in industry funds. In fact, when the Prime Minister said, 'There'll be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' she would perhaps have been better off saying, 'There'll be no competition in relation to superannuation funds under a government that I lead,' because that is exactly what we are seeing as a result of this legislation. The coalition is deeply disappointed that the government has introduced legislation into parliament which, instead of ensuring genuine competition—but the government does not like competition; it does not like competition because it might be shown up—will impose an additional layer of government intervention in the default fund market. The coalition is also extremely concerned that Minister Shorten has been so desperate to protect the vested interests of his friends in the union movement that he has actually lost sight of his responsibility as a minister of the Crown to act in the public interest.


I alluded to the fact that this legislation is creating further jobs for Labor government members' mates—jobs for the boys; jobs for unionists. Well, it does. The bill also contains the creation of two additional vice-president positions at Fair Work Australia, two of the highest officers in the organisation. Minister Shorten has completely failed to explain to the parliament why these positions are necessary or justified, apart from the department's submission that the President of Fair Work Australia sought the additional roles. These two positions would slot into the second and third most senior officers of the tribunal. Since the announcement of these two additional positions, there has been widespread community concern, including from within Fair Work Australia.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (21:59):  I am proud of my service to the great state of Western Australia, both in the trucking industry and now as a senator for the last 7½ years. But, unfortunately, there are others who have made a much less positive contribution to Western Australian life. I am talking about those who fought tooth and nail to deny compensation to the thousands of innocent victims of CSR's asbestos mine at Wittenoom. The horrific impact of the Wittenoom mine has been dubbed 'the world's greatest industrial disaster', with some predicting that it will cause more deaths than the terrible chemical explosion at Bhopal in India.


The story of the toxic mine at Wittenoom is a personal one for me. My dad, as a new Australian who emigrated from Italy after the war, found himself in the Wittenoom mine in 1952. He worked in a variety of roles, one of which was loading railcars underground. There was zero visibility because of the level of dust in the mine, but not only that: there was no personal protective equipment whatsoever provided to the workers. Our family is very lucky that dad is still with us today despite suffering from an asbestos related disease. Sadly, the same cannot be said for a lot of other families who have lost loved ones from asbestos related diseases contracted while working at CSR's Wittenoom mine. I myself, as a truck driver, visited the mine in the early 1980s and spent time walking through the site to see where my dad had worked, never realising at any stage the danger it presented to me.


In 1977, after many years of ignoring the truth, CSR's managers finally accepted the moral and humanitarian, as well as financial, obligation that they had to pay compensation to the victims of their deadly asbestos business. Unfortunately, that is when the real villains stepped in: heartless corporate lawyers who advised CSR management to ignore their 'emotive moral and humanitarian feelings' and build a 'legal fortification' to defeat valid compensation claims.


The conduct of CSR's lawyers came to light during a test case brought in the WA Supreme Court by brave workers Tim Barrow and Peter Heys. CSR's lawyer, a solicitor from the Perth firm Robinson Cox, which later became Clayton Utz, founded CSR's legal fortifications upon the 'four dog defence', a brutal strategy designed to stonewall valid claims, perfected by ruthless asbestos industry lawyers in the United States. It goes something like this. Your dog jumps over the fence and bites your neighbour's child to death. The first line of your defence when they take you to court is that you never owned a dog, or if you did, it was always kept tied up. If you lose on this point, you then claim you had no idea the dog was savage. If you lose that one, you try to make out that the child must have provoked the dog and it was the child's fault. The last line of the defence, if all else fails, is that okay, you did have a dog, it wasn't tied up, you did know it was dangerous, it did bite the child, but the child's actual death was caused by something else.


The 'first dog' deployed by CSR's solicitor was to find every basis imaginable to reject compensation claims brought by the dying victims of the Wittenoom asbestos mine. As the President of the Asbestos Diseases Society of WA, Robert Vojakovic, remarked, CSR's solicitor played a key role in their attempts to deny compensation to the victims of Wittenoom:


… she was CSR's lead lawyer at the time the company was rejecting claims for compensation from dying victims, thereby forcing the families to go to trial …


""She and CSR caused extra suffering for people who were already dying with painful diseases, causing extra trauma for families of victims as well,"" …


The 'second dog' deployed by CSR's solicitor to defeat claims was to use procedural tactics to delay judgement until after the claimants' deaths. As Mr Peter Gordon, solicitor for Mr Barrow and Mr Heys, noted:


""CSR was represented by—


their solicitor and she—


… was rhetorically asking the court why it was that workers should be entitled to jump court queues just because they were dying.""


The solicitor's tawdry efforts partially succeeded—Mr Heys died of mesothelioma before the court could deliver justice, leaving his wife and children to continue his claim.


Why did CSR's solicitor try to delay judgement until after Mr Heys' death? The answer is simple: to reduce CSR's compensation bill. This was the third dog deployed by the solicitor: exploit the fact that Mr Heys died before judgement to reduce the amount of compensation payable to his family. Because Mr Heys died before judgement was delivered, CSR was able to apply a discount to the compensation payable to his surviving wife and children. Although Mr Barrow and Mr Heys' landmark case ultimately succeeded, CSR's solicitor was not prepared to let sleeping dogs lie and continued to exploit technicalities to reduce the compensation payable to Mr Heys' surviving wife and children.


In 1989 the solicitor deployed her fourth dog: an appeal against the compensation awarded to Mr Heys' family, arguing that CSR's debt should be reduced because Mr Heys received workers compensation payments while he remained alive. The solicitor's cynical manoeuvre succeeded, and she ripped almost $19,000 out of the hands of the dead man's family. In subsequent years, CSR's solicitor has pleaded that she was simply acting on her client's instructions and the advice of barristers when she sought to delay justice to dying men. But the solicitor, and she alone, is responsible for her conduct as a solicitor. She cannot shift the blame to her clients or advising counsel. This is spelt out in black and white in section 32 of the WA solicitors professional conduct rules, which requires solicitors to exercise independent judgement in the conduct of proceedings, notwithstanding client's instructions or advice from barristers. This principle of professional independence has been affirmed by none other than the Chief Justice of the High Court, in the case of Giannarelli v Wraith.


The apparent failure by CSR's solicitor to exercise the required degree of independent judgement may not be her only failure to live up to the professional standards expected of an ethical lawyer. In the Barrow and Heys case, the WA Supreme Court was frustrated from making further findings about CSR's conduct because key documents had suspiciously gone missing. In my opinion, the loss of these documents reeks of a cover-up. And what makes it even more concerning is that the solicitor involved was from none other than the law firm that became Clayton Utz.


We all remember the shocking scandal that beset Clayton Utz when it was discovered the firm had deliberately destroyed thousands of documents to help British American Tobacco escape liability for injuries caused by its own trade in death. Were CSR's missing documents also victims of the hardworking shredding machines that featured in Clayton Utz's 'document retention policy'? Was Clayton Utz's effort to destroy documents in the British American Tobacco case simply the last in a long line of dodgy legal practices? These are very serious questions that must be answered.


The solicitor responsible for CSR's behaviour towards the victims of its asbestos mines should feel ashamed of the harm she has caused to the people of Western Australia. In my opinion, she has demonstrated a total lack of judgement and failed to exercise the requisite degree of professional independence; she displayed highly questionable values and conducted the litigation in an immoral and inhumane manner; and she failed to live up to the ethical standards expected of her as a lawyer by seeking to defeat the fair and efficient administration of justice. The solicitor in question also has serious questions to answer about the suspicious disappearance of documents that may have been of assistance to the victims of Wittenoom.


Mr Deputy President, you may ask why this solicitor's professional conduct some 20 years ago is relevant today. The answer is that the solicitor in question is now a member of this parliament, and to quote the Deputy Leader of the Opposition:


It goes to … character ... ethics ... judgement, whether people can have trust and confidence ...


…   …   …


Your character doesn't commence being judged from the moment you take up your position as a Member of Parliament. People deserve to know what sort of person you are, how you conducted yourself in your professional life.


With those words the Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a noose for her own neck. You see, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is the solicitor whose disgraceful conduct I have been discussing these past minutes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was CSR's lead solicitor in the Wittenoom litigation. After her disgraceful behaviour towards the Prime Minister, any failure to answer these questions will expose the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as a rank hypocrite and will once again expose the terrible lack of judgement inherent in her decision to meet with admitted fraudster Ralph Blewitt, a decision which has led to intense speculation about her increasingly uncertain future.
