"Senator KNOWLES,",LP,2003-05-14,"—I rise today in the Senate to make some comments on autism. This week is National Autism Awareness Week, and I think it would serve us all well if we were more aware of the trauma associated with autism. Thanks to the Developmental Disability Council of Western Australia, I have been honoured and privileged to have been adopted by a family that has been affected by autism. The family who decided to adopt me under the Adopt-a-Pollie program are the most wonderful people you could imagine and they are suffering under immense strain. I will give the Senate a brief outline of family. 
It comprises a single mother who has four children under the age of 10, three of whom are autistic, two of whom are non-verbal. That mother is nothing short of amazing; she is remarkable. She is studying full time at university to do special ed, and she also has an illness herself. She copes remarkably well but would cope a whole lot better if she had more support. That is not to belittle the people who support her in everything she has done thus far, but it is a very traumatic situation for any family to discover that they have an autistic child, let alone to have three autistic children in such circumstances.
What is autism? Autism is a puzzling disorder that affects one in 1,000 people. Scientists are still trying to discover why it happens. A child can look perfectly normal when it is born and its behaviour can be essentially perfectly normal in its early and formative years. Autism may well not be diagnosed until the child is about three to five years of age, when it becomes apparent that some of its behaviour is different. Autism can range from mild to severe, and it therefore affects children very differently. It affects one person differently from another. In this one family alone, there are three autistic children, and two of them are non-verbal. Boys are more likely to be affected than girls. It needs to be emphasised that poor parenting is not a cause of some of the behavioural problems that are associated with autism. The disorder causes problems with social interaction and behaviour. It is sometimes—but certainly not always—associated with an intellectual disability. In fact, it can be quite the reverse: some autistic people can be absolutely brilliant at certain things. It is their focus on certain issues that, at times, makes them brilliant on a particular subject.
Annually about 900 children are diagnosed with autism. Autism significantly affects a person's ability to communicate and interact socially, which in turn, of course, affects their behaviour. When one has difficulty getting across to another what they want as a child—and even as a young adult—then that will create frustration and it will create further tension in that environment. As far as communication is concerned, emotions and words can be very difficult to comprehend. It is very difficult, in many ways, for children with autism to link words with their meanings. That is where the mother of the family with whom I have contact is a very sensible parent. She keeps on saying: `I don't necessarily want my child to come home from school with a lovely little card that they have made. If my child came home and I knew that he could identify an arm, a hand, a leg, his face, his eyes, his ears—that would be teaching him something in his life skills.'
I think that is a very important point that we need to be able to get across to the educators, who I believe do a very good job. The role of a special education teacher is not an easy one and it is one that we should never, ever take for granted. But the mother's words were highlighted, only a few weeks ago, when the youngest child of this family, who is only about three years of age, started to display an unusual tendency to topple over. It was very difficult because the mother did not quite know what was wrong, and the child could not tell her what was wrong. Invariably, those children do not feel pain and, therefore, the possibilities were endless.
In the end, the mother took the child to a doctor who referred the child to the medical emergency centre in one of the hospitals in Perth. Because this child—the most absolutely delightful looking child—looked perfectly normal, everybody started talking to the child: `Come on here, mate, do this, do that, do something else. Does this hurt, does that hurt?' The mother kept saying: `He is non-verbal. He does not speak. I don't know what's wrong with him.' The whole process undertaken by the doctors and nurses, and the mother and father—because the father came in to lend assistance, and he was there trying to hold the child down while they were doing tests—became very difficult. To cut a long story short, the little boy was eventually diagnosed with a broken kneecap. 
We do not understand, as people who have been blessed with all our faculties, because we can say, `My arm hurts,' or, `My knee hurts.' We go to a doctor and it is done. But this is a very special group of people. There are significant difficulties with some of the verbal sufferers, but particularly with the non-verbal communicators. As a result, the child will grab what they want or lead one to what they want. They may, in fact, parrot words that do not necessarily mean what they want them to mean at the time. Their senses can be confused; a sudden noise can be terrifying to them; silence can be very loud to them. We need to create awareness, particularly during Autism Awareness Week, of what we as a community should be doing.
There is enormous stress on the families of sufferers. There is enormous stress just in doing something as simple as going shopping. I cite this particular family again. The mother goes to the supermarket with the four children—there is no-one else there at the time to look after the children—and her gorgeous eldest son puts the little tot in a trolley. He wheels the little one around in one trolley, and mum has the other two children beside her while she wheels another trolley with the food in it. In many respects, the eldest one is almost being forced to be older than he really is, because, even though he is autistic himself, he is not non-verbal. He gets tired as he is pushing the trolley with his little brother in it. When they get to the checkout, the mother is confronted with the checkout line, four children and a trolley full of groceries. I think being at the end of the checkout line is pretty frustrating just on my own, let alone if you have four children and a trolley full of shopping. Then, when she gets through the checkout, she has had to park a million miles away and has to get the trolley and her four children to the car.
We have ensured that this family has an ACROD sticker so they can park at the door of the supermarket, but that process was not necessarily easy, because the actual recipient of the ACROD sticker is not theoretically disabled. As a community we need to make life easier for the sufferers, and also for the parents of these children. Difficulties are created during the day-to-day trials of running a household at night, where you are trying to cook a meal and bath the children at the same time, and where there is a propensity for one child to put a hand in the oven or on a hot pot on the stove or whatever while the others are getting in and out of the bath. A lot of people do not understand the physical demands, the frustration and the community isolation. They look at these particular children and say, `They're just badly behaved. They're just rotten little kids.' They all look gorgeous: they are dressed beautifully, presented beautifully and everything else, but they have behavioural problems from time to time. In turn, that puts pressure on the family unit that can lead to separation or divorce. Therefore, the chance of burnout of the main carer is potentially very real.
The question of what should be done about this problem is one we, as a parliament, need to look at. I know our policy is very firmly devoted to ensuring that there is overall mainstream disability funding. Of course, there are also state based responsibilities: the states have a responsibility for early intervention, school age support services, family respite services, residential services, employment services and family support. That is all very well, but does it work? When I was confronted with the problem of this early evening rat-race, I said to the mother, `Are there people who could come in and help you at the peak times?' She said, `Only if I decide that my need is greater than somebody else's.' That in itself is difficult. To then try and get volunteer support is somewhat challenging; nonetheless it can sometimes be achieved. But we then have to make sure that the volunteers do not get burnt out. 
In this important week of autism awareness, I think it is very important that we, as a community and as a parliament, try and focus on what can be done to help the sufferers and also the carers. I know we have made carer payments available for people in circumstances such as this, but sometimes money is not the only solution; actual hands on deck can help resolve a crisis and take away some of the load. In the family I spoke of, both parents love their children dearly—there is absolutely no question that either one of them is abrogating their responsibility to these children. I think that is the case wherever such a disability occurs. We need to try and focus on those questions: how we can help them through their education and how their education can be geared towards their life skills as opposed to doing nice little things that might make them feel good at the time. We need to train them and guide them towards areas that will give them a future somewhat independent of their primary carer.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>National Autism Awareness Week</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-05-14,"—My question is to Senator Ian Macdonald, the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Does the minister recall his answer to a question from Senator Santoro on 19 March this year when he said:
The bottom line is that the Commonwealth drought assistance package and existing EC arrangements could cost the Commonwealth, and we have forward budgeted for, some $900 million over the three-year period.
Can the minister also confirm that his media statement dated 7 May, just one week ago, stated that `the package of Commonwealth measures totalling $900 million ... is helping Australian communities affected by the drought.' Can the minister now explain why the $900 million drought package was cut by almost 20 per cent to just $742 million in last night's budget, and why funding for the additional drought measures promised by the Prime Minister on 9 December last year has been cut by nearly 54 per cent, from $368 million to just $170 million? Why did the Howard government mislead Australian farmers by promising funding it had no intention of delivering?
—Order! Senator O'Brien, that was a very long question. It ran nearly half a minute over time.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-05-14,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I remind the minister that he and the minister, Dr Kemp, said seven days ago in a press release that the amount to be provided for drought funding was $900 million not $742 million. Is the minister aware that not just the National Farmers Federation but also the New South Wales Farmers Association, AgForce and other farm organisations say that this government has betrayed rural Australia by slashing drought funding in the midst of the worst drought of the century? Can the minister inform the Senate just when the government decided to cut budgeted drought funding? Were the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator Ian Macdonald, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, misleading Australian farmers all along or was this an ambush sprung by the Treasurer in the budget papers last night?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-05-14,"—I sincerely thank Senator O'Brien for that question because it enables me to put to rest some of the misinformation and absolute scaremongering that Senator O'Brien has been involved in this morning. It will also enable me, should time permit, to explain and give Senator O'Brien a bit of a lesson on budgeting and how budgets are put together, and how particular issues are calculated. I will give Senator O'Brien that lesson because I am sure he will never be in a position where he will have to bother putting a budget together himself.
This government's commitment is to help those impacted upon by drought. As a result of that commitment, the Commonwealth is paying more and contributing more to drought now than ever before at the same time as the states are contributing less than ever before to help those affected by drought. To explain to Senator O'Brien, we have made a commitment to those impacted upon by drought. We have set out the criteria and we have explained the rules. Part of the rules state that if you want to apply for exceptional circumstances you have to get the state government to make the application, determine the boundaries and give all the information. The Commonwealth will then assess those in accordance with the criteria and, if those making the application meet the criteria, money will be paid to them.
That commitment remains from this government. Every drought affected farmer or person entitled to drought assistance who applies and meets the commitment will be paid in full. There is no 20 per cent cutback, there is no 10 per cent cutback and there is no one per cent cutback. There is no cutback at all in our commitment to give every impacted upon farmer exactly what they are entitled to in accordance with the rules and the criteria. 
If I could just explain to Senator O'Brien: when you are preparing a budget you have to make estimates of what your commitments might involve you in in the out years. When these drought conditions were announced, our department made an estimate that, on the severity of the drought and on the number we estimated would be impacted upon, $900 million might be a good assessment of what might be provided for. What has happened is that there has been a slower than expected take-up of the available drought assistance. In the normal course of events our department has looked through that and has made a calculation, based on what has come in today, of what might be needed for the future and we got to the figure of $748.7 million—I am not quite sure where the point seven comes from—and that is an assessment of what might be called upon. But whatever is called upon, be it $500 million, $1,200 million, $900 million or $700 million, whatever is applied for and meets the criteria will be paid. There is absolutely no cutback—no cutback at all—in the funds available to eligible landowners and farmers. I am very disappointed to see that the National Farmers Federation was confused by Senator O'Brien's rhetoric. I think they now understand—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2003-05-14,"—I cannot work out how I can be clearer to Senator O'Brien. We have not cut funding. Whatever is applied for that meets the criteria will be paid. It might be $748 million, it might be $900 million, it might be $1,100 million or it might be $600 million. We hope it is close to the figure that our officials have assessed, but that is only an assessment. Whatever is required will be paid. If Senator O'Brien wanted to help farmers rather than mislead people, he would get his state colleagues to contribute to some of the difficult times that farmers are suffering in their respective states. The National Farmers Federation, I think you will find, Senator O'Brien, now understand that they were misled by your rhetoric. They understand that whatever is required to meet our commitments to those who are affected by drought will be paid in full. There is no cutback, and I do not know how I can be more explanatory.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-05-14,"—My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. Will the minister inform the Senate how the Howard government's unparalleled record of responsible economic management is providing Australians with better health services, greater opportunities for higher education and personal income tax relief?
—I rise on a point of order. The question is out of order. It is not asking a question; it is making a series of statements—some fanciful and fictitious but statements nonetheless. The standing orders are quite explicit. When senators want to ask a question, they rise in their place and actually ask a question; they do not engage in propagandising on behalf of the government.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-05-14,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to answer this important question from Senator Mason. Last night's budget continues the Howard government's impressive record of strong and responsible economic management. When we first came into office, we inherited a $10 billion budget deficit and $96 billion of accumulated debt. We came into office with vivid memories of interest rates at record high levels of 17 per cent and unemployment at its highest level since the Great Depression. In 13 years, Labor had nine budget deficits with an average deficit of $12.2 billion—only four surpluses in 13 years. What a contrast to the Howard government's economic record. Our economy is strong. The OECD economic survey of Australia recently stated:
A judicious mix of macroeconomic and structural policies has resulted in exceptional economic performance which is expected to continue.
The IMF, the OECD and the Economist magazine all confirm that we are once again expected to outperform most OECD economies with GDP growth of 3.3 per cent this year and 3.8 per cent in 2004. Employment remains strong, and we have created more than 1.1 million jobs since we came to office. Unemployment is around its lowest rate in 10 years. Australian families are continuing to benefit from interest rates that are at their lowest levels in 30 years and from personal income tax cuts worth $12 billion. And we have paid $63 billion off Labor's irresponsible debt.
Responsible economic management is the hallmark of this government. The budget for this coming year will deliver a surplus of $2.2 billion—the sixth surplus of this government. Seven years in office and six surpluses—what a contrast to Labor's abysmal record. It is because of our responsible economic management that we are now able to pay a dividend to the Australian people. From 1 July 2003, Australian taxpayers will share in personal income tax cuts worth $10.7 billion over the next four years. It is because of our commitment to keeping the budget in surplus that we have been able to invest in the priority areas of defence, security, education and health. The government is committing an additional $2.1 billion to enhance the Australian Defence Force's capability to defend Australian interests at home and abroad, and $411 million is being provided to enhance our ability to identify and respond to security threats. 
The budget funds further reforms to improve the quality of, and accessibility to, higher education. These reforms, costing $1.5 billion over four years, will help make our people and our nation more productive. To ensure the effectiveness of the health system, funding of $917 million over five years will be provided for A Fairer Medicare package and $42 billion over five years will be provided for public hospitals under the Australian health care agreement. These are all initiatives to help us build our future. This is able to be done because of our absolute commitment to economic responsibility.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-05-14,"—My question is to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone. Can the minister confirm that the budget papers reveal the government has clawed back $723 million of family tax benefit payments from 1.8 million low- and middle-income Australian families during the last financial year? Isn't this massive clawback of family tax benefits, which averages $400 per family, greater than the value of the promised tax cuts announced last evening?

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-05-14,"—I thank the senator for the opportunity to answer his question. Senator, you refer to the tax cut as being small. It is easy to look at any amount of money on a single weekly basis and identify it as being small. I get faced with that in my portfolio all the time. People say to me: `Couldn't we just give people $5 more a week?' They think of a small amount per week as being not much. But what they forget to do is to look at the number of people getting that amount and the period over which they get it. So $5 a week becomes $250 a year, and when it is to millions of taxpayers the cost to government is very substantial. I make that point to keep a bit of perspective. I face that all the time with people saying, `Couldn't we give a bit more welfare?' not recognising that if you do a bit more every week for millions of people it adds up. The example I have used recently is that $5 a week for everybody who is getting some type of welfare or family tax assistance works out to be $10 billion over the forward estimates period. So you may dismiss the tax cut as being small. It is a significant cost to government revenue, and I am sure taxpayers would rather have it than not. It is as simple as that. I do not think you are advocating it not being proceeded with.
Let me refer now to your remarks about a family tax benefit clawback. Senator, I do not have the figures in front of me, but it is true that where people have been overpaid they have had to pay the money back. Through you, Mr President, what you are actually advocating, Senator, if you do not approve of that, is that families who have had more than their entitlement ask to keep it, over and above the amount that another family in the same circumstances would have had. In other words, what the senator is advocating is that people who have had more than their entitlement should somehow be able to keep it and should be able to have more than another family in the same circumstances. We do not agree with that. We say that at the end of the year, when the reconciliation is done, a family in one set of circumstances should get exactly the same amount of money and assistance as a family in the same set of circumstances. So if you have more, you have to pay the money back. We have had a variety of arrangements to assist families with that, treating it as a down payment on next year's family tax benefit. I notice that the questioner did not ask about family tax benefit top-ups, of course. They are now paid in a way that they were not in the past so that, again, at the end of this year if you got less than a family in the same circumstances, and less than you were entitled to get, you would get a top-up. These two matters are quite unrelated. The senator seeks to put them together for his amusement, but in fact the value of the tax cut is quite unrelated to the family tax benefit recoupment.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-05-14,"—Senator, as you know, changes were made to the family tax benefit system, most of which came online in February and all of which will be online by the end of this year. Those changes will assist families and give them more choices in how to take their family tax benefit. I simply remind you, as I have reminded you in the past, that the family tax benefit is just that. It is associated with the tax system. Just as some people get a refund—a parliamentary colleague told me he got $900 recently; half his luck!—some people get a letter saying, `You owe more.' So it is with the family tax benefit system. It is designed to ensure that at the end of the year one family in a set of circumstances gets the same amount of money as another family in the same circumstances. There is an adjustment at the end of the year, just as there is in the tax system.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-05-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
As is the protocol in this place, I contacted the Attorney-General's office and let them know that I would be asking for an explanation in relation to question No. 1392. The question asks:
Does the Commissioner of Taxation currently exercise general administration of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988 (the Registration and Collection Act) or the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989 (the Assessment Act) ... as Commissioner of Taxation.
This question goes back to legislation that passed through this chamber quite some time ago in relation to exactly that position. That position was altered by legislation through this chamber, and yet repeated requests, particularly in relation to the Privacy Commissioner, remain ignored. At the present moment the Privacy Commissioner has a set of guidelines, and it is under guideline 9.8 of the Tax File Number Guidelines 1992 that the Privacy Commissioner is operating. These guidelines are very clearly in conflict with the amendments to those acts that I have just referred to. They are in conflict with those guidelines in that, as a result of that legislation, the Commissioner of Taxation no longer has the position of registrar in relation to those acts. 
Yet repeated requests of the government and of the Privacy Commissioner to alter the guidelines have gone unanswered. It was for that reason that back on 16 April notice was given to the Attorney-General asking him to make certain facts available to the public in relation to this. Paragraph 7 of the request says:
With reference to section 11 of the Registration and Collection Act, both prior to and after the amendments made under the Amendment Act, has this legislation, or has any other legislation, rule or regulation, provided at any time whatsoever that the Commissioner of Taxation exercise general administration of the Registration and Collection Act in the capacity of the Office Commissioner of Taxation; if so, will the Attorney-General particularise such times.
That really goes to the essence of the question. The question clearly asks the Attorney-General: did the taxation commissioner at any time hold the position of registrar for those acts? Has that ceased to exist at any point in time? It clearly requests the Attorney-General to give us particulars pertaining to those times. There is a belief among certain constituents, both in Queensland and widely around Australia, that the Privacy Commissioner's regulations in relation to this section are in conflict with the amendments that this chamber has passed. Paragraph 8 says:
With reference to section 147 of the Assessment Act, both prior to and after the amendments made under the Child Support Legislation Amendment Act 2001, has this legislation, or has any other legislation, rule or regulation, provided at any time whatsoever that the Commissioner of Taxation exercise general administration of the Assessment Act in the capacity of the Office Commissioner of Taxation; if so, will the Attorney-General particularise such times.
It is a very clear and concise request to the Attorney-General. It is also a request to the government to look at this situation where, clearly, the Privacy Commissioner's regulations are in conflict with the legislation. It is a request that the government address this issue by whatever means necessary to remove or correct that anomaly.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today relating to the 2003-04 Budget.
Last night the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history announced the smallest tax cut in Australia's history. Even after these paltry tax cuts, this government still retains the title of the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Moreover, these paltry tax cuts represent a cynical attempt by the government to divert attention from the higher costs on Australian families elsewhere in this budget. The proposed changes to Medicare and education will each, on their own, far outweigh the benefits from the tax cuts, which were so accurately described today by Senator Vanstone as nothing more than a sandwich and a milkshake. This budget is all about giving with one hand and slugging families even more with the other.
I want to take issue with Senator Minchin, who today continued to perpetuate the myth about the level of taxation by the government, because I am fond of that old saying: if it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, then it is a duck. What about the GST? It cannot possibly be an orphan: I spent 27 hours in this chamber, in the Commonwealth parliament, debating the GST. The ATO—the Australian Taxation Office—say it is a Commonwealth tax. The Australian Bureau of Statistics say it is a Commonwealth tax. And the Auditor-General—the final arbiter—says it is a Commonwealth tax. So I have got to say to the minister, I have got to say to those on the other side of the chamber: this is walking and talking and quacking like a duck because it is a Commonwealth tax, and you should just get over it. 
Why is this government able to give a tax cut? The reason is simple. It is sloshing around with bucket loads of money from tax revenue. Under this government, the tax take has reached new historic heights. The government has finally been forced to give back some money due to months and months of community pressure. However, this long overdue tax cut from the highest-ever taxing government in Australia's history is meagre. That meagreness was exposed today brutally, by accident, by Senator Vanstone. This tax cut is not only small but it will be swallowed up and gone within 12 months—that is right: just 12 months.
After the changes announced by the government, Australian families earning between $30,000 and $50,000 will receive just $4 extra per week. That is even less than the cost of a milkshake and a sandwich. However, that same worker who is enjoying his tax cut of just $208, at the end of the year will be paying $272 more in income tax. If you assume, as this budget does, that earnings rise in line with the budget, someone on $40,000 will pay $480 more—that is right: $480 more in tax. They have saved $208; they are $272 worse off than they were at the beginning of the year. This government is returning much less in tax cuts than it has taken through bracket creep. This government has not even given back the bracket creep of $3.3 billion that it will harvest this year.
—Just this year.
—That is right. But what about the proud boast? I did not hear a word from Senator Minchin or anybody else over there.
—Senator Mason will have his chance. What about the proud boast that this government will deliver 80 per cent of Australians paying just 30c in the dollar? What the government is admitting in its own figures—and last night on national television the Treasurer admitted it—is that, after this modest little tax cut, only 75 per cent of Australians will pay 30 per cent tax. It gets worse and worse each year this goes on. This government is trying to perpetuate the myth that it is a low taxing government, but its own budget papers, independent analysis and the Auditor-General all say that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history. This is not, however, the first time they have given a tax cut that vanishes quickly. Just go back to 1 July and the GST tax cuts—remember them?

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-05-14,"—I am delighted to say a few words on the government's budget. As you know, Mr Deputy President, it is a habit of mine to talk a bit about the context and the history of these things so the Labor Party can learn something about their failures. The history is that the government is still cleaning up Labor's mess. The coalition has again delivered a surplus of about $2.2 billion, and every last cent of that will go to pay back Labor's debt, which amounted to $70 billion over their last five years in government. Just the interest bill on that deficit ran into several billion dollars a year, so a party supposedly so concerned with social justice compromised the federal government's capacity to help in education, schools, health and welfare. Every cent of the $2.2 billion surplus will go to pay back their deficit. And you know what, Mr Deputy President? This government, the coalition, has now paid back $63 billion of Labor's debt. That is the history. 
Now let me give you a bit of the context. The war in Iraq has been a huge financial burden. It was a war that Labor opposed. It might be interesting to ponder for a second the link between moral courage and financial responsibility. It is an interesting point, but we will discuss that perhaps at another time. Secondly, the important part of the context is the Australian drought—the worst drought in this nation's history. For a country that relies so much on agriculture for exports and for employment, this was another enormous fiscal burden on the nation. That is the second part of the context. The third part is the unstable world economic environment. Terrorism, uncertain oil prices and falling world share and commodity prices all underpinned a very difficult economic scenario for this nation. With that history and in that context Mr Costello has delivered a budget surplus. He has given the nation a budget surplus and, in a difficult international context, he has given tax cuts. Finally, he has also managed to enhance the defence and the security of our nation.
I think one can say with a great deal of certainty that no other comparable nation on earth has been able to manage this. We can look at our coalition of the willing partners, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom's projected budget deficit would now be about $20 billion in the Australian context. In the United States their projected deficit would be around $30 billion. What has Mr Costello given us? He has given a $2.2 billion surplus, which is absolutely remarkable when you compare it with our partners in the coalition of the willing. What does all this mean for the average Australian? Australian home buyers are now paying $330 less per month for a $100,000 home mortgage than they were paying when Labor was last in office. Interest rates are stable. What is happening on the jobs front? The coalition has created more than a million new jobs since 1996. Unemployment is at around its lowest rate in 10 years and is expected to remain steady at around six per cent. This is a very important point: today Australia's interest bill is $4.39 billion per year less than it was under the Labor Party. That is over $4 billion dollars of savings that this government can spend on things like health and education. In summary, we have a budget surplus of over $2 billion. The nation has tax cuts. We have enhanced defence and security, and in this context it is a marvellous economic and budgetary achievement.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-05-14,"—Senator Mason wanted to traverse history. I think it is important to remind the Senate that, in fact, the Treasurer who left this country with the highest budget deficit in today's dollar terms was none other than John Howard. He was Treasurer at the time of the defeat of the Liberal government in 1983. It was the largest budget deficit in Australian history.
—You're trawling back in time now. How about the last seven years?
—I do not intend to go into history anymore because I think that speaks for itself. I want to deal with this so-called tax cut in the here and now as a result of the budget announced last night. Four dollars a week for an average income earner—that is the value of the tax cut in current dollar value delivered last night. Of course, the Treasurer does not want to explain, and certainly Senator Minchin today did not want to explain, that the $4 will disappear by this time next year. Why will the $4 disappear? It will disappear because the $2.4 billion cost of the tax cut will be clawed back through bracket creep. By this time next year that $4 will be worth precisely zero. What will Australians be left with at this time next year? Not only will they have no tax cut in dollar value terms but they will be left with much higher medical costs as a result of this government's so-called reforms and so-called improvement in fairness to the medical system. They will be left with higher medical costs. For an average person, just five visits to the doctor will wipe out this tax cut. Goodness knows what the cost to a family will be in terms of the additional expense of sending their child or children to university with an increase in fees of up to 30 per cent. That will certainly wipe out this tax cut for the next 10 years for the average Australian family. We need to look at this so-called tax cut in that context. 
I think it would have surprised the Treasurer and the government—it certainly was a surprise to me, albeit a pleasant surprise—that it was none other than Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Family and Community Services, who really torpedoed the value of the government's own tax cut by her comments this morning on the Life Matters program when she was interviewed by Ms Doogue. In the context of what $5 can buy—bear in mind the average tax cut is $4—Senator Vanstone said: 
Five dollars, hell, what will it buy you? A sandwich and a milkshake if you're lucky.
That is Senator Vanstone's very correct analysis of the value of this $4 tax cut. It will buy you a sandwich and a milkshake. Of course, it will not even buy that if you have to go to the doctor and pay the extra fees that will flow as a consequence of this budget, and it certainly will not buy a sandwich or even half a milkshake if you have to send your child or children to university. Four dollars will not even buy two loaves of bread. As I said earlier, Senator Vanstone has very perceptively pointed out that it will not even buy you a sandwich and a milkshake.
If $5 is not enough for Australia's poorest citizens, how can $4 be sufficient for average families? I think it is an insult to suggest that $4, which will disappear by this time next year because of bracket creep, will make a significant difference and an improvement in the lives of struggling lower- and middle-income families in this country, particularly when they are going to have to put the tax cut in one pocket and fork out considerably more as a consequence of higher medical costs and, when they intend or wish to send their child to university, higher university fees.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2003-05-14,"—I also rise to take note of matters arising from the budget and the way in which the Howard government has really kept this country on the right track over the last seven years compared with the previous seven years under the last Labor government. It is an interesting contrast. The pivotal point in history in Australia is the election of the Howard government in 1996: go back seven years under Labor and compare what was happening then, and then move on seven years and see what is happening now. We should compare the really important outcomes in the economy and the record inflation under the last Labor government with the low inflation now. We should compare the incredibly high jobless rates and 11 per cent unemployment with the figure of around six per cent now. We should compare interest rates which were up to 17 per cent back then and which are now down to around five or six per cent. Unemployment rates, interest rates and foreign debt levels, in addition to inflation and job outcomes, have all improved massively under this government. 
Last night we brought down what I think was one of the best budgets in the history of this government. The criticism we heard this morning has not really cut across the major thrusts of the budget and the important changes in tackling the hard issues that have happened under the coalition government. For example, Labor left Medicare in a total mess and we have now brought major reforms to that area. In higher education, Labor were so bankrupt at the end of their time in government that their solution to the lack of money in universities in 1996 was that the universities should borrow money and then pay it back. That was a totally unsustainable solution. The Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, is to be congratulated on putting together a totally visionary package, on bringing the sector with him and on reforming it in such a way that it now has substantially more planned resources over the next 10 years.
I would like the Labor Party to remember one figure and that is the comparison between Kim Beazley's Knowledge Nation and what we did last night. The amount of money promised in Knowledge Nation was only half what this government delivered last night.
—And ours is paid for.
—That is exactly right. We are delivering $1.2 billion extra over the next four years. That money will go up over those four years and put a decent funding base under the sector. We have changed the HECS system in a way that allows universities on four bands to set their own levels between the bottom and the top of each band. If a university wants to charge zero, it can. The bands run from zero up to the different levels. We have introduced a level, particularly in the national priority areas such as nursing and teaching, where the amount of money is much lower than in the other bands. We also have major reforms for regional universities, with another $122 million to support our regional universities. There are equity places and another 25,000 scholarships being offered across the system over the next four years. There is an improvement in the funding of places across our system, we have put $54 million into learning and teaching, and a national institute of learning and teaching is being established.
This government has delivered on higher education. That is something the previous government was unable to do. In the final few seconds available to me, I want to contrast what happened in the schools system previously under Labor and what is happening at a state level under Labor now with what is happening under our government. We continue to increase funding to public schools at a much faster rate than the state ALP governments.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I would also like to take note of the answers to questions today in relation to the budget and address some of the issues of concern to me as I represent people from regional Australia. Many of those people are in the lower income brackets which have been so generously addressed with a $4 a week tax cut and I would like to consider what that tax cut and some of the budget outcomes might represent for those people. However, it is important to take note of Senator Vanstone's comments and efforts on ABC Radio this morning. When she took calls from people receiving student allowances like Youth Allowance, she said that $5 more a week would make a significant difference. In that interview she said:
We do care. If I can put it in perspective, you know we were mentioning it's a third of government outlays we spend, and on a one-on-one basis someone says to me, `Couldn't people just have $5 more?' and you meet people in very impecunious circumstances and your heart just opens up and of course you want to give them $5 more. Five dollars? Hell, what will it buy? It might buy you a sandwich and a milkshake if you're lucky. 
That is exactly right, Senator Vanstone: what does $5 a week buy? It certainly might buy you a sandwich and a milkshake if you are lucky. If you are a working family, it might buy you a litre of milk and a loaf of bread or a perhaps a kilo of mince as a contribution to the family's budget, but that is all. 
An average Australian family earning between $30,000 and $50,000 will not be able to buy very much at all with Treasurer Costello's $4-a-week tax cut. In many respects it is an absolute insult. But, to make matters worse, it is the poorest Australians Senator Vanstone was speaking about this morning in her interview. They got absolutely nothing in the budget. They did not get $5; they got nothing. What is more, the minister tried to dismiss the importance of the problem of effective marginal tax rates being faced by welfare recipients who are trying to move into work. In her interview this morning, the senator said:
I do worry that there has been an inordinate focus on what we call effective marginal tax rates.
Then, when pressed on the punishing tax rates faced by people moving from welfare to work, she offered this:
It is too high—that is when it goes over 100c in the dollar. It is obviously too high when a family is worse off. But on an individual basis I do not think there is anything wrong, anything harsh. In fact, I think it is something to be proud of that you replace $1 earned for yourself for $1 that was otherwise coming from other taxpayers because it means you're becoming more independent and people should be proud of that and not see it as burden.
The problem is that, if you are no better off for every dollar you earn, it is pretty hard to justify working—particularly when your income is very low. The fact is that Senator Vanstone is part of a government that has slugged Australian families and has left people on welfare trapped in poverty. This is what this really represents: it is a poverty trap, and the budget does nothing to tip the scales in favour of these Australians who are actually sinking. 
The Howard government's budget does not share the wealth that is being created in this country. When you think about what the government has delivered in terms of its significant surplus, the fact is that so much of it has come by taking money away from services for average families in this country. The average gross earnings for families in this country are about $800 per week, and after tax that is about $615 a week. With a mortgage repayment of perhaps $220 a week, that leaves $395 for everything else. If you think that is bad, spare a thought for the 2½ million Australians living below the poverty line—$415 a week for a couple with two children to pay for everything. Over the last five years, the gains have been at the top end and have dwarfed those for people at the bottom. Consider some of the blue ribbon seats, such as Wentworth and North Sydney, where family incomes are between—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget 2003-04</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-05-14,"—The issue to which I hope to refer—namely, higher education—has been referred to not only in other contributions but, indeed, in most of the minister's answers today. I want to make very clear and put on the record the Democrats' response to the proposed reforms for higher education released in last night's budget. When Senator Tierney talks about the cut-price or reduced fees for nursing and teaching places, he fails to acknowledge that those fees merely remain the same. It is the other fees that will increase. While nurses and teachers have received somewhat of a break or an alleviation of their fees and charges, it is still a pretty appalling position to put aspiring students in, given the teacher and nursing shortage that is predicted for this country. 
Across the board, we are looking at not the introduction of but the extension of user pays in our higher education system. It is almost the complete privatisation of higher education as we know it. In my question to the minister—to which I did not get a response—I pointed out the fact that we are now overtaking the United States as the third most privatised higher education system in the world at that level. Certainly we have among the highest fees and charges. We know the HECS increase of up to 30 per cent will be a psychological and financial disincentive to students wanting to enter into and participate in higher education. We also know who is going to be hardest hit by that. It is going to be poor kids, Indigenous kids and those from regional backgrounds because in the last 10 years their participation rates in higher education have not improved. And they are not going to improve as a consequence of last night's changes; they are going to get worse. 
In my question to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Treasurer, I asked whether or not they had reneged on or disregarded the notion in the Crossroads report that acknowledges that for some groups the Higher Education Contribution Scheme has been a barrier. This budget is going to erect more barriers to education. As for the doubling of full fee paying places for undergraduate education, we cannot even fill the places that are currently available. But we know who will be able to access those places. We also know on current trends that quality will be sacrificed—tertiary entrance requirements are going to get lower. If you can afford to pay, yes, there are examples of wealthier students getting in, but their TERs are not necessarily as good as they should be in comparison to the HECS funded places. 
I know student groups and academic and general staff groups are going to be very angry. The postgraduate sector is appalled. Yes, I know that the AVCC are on record saying that they support this package—because they are being blackmailed. They have been given back the $1.5 billion that was cut out in 1996-97. This is not new money. How dare people say this is paid for, as though it were some kind of new reinvestment in public education? It is putting back what this government cut in 1996-97. The AVCC seem to be saying that four to five grand for the average student is the price of a small car. I am not sure how many vice-chancellors are paying for small cars these days; I think they get that in their packages. Let us not pretend that this is a little bit onerous for some students; this means law degrees that take three years and that are charged at up to 30 per cent extra will cost $25,065—to be precise—per degree.
That is not an up-front fee place; that is what law will cost at some institutions from 2005. That is an extraordinary fee, considering the number of students in Australia now who are doing law or are aspiring to do law. As Dr Carolyn Allport from the NTEU said last night, increasingly it is like an arts degree. It is a very popular course. Those students who study and graduate from law do not always get a huge income and do not always practise law, but they are providing community benefit as well. That is what this government is missing: the fact that investment in education has a community benefit and we should treat higher education—in fact, education at all levels—as an investment, not a cost. This is not about backing Australia's future; it is about hacking Australia's future. The government can say all it likes in question time today or on record elsewhere that it thinks this is actually some kind of investment in future graduates and our community, but I think everyone out there knows the reality. They know exactly what this means, particularly for the disadvantaged in our higher education system. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-05-14,"—I present the fourth report of 2003 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No.5 of 2003, dated 14 May 2003. 
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On 19 March 2003, I advised the Senate about the continuing concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee with the quality of some of the explanatory memoranda which accompany bills. I further advised that the committee had written to the Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Peter Slipper MP, and to the First Parliamentary Counsel, Ms Hilary Penfold QC, about these issues.
The committee has now received a very constructive reply from the Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, advising that he agreed with the committee that agencies should be made aware of the relevant requirements in preparing explanatory memoranda. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has therefore issued a legislation circular to remind all agencies of these requirements and to alert them to the concerns of the committee.
The legislation circular sets out the role and functions of the committee and attaches a copy of the tabling statement for Alert Digest No. 3 of 2003, which detailed the main problems relating to explanatory memoranda. The circular emphasises that EMs should clearly explain provisions which fall within the committee's terms of reference. It also asks that the tabling statement be brought to the attention of all officers who prepare EMs.
The committee has also received a most helpful reply from the First Parliamentary Counsel which sets out the role of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in the preparation of explanatory memoranda and suggestions for improving this process. The OPC has no direct input into preparing or checking EM. It does have an indirect influence, however, in that its drafters mention to instructing departments some matters which do need to be included in the EM, including provisions which would interest the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The OPC also advises instructors to begin the preparation of EM as early as possible, because the EM process often reveals difficulties in the draft bill itself. Nevertheless, the OPC has no responsibility for monitoring the final EM.
In relation to improving EM, the OPC agreed with the committee that it would be useful to emphasise to agencies, and especially to their policy areas, that the legislation handbook and legislation circulars provide standards for explanatory memoranda. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel also advised that it might be appropriate to establish a training course in preparing explanatory memoranda for agency staff who are responsible for developing legislation. 
The OPC further advised, however, that there may be more fundamental problems which explain why so many explanatory memoranda do not reach an acceptable standard. The first of these difficulties is the experience of staff who prepare explanatory memoranda. The office has noticed a continuing tendency for agencies to assign legislation projects to staff at lower and lower levels of classification. At present it is usual for quite junior staff to have the daily responsibility for this type of work, with only nominal input from senior executive service level officers. These non-SES staff, while competent, are typically inexperienced in legislative work and receive inadequate supervision and direction. There is a further problem in that the non-SES staff tend to move on to other jobs, often within the same agency and even during a legislative project. The result is a lack of continuity, in that staff are unable to gain reasonable experience in this area and what experience they have is lost when they go. It is these staff who prepare EM, the quality of which is affected by their lack of supervision and experience.
In addition to these deficiencies, the office has identified what it describes as an even more significant factor in the standard of explanatory memoranda, which is the lack of time allowed for their preparation. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that the deadlines for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to receive bills and explanatory memoranda for introduction are the same. In practice, bills are often completed actually on these deadlines, so there is virtually no scope for final revision of explanatory memoranda.
Another consideration noted by the office is that it is difficult to prepare an explanatory memoranda while a bill is still being drafted. This is the case in relation to both the bill as a whole and individual clauses. It is not practical for instructors to prepare an explanatory memoranda at the same time as finalising a bill, although this is what most agencies expect. Also, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that it is very rare for agencies to resource legislative projects so that some people work on the bill and others on the explanatory memorandum.
In this context, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel suggests that the reasons why bills are often finished right on the deadline are significant. One of these reasons is that such deadlines are sometimes set without taking into account the nature of the legislative project, which itself may expand without any alteration to the deadlines. Also there may be pressures to introduce a bill as soon as it appears to be ready, even though work on other parts of the project, such as the explanatory memoranda, may not be complete. Even in cases where bills are not introduced for some time after drafting has largely been completed, there are factors which largely preclude effective checking of the explanatory memoranda.
The Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that the lack of time for the preparation of adequate explanatory memoranda might be addressed by having separate deadlines for bills and EM. This would recognise that a proper EM cannot be prepared until both the broad structure and the individual provisions of a bill are known. The OPC notes that some individual agencies have tried this approach but in the opinion of the office it should be enforced by a central coordinating agency. 
The committee is most grateful for these replies, which have significantly assisted in its consideration of the matter. The committee has not yet completed its deliberations in relation to explanatory memoranda, and it may be possible that there will be further initiatives based on the advice in the letter from the First Parliamentary Counsel. The committee will report in full to the Senate on future developments.

On 19 March 2003, I advised the Senate about the continuing concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee with the quality of some of the explanatory memoranda which accompany bills. I further advised that the committee had written to the Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Hon. Peter Slipper MP, and to the First Parliamentary Counsel, Ms Hilary Penfold QC, about these issues.
The committee has now received a very constructive reply from the Acting Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, advising that he agreed with the committee that agencies should be made aware of the relevant requirements in preparing explanatory memoranda. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has therefore issued a legislation circular to remind all agencies of these requirements and to alert them to the concerns of the committee.
The legislation circular sets out the role and functions of the committee and attaches a copy of the tabling statement for Alert Digest No. 3 of 2003, which detailed the main problems relating to explanatory memoranda. The circular emphasises that EMs should clearly explain provisions which fall within the committee's terms of reference. It also asks that the tabling statement be brought to the attention of all officers who prepare EMs.
The committee has also received a most helpful reply from the First Parliamentary Counsel which sets out the role of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in the preparation of explanatory memoranda and suggestions for improving this process. The OPC has no direct input into preparing or checking EM. It does have an indirect influence, however, in that its drafters mention to instructing departments some matters which do need to be included in the EM, including provisions which would interest the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The OPC also advises instructors to begin the preparation of EM as early as possible, because the EM process often reveals difficulties in the draft bill itself. Nevertheless, the OPC has no responsibility for monitoring the final EM.
In relation to improving EM, the OPC agreed with the committee that it would be useful to emphasise to agencies, and especially to their policy areas, that the legislation handbook and legislation circulars provide standards for explanatory memoranda. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel also advised that it might be appropriate to establish a training course in preparing explanatory memoranda for agency staff who are responsible for developing legislation. 
The OPC further advised, however, that there may be more fundamental problems which explain why so many explanatory memoranda do not reach an acceptable standard. The first of these difficulties is the experience of staff who prepare explanatory memoranda. The office has noticed a continuing tendency for agencies to assign legislation projects to staff at lower and lower levels of classification. At present it is usual for quite junior staff to have the daily responsibility for this type of work, with only nominal input from senior executive service level officers. These non-SES staff, while competent, are typically inexperienced in legislative work and receive inadequate supervision and direction. There is a further problem in that the non-SES staff tend to move on to other jobs, often within the same agency and even during a legislative project. The result is a lack of continuity, in that staff are unable to gain reasonable experience in this area and what experience they have is lost when they go. It is these staff who prepare EM, the quality of which is affected by their lack of supervision and experience.
In addition to these deficiencies, the office has identified what it describes as an even more significant factor in the standard of explanatory memoranda, which is the lack of time allowed for their preparation. The Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that the deadlines for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to receive bills and explanatory memoranda for introduction are the same. In practice, bills are often completed actually on these deadlines, so there is virtually no scope for final revision of explanatory memoranda.
Another consideration noted by the office is that it is difficult to prepare an explanatory memoranda while a bill is still being drafted. This is the case in relation to both the bill as a whole and individual clauses. It is not practical for instructors to prepare an explanatory memoranda at the same time as finalising a bill, although this is what most agencies expect. Also, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that it is very rare for agencies to resource legislative projects so that some people work on the bill and others on the explanatory memorandum.
In this context, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel suggests that the reasons why bills are often finished right on the deadline are significant. One of these reasons is that such deadlines are sometimes set without taking into account the nature of the legislative project, which itself may expand without any alteration to the deadlines. Also there may be pressures to introduce a bill as soon as it appears to be ready, even though work on other parts of the project, such as the explanatory memoranda, may not be complete. Even in cases where bills are not introduced for some time after drafting has largely been completed, there are factors which largely preclude effective checking of the explanatory memoranda.
The Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that the lack of time for the preparation of adequate explanatory memoranda might be addressed by having separate deadlines for bills and EM. This would recognise that a proper EM cannot be prepared until both the broad structure and the individual provisions of a bill are known. The OPC notes that some individual agencies have tried this approach but in the opinion of the office it should be enforced by a central coordinating agency. 
The committee is most grateful for these replies, which have significantly assisted in its consideration of the matter. The committee has not yet completed its deliberations in relation to explanatory memoranda, and it may be possible that there will be further initiatives based on the advice in the letter from the First Parliamentary Counsel. The committee will report in full to the Senate on future developments.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-05-14,"—On behalf of the chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Terrorism Insurance Bill 2002, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-05-14,"—On behalf of Senator Ferguson, of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present a report on the proposed development of off-base housing for Defence at Adamstown, Newcastle in New South Wales. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
—I seek leave to have a tabling statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
The report addresses the construction of 72 new dwellings for Defence personnel at Adamstown, a suburb of Newcastle, located some 7 kilometres from the city centre. The work was proposed by the Defence Housing Authority and is estimated to cost $21.6 million.
The impetus for this work came from the most recent Defence Housing Forecast for the Newcastle area, which predicted a growth in the Defence requirement from 839 homes in the current financial year to a total of 892 in the 2005-2006 financial year. 
This figure partially reflects the increase in Defence personnel expected in association with the establishment at RAAF Base Williamtown of the Airborne Early Warning and Control capability. Works associated with the implementation of this new system were the subject of the Committee's second report of 2002. Evidence given to that inquiry indicated that personnel numbers at RAAF Base Williamtown would increase by 350.
A further motivation for the proposed work is the need to provide a broader range of housing options for Defence personnel in the Newcastle area. At present, much of the available Defence housing is concentrated in suburbs near the RAAF Base, located some 30 kilometres from the Newcastle CBD. The current proposal will satisfy the requirements of those Defence Force members who have a particular need—for reasons related to spouse employment or the education of older children—to live closer to the city centre.
The proposal will also increase the amount of housing stock owned and managed by the Defence Housing Authority, thereby decreasing the amount of rental allowance being paid to Defence personnel renting homes through the private market. 
The proposal brought before the Committee consists of 72 dwellings, comprising 60 four-bedroom detached houses and 12 three-bedroom townhouses, and associated road works and utilities. This range of housing types reflects the preferences of Defence personnel as expressed in a recent survey undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority.
Whilst the proposal was given unqualified support by the Commander of RAAF Base Williamtown and by representatives of Defence Families Australia, objections were raised by local residents' groups. 
Residents' worries related mainly to:
·	the level of community consultation undertaken by the Defence Housing authority; and 
·	the potentially dangerous nature of a proposed open space, which is immediately adjacent to the local golf course.
In their evidence to the Committee, representatives of local residents' groups expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the level of community consultation undertaken by the Defence Housing Authority. 
Concerns raised by residents in relation to traffic impacts and environmental issues were largely addressed in expert reports prepared for the Defence Housing Authority during the planning stage of the development, but residents stated that they had not been given access to these reports. At the public hearing, the Authority acknowledged the need to resolve remaining areas of community concern and undertook to make relevant expert reports available to interested residents. The Committee recommended that, in future, the Defence Housing Authority ensure that there is adequate direct community consultation.
Local residents and the President of the Merewether Golf Club also expressed concern at the location of the development's proposed open space, which abuts the golf club grounds at the south-east corner of the site. Fears were raised that residents using this open area may be hit and injured by off-course golf balls. The Defence Housing Authority stated that their intention was for this area to serve as a `passive' open space that would double as a retention basin for water run-off, and not as an `active' recreational area. Residents of the new development may, nevertheless, enter the area.
The Committee recommended that the Defence Housing Authority work with the Newcastle City Council and the Merewether Golf Club to ensure that appropriate measures be taken to guarantee public safety. The Authority undertook to assist the Golf Club in erecting a physical barrier if necessary.
At the public hearing, the Committee was informed that, while the Development Control Plan for the proposed work had been completed and submitted to Council for public comment, there is no statutory time-frame in which the Newcastle City Council is obliged to make a determination on that Plan. The Defence Housing Authority expects completion of the first 35 dwellings by June 2004 and the remainder by October 2004, but this is dependent upon Council approval for the work being granted in late April 2003. The Committee was concerned that uncertainties surrounding critical project milestones may impact upon the overall cost of the development. This was particularly worrying given the very small contingency provision included in the project budget. 
During in-camera deliberations on the project costs the Committee's unease was compounded by indefinite figures and omissions noted in the budget.
In view of this, the Committee requested that the Defence Housing Authority provide a complete and updated feasibility study, and recommended that, in future, the Committee be provided with a full feasibility and contingency study prior to the public hearing.
Overall, the Committee acknowledges that the project will provide much-needed housing for Defence personnel in the Newcastle region and will expand the range of housing options available to them. Therefore, the Committee has recommended that the proposed works proceed at the estimated cost of $21.6 million, pending the satisfaction of the recommendations contained in its report.
Mr President, I would like to thank my Committee colleagues for their contribution to this inquiry. I also wish to thank the staff of the secretariat for their support. 
I commend the Report to the Senate.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2003-05-14,"—by leave—Mr Acting Deputy President, senators will recall that on 18 March this year the Senate resolved to support the government's decision to commit Australian Defence Force personnel to the international coalition to disarm Iraq. The coalition undertook to enforce Iraq's compliance with its obligations under successive resolutions of the United Nations Security Council with a view to restoring peace and security to that area of the Middle East.
I am pleased to report that the coalition's major combat operations in Iraq have been successfully concluded.
Australian military forces participated with just cause in an action properly based in international law, which resulted in the liberation of an oppressed people.
Australian defence forces acquitted themselves with great distinction and professionalism. They rightly won the admiration not only of the Australian people but also of our allies.
I know that all Australians will join me in expressing our immense gratitude that no Australian casualties have so far been sustained.
Both the Prime Minister and I have been told by so many senior members of the Australian Defence Force that the absence of casualties is due, in no small measure, to the predeployment of our forces some weeks before the military operation commenced.
This pre-positioning added weight to the attempt to pressure Saddam Hussein into compliance and, more importantly, it gave our people the opportunity to prepare and acclimatise, enhancing their performance and their security in the event of conflict.
Not only was the victory achieved quickly but the doomsday predictions were not realised: the oil wells were not set on fire; there were not millions of refugees; the dams on the Tigris and the Euphrates were not breached to bring on catastrophic flooding; there was no long drawn-out bloody siege for Baghdad. For all this we are extremely grateful.
The decisive victory of the American-led coalition reflects great credit on the strength and determination of President Bush's leadership. It also has immense implications, not least the momentum that it has already begun to generate towards achieving a Middle East peace settlement.
President Bush and his administration are determined to do all they can to advance the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.
The President made this very clear to the Prime Minister during their recent discussions in the United States.
Now that the major combat phase is over and efforts in Iraq rightly turn to humanitarian assistance, we have begun to bring home our defence personnel.
This month we will be welcoming home HMAS Anzac and HMAS Darwin, the airmen and women and support crews deployed with the FA18 Hornet aircraft, the majority of the Special Air Service units, the Commando and Incident Response Regiment elements, the CH47 Helicopter Detachment and the Navy clearance diver team.
Some military forces are still required to restore peace and security and assist in the rehabilitation of the Iraqi nation. 
Our military deployment will be limited given current commitments in our own region. Many other nations have indicated a willingness to provide peacekeeping assistance in Iraq. The government has made clear all along that Australia would not be in a position to provide peacekeeping forces in Iraq. Our coalition partners clearly understood and accepted our position.
However, the following ADF capabilities will either remain or be deployed to Iraq: an Australian National Headquarters element; HMAS Sydney; HMAS Kanimbla and a naval task group command element; an Army commando element for a brief period; two P3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft and support; two C130 Hercules transport aircraft and support; an air traffic control element to support air operations at Baghdad International Airport; a security group for the new Australian Representational Mission in Baghdad, as well as civilian and military experts working on locating and eliminating WMD in Iraq.
Our commitment for this phase of the operation is currently in the order of 1,200 personnel. For Australia and the families of those involved this remains a significant deployment.
It is our intention to ensure that the period of coalition control is kept to a minimum and that the responsibility for governing Iraq is taken up by an interim Iraqi authority as soon as practicable. This will be the first step on the pathway to representative government.
It is worth briefly recalling the history of events that led to our decision to participate in the coalition's operations in Iraq.
The cease-fire of 1991, which concluded the first Gulf War, prohibited Iraq from maintaining any biological, chemical or nuclear weapons capability.
For 12 years the United Nations sought to cajole and coerce Iraq into compliance. Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, even in the face of a substantial military threat, demonstrated that the community of nations had come to a critical point in this long-running conflict. If Saddam Hussein was to be disarmed, we had to be prepared to resort to force.
I remind the Senate, and through it the people of Australia, that the Security Council was unanimous in its view that Saddam Hussein had continued his weapons of mass destruction programs and that Iraq was therefore in material breach of its obligations under a long series of Security Council resolutions.
There has always been a fear that the more nations that possess these weapons, the more likely they will eventually be used. This fear is compounded when they are in the hands of regimes that show a total disregard for common humanity and the rule of law, aggressive and belligerent regimes like that overseen by Saddam Hussein. 
But the greatest fear is that these weapons will find their way into the hands of terrorists. The events of 11 September 2001 and the atrocity in Bali have clearly demonstrated that international terrorists have no regard for human life. Terrorist organisations like al-Qaeda want these weapons. And make no mistake—if they obtain them they will use them.
Through its actions in Iraq the coalition has sent a clear signal to other rogue states and terrorist groups alike—the world is prepared to take a stand. We do not for one moment regret that decision. It was right, it was lawful and it was in Australia's national interest. 
The government is enormously proud of the magnificent job done by our forces. They have rightly earned the praise of their coalition partners.  
Our forces performed superbly in accordance with their very fine reputation for professionalism and skill and courage. I want, on behalf of the country, to record our deepest admiration, our respect and gratitude to all of them. Most of all, I hope that the situation in Iraq can be stabilised relatively quickly and that all our forces will be home, safely and soon, with their families. I am confident that these sentiments are shared by all Australians. They have done this country proud.
I know that the desire to see them home is felt most keenly by their families and friends. The Prime Minister was grateful that he had the opportunity to meet some of the families over the last weeks. 
There is a special bond between the community and the armed forces which serve their nation's interests. When our forces are deployed to combat, we feel it all the more keenly. At the heart of that bond is the recognition that military service carries a commitment to sacrifice.
When the Prime Minister visited Qatar last week he let our people know that everyone in Australia is keen to welcome them home as soon as possible. The nation will have an opportunity to show its heartfelt thanks in the near future. All the men and women involved both in the war in Iraq and the broader international coalition against terrorism will be invited to march through the streets of Sydney and Perth. I encourage all who are able, to gather and join in expressing our thanks for a successful operation and our unqualified pleasure at their safe homecoming.
In Qatar the Prime Minister meet Brigadier Maurie McNarn, the Commander of Australian National Headquarters in the Middle East. I too would like to congratulate Brigadier McNarn, on behalf of the nation, for commanding our forces so successfully. While I know that his family will appreciate these sentiments, I also know that their attention will be overwhelmingly focused on his homecoming, now just a few short days away.
The military campaign in Iraq was astonishingly speedy and effective. It has been a remarkable campaign and a great tribute to the American military leadership. Most importantly, every attempt was made by the coalition forces to ensure that civilian casualties were kept to an absolute minimum. Our quarrel was with Saddam Hussein's regime, not with the people of Iraq.
We did not only rely on technology, on the use of precision guided weapons, but also on strict targeting policies—policies which Saddam Hussein tried to take advantage of. It is a cruel irony that the Iraqi leadership had less regard for the wellbeing of the Iraqi people than the coalition forces. How else can you explain the placement of artillery, military communications systems, munitions stores and the like in urban areas, in schools, in kindergartens, in hospitals?
It is a testament not only to our fighting men and women, but also to our defence hierarchy, that when missions were aborted out of concern for the impact on civilians, such decisions were praised not admonished.
The government also wants to pay tribute to the contributions of the American, British and other coalition forces. They have behaved and conducted themselves with great honour and distinction. The coalition has, I believe, set new standards of integrity and ethical behaviour in military conflict. This new attitude reflects the reality that the modern military man or woman is as much a conciliator and a peacekeeper as he or she is a fighter. 
The speed and effectiveness of the coalition campaign also reflects the lack of organised military operations by the Iraqi forces against the coalition. Perhaps we should not have been surprised by this. It was probably the first signal of the real feelings of the Iraqi people—they were not willing to sacrifice their lives to save a brutal despot. 
Saddam Hussein was not Iraq. Once they could be sure that his regime was crumbling, we saw, in the streets of Baghdad, Basra, and hundreds of other towns all over Iraq, expressions of joy—the sheer joy of freedom.
Of course, for some, that joy will be tempered by sadness. Tragically, despite all the efforts of the coalition, there have been civilian casualties. The death of innocent people, especially children, should always shock and sadden us, lest we lose our basic humanity. But, when we consider the civilian death and suffering in Iraq now—and we are touched by it and grieve for it—we must not forget the deaths and suffering of millions of Iraqis over the past 25 years.
Saddam Hussein and his regime stand accused of the most serious crimes against humanity. Since Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979, torture and summary executions have been a routine mechanism of state control.
You would all have read the reports of the most diabolical and cruel punishments. The coalition forces have only just begun the task of collecting specific and hard evidence of these terrible violations of human rights. They have already uncovered considerable circumstantial evidence, but the task of gathering proof will be time-consuming, difficult, frustrating and harrowing, especially for the families of the victims.
Despite its dark past Iraq now has a promising future, but, as is the case with all beginnings, it is a period of enormous challenge.
Security is the most important immediate priority. The people of Iraq cannot consider their future until their day-to-day security is assured. They must be able to go to work, go to school, meet and discuss issues freely.
The coalition must also work to provide basic humanitarian support for the Iraqis. Without secure food supplies, clean drinking water, functioning sewerage systems, reliable electricity, transport and fuel, there will be little opportunity for the Iraqi people to turn their attention to their political infrastructure.
It is critical that the world not believe that the current dilapidated state of Iraq's infrastructure is entirely due to military conflict. Even before the conflict started, Iraq's infrastructure was severely degraded. The telecommunications network required urgent attention, oil and gas infrastructure had deteriorated greatly, electricity generation was at less than half its nominal capacity and, partly because of the poor state of the distribution system, power cuts were common. Water supplies were increasingly vulnerable to contamination by raw sewage and access to safe drinking water was a major concern.
These deficiencies stem from longstanding neglect. It is salutary to consider that more Iraqi lives have been lost to dirty drinking water than to the recent conflict.
Australia takes its rehabilitation responsibilities very seriously. Our contribution, as in the conflict phase, will be to focus our limited resources in niche areas where we have expertise and where a concerted effort can make a difference. We have committed some $100 million in aid. We have provided highly skilled personnel to contribute to key humanitarian planning and reconstruction efforts.
We are keen to play a strong role in rehabilitating Iraqi agriculture, an area where our expertise in dry-land farming, salination and irrigation may prove useful to the Iraqi people. Another focus of our humanitarian efforts will be in the water and sanitation sector. 
In addition to meeting these obligations, the coalition is working hard to rid Iraq of all weapons of mass destruction. The hunt for these weapons will not be easy. We know that, in order to protect them from inspectors, the Iraqi regime broke them up and hid them in their disaggregated condition in different parts of the country.
We are starting to uncover the evidence. We have found what appear to be mobile biological weapon production facilities, just like those described by the US Secretary of State to the Security Council in February.
It is going to take considerable time and resources to complete the investigation and destruction of the regime's weapons of mass destruction, but at least we will no longer be obstructed by a hostile regime.
Australia has joined the United States and the United Kingdom as partners in the coalition transitional authority in Iraq. The coalition's aim is to create the circumstances in which the Iraqis will have the opportunity to establish a representative government of their choosing. We are not in the business of imposing a particular model of democracy on the Iraqi people.
The transitional phase will be enormously challenging. Restoring political stability and promoting democracy in Iraq are daunting tasks. Iraq has no history of representative democracy and is marked by significant religious and ethnic divides. It will also take time and sustained effort to overcome the corrosive effects of Saddam Hussein's dictatorship.
But Iraq is a relatively modern and sophisticated country with good economic prospects; not just because of its oil resources but because its people are strong and well skilled and have a strong entrepreneurial ethos.
While it is not for the coalition to dictate the form of Iraq's new government, we will seek to establish a representative process so that Iraqis can, for the first time, choose their leaders via a process that respects democratic principles and respects Iraq's religious and ethnic mix. As a committed supporter of the Australian democratic system it should be no surprise that the Prime Minister has speculated that a federal model may be appropriate. But again that is up to the Iraqi people to determine the best way to preserve Iraq's territorial integrity and enhance the stability of the immediate region.
The government considers that the United Nations could play a significant, practical role in support of the transitional processes.
The United Nations is best placed to help mobilise and coordinate aid efforts, help transfer power to the Iraqis and consolidate international acceptance of the new regime. But the Security Council will need to act much more constructively than it has to date if the United Nations is to have any meaningful role in rehabilitating Iraq.
The Prime Minister's talks last week with President Bush underlined the deepening and strengthening relationship between our two nations. The relationship between Australia and America has never been stronger. This relationship is not forced or contrived. We are allies because we are friends—close friends. And that friendship is based above all else on a commonality of views. We share a view of the world that values freedom and individual liberty.
Both our nations recognise the threat posed to our communities by international terrorists. We understand the dangers of leaving the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction unchecked. Our longstanding security alliance with the United States provides a solid and reliable basis for us to cooperate on addressing these issues. 
The shared intelligence and the access to cutting-edge defence and security technologies that the alliance facilitates are vital to ensuring Australia's security, and will only become more important in the future.
But neither nation seeks to promote this relationship at the expense of another. The government will continue to develop and enhance relationships wherever and whenever we can see an advantage for Australia. Our national interest is best served by a network of alliances and relationships.
The government also wishes to place on record our great respect for the strength of leadership displayed by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Australia's relationship with the United Kingdom is not a relic of history. It is rich and diverse. It extends across so many generations, in so many areas, and has, of course, been reinforced by recent experience. 
Without the determination demonstrated by President Bush and his administration, without the dogged resolve of Mr Blair, Saddam Hussein's intransigence would never have been addressed. 
The strengthening of these longstanding and important ties with America and Britain does not mean for a moment that Australia has diminished other important relationships. Indeed, we have been very careful to ensure that our region understands our involvement in Iraq. 
Earlier this year the Prime Minister visited Indonesia to consult President Megawati on this and other matters. Although Indonesia has taken a very different position on Iraq, the President did not want this issue to affect our close bilateral relationship.
She specifically assured the Prime Minister that Indonesia would not view a military operation to oust Saddam Hussein as an attack on Islam.
Other friends and important regional partners actively supported the coalition's operations—Japan, Korea, Singapore for example. It is wrong to characterise our participation in Iraq as somehow out of step with our neighbours.
I return to the question of Israel and the Palestinians. As I have indicated, the Prime Minister drew great encouragement from President Bush's clearly stated determination to work as hard as possible to achieve a peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. Australia has been a staunch friend and ally of Israel for some 50 years, but we nonetheless recognise the imperative for an independent Palestinian state.
We know that this issue is also very close to the heart of Mr Blair.
The Prime Minister has assured both President Bush and Mr Blair that the Australian government will assist in any way it can to achieve a successful outcome for the new peace process. It will not be easy but one thing should be clearly understood and give hope—there is a great determination on the part of the US administration and the United Kingdom to do everything possible to achieve that objective. If ever there was a moment for the Israeli and Palestinian people to seize, this is it.
We hope that the Iraqis too will seize their moment. The sooner we can get them involved in their own governance, in their administration, the better, for only the Iraqi people are in a position to determine what is in their national interest.
This is the first time in my lifetime that the people of Iraq have a real and genuine opportunity to have a free, open and democratic society. I would hope that I speak for everyone in this place, for every Australian, when we offer them our support and assistance in achieving this objective. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the statement. 
Leave granted.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-05-14,"—The war in Iraq is over, but the peace is not yet secured. In the months ahead, as Australians reflect on the war in Iraq, they will remember all the half-truths and misinformation provided by Mr Howard in his justification for the war. The Australian people will not forget that the Howard government took Australia to a war that was unnecessary, illegal and unjust. Australians will not forget the government was never once prepared to tell the truth about the commitments it had made prior to the war. They will reflect on the Prime Minister's plea that this war was necessary because Iraq had nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.
Of course, in the Prime Minister's statement today we hardly hear mention of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The justification has disappeared—it is glossed over. The Prime Minister now talks about regime change. But before the war he said regime change was not his policy. He talks about the liberation of Iraq as the reason Australia went to war. The fact is these weapons do not exist in the quantities claimed by the Prime Minister. In his statement to parliament on 4 February, the Prime Minister said:
Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program ...
The International Atomic Energy Agency now says there is no evidence of a nuclear weapon program. The Prime Minister also said:
... all key aspects ... of Iraq's biological weapons program—
including weaponisation—
are active ... and more advanced than they were before the Gulf War.
That was not true. Iraq did not present the imminent strategic threat that the Prime Minister cited as his main reason for going to war. Unfortunately, the parliament and the nation have been deceived. The disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction—and the destruction of the regime of Saddam Hussein—was an important objective, one that was strongly supported by Labor. It was supported unanimously by the UN Security Council in resolution 1441. The reports by Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei showed that progress was being made. With more time it could have achieved the peaceful disarmament of Iraq. Why then did the Prime Minister choose war when a peaceful solution was still available?
But the commitment to war was made—wrongly, in the opposition's view and in the view of millions of Australians. Labor said that we hoped the conflict would end quickly and that the troops could come home soon. All Australians welcomed the end of the war and were thankful that there were no casualties among the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Of course, many people did lose their lives, including over 170 coalition soldiers and an unknown number of innocent Iraqi civilians. Many Australians have been concerned by images of Iraqi people without food, water or shelter—particularly young children.
Australians are also concerned about the increased threat to Australia from terrorist activity as a result of our participation in military action in Iraq. I note that Mr Abbott had the courage to admit that Australia was at greater risk from terrorism as a result of our involvement in Iraq. But the Prime Minister will not admit that. Mr Howard continues to deny the increased threat. But the budget spending on new counter-terrorism measures shows just how real the threat is. Today, many Australians will be asking, `Who was behind the bombing in Saudi Arabia that has killed at least one Australian and injured another?' Australians are also asking themselves, `Has this war made us more secure or less secure in our own region and neighbourhood?' And many Australians are deeply disturbed at the way in which the government has been willing to flout international law and undermine the United Nations in pursuit of its narrow political objectives. 
Australians will always support our troops. We congratulate Australian Defence Force personnel on the courageous and professional way in which they have conducted themselves in Iraq. We are very grateful that they suffered no casualties and we look forward to their safe and early return to their homes and families. Australians, whatever their views on the war, acknowledge the professionalism and dedication of the men and women of our defence forces. We are especially pleased that our community has not repeated the mistakes of the past and that all Australians, regardless of their views about the war, have fully supported our troops.
The Leader of the Opposition was prepared to face the troops and their families and explain that, while the opposition opposed the war, we supported our troops and always will. Our argument has been with the government, not with the troops. This was clearly understood by the troops and their families, and the RSL, whose national president wrote to Mr Crean in these terms:
Above all, we want to see our troops and their families given wholehearted support. For that reason, I am delighted that you [Mr Crean] have publicly weighed in on the side of our troops.
Labor took the view that no military action to disarm Iraq should have taken place without the authority of the United Nations Security Council. That did not happen, and we opposed Australia's participation in the war on that basis. Even today, most Australians and many community organisations such as the RSL would have preferred that action to have been taken under the auspices of the UN. But be clear: Labor does not hold anti-American views. The Curtin Labor government founded Australia's alliance with the United States and Labor has supported it ever since. When we have disagreed with American policy we have expressed our disagreements as friends and allies. Australia should now have the courage to tell the US government that there is a deep concern in the international community about peace and stability when the world's largest military power unilaterally pursues a doctrine of pre-emptive strike.
Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser summed up these concerns in an article in the Age newspaper on 1 May. He said:
The debate is between those who believe in the development of an international system founded in law and agreement, and those who believe in the exercise of American power ...
How the Liberals hate it! Like former Prime Minister Fraser and all other prime ministers before the current incumbent, the opposition believes that it is in Australia's long-term national interest to support a world that is ruled by international cooperation, law and justice and not by unilateralism. It is of deep regret and concern that Mr Howard, the most anti-United Nations Prime Minister in the history of this country, has chosen to take Australia down a different path. The Prime Minister continues to ignore the most fundamental premise of the ANZUS treaty—the commitment of parties under article 1 to resolve international disputes peacefully through the United Nations system. The Prime Minister should stand up for Australia's national interests and remember that, as a middle power, we have no interest in a world where might is right and where the international rule of law is sidelined. 
The Prime Minister has tried desperately to cover his actions in a cloak of respectability. He ignores the clear fact that he has damaged Australia's international reputation and our ability to work cooperatively with our neighbours on more important national security issues such as regional terrorism. He was well aware of the concerns expressed by countries such as Indonesia about the consequences of military action in Iraq without the authority of the United Nations. With the world's largest Muslim population, Indonesia is a country vital to the long-term security of this nation. But the Howard government completely ignored the concerns of the Indonesian government, including President Megawati's statement of 20 March this year in which she said:
War will not only fail to resolve the problem, but it will also cause humanitarian tragedy. The Government and the people of Indonesia are gravely concerned over the innocent civilian casualties and the immense material losses that may result from this military action.
The Prime Minister did not want to hear that message. He probably is not interested either in the views of countries that we have considered close allies for more than a century. Canada and New Zealand have fought alongside Australia in the major wars of the 20th century, but they refused to participate in the war against Iraq. Ask yourself why? The answer is that, unlike the Australia under Mr Howard, Canada and New Zealand actually still believe in upholding international law. They know that, by diminishing the role of the United Nations, Australia and the other members of the coalition of the willing have diminished their own security. Thirty-three countries contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War; only three countries participated in 2003.
We must now turn our attention to the needs of postwar Iraq. There must be a transition to Iraqi self-rule as soon as possible. But there are already problems emerging in the civil administration arrangements and reconstruction efforts. The Prime Minister glosses over the security problems facing Iraq, but the breakdown of law and order is a serious problem that requires urgent attention. On 6 May President Bush was forced to change the leadership of the US administration and appoint Paul Bremer as special presidential envoy to Iraq. He will now oversee coalition reconstruction efforts and the process towards self-governance. Australia, together with the United States and the United Kingdom as the three active military forces in Iraq during the war, has assumed legal obligations as an occupying power under the 1949 Geneva convention. These obligations extend to both the humanitarian requirements and the physical protection of the Iraqi population. Mr Howard failed to tell the Australian people that this would be the consequence of taking military action outside of the United Nations mandate.
Mr Howard said that Australian troops would not be involved in any peacekeeping after the war. In comments published in the Bulletin before the war, the Prime Minister gave his categorical assurance that Australian forces would not be engaged in peacekeeping operations and would return to Australia following the end of the conflict. The Prime Minister said on 11 February 2003:
An ongoing peacekeeping role is not something that I would seek for a moment. If there is a final Australian military commitment it will be of a scale that I have mentioned and we would see it as being of a quite short, specific duration. I don't see any peacekeeping.
That is what the Prime Minister said and now, again, we find it is not the case. We now know that it was just deceit. The Prime Minister appears pathologically incapable of telling the truth to the Australian people on the most important matters of national security. Since the war's end, Mr Howard has committed to keeping 1,200 troops in Iraq, but he will not explain how this figure was arrived at. Mr Howard should tell Australians what agreement he has reached with President Bush and why this level of contribution is essential to fulfil Australia's obligations to secure the peace. He should admit that this burden would be reduced if the United Nations assumed responsibility for the interim authority.  
Our commitment in Iraq is more than Australia's commitment of peacekeepers to East Timor, in which we played the lead role. This expensive and unwelcome position that the Howard government has got Australia into reinforces the need for the United Nations to take the lead in a postwar Iraq. The government has already spent $750 million on this war, and it will cost more than $400 million to keep Australian forces there. We call on the government to move urgently towards a UN sponsored civil and military administration in Iraq. Such an administration provides the only way that Australia can legally transfer its responsibilities in Iraq to a properly constituted Iraqi government where Australia would be one of 191 UN members that would make a contribution to Iraq, not just one of three occupying powers. A UN administration is the best way for Australia to get our troops home quickly and safely.
The Prime Minister is one of those who reject the UN role for the reconstruction of Iraq. But he should remember the pivotal role that the UN played in East Timor, a role that Mr Howard has been prepared to trumpet loud and clear in the past. This is also the same role that the UN successfully played in Cambodia. It was the efforts of Australia under a previous Labor government that drove the peace process in Cambodia in the early 1990s. Through persistence and determination, Australia managed to get the international community to sign onto the most comprehensive peace and reconstruction plan in the history of the UN system. That plan—the `Red Book', as it was called at the time—was the blueprint for the transition in Cambodia from a murderous regime under the Khmer Rouge to the democratic state that it is today. Instead of dismissing the role of the UN, the Howard government should get behind it and start achieving real outcomes.
The opposition believe that the UN is best placed to coordinate the delivery of international humanitarian assistance in the economic reconstruction of Iraq. We believe there should be an international conference held under the auspices of the UN to determine the interim Iraqi authority. Participants in that conference should be drawn from all elements of Iraqi society, including the exile community. The UN is experienced in humanitarian and reconstruction projects. We want to see a democratic government in Iraq, and Australians have been generous in their desire to see Iraq rebuilt. Australia has a great deal of expertise to contribute to the rebuilding of Iraq's economy and the establishment of democratic institutions. Labor urge the Australian government—and all Australians—to give urgent support to both the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people at a government level and the various appeals that have been established.
Recent reports from Iraq indicate that Australia and other coalition members are failing to discharge their full responsibilities under the Geneva Convention to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. Yesterday the Prime Minister chastised those who would dare suggest that war in Iraq would cause a humanitarian crisis. Again, he ignores the facts. He should listen to the officials of the World Health Organisation. On 7 May, the World Health Organisation issued a press release which catalogued the growing number of cases of disease as a result of a lack of clean drinking water and adequate sewerage services. In particular, there is a growing incidence of cholera in Basra among very young children aged between 13 months and four years of age. Furthermore, the head of Medicine Sans Frontieres has attacked the coalition, stating that there is not one hospital that is fully functional in Baghdad, a city of five million people.  
UNICEF is working in Iraq to alleviate some of the worst problems facing children in Iraq, but the task has been made more difficult by the poor security situation on the ground. The UN has issued an appeal for $2.2 billion of humanitarian assistance in Iraq. So far, $US677 million has been met—that is 30 per cent—leaving an outstanding total of $US1.5 billion. (Extension of time granted) Australia's contribution to the UN appeal stands at $US10.2 million, 1.51 per cent of the total. In contrast, noncombatant states—Canada, the Netherlands and Germany—have pledged $US29.6 million, $US14.9 million and $US10.2 million respectively. Having contributed to this problem, the Howard government has a moral responsibility to do more to assist with the humanitarian reconstruction of Iraq.
The Prime Minister has spent much of his time speaking about the Middle East peace process. We agree that the engagement by the Bush administration in the road map for peace is strongly welcomed. It is the best chance in a decade to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. Each member of the quartet—the US, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia—has an important role to play in bringing the two sides together to reach a lasting solution, but peace will not be achieved without an end to the terrorist attacks that have plagued Israel in recent years. The steps taken by Abu Mazen and the new Palestinian leadership in recent times are encouraging but more still needs to be done to end the violence. The vision of two states living side by side in peace and with secure borders is a goal shared not only by the Israelis and the Palestinians but also by all those in the international community who are interested in peace and stability.
The issue of Iraq is now back before the UN Security Council. It is our hope that Security Council members can negotiate on the draft UN resolution in good faith and quickly re-establish the council's position at the forefront of international efforts to rebuild Iraq. It is Labor's view that the draft resolution should be used to achieve three critical tasks: sanctions against Iraq should now be lifted, the UN weapons inspectors under Hans Blix should immediately be returned to Iraq to find and verify the destruction of Iraq's WMD programs; and, the proposed UN special coordinator should be given sufficient executive powers so that the UN can take responsibility for the humanitarian, political and security reconstruction of Iraq. The government should be arguing strenuously for this outcome, with both the US and the UN. Only through a speedy transition to UN authority in Iraq will Australia be able to withdraw its remaining military forces. Labor wants to see our troops home for the sake of their families and for the sake of our national security. Australia faces numerous security challenges in our own region. Security for Australia begins at home and that is where our forces should be.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-05-14,"—I speak to the ministerial statement on Iraq on behalf of the Australian Democrats. At the outset, I state that we Democrats reaffirm our view that the attack on Iraq was illegal, unnecessary and unwise. It was the subject of a significant amount of debate throughout the Australian community over many months. I will not extensively revisit that debate, but it should be noted that the debate about where to go from here is more important than ever. That is why I have said a number of times that those millions of Australians who marched and spoke out in support of peace need to keep speaking out and to keep being a part of the debate. The peace movement is more important than ever to ensure that we do not compound the mistakes that have been made. All of us, whether or not we were supportive of the war against Iraq, joined together to try to ensure the best possible outcome in terms of peace and stability not just for that region but for the globe as a whole. The Democrats are looking, and are keen, to work with people across the Australian community, and indeed across the global community, to maximise the chances of that happening. 
Nonetheless, there are some components within the government's statement that do need to be specifically addressed and noted. There is clearly already some rewriting of history going on in relation to the government's statements on Iraq, as Senator Faulkner has already outlined to some extent, not the least in the very opening sentence of the statement by the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill. I really think the minister should correct the record in relation to this. I know he was basically reading out the Prime Minister's statement in the other place, or I assume he was, but whoever adapted his speech for the Senate obviously did not know this fact, which shows how much the Senate's debates and decisions impact on the mind of the Prime Minister. I think that is part of the problem we have seen: there has been a clear ignoring of the Senate's views and the views of anybody in the Australian community that do not match those of the Prime Minister. They are basically ignored as if they are not there, and the first sentence of the minister's statement today reinforced that fact. Senator Hill said at the start of his statement:
Senators will recall that on the 18 March this year the House resolved to support the government's decision to commit Australian Defence Force personnel ...
I am sorry, but the Senate explicitly resolved to oppose the government's decision. It was a historic occasion on which the Senate for the first time indicated its opposition to the deployment of Australian troops. For the minister to come in here and pretend that that did not happen and to put on the record in a ministerial statement something that is blatantly, clearly and demonstrably false is a clear indication of this government's willingness to completely ignore reality and rewrite history. I do believe that record must be corrected. I do not know whether it was inadvertent on the part of Senator Hill—I suspect it was—but it should not be forgotten that this Senate passed a motion insisting, amongst other things, that there should be no commitment of Australian troops to a war in Iraq outside the authority of the United Nations. It concluded that Australia's involvement without UN authorisation is not in, and would not be in, Australia's interests. It expressed specific opposition to the decision of the cabinet and to that of the President of the USA to commit troops to an attack on Iraq. That was the view of this Senate, and for the minister to portray it as completely the opposite must be corrected as a matter of record.
I think it is also worth building on that Senate motion and the fact that the Senate did for the first time oppose the commitment of Australian troops overseas by reinforcing, pushing and promoting the debate. The Democrats have been pushing since 1981 that the parliament should be required to approve deployment of troops overseas. The parliament, and the Senate, is far more reflective of the diversity of the Australian community than the cabinet, and we believe that approval should be required in Australia, as it is in many other countries.
I draw the public's attention to the private member's bill put forward by Senator Stott Despoja and I, which is on the Notice Paper, which seeks to change the Defence Act to require the approval of both houses of parliament to deploy troops overseas. I think in the past people thought that was a bit of an academic issue. I do not think anyone ever imagined that we would have a Prime Minister who would commit Australian troops to an aggressive act overseas against the wishes of the majority of the Australian community. Of course that is now a matter of historical fact and that, the Democrats believe, means we should revisit the issue. As I said, that was first put forward as an amendment by former Senator Colin Mason back in 1981. 
There are other components in the minister's statement that must be noted. The minister is right in saying that the action in Iraq has immense implications, but I think he is being very glib in suggesting that all those implications are wonderful, rosy and automatically positive. None of us, whether we supported the attack in Iraq or were against it, know what the future holds, but there is no doubt that there are still major risks and dangers to Australians and to the global community. We all need to work together to minimise those risks. We should not pretend that they are not there. If we pretend that they are not there, as the government is doing, we are far more likely to come a cropper in relation to those risks.
I think the minister also misleads the Senate by suggesting that the Security Council was unanimous in its view that Saddam Hussein had continued his weapons of mass destruction programs. Some nations may have believed that, but what was unanimous was that Saddam was in material breach of resolutions by not adequately demonstrating that he had not continued his weapons of mass destruction programs. The other fact is that a material breach of a resolution does not equate to an automatic right for any country to attack a nation—it certainly did not under international law as it existed up until that time. We heard the minister talking about the fear that the weapons of mass destruction, the ones that have not been found yet, will find their way into the hands of terrorists. As the Democrats warned before the war, if those weapons existed—and nobody knows that for sure yet—and if there was a war, there was much more likelihood that they would be smuggled out of the country and into neighbouring countries where they were more likely to fall into the hands of terrorists. The Prime Minister himself suggested that may have happened when people started asking him, `Where are these weapons?' He suggested that they may have been spirited off to Syria.
The minister and the government also make what I believe is a continuing inappropriate and damaging link between September 11 2001, the Bali atrocity and weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction as a definition seems to be a bit of a movable one, but it tends to mean nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry. September 11 and the Bali atrocity were certainly horrendous and led to the loss of many lives but they did not involve anything that could be seen as weapons of mass destruction; they involved some hijacked aeroplanes in one case and some close to homemade bombs in another. That is the weaponry of choice for terrorists around the world. That does not mean that we do not need to worry about them getting weapons of mass destruction, but to suggest that the atrocities we have seen to date are linked to weapons of mass destruction is grossly misleading.
The minister said that the action taken against Iraq has sent a clear signal to other rogue states. It certainly has sent a clear signal: it has sent the signal that you had better get yourself some weapons of mass destruction—like North Korea has done or is threatening to do—before the US decides you are the next target on its list. If anything, it will encourage proliferation of those weapons. The minister's statement continued with the fiction that the attack on Iraq was lawful when very few credible experts in international law, or even people with basic commonsense, believe that it was lawful. The minister talked about Saddam Hussein's 24-year rule of torture and executions but provided no explanation as to why for the first 23 years it was fine for him to stay in that role—or indeed why it was fine for us to trade with his regime continuously. Why was there this sudden change in focus and attitude? 
 The minister's statement again made the hypocritical suggestion that we need to give the US and coalition forces more time to find these weapons of mass destruction. He says that the hunt for these weapons will not be easy and that we should give the coalition forces some more time. If only the US had given the United Nations inspectors more time. The US said, `You do not need any more time. You haven't got any more time. We are going to go in. We can't be bothered waiting.' Now the US is expecting everybody else to wait and give its forces more time to find these weapons.
The minister said the United Nations could play a significant practical role in the transitional process. The Democrats' view is that the United Nations must play a significant—indeed the leading—role. To continue with this aspersion against the Security Council by suggesting that it has not acted constructively, obviously the government's definition of the Security Council acting constructively is for it to do what it is told by the US. That is when the Security Council would really become irrelevant, and the Democrats are pleased that the Security Council has shown independence of thought and view.
The statement talks about the relationship with the United States. The Democrats are on record a number of times saying that we are supportive of an alliance with the US, but it is not an alliance in which we should be completely subservient and tied to—handcuffed to—the United States. A senior deputy official of the United States administration made what in his view was a positive comment about the Australian-US relationship when he was describing us as being `joined at the hip' to the US. I do not mind being close enough to the US to shake its hand but I do not want to be joined at the hip with any other nation. How the minister can suggest that we can still have a range of equal relationships with a whole lot of other nations based on our own interests when we are joined at the hip with the global hyperpower is laughable.
One statement that I note and welcome is the statement in relation to Israel and Palestine. The Democrats specifically note the government's recognition of the imperative for an independent Palestinian state. It does make you wonder why they voted against a motion moved in this place not too long ago supporting an independent Palestinian state—as did the Labor Party I might add. I am not quite sure why that was, but it is pleasing to see here that the government, specifically in this statement, recognises the imperative for an independent Palestinian state. In my personal view, Israel equally has a right to exist peacefully and it is a major priority for all of us to do what we can to try to bring about a peaceful solution for that region.
This statement is also about our troops. The Democrats look forward to welcoming home our troops from Iraq and expressing relief that they have returned safely. I am sure that for some families the last four months have felt more like four years, and there will undoubtedly be scenes and feelings of much joy. Whilst defence families will rightly celebrate, the government should be much more circumspect. The recent health report belatedly released on the 1991 Gulf War veterans showed that Australian troops can return damaged in ways that are not immediately apparent. The Democrats welcome the government's decision to blood-test returning troops and offer stress assessments and counselling, but we will hold the Howard government to the recommendations of the health of Gulf War veterans of 1991 report, including better monitoring of vaccination and exposures. We have questioned the government about its progress in implementing those recommendations and we will continue to focus on that. 
I cannot allow to pass unmentioned this government's and this minister's flowery statement about our wonderful service men and women and what a great job they have done and how much the government supports them and acknowledges them. I think we all do that. Indeed you have to admire people who will put their lives on the line in the defence of their own country. It is just unfortunate that the government deployed them overseas in an action that was not in the defence of Australia. We have heard those wonderful, great patriotic statements about our service men and women and the debt we owe them, yet last night we saw a budget which, once again—for the eighth budget in a row—ignored some of the fundamental measures for which the veterans community have been calling out for years, all the specific measures that the RSL, the TPI veterans and other veterans groups have been focusing on year after year. We had the Clarke report that reinforced some of those measures. This government brought down a budget that had over $2 billion in its surplus for next year, yet a few simple measures—such as the proper treatment of compensation payments for veterans so the payments do not get counted as income under social security rules, increasing the funeral benefit payments that have been stuck at a very low level for many years and finally recognising the BCOF veterans—combined would cost less than $50 million a year. This government is making such big noises about how wonderful our service men and women are! It shows it up again. It has new money for monuments and medals, so that its members can proudly stand around at ceremonies and look like they have done something significant by association with people who have done important things, but it will not commit money to actually meet the needs of our veterans. 
In the Democrats' view, that shows the absolute hypocrisy of these government statements. We will continue to push for some proper treatment for our veterans. They have done their job now, but we have a debt to veterans that continues on into the future. They should not be just welcomed home with a nice parade, a memorial and some medals and then patted on the head and not assisted with many of the difficulties that can happen as a consequence of their service.
While the Democrats look forward to the safe return of all Australian troops, we express our sorrow and remorse at the deaths of thousands of people—probably well over 10,000 Iraqis, coalition forces and media representatives, including, of course, an Australian cameraman. The exact number of deaths and casualties will probably never be known. The Minister for Defence has failed to give some indication to the Senate—despite being asked by me, on behalf of the Democrats, before the break—of the numbers of deaths as a result of the war. He said he would seek further advice, but he has not provided that information to the Senate or to the Australian people. Of course, the toll continues to rise in Iraq as a result of ongoing violence, unexploded cluster bombs and landmines—which should never be used by forces that Australia is cooperating with in any way—and a lack of clean water, food and, particularly, medical supplies and facilities. There will be long-term effects from the use of depleted uranium.  
So this peace is still not very peaceful at all. The liberated Iraqi people are not liberated from violence or disease or shortages of essential goods. We should note that the vast majority of the civilian deaths from the 1991 Iraq war occurred after the war because of the damaged infrastructure and because of inadequate medical supplies. We should also note the report in Monday's New York Times that quoted American officials in Iraq saying that escalating violence and a breakdown of civil order are paralysing the effort to rebuild Iraq. To suggest that all is going rosily and we just have to sort out a few problems is again grossly misrepresenting the picture. Of course, we had Britain's international aid minister, Clare Short, resigning from the UK cabinet just a day or two ago over the US control over plans for postwar Iraq. So we should not be boasting.
The Democrats are not wanting to just focus on the negative. We acknowledge the great benefit of being rid of Saddam Hussein, but the weapons of mass destruction have not been found, tens of thousands of families in Iraq, the US and the UK are in mourning and their lives will never be the same again and, very worryingly, the precedent has been set for pre-emptive strikes. That will only make some nations more eager to illicitly acquire weapons of mass destruction, as a deterrent against possible future pre-emptive strikes.
The Democrats urge the government to do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Iraq. We believe we have an obligation as a nation. Having been part of the invading forces, for better or worse, we now have an obligation to contribute to repairing the damage as quickly as possible. We note the public appeals by many organisations, such as Oxfam, Community Aid Abroad and others, and encourage Australians to contribute to those. We believe we have an obligation to provide peacekeepers. We have an excellent record as a nation in that area. We have previously had an excellent record in supporting the United Nations in multilateral diplomatic efforts. The Democrats believe we need to go back to that approach.
It is worth acknowledging that Australia has higher standards in warfare than the US forces. We do not use depleted uranium weaponry or cluster bombs. We acknowledge and praise the Australian pilot who refused to bomb a target because he was not confident that it was not civilian. I would also like to take this opportunity to praise those Australians who demonstrated the depth of their commitment by going over to Baghdad and other parts of Iraq as so-called human shields to try and do what they could to protect the civilians of Iraq. I particularly note the work of Adelaide councillor Ruth Russell, a member of the Democrats. Her passion and bravery really need to be noted.
The other concern that we have is that this statement does not talk about the need for global disarmament. It talks about weapons of mass destruction and so-called rogue regimes; it does not talk about the growing numbers of weapons of mass destruction with larger, developed nations such as our allies and friends. This government should do more to restart the global move towards disarmament. (Extension of time granted)
I do believe this issue is significant. As I said at the start, it is important and the debate needs to continue. This is not just a wrap-up—which is, I think, what the government is trying to do—of the Iraq issue. We need to look at where we go from here as a nation in terms of our foreign policy, defence policy, security policy and overseas aid policy. That is why this debate is so important. I do encourage Australians to continue to participate in it and to push all political parties down a more peaceful path. 
Apart from the lack of action on disarmament, it is worth noting this government's direction—a direct consequence of this joined-at-the-hip alliance with the United States—in the defence component of the budget yesterday. The defence budget confirms the government's priorities and plans for acting with the United States in going to war against other countries. It is improving our capacity to join coalition forces in other wars overseas. The Democrats do not believe that money should be spent—it is over $1 billion, according to yesterday's budget. The details and breakdown are not terribly clear—we will use budget estimates to clarify that—but significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, are going to be spent on upgrading and changing our operational capability so that we can work more closely with the United States in their activities. We believe that is the wrong direction, not only for our defence and security policy, but, indeed, for the world as a whole. We are not against operational readiness, but we oppose the operations that the government is clearly considering.
Our defence policy is increasingly made in the USA. When the government talks about funds for interoperability and high-tech communications, they are basically using fancy words for `plug and play with the USA'. Many aspects of the defence budget are not about defending Australia or even likely low-level conflicts or peacekeeping in our region, which is where resources should be put. The Democrats are not against defence spending per se or even increased spending, if the need is proven through changes in the world scene with terrorism et cetera. But it must be spent in areas that will increase security and we must spend more on foreign aid.
What has occurred has cost the world many billions of dollars and thousands of lives. Saddam Hussein has disappeared, but it is still far from clear that the region or the world are more secure. I think all of us agree that, as political representatives and as a nation, we must all work towards that goal of making the world and the region more secure. The Democrats commit to that. Despite our strong opposition to the government's actions and decisions in relation to Iraq, we do seek ways to work together to make the world and our region a safer and more secure place.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,Ministerial Statements,28,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-05-14,"—I congratulate, on behalf of the Greens, the men and women of our defence forces for their courage, determination, commitment and success in the deployment, on behalf of the government of this nation, to Iraq. We wish them success in their ongoing role in that beleaguered country after so many decades of terror and disruption. I must also say that, when I wake up every morning these days, I feel better that Saddam Hussein is, as far as we know, off the scene.
I remember moving in the Tasmanian parliament in 1991 a motion to ask the then UN mandated forces to come to the aid of the Kurds, who were escaping Saddam Hussein in the north of the country. In the debate before this war, that was drawn to my attention as a point of hypocrisy, because I was opposed to the illegal war in which the government was engaging with this country. But it was not hypocrisy. The man was a first-class brute—a monster. That he is no longer there is a cause for celebration for everybody. 
That said, I woke up this morning and listened to a report, which I think came through from the BBC but was being played on Radio National on the ABC. It was to do with possibly 3,000 graves having been found in a village outside of Baghdad. A woman had gathered the bones of her husband's friend and put them in a plastic bag and was taking them home. She was hoping to find her husband on a return trip. Kids were watching as this pit was being opened up. It was thought that these were the remains of 3,000 out of potentially 300,000 people who had been slaughtered by Saddam Hussein and his henchpeople in 1991 as a result of the failed Shiite uprising against Saddam Hussein's regime. What this report did not say was that that uprising had been fuelled by the United States. The then Bush administration had dropped leaflets on these folk telling them to rise up against Saddam Hussein in the wake of the war which ended the occupation of Kuwait. And as with the Kurds in the north, these people were then abandoned by the Bush administration. If there are 300,000 graves there, let us make it clear that the majority of those people went to their graves because of the perfidy of the United States administration at the time. That is a terrible indictment, but there it is.
We are told that history is written by the conquerors, but I think these days information and evidence is better than that. We have to recognise that this world is an unsafe place which can be made safe by determined humanity and global justice but not by the philosophy that might is right. That is the philosophy, after all, of Saddam Hussein. We run a very dangerous course—let Mr Howard, our Prime Minister, listen to this, as well as George W. Bush, the President of the United States—if we believe, with our epithets of democracy and freedom above our heads, that might is right. It is not. The common aspiration of people for life and liberty is right, but we have got a long way to go before we can determine for anybody else how that should be.
I am not about to forget either that in 1983 the current Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, went and met Saddam Hussein during the period of conflict between Iraq and Iran which led to one million deaths, mainly of young people. Consequently, upon that meeting—not necessarily arising out of it—it was US laboratories that equipped Saddam Hussein with his terrible technical capability to engage in biological and chemical warfare. It was Russian wherewithal that gave him some nuclear capability and it was German and French wherewithal that gave him other weapons capability. This is not a case of good versus evil but an intricate admixture. We have to be very aware of this in this age where the prevailing dictum is that might is right simply because it is the Pentagon that has got the might. It is a very dangerous dictum, and if we believe ourselves any different to Germans, Russians, Chinese or Peruvians in our ability to go off the rails if we do not rein that dictum in, then we are making a fundamental and unforgivable mistake, given the history of the world as we know it.
This war was not about relieving the Iraqi people of the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein; it was always about American control of the Middle East and its resources, and it continues to be so. The weapons of mass destruction that were alleged to have been held by Saddam Hussein were the ostensible reason for the United States, and therefore the Howard government, being involved in this war. Let me reiterate—and I know that we cannot win on this but we must stand by it: this war was not motivated by the need to relieve the Iraqi people of the brutality of Saddam Hussein. That brutality over the last 20 years has to some degree been enabled by American largesse in the past and during the last 10 years or so the greatest power on earth sat on its hands while those cruelties were unleashed on the people of Iraq. 
Perhaps at Saddam Hussein's weakest period ever the invasion of Iraq came for other reasons, including the one of weapons of mass destruction. The extraordinary thing is that those weapons of mass destruction have not been found. It is very clear now, as the US's own weapons inspectors pack up and leave, that the weapons of mass destruction, in the dimensions that we were told—including by our own Prime Minister—they would be found in, will not be found, because they are not there. What we have found is a brutal dictatorship seriously disabled and devoid of the capability to do the things it could do 15 years ago. Would and did American surveillance and intelligence not know this? The question must arise of whether the weapons of mass destruction argument itself is not dinkum. I do not know, but there was a monumental failure of American intelligence if the evidence being put forward by the US Secretary of State or the President in the prewar period is taken into account.
What worries me is what has happened with, and since, the war. Senator Bartlett referred to some of the absolutely unnecessary depredations of that war, including the use of cluster bombs in civilian areas, which has left thousands of people either dead or horribly maimed and which was unnecessary, unneeded and, with the extraordinary firepower of the United States, unforgivable. I refer to a report from Ian Traynor in Zagreb just released today via the Guardian. It is headlined `Nuclear looting alarms UN watchdog'. It reads:
United Nations nuclear inspectors, barred from Iraq by Washington, are increasingly worried that the widespread looting and ransacking of Iraq's nuclear facilities may result in terrorists building a radioactive “dirty bomb”. 
The inspectors' concerns are shared internationally and the British government has reportedly offered to raise the matter with Washington to try to get agreement on a return of the UN nuclear inspectors to Iraq. 
The main worry revolves around the fate of at least 200 radioactive isotopes which were stored at the sprawling al-Tuwaitha nuclear complex, 15 miles south of Baghdad. It has seen widespread looting, and reports from Baghdad speak of locals making off with barrels of raw uranium and the isotopes which are meant for medical or industrial use. 
“If this happened anywhere else there would be national outrage and it would be the highest priority,” said a senior source at the UN nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency. 
“The radioactive sources, some very potent ones, could get on to the black market and into the hands of terrorists planning dirty-bomb attacks,” said Melissa Fleming, an IAEA spokeswoman. 
And so on it goes. We have got this extraordinary military power under direction from the Bush administration, which was worried about terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, delinquently allowing the robbing of terribly dangerous nuclear material from the one nuclear facility which was known to contain it, which they knew about all along, with it potentially getting into the hands of terrorists. That is what comes of this simplistic idea that you are in control of everything when, in fact, you are not—you are in control of a complex human society in a place like Iraq. If it is not too late, there is an enormous responsibility on the part of the UN authorities not to wait until Britain asks them—they read this material and they know about it, the same as we do—but to have firstly prevented this from happening and to now make sure that those nuclear materials are taken out of action.
That brings me to the national museum in Baghdad. On 14 February, Mr Acting Deputy President—and I know you are aware of this—I asked the Prime Minister and his several ministers: what are you going to do with these archaeological and World Heritage treasures for all of humankind in Iraq—the cradle of civilisation, the fabled or historic, whichever way you will have it, Garden of Eden? We are signatories to the 1954 Hague convention, protecting in wartime such historic and human treasures. World authorities had been warning for months about the dangers in wartime for these antiquities, which are priceless treasures for all humanity. In that series of questions, I asked specifically of Mr Howard: `What are you going to do to prevent looting'—I used that word—`of these treasures in the wake of the war?' I will tell you what our Prime Minister did. It was nothing. I will tell you what the President of the United States—the greatest power on earth—did. It was nothing. I will tell you what they did do: they sent their troops to the ministry of oil. They went to protect the oil—because that was what they were after—and ignored this priceless human heritage. I ask you: where is an acceptable philosophy behind that terrible, delinquent series of events? 
One then has to move onto the dimensions of the continuing human disaster in Iraq and say, through this debate, to our Prime Minister: you should now concentrate on the fortunes of those Iraqi people who are suffering greatly at the moment, and on the promise of democracy and of their getting control of their own affairs. This is going to raise enormously complex questions. This is an Islamic country which does not see democracy in the way we do. The United States says it is going to take two years before it hands over administration. I am not even going to question whether it will be dinkum democracy, because it will not be. When the United States says that, it means that it is going to hand over to an administration vetted by itself and acceptable to itself, regardless of the democratic wishes of the Iraqi people. That is what is going to happen there. We can debate this in a year or two when we see what happens. But there is an enormous responsibility on the shoulders of our Prime Minister to make sure that the transfer of authority which was promised to the Iraqi people actually takes place.
There is an enormous responsibility also to see that the aid gets to the Iraqi people who, beyond democracy, are suffering on a day-to-day basis. Having suffered appalling depredations in the past, they now face the depredations of a disrupted society—disrupted water supplies, disrupted and failing sewage disposal, pollution and general chaos in society. Of course, in those circumstances it is very often children and women who suffer most. On this continuing occupation of Iraq, I would counsel our Prime Minister to bring into the equation—right at the top of the list—aid, with a humanitarian caveat on it, to those very people in Iraq who now have been freed from the awful yoke of Saddam Hussein.
That brings me finally to the wider question of how we get rule of law in this world. President Bush, backed by Prime Minister Howard, moved on Iraq illegally—but nevertheless strongly—and now has control of that country. But the question is: how do we in future take part in a global community of six billion people where more terrible depredations are going to occur so that everybody has a say? The answer to that is global democracy. I have never heard our Prime Minister or President Bush even go close to backing the concept of one person, one vote, one value planet-wide. If you are going to espouse freedom and democracy and freedom through democracy, you have to espouse that dictum not just for Australians and for Americans, who constitute 4.5 per cent, the two of us together, of the world's population, but for 100 per cent of the people on this planet. We, in the rich, powerful 20 per cent of the world's population, have to consider seriously whether we are dinkum about so-called democracy and freedom or whether it is just going to continue to be used in a hollow fashion—meaningless, discriminatory, cutting out the poor, cutting out those of different cultures and religions as we continue to use an inordinate amount of the world's resources, not least dependent on oil—to the disadvantage of the 80 per cent, including the one billion people who do not get $2 a day to feed themselves and their families. 
Neither we nor the US can take unto ourselves the right to rule the world. That is the right of everybody on this planet conjointly, and the formula is democracy. If we are going to espouse democracy, let us make it real democracy. I do not think that President Bush and our own Prime Minister believe in that for one minute. That is the challenge and that will be one of the great debates of this century. If out of this debacle of Saddam Hussein, the war in Iraq and the sidelining of the United Nations we can move forward to a more egalitarian and democratic world, then good will have come of it in the wider sense, beyond the breath of freedom that the Iraqi people are having at the moment.

That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like to speak briefly to the Attorney-General's report. Like most members, I have only just had the opportunity to look at this report that apparently derives from section 23YV of the Crimes Act 1914, which required an independent review of part 1D of that act relating to forensic procedures, particularly the use of DNA material for law enforcement purposes.
I, like others, will read in detail the numerous recommendations that have come about as a consequence of this review, but it is worth noting on the record tonight that this is part of a broad-ranging investigation by this government into a number of issues to do with not only the collection of DNA for the purposes of law and thus forensics but the collection of DNA generally and privacy issues relating to the collection of that information. I hope shortly—but I assume very soon—we will see the tabling of the ALRC-AHEC report into the protection of genetic information. I am glad to say that that report, which has been a broad-ranging, very consultative process over at least the past 18 months, is something that the Australian Democrats, or I particularly, have called for for a long time. Back in 1998 I tabled a private member's bill on genetic privacy and non-discrimination. While the system has probably moved on a lot since then, there were some issues raised in the context of that debate and the consequent Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, which identified that there were characteristics of DNA collection, disposal and its use for research purposes and, in bad circumstances, discrimination on the basis of DNA information that really needed to be investigated. So I am glad to see this report because this, essentially, is the first part of a process of tabling of reports that relate to this very important issue.
I note, in my initial look at this report, that this report acknowledges that there is not really a national system in place as yet. Obviously there is CrimTrac and other related processes, but they are still very much a state jurisdictional responsibility. There is also different legislation in each state and territory, and different regulatory approaches as well. I certainly commend the chair, Tom Sherman, and many of the others, notably the Privacy Commissioner, who were involved in the deliberations that led to the report and its tabling tonight. As I said, I look forward to the ALRC-AHEC report. For those of you who have seen their interim reports, which are about 600 to 800 pages long, you will know that when the final version is tabled there will certainly be an opportunity to have a long Senate debate in the consideration of government documents.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2003-05-14,"—I rise this evening to speak about the Smith Family's report Barriers to participation—financial, educational and technological which was launched by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Abbott, in March 2003, in the last sitting period. The minister launched the document in the shadow of grave international events at the time, but he noted that it was still possible to retain a focus on other important issues, such as Australians living in poverty.
In many ways, the government has a vision of a society where everyone has a place and an opportunity to participate. Many people derive a sense of worth from their work, but for those who do not have work it is important that they still have the opportunity to participate in our society—in our community—in the ways they choose. But increasingly, in a technology driven world, participation in society means ensuring that the gap between the information rich and the information poor does not widen. So it is the technology aspects of the Smith Family's report that I want to look at this evening.
I will come back to the report after first looking at the landscape of Internet usage as measured by two relevant Australian publications: the ABS's Biennial report on Internet activity and the National Office for the Information Economy's report The digital divide. The most recent ABS biennial report, released in March 2003, noted a couple of important things. Firstly, it noted that the number of Internet subscribers with permanent connections had dramatically increased. The figure was around 350,000 subscribers at the end of the September quarter 2002, an increase of over 47 per cent from the end of March 2002. The number of subscribers grew by around 326,000 to almost 4.6 million. The majority of these were in the household market, with over 3.9 million household subscribers. Finally, the increasing uptake of broadband services is also quite evident in the large increase in the volume of data downloaded, which was up 28 per cent between the March quarter 2002 and the September quarter. This data provides very clear indications of the growing importance of the Internet in the lives of so many Australians.
In the context of the broadening of engagement of Australians as a group, as outlined in that ABS data, NOIE's most recent Current state of play report, of April 2002, backs up the focus on information technology and underscores the importance of a commitment to ensuring that Australian communities, households and individuals can fully participate in the information economy. NOIE reports that, while overall Internet use in Australia continues to rise, with household Internet access at 52 per cent, there are still disparities in online access and use. The report states: 
People on low incomes, aged over 55, without tertiary education, and of Indigenous heritage are less likely to have connection to and use the Internet. The disparity in access and use for such groups is commonly referred to as the `digital divide'. That divide is clearly not a sharp line, but increases with and contributes to social and economic disadvantage.
NOIE has a strategy, in six parts, to minimise this disadvantage. It looks firstly at access to infrastructure—like adequate bandwidth capacity and affordable and reliable Internet connections—and computer hardware and software and publicly provided access. Secondly, there is information and communications technology literacy—that is, basic ICT information and training to increase user confidence in using both the technology and online content, applications and services. Then there is awareness. An understanding of the benefits of new technology by potential users, and an awareness of how technology can make everyday life easier, should be one of the focuses of IT promotion, and not necessarily the technology itself, because it can seem confronting to some potential users. Then there is integration. Technology should be integrated into the social fabric of everyday life and embedded, in some ways, in people's lifestyles and into the lives of local communities. Support is also important. The provision of technical and training support, and implementing a supportive regulatory regime, engenders user confidence and trust to address key issues like privacy, security and consumer rights, among others.
Finally are applications and content, the development and production of compelling online content and applications which motivate use and enable users to maximise the benefits of their ICT use. It is seen as a major problem that the existing digital divide framework can overemphasise the importance of the physical presence of computers and connectivity, thus often excluding other factors that allow people to use the Internet. So we really need to address the take-up of information and communications technology more broadly.
The Smith Family report, as I said, Barriers to participation—financial, educational and technological edited by Gianni Zappala, is well received. The third chapter was written by Gianni Zappala and Jennifer McLaren. It examines data on the access and usage of computers and the Internet by households and by children from financially disadvantaged backgrounds. Dr Rob Simons, the National Manager of Strategic Research at the Smith Family, says in the report's preface:
... the third chapter builds on recently published research by the Smith Family and focuses on the `digital divide' among families and students on the Learning for Life programme. It also provides a preliminary illustration of the need for the `ABC of the digital divide'—access, basic training and content—as an effective way of overcoming the barriers to computer and Internet usage that many students in low income households experience.
The analysis in the report is based on data collected from almost 7,000 students from approximately 3,500 households in the Smith Family's Learning for Life program. It examines their usage by social disadvantage, family type, ethnic and cultural background, employment status and the level of parental education. The report identified that very important issues such as economic participation, education and lifelong learning, access to services and political participation and social inclusion issues need to be considered further.
I will outline a couple of the key findings of the report. For example, while the access gap has been narrowing, as I indicated, over the last few years, only one-third of the families who were on the Learning for Life, or LFL, program at the end of 2001 had Internet access at home compared with half of the comparable population Australia-wide. Schools are also important in closing or levelling the access gap, as most students use computers and the Internet at school. The report also noted that factors other than income played an important role in determining ICT access. In particular, the level of parental education was identified as most strongly associated with home access to computers and the Internet with higher education correlating to higher levels of access. Families from some NESB groups, for example, have higher levels of home access compared with those who are either Australian born or born overseas from English-speaking countries. Other factors associated with home access were family structure, housing type and regional disadvantage. 
In its conclusions, the report advocated the need for a couple of steps to be taken: firstly, greater ICT related support and education for adults so that the importance of home access to computers and the Internet can be recognised by those without higher levels of education; and, secondly, greater research and policy attention to the role of schools, teachers and parents in ensuring that people have the requisite resources and skills to use the technology appropriately.
Whilst I understand the Smith Family's focus on household computer technology uptake, given this is the greatest area of growth, according to the ABS, as I indicated earlier, I also note that some people have seen a need for more focus on schools being effective in closing the access gap. Technological barriers should be viewed from a broader perspective that looks at all the other places through which children, families and communities access computers and the Internet—that might include, for example, schools, public libraries, community and volunteer organisations, government agencies, local councils and so on—and whether parents choose not to have home access because these options may be more affordable or more accessible.
In the course of pursuing this report and its evaluation, and in the course of NOIE's further work in this area, it might be valuable for them to have a look at some of the conclusions that the report has come to and perhaps progress the study that has been undertaken by the Smith Family. As I have thought about this and also heard the speakers on the day of the launch as well, I would be particularly interested in seeing more work done on how the Internet and computers are actually being used by students—the balance, for example, between educational and recreational purposes, although there may be some parents who do not actually want to look at the end result of that—whether home Internet access does improve educational outcomes per se, and also questions of technological literacy and competency. 
It is interesting for us that the report particularly refers to political participation and social inclusion, the importance of the Internet to the democratic process and how political movements and protests occur via email campaigns—and don't we know that. There are a lot of issues raised, particularly in this chapter—that is not to say that the other parts of the report are not equally important—and the Smith Family's contribution to the debate is most particularly important. I look forward to hearing more about the results of their assessment and examination of the barriers to societal participation among low-income Australians.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Smith Family Report</title>,Adjournment,34,1,speech
