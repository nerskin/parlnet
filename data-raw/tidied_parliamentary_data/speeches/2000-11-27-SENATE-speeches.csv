"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-11-27,"—I continue my summing up of the second reading debate on this legislation. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2000 provides to many Australians entitlements which had previously been denied to them. The bill extends full repatriation benefits, from 1 January next year, to more than 2,600 veterans who served in South-East Asia between 1955 and 1975. It also extends psychiatric assessment and counselling services to adult children and former partners of Vietnam veterans as one of the key initiatives in response to the Vietnam Veterans Health Study.
This bill is one that has received overwhelming support from the veteran community and the community generally. There has been the one issue in relation to whether or not the Veterans' Entitlements Act should be extended to people that have not been under the direct service and control of the Australian defence forces. The government's attitude on this is based on precedent and principle—that is, there is a need to ensure the integrity of the legislation. Certain claims were made during the second reading debate and I will try to deal with those in a way that is not as emotive as some opposite sought to portray the situation. People need to be subjected to military command or the strictures of military discipline to be able to fall under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It is noteworthy that Major General Peter Phillips, the National President of the RSL, is supportive of our view on this.
The cause of nurses has been taken up by the opposition and the Australian Democrats in this debate, but it is interesting that they do not seem to want to take up the cause of about 1,100 other Australian civilians who worked in Vietnam during the conflict. That includes privately contracted entertainers, non-accredited war correspondents, Qantas air crew who transported troops to and from Vietnam, those who were involved in the private supply or contracting of trucks and mechanical support to trucks and bulldozers, and those employed at our embassies. The list goes on; there are about 1,100. You then have to ask the question: what is the distinguishing feature in relation to one lot of civilians, as opposed to all the other civilians, that makes them worthy of special consideration under the Veterans' Entitlements Act?
A number of Australian civilians made a substantial contribution. Those that were engaged under the SEATO treaty arrangements were employed by the Commonwealth through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. There is some suggestion that, because we are not going to extend veterans' entitlements to those people, somehow they are devoid of any support whatsoever. That is wrong. As Commonwealth employees, the government owed a duty of care to them and, to this end, they were covered for compensation purposes under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act 1930—now the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.
It is interesting to note that six nurses have applied to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for entitlements. Their claims have been rejected, but the interesting thing is that nine nurses have applied under Comcare and eight of them have had their claims accepted. The difficulty is that privacy considerations do not allow me to know whether the six that had applied to the DVA are part of the nine that applied under Comcare, so I am unable to assist the Senate in that regard. Nevertheless, the nurses who have legitimate claims can bring them under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. It is not that they are left completely uncovered. There is appropriate legislation which applies to every other Commonwealth or government employee that was involved in Vietnam during this period, other than our people who were under the strictures of defence discipline. 
The situation for those nurses—not that I would ever suggest they would do it—was that, if the going got tough, they were at all times at liberty to leave whereas, if our Defence personnel had left, they would have been subjected to a court martial. There is a very significant difference in the treatment that was afforded to two different sets of circumstances, given their presence in Vietnam. The support for the nurses has come out of the Mohr report. Whilst I think all of us would agree that Justice Mohr has done an excellent job in his consideration of the matters that were put before him—and he has put those matters to the government for consideration, most of which we have adopted—I simply say that the issues he dealt with in relation to the nurses were not part of the terms of reference. Therefore, the government was unable to appropriately respond fully to the suggestions that he made during the course of the hearing. As I have mentioned before, the one difficulty is that, if we are going to afford this extra cover to one lot of civilians, why not to all the other civilians as well? It is interesting that neither the Labor Party nor the Democrats have asserted that. What they have picked on is something that was put in front of Justice Mohr.
—He made a recommendation. We have not picked on it; it is in the report. After careful study, we adopted the recommendations handed down by Mr Mohr.
—I take Senator Schacht's interjections. They have adopted or picked—
—We did not pick it by chance; it was in the recommendations in the report that your government commissioned.
—I would have thought we could have had a friendly debate about something like this, but you can always count on Senator Schacht to demean the process. Yes, the Labor Party sought to adopt a recommendation from Justice Mohr that was not within the terms of reference put before him. As a result, due consideration was not given to the entitlements of all the other civilians who found themselves in Vietnam in similar circumstances.
I think that deals with the issues that were raised during the second reading debate. I thank honourable senators for their contribution. In conclusion, in relation to the issue of the SEATO nurses, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Bruce Scott, has agreed to hold a meeting with those representatives, with appropriate staff from his department and with Comcare to see what the difficulties are and to see how Comcare can cover them. It is the government's view that it ought to be Comcare that looks after these civilian nurses, as opposed to the veterans' entitlements legislation. It is not that we are trying to be bloody-minded or hard-nosed in relation to the nurses—we want to ensure that they are properly cared for and catered for—but, if we do extend it to civilians who do not qualify under the Veterans Entitlements Act, the question remains: why not all the other civilians similarly engaged in Vietnam?
Having said that, I commend the bill to the Senate. This is an excellent piece of legislation which deals with the aspirations of many Vietnam veterans over a period of time. We commissioned a report which, with respect, should have been commissioned a lot earlier. It is nice to see the Labor Party coming on board and supporting a lot of these recommendations, keeping in mind that they had 13 years in which to commission such a report. They had 13 years in which to deal with the question of justice for the Vietnam veterans. We have done so, and we have delivered by the spadeful for the Vietnam veterans. It is a pity that this debate has been somewhat diminished and sidetracked on this one issue in relation to the nurses, but let me say that we as a government are anxious to ensure that they do get proper care and cover. We believe they have that through Comcare.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-27,"—My question is directed to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. If, as the Treasurer claims, `the farmers have probably had the best deal out of fuel taxation of any group in Australia', how does the government explain the call by the National Farmers Federation, backed by all of its affiliate groups at its recent national council meeting in Canberra, for a freeze on the February fuel excise increase?

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-27,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that answer. The problem, Minister, is that the NFF just does not believe you. I point to the recent statement by the President of the NFF, Mr Ian Donges—and you can listen to this, Senator Boswell; you're a member of the government—who said:  
It seems that some people in the government cannot accept the fact that, on fuel, the NFF is speaking for the community when we call for a freeze on the February fuel excise increase. 
I ask: what is the government's response to that statement by the NFF president, Mr Donges? Will the government ignore the NFF and the community and proceed with the February increase in fuel excise?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-11-27,"—I thank Senator Forshaw for that question. It is true that the rural sector has been given special attention by this government in relation to fuel. You can mention a number of things which have been of enormous benefit to the rural sector and to the wider Australian community. One is the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme, which has been very effective in helping to cut the effective rate of excise on large transports. It has delivered very large benefits to rural Australia. The fuel grants scheme, which was established to make sure that the margin between city and rural prices was cut back, cost the last budget some $500 million. It has been another effective scheme. There are a number of very important schemes which have been effective in the farming sector. I recall that, in some of the comments that the leader of the National Farmers Federation has made on fuel excise, he has talked about the wider community issues. We share those concerns. We share the concerns of the rural sector and city people about the high prices of petrol. The reason we have high petrol prices is due to the fact that world prices have soared in the last year and a half. There is no secret about that: that is the reason. I think farmers will be particularly interested when I bring to their attention what Senator Cook said—
—I regret to say there are some further quotes from Senator Cook that I do feel compelled to bring to the attention of the Senate. There was a very famous report that Senator Cook signed in relation to the cuts in fuel excise which this government announced as part of the new tax system. Senator Cook chaired a committee into the new tax system. Among other things, Senator Cook bemoaned the fact that this government had cut excise by too much.
—What was the recommendation I made?
—You can shake your head all you like, Senator Cook, but I happen to have your quotes here. Listen to what you signed on to:
The government's proposed tax changes will encourage business to use more heavily polluting petroleum fuels at the expense of LPG, LNG and other more environmentally friendly fuels.
What was he complaining about then? What was the mood of the government?
—You destroyed the gas industry.
—Don't be embarrassed, Senator Sherry. What was the mood that Senator Cook was complaining about?
—Tax reductions.
—He was complaining about the fact that we have cut the excise on fuels. He would know that not only was there a cut in the excise but also people in business can claim an input tax credit for the GST paid on fuels. That was the Labor Party position. When we had this bill—
—It was not.
—I am actually reading from your words, Senator Cook.
—No, you're not.
—Under `Transport and the environment' this is what Senator Cook said—
—No, no; tell the truth for once in your life.
—Senator Cook, you can have an opportunity to debate the matter.
—Oh dear, so early in the parliamentary fortnight.
—Why don't you tell us his most famous quote?
—I will not tell you Senator Cook's most famous quote. I will stick to my last—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Australia: Fuel Prices</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-11-27,"—Thank you for the supplementary question. You quoted the comment which I quoted in my earlier remarks—that Mr Donges was speaking about wider community concerns. We share those concerns. That is the response. The fact of the matter is that the price of fuel has gone up because world prices have gone up.
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is that I did quote Mr Donges, and I quoted Mr Donges when he said he would call for a freeze on the February fuel excise. My question was specifically: does this minister agree with that call by Mr Donges for a freeze on fuel excise? Madam President, could you ask the minister, as he feels it appropriate to quote what I quoted from, to answer the very question regarding Mr Donges's comments?
—There is no point of order.
—I assume you were talking about Mr Donges, not `Mr Dongers'. Mr Donges, I think, was the person you meant to talk about. If you purport to quote someone, you should try to get their name correct. Mr Donges will be particularly upset when he reads what the Labor Party said about the cuts to fuel excise, in particular Senator Cook's position.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-27,"—On 9 November Senator Bolkus asked me for further information in relation to a question that he had asked on 7 November in relation to the aged care accountability of funds used for accreditation and certification. I have received a response from the minister, which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator BOLKUS (3.13p.m)-by leave-I just wish to ask the minister when he intends to come back to the Senate with information addressing the core questions that I asked the other day.
SENATOR HERRON-The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question in accordance with information supplied to her:
As mentioned in my previous answer, the accreditation and certification standards introduced by this Government are the way we ensure accountability for use of these funds. Focussing on certification and accreditation as the end products for use of these funds ensures that the emphasis is placed on outputs and outcomes, as it should be.
Services which are closing down, such as Hindmarsh Nursing Home, are a tiny minority of services. Such services can be expected to either not be seeking accreditation or to have been refused accreditation. However, they will certainly have capital-related expenses such as depreciation, for which accommodation charges are a source of funds.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Hindmarsh</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman), to a question without notice asked by Senator Evans today, relating to welfare reform.
It is interesting to note that the minister received three questions today about the welfare reform process—one from me, one from Senator Lees and one from Senator Harradine—and the minister had nothing to say. The minister could not help us with what is happening with the welfare reform process. She said she could not give us a sneak preview. This is the thing that is supposed to be her crowning achievement and this is the thing that causes her to refuse to resign, as she promised the Prime Minister, until she gets her way with it, but she is unable to inform the Senate of what is happening with the issue.
All we know is what we read in the papers: that the Prime Minister says there are some differing views at the cabinet table about what to do about the welfare reform process. Apparently, it is the difference between hard and harder—those who want to hit the poor hard and those who want to hit the poor even harder—and they are having some sort of ideological debate about how hard one ought to hit the poor and how hard one ought to hit people on disability pensions et cetera. But the minister is unable to share any of that with us today and unable to share with us when she will be responding to the McClure report and when she will be giving us any more detail, other than to say `hopefully next week', because, quite frankly, she does not know. She does not know the answer because the Prime Minister has not told her what she is allowed to say or what the government is going to do. The Prime Minister is talking about after Christmas; the minister is talking about maybe next week.
This minister has cancelled more appointments at the National Press Club than most of you have had hot dinners in the last year. I do not know what the fee is for a cancellation or a postponement at the National Press Club but if it is any more than $100 the taxpayers of this country are going to start feeling the pinch. People might remember that the minister was not going to have a review process; she was actually going to release the white paper on welfare reform. That was until the Prime Minister's office got hold of it, and she had to rearrange her plans. I think she cancelled or postponed at the Press Club at least twice, and finally she announced that she was forming a committee. She could not name the committee or tell us its terms of reference, but the supposedly huge announcement on welfare reform became her saying she was forming the committee. Eventually, it transpired that that committee was the McClure committee. They found Mr McClure to chair it and finally it got under way. As we know, its report was delayed by some months and the government's response to that report continues to be delayed.
We know that there have been another couple of postponements at the Press Club, another couple of postponement fees charged to the Australian taxpayer, as the minister again waits for the Prime Minister, Mr Abbott and Mr Reith to let her know what her policy is. Until then, if you try to get into the Press Club in the next few weeks, you will find that you cannot: every date is booked for Senator Newman; she might be giving a speech about welfare reform. So, if you want to do something at the Press Club, do not bother: you have to get an alternative venue because it is all booked to Senator Newman because her speech is coming soon. 
—That is what they tell you, Chris.
—What we know, Senator Campbell, is that you have no chance of making it into the ministry until she goes, and she is not going until they let her make her speech. So you have to hope, as must Senator Patterson, that she gets to give her speech soon, because you have no chance of making the ministry until then.
I am making light of this but it is really a very serious issue. The welfare reform process is being completely bungled by this government. They really are seriously contemplating letting Mr Abbott, who has done so much to wreck the whole Job Network and Employment National, loose on the welfare recipients of this country, the people who need a social welfare safety net. I think that would be disastrous for social justice in this country. It is of great concern to many people, including many people in the government and in the Liberal Party.
We know now that the minister does not know when she will be allowed to say something about welfare reform or what she will be allowed to say. We know that she is threatening to not resign until they let her put her imprimatur on the reforms, but at this stage she does not know what that imprimatur will be. We know that, at the weekend, in the list of the most overtly powerful Australians, we saw that my leader, Senator John Faulkner, was at No. 7 with a bullet and Senator Newman was equal 10th and falling, because she has completely lost control of the agenda. She has been overruled by the Mr Abbotts and the Mr Reiths of this government and they are driving the social welfare agenda, which is to kick the poor, to reduce welfare payments and to run a much harsher policy than even Senator Newman is prepared to run. It is very strange when you find yourself thinking that Senator Newman is the caring face of the government, but apparently that is the case inside cabinet: she is the voice of concern, apparently, surprising as that may be.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-11-27,"—I find it really hypocritical that the Labor Party stand up here and comment when they have absolutely no policies except that they are going to roll back the GST. That is about their only policy, and then they are equivocal about that: one day they are going to roll it back; the next day they are not going to roll it back. Yet they come in here and are critical of the Liberal Party and the coalition in regard to social welfare policy. When we came into government, we inherited a ramshackle system. Senator Richardson, when he was minister for social security, had said it was a trim, taut and terrific social security program and that nothing else could be done to it at all. In fact, we found that lots could be done to it. We found, for example, that there were a number of youth payments and that, because there were so many different payments, young people were being given conflicting advice. So Senator Newman in fact reformed the whole of those youth payments and reduced the number of youth payments—and I have forgotten how many there were—down to a limited number, so that there were less likely to be errors. All sorts of reforms were put into place.
Labor have the gall to come in here and criticise, when they went to the 1993 election saying they were going to take all pensioners out of the taxation system. This was part of their social welfare policy. That is what they went to the 1993 election telling people; that was to be their policy when they were in government. What did they do straight after the election? They said, `We made a mistake. We did not mean to say that.' 
What was one of their other brilliant ideas in social welfare reform? One of the things that they said in 1992 was that they were going to—and they did, they put legislation through this place—treat capital gains on shares as income for the purposes of assessing the pension, so that when shares fluctuated older people's pensions went down. We told them over and over and over again that it would not work. But Labor pressed on with this ridiculous policy—this is how good they are at social welfare reform; this is the sort of thing that they do under social welfare reform—and in fact they had to renege on it in the end because it was totally unworkable. The fluctuations in pensions were totally unacceptable and unworkable. That is the sort of reform that the Labor Party tried to bring in. One part of the reform was that they would take all older people out of the taxation system, and then they failed by withdrawing that immediately after the election. 
When we came into government, what did we find? That a billion dollars of the $10 billion Beazley black hole was being spent on social security fraud and overpayment. The Labor Party were borrowing $1 billion from overseas, against the future of young Australians, to pay for fraud and overpayment. People were getting jobs and saying, `Don't bother going and telling anybody that you've got a job because Social Security never follows you up.' This is the wonderful system they had: `Just work for six or seven weeks and then go and tell Social Security that you've got a job. They won't get the money back; they won't follow it up.' They were not following it up—
—That is not true.
—Senator Crowley, it is absolutely true. In the first year that we were in government, there were $47 million a week in savings on social security fraud and overpayment. That is $47 million a week—not a year—that was recuperated from social security fraud and overpayment. The Labor Party were borrowing $1 billion dollars a year to pay for social security fraud and overpayment, so do not tell me about welfare reform, because you were incapable of it. When you put in a reform like treating unrealised capital gains as shares, you had to withdraw it. Then the Labor Party lied, telling pensioners that they would be taken out of the tax system. 
—Order! Senator Patterson, would you address the chair, please.
—Go back to the drawing board, get some policies and talk about your policies rather than ask us when we are going to bring ours in. We will bring ours in in good time, and they will be worthwhile reforms.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Social Welfare: Reform</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I rise to support the motion moved by my colleague Senator Evans that we take note of the answers—if you can call them that—given by Senator Newman on the question of social welfare policy in this country. As has been pointed out by Senator Evans and by the media, those interested in social welfare have been waiting now not just the odd couple of months but a good 12 months for this minister to front up with what was speculated to be a major policy statement, properly costed, on reforming social welfare in this country. It has always been put back—`no, not quite'—and its presentation cancelled. The National Press Club luncheon was cancelled, and presentations were cancelled, delayed and deferred. There was speculation in the press and leaks from the government: `It's not quite ready; we're still discussing it.' 
During all the time that this was going on, as Senator Evans pointed out, the only form of action that we got was that finally the minister commissioned the McClure review. The review took place, and when the report was released it was promoted as the major benchmark, the major stepping stone, for the most dramatic change to social welfare `reform' in Australia's history. Since then, we have waited with bated breath. Now what is emerging is that this minister is being consistently rolled by others in her own government—even by her junior minister, Mr Abbott, and others who do not want her to be in charge and to get any kudos, if you could call it that, for making a major costed statement on social welfare reform. What is clear is that Mr Abbott wants the job of minister for social security or Minister for Family and Community Services—whatever title they will drum up to suit his ambition, as long he will be the cabinet minister in charge. What he wants to do is to get the present minister, Senator Newman, out of the job so that he has the glory and the honour of putting it together and, above all, announcing it.  
Speculation has been put in the press—I suppose by Mr Abbott and his acolytes—that Senator Newman is to go off to greener pastures: to be the Governor-General maybe or an ambassador or administrator. I suppose they might create the position of Administrator of Heard Island—one of our dependencies in the Southern Ocean and a place where the ability of Senator Newman could be put effectively to work representing the interests of penguins and albatrosses. Obviously, something is being lined up for her. I found it astonishing to read an article in the Sydney Morning Herald only last Saturday in which Senator Newman was written up as being a bleeding heart in favour of social welfare, as the one in the government who has the most empathy with the social welfare lobby groups. After sitting here for four years opposite Senator Newman, I have to say that that is an astonishing description of the woman we describe as Mrs Bucket—
—Hyacinth.
—Hyacinth Bucket.
—Order, Senator! Please refer to the minister by her correct title and name.
—Nevertheless, Minister Newman has never let up in this place, standing up here and delighting and glowing in the fact that she has taken the pension off some poor person in this country. Yet this is not good enough for the Tony Abbotts of the world. They want to be even harder, and they are out there now leaking that she has got to go before this statement is made on reform. Mr Abbott, the man who left the seminary before he would have become a frocked priest, is now out there attacking the St Vincent de Paul Society because it is defending the poor too much, saying it does not understand. An article says:
He cited papal doctrine in his attack on the St Vincent de Paul Society.
The St Vincent de Paul Society has done more over the decades to help poor people in this country than Tony Abbott could do if he lived a million years, even if he were the social security minister or the Minister for Family and Community Services.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-11-27,"—What an incredible and pointless debate this is. We had Senator Evans demanding to have a preview from the minister when the minister made it quite plain that this new policy would be available next week. Senator Evans has delusions of grandeur; he thinks he is more important than any member of the cabinet. He wants to have a preview before anybody else—
—I know you would like to have a preview, too, Senator Schacht. I am sure Senator Crowley and Senator Carr would like to have previews but, like the rest of us and like Senator Evans, you are going to have to wait until it has been to cabinet and the government has released this report.
—It is an albatross!
—This report is not an albatross. It is a very important report which is going to set a new direction for social welfare in Australia. We have to think about why we need this new reform agenda. Why does it all have to be changed? It has to be changed because for years and years we have had a social welfare system under which people got onto social welfare and never got off it. They were there without review and simply became the faceless people in society who were welfare dependent under the policies of the previous government. When this government got into office, a system of review of those who were on social security was introduced. If we all can recall, every week millions of dollars are being saved in social security payments because it was found that a lot of people were no longer in need of social security. This government has introduced the concept of mutual obligation so that people who are on social security have an obligation to the community to provide something in return for the social security benefits which they receive—if they are able to give something back. For that reason, we have introduced a work for the dole scheme, which means that people who are on unemployment benefits do community work, instead of lying around at home. 
—Which the opposition support.
—As Senator Calvert says, which the opposition oppose.
—No, support.
—They do support, but they opposed it in the beginning.
—No, not on Heard Island. If the Labor Party could, they would probably enrol all the penguins and have them vote in a seat in Brisbane to help them get elected. Mutual obligation, through work for the dole, has been very successful. We are trying to overcome the whole issue of people not being able to use their abilities and, instead, getting into welfare dependency because their disabilities are emphasised. That is a completely different focus of the social welfare system. The whole of the reform is based on the five themes, which have been mentioned before, proposed by the reference group: individualised service delivery, a simple and responsive income support structure, incentives and financial assistance, mutual obligation, and social partnership. 
We on this side of the Senate believe that we need to have this reform of our social welfare system so that there is an integrated approach to the provision of social welfare. Nobody at all denies that the need exists for some people to be on social welfare and for the community as a whole to provide for those who, for some reason, are unable to work or to support themselves. But we do need to have a consistent and integrated approach which means that people on social welfare are encouraged to identify their abilities and to use them in a constructive way so that, where possible, they can support themselves to some degree while receiving support from the government. The government has made it quite plain that nobody would be disadvantaged by this reform of the social welfare program. The kind of nonsense which the opposition are coming out with in matters like this motion to take note of the answers given by the minister is only undermining the public credibility of what will be a very effective policy. It is important that people with disabilities emphasise the positives. It is quite wrong of the opposition to mock the process of reform because they have been responsible for many people over the years wallowing in welfare dependency.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I am pleased to add my thoughts and words to the motion to take note of the answers by Senator Newman today. I do not find it very helpful in this place when the government deliberately, I have to say, misrepresents the policies of the previous Labor government. The fact that we did not solve everything may be something you could do us on, but to suggest that we never hunted down overpayments or never looked for fraud is absolutely wrong. There were any number of great initiatives in social security under the previous Labor government which deserve your applause. We will not get applause, but at least we might stop the misrepresentation. For example, it was Brian Howe, as minister, who introduced the benchmark payments for children up to 13 and for children from 13 to 16. It was the Labor government which carried through the child support legislation, which made a huge difference—legislation which Peter Durack might have wanted to introduce in the previous Fraser Liberal government, but he was too busy, as we understand, dealing with the bottom of the harbour. Reform is a process that continues, but this government is pushing more and more people off welfare into poverty.
Here are some of the figures. There are 2.4 million Australians now living in poverty, and one in four poor Australians are members of the working poor. Officially, 2,500 people sleep rough in Sydney streets, but that is probably only one-third of the real figure. The Productivity Commission revealed that between 1990 and 1998 the earnings of the 10 per cent of the most highly paid men leapt above middle income earners by as much as 162 per cent, while the income of the top 10 per cent of women soared by as much as 150 per cent. At the same time, blue-collar workers' wages slipped from 71 per cent to 68 per cent of middle-class white-collar wages. In other words, the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting very rich indeed. The gap is opening. Since your government has come to office, that gap has only widened. That is the concern. Then we have Mr Abbott suggesting that the real problem is St Vincent de Paul and that, really, people should understand the principle of subsidiarity, and some of us might have a sense of what that means, but the rest of us do not—that is, devolving the task to those organisations closest to the problem. 
There may be something in that. If you really wanted to work in conjunction with St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family or Anglicare, why would you, at the same time, significantly cut government funding to those organisations? That is exactly what you have done. You have pushed people off welfare payments. They are then forced to go to the charitable organisations at the same time as you have significantly cut payments to welfare. That is what Minister Newman is sitting over. That is what the government is sitting over. That is why we get up and legitimately complain.
We also complain bitterly about the number of people who have been breached—in other words, had their unemployment benefits and payments cut. Of the 474,435 breaches imposed on job seekers in the last financial year, 172,000 were overturned on appeal. Something like 40 per cent of the people who were breached were found, on appeal, to be eligible for continuing payment—a mistake had been made. What is the policy? What is the welfare approach? What is in this government's heart if it is breaching people, cutting their payments? We found the evidence at the estimates the other night: something like 38 to 40 per cent of those breaches were overturned before they even went to an official appeal. These are the people who suddenly find themselves without any money. You cannot get the department or Centrelink to change the decision overnight and, if it happens on a Friday, you are stuck with no money for two days—so you go and see St Vincent de Paul and you arrive there just in time to find that they too have had their funding cut significantly.
If the government were serious about caring for the poor, it would not be boasting about how many people it has got off payments, especially when so many of them are eligible. It would be actually talking about how much money it had given to St Vincent de Paul or to people to make sure that they were not pushed into poverty. We are finding that more and more people are pushed into poverty—more and more people are pushed into the degrading business of having absolutely no money and having to find somewhere they can go to get that kind of assistance. That is not the sort of Australia we want. The GST has contributed to making people poor. Petrol prices are doing it too. At the moment, when you are on a pension and have a $7 increase under the GST, if you fill your petrol tank once you have just spent an extra $10—the $7 you gained for the week has gone.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-27,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2000, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the bill to be considered during these sittings. I seek leave to have that statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Family Law Act 1975 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to clarify the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service.
A question has been raised concerning the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service to hear Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (ADJR Act) matters transferred to it by the Federal Court and matrimonial causes transferred to it by the Family Court. The Solicitor-General has advised that as certainty is important in this matter, it would be desirable to clarify the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service.
To avoid any uncertainty in this matter the legislation would also validate orders made by the Federal Magistrates Service in ADJR matters or matrimonial causes transferred from the relevant superior court.
A related matter concerns section 86AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 which limits award the amount of damages that the Federal Magistrates Service can award in relation to proceedings instituted in the Federal Magistrates Service to $200,000 or such other amount as is prescribed. It is proposed to amend the Trade Practices Act to ensure that the same restriction applies to matters transferred to the Federal Magistrates Service by the Federal Court as already applies to trade practices matters commenced in the Federal Magistrates Service.
Reasons for Urgency
As the Federal Magistrates Service is an inferior court it is possible that orders made by it without jurisdiction would be held null and void if successfully challenged. It is possible, for example, that some litigants who have had decrees nisi granted by the Federal Magistrates Service have since remarried. While it is only a possibility that a court would find that the Federal Magistrates Service did not have jurisdiction to make a decree nisi, it is not tenable to have an uncertainty about the validity of marriages.

I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee's correspondence concerning these regulations and a previous matter.
Leave granted.
The correspondence read as follows—
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.181
17 August 2000
Senator the Hon Robert Hill
Minister for Environment and Heritage
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister 
I refer to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No. 181, that provide for environmental assessment and approvals, conservation of biodiversity, various conservation principles, enforcement and administrative matters.
As a general comment the Explanatory Statement does little more than paraphrase the Regulations. It does not explain key aspects of the new regulations, as indicated in the following comments. 
Regulations 7.01 and 7.02 list the criteria for listing a native species as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable. The criteria are defined by using terms such as `very severe', `severe', `substantial', `very low', `low', `limited' etc. The Explanatory Statement does not, however, explain how these criteria are to be defined and the Committee would appreciate clarification of this process.
The Regulations expressly create a number of strict liability offences. Some of these offences were not previously strict liability offences under the previous National Parks and Wildlife Regulations 1975 (new regulations 12.14, 12.28, 12.29, 12.43, 12.44, 12.48 and 12.54). Others are newly introduced strict liability offences (new regulations 12.50 to 12.52 and 12.55). No explanation is given in the Explanatory Statement for these changes. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reason why it has been decided that these offences should carry strict liability.
Regulation 12.10, read in conjunction with Part 17, deals with permits for scientific research. The previous National Parks and Wildlife Regulations 1975 imposed a requirement for consultation with the Aboriginal owners of the land before a permit could be issued allowing research on land on which a sacred site is situated (old regulation 27(2)). The Committee would appreciate your assurance that the new regulations do not involve any lessening of this consultation requirement.
Regulation 12.13 sets a penalty of 50 penalty units where a person damages, defaces, moves, possesses or interferes with heritage. Heritage is defined broadly and includes `objects that have aesthetic, archaeological, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value'. It is quite possible that a person may not know whether an object falls within this broad definition. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to whether this Regulation is intended to be a strict liability offence or, if not, whether it should be confined to intentional acts.
Regulation 12.24 imposes a penalty of 50 penalty units on a person who captures an image in or of a Commonwealth reserve in contravention of a prohibition or restriction imposed by the Director. The Committee would appreciate your advice about the following matters in relation to this Regulation: 
1. What is the reason for the imposition of the maximum number of penalty units (as prescribed by subsection 520(2) of the Act) for this offence?
2. The heading to the regulation refers to `capturing images or recording sound', yet the regulation does not refer specifically to `recording sound'. Should these words be deleted from the heading?
3. How extensive will the publication of a prohibition or notice under subregulation 12.24 (4) be?
4. Where the `device or means used' to capture the image has been confiscated by the Director, ranger or warden, under subregulation 12.24 (5), what provision is made for the subsequent return of the property?
5. Does the expression `device or means used to capture the image' include cameras used by tourists?
Subregulation 12.36(2) extends the prohibition on commercial activity in a Commonwealth reserve to include `a commercial activity being carried out in the reserve, whether or not the activity took place in the reserve'. The distinction between `being carried out in' and `took place in' is not self-evident and the Explanatory Statement sheds no light on what is meant by this subregulation.  The Committee would therefore appreciate receiving further information clarifying the intent of this provision. 
Regulation 12.38 states that a person must not `use a captured image of a Commonwealth reserve to derive commercial gain'. The prohibition is not restricted to the person who initially captures the image and extends to subsequent users of the image. However, a subsequent user of the image for commercial gain may not know whether the image is `of a Commonwealth reserve', in which case the Regulation may have a strict liability effect. The Committee would also appreciate clarification of the intent of this provision.
Subregulation 14.03(4) provides that an infringement notice may be served on a person not more than 12 months after the alleged offence. This appears to be a long period in which to serve a notice and perhaps a shorter period may be preferable. The Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 9 October 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated. 
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000, concerning the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 (EPBC regulations).
I have considered comments made by the Committee on the EPBC regulations. Please find attached to this letter, my response to the comments raised.
The information contained in the attachment provides the explanations and clarifications sought by the Committee in relation to particular EPBC regulations.
Yours sincerely

ATTACHMENT
RESPONSE TO COMMENTS BY THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECT-ION AND BIO-DIVERSITY CONSERVATION REGU-LATIONS 2000
1. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Regulations 7.01 and 7.02 list the criteria for listing a native species as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable. The criteria are defined by using terms such as `very severe', `severe', `substantial', `very low', `low', `limited' etc. The Explanatory Statement does not, however, explain how these criteria are to be defined and the Committee would appreciate clarification of this process.
RESPONSE
The listing of native species as critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable is to be guided by the terms provided in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 (EPBC regulations) such as `very severe', `severe', `substantial', `very low', `low', `limited' etc.
These terms are further clarified in guidelines (see Attachment A and at the following Internet site: http://www.environment.gov.au/bg/wildlife/lists/nominations/index.html) developed by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (TSSC) which are provided with the nomination forms for threatened species, threatened ecological communities and key threatening processes. The terms are also closely aligned with the detailed criteria used by The World Conservation Union Red List categories. The criteria are subject to change as assessment methods develop. The guidelines will be reviewed and updated by the TSSC as required, to ensure that listing procedures are consistent with current scientific thinking.
2. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
The regulations expressly create a number of strict liability offences. Some of these offences were not previously strict liability offences under the previous National Parks and Wildlife Regulations 1975 (NPWS regulations) (new regulations 12.14, 12.28, 12.29, 12.43, 12.44, 12.48 and 12.54). Others are newly introduced strict liability offences (new regulations 12.50 to 12.52 and 12.55). No explanation is given in the Explanatory Statement for these changes. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reason why it has been decided that these offences should carry strict liability.
RESPONSE
The NPWS regulations did not have strict liability offences as they predated the Criminal Code Act 1995. Those offences that are strict liability in the EPBC regulations, in accordance with the Criminal Code, have clear cut physical elements. During the development of the EPBC regulations, the Attorney General's Department examined the offence provisions referred to above and advised that strict liability could be attached to each one.
Please note the matters dealt with by EPBC regulations 12.50 to 12.52 were previously covered by the NPWS, regulations (regulations 60E-H - see Attachment B).
3. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Regulation 12.10, read in conjunction with Part 17, deals with permits for scientific research. The previous NPWS regulations imposed a requirement for consultation with the Aboriginal owners of the land before a permit could be issued, allowing research on land on which a sacred site is situated (old regulation 27(2)). The Committee would appreciate your assurance that the new regulations do not involve any lessening of this consultation requirement.
RESPONSE 
Permits are issued by the Director of National Parks. Section 514D(2) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) requires that in relation to Commonwealth reserves or conservation zones, the Director is to ""consult and have regard to the views of"" Chairpersons of Aboriginal land councils and community councils for particular reserves in respect to the performance of the Directors functions and exercise of powers. This requirement goes beyond the item-by-item requirements for consultation in the previous NPWS regulations. When coupled with the circumstances required under regulation 17.05 (items 1 and 2 for permitting of any activity) it is considered that requirements for consulting with Indigenous owners of land have been extended under the EPBC regulations.
4. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Regulation 12.13 sets a penalty of 50 penalty units where a person damages, defaces, moves, possesses or interferes with heritage. Heritage is defined broadly and includes `objects that have aesthetic, archaeological, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value'. It is. quite possible that a person may not know whether an object falls within this broad definition. The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to whether this regulation is intended to be a strict liability offence or, if not, whether it should be confined to intentional acts.
RESPONSE
The offence provision is not strict liability. This regulation is designed to both broaden and simplify protection of heritage in a reserve. The previous NPWS regulations required specific identification of an archaeological site or identification and labelling of an historic site. This approach had the potential to draw undue attention to known heritage items and their location in a manner that could be either culturally insensitive or detrimental to heritage protection, or both. In addition, heritage items of which the Director was not aware (for cultural reasons for example) could not be protected. The approach taken in the EPBC regulations overcomes these problems. However, in recognition that persons may, through an honest and reasonable mistake of fact, damage and interfere with heritage, it is not appropriate to apply a strict liability offence. The approach that has been adopted establishes and promotes a regime encouraging awareness and understanding of the need to not damage any heritage in Commonwealth Reserves.
5. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Regulation 12.24 imposes a penalty of 50 penalty units on a person who captures an image in, or of, a Commonwealth reserve, in contravention of a prohibition or restriction imposed by the Director. The Committee would appreciate your advice about the following matters in relation to this regulation:
(a) What is the reason for the imposition of the maximum number of penalty units (as prescribed by subsection 520(2) of the Act for this offence?
RESPONSE
Offences committed in relation to this regulation generally relate to acute cultural sensitivity regarding image (either visual or sound) capture. In such cases the maximum penalty is appropriate.
(b) The heading to the regulations refers to `capturing images or recording sound', yet the regulation does not refer specifically to `recording sound'. Should these words be deleted from the heading?
RESPONSE
The reference in the regulation to `image' covers both visual and sound images.
(c) How extensive will the publication of a prohibition or notice under subregulation 12.24 (4) be?
RESPONSE
Regulation 12.05 provides that unless otherwise specified, publication would be in the Gazette. However, in accordance with the aim of promoting compliance through awareness development and education, determinations by the Director will generally be widely advertised, for example, in: local media, training and guidelines for tour operators, information handed out at entrance. stations, by appropriate signage, and in management plans.
(d) Where the `device or means used' to capture the image has been confiscated by the Director, ranger or warden, under subregulation 12.24(5), what provision is made for the subsequent return of the property?
RESPONSE
The handling of images and devices under subregulation 12.24(5) is to be addressed in guidelines for wardens and rangers. The intent is to have the device surrendered, have the medium processed and then return the device together with any images that were not captured in a place or manner prohibited by the regulations. Any prohibited images would be destroyed unless required for evidence.
(e) Does the expression `device or means used to capture the image' include cameras used by tourists?
RESPONSE 
The expression `device or means used to capture the image' includes cameras used by tourists. However, this applies only where the Director has made a determination that images are not to be captured in a particular area. Such a restriction or prohibition will generally be widely publicised as stated above in response to comment (c). In practice, `image capture' in parts of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park has, for some years, been limited. This situation is now reflected in the EPBC regulations.
6. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Subregulation 12.36(2) extends the prohibition on commercial activity in a Commonwealth reserve to include `a commercial activity being carried out in the reserve, whether or not the activity took place in the reserve'. The distinction between `being carried out in' and `took place in' is not self-evident and the Explanatory Statement sheds no light on what is meant by this subregulation. The Committee would therefore appreciate receiving further information clarifying the intent of this provision.
RESPONSE
There are instances where transactions for commercial activities take place outside (sometimes immediately outside) the reserve with the express intent of resulting in an activity within the reserve, for example, hire of boats adjacent to the boundary of Kakadu National Park for use on waterways within the reserve or joy flights over Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. The NPWS regulations provided no capacity to regulate these activities which impact on the reserve. Enforcement of EPBC regulation 12.36(2) would require evidence that the commercial activity includes advertising or other promotion of an activity within the reserve, or that (due to location) the commercial activity could not effectively take place other than in the reserve. Where this can be established, a permit would be required in the same way as if the transaction took place within the reserve.
7. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Regulation 12.38 states that a person must not `use a captured image of a Commonwealth reserve to derive commercial gain'. The prohibition is not restricted to the person who initially captures the image and extends to subsequent users of the image. However, a subsequent user of the image for commercial gain may not know whether the image is `of a Commonwealth reserve', in which case the regulation may have a strict liability effect. The Committee would also appreciate clarification of the intent of this provision.
RESPONSE
Previously the NPWS regulations sought to regulate only overt commercial image capture. This was based on assumptions that images captured for commercial use had a wider reach and exposure than privately captured images and there was relatively limited scope for a privately captured image to enter the commercial realm.
Regulation 12.38 recognises that privately captured images are now capable of being widely shared, for example, through the Internet. Though such sources, commercial interests can now easily obtain images that they would not have been authorised to capture themselves. They would then be free to use such images without any regulation, regardless of for example, the potential cultural offence that may be caused. The EPBC  regulation seeks to impose an obligation on a person to gain authorisation to derive commercial gain in this way. This applies to any person who `on-sells' an image that was captured privately and lawfully, whether or not they are the person who captured the image in the first place. Again, priority is placed on preventing or limiting exposure of images that are culturally offensive, through awareness and education rather than enforcement.
8. STANDING COMMITTEE COMMENT
Subregulation 14.03(4) provides that an infringement notice may be served on a person not more than 12 months after the alleged offence. This appears to be a long period in which to serve a notice and perhaps a shorter period may be preferable. The Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter.
RESPONSE
Prosecution for offences against the EPBC regulations can be commenced within one year of the offence being committed. It is therefore appropriate that an infringement notice could be served within that time to give the alleged offender the maximum opportunity to take advantage of the infringement notice option. Any shorter period for service of an infringement notice would seem to be unfair to an alleged offender.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your reply dated 3 October 2000 in response to the Committee's concerns with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000. The Committee considered your response at its meeting today and agreed that it met most of its concerns. 
However, the Committee remains concerned with certain regulations and would appreciate further information on the following matters. 
Response to Standing Committee comment number 2. The Committee notes your advice that the Attorney-General examined the offence provisions and strict liability was attached to each one. However, the Committee would appreciate your advice on the reasons why it was decided that each of these provisions should carry strict liability.
Response to Standing Committee comment number 4. In relation to regulation 12.13, you advised that it had been broadened to protect heritage sites generally to include those known and those of which the Director was unaware. Given the broad definition of `heritage' and the fact that the Director may be unaware that sites exist, the Committee reiterates its view that it may be appropriate to confine the regulation to intentional acts.
Response to Standing Committee comment number 5(b). The Committee's research indicates a drafting distinction has been drawn between visual images and sound and suggests that the inclusion of `recording sound' would overcome any potential confusion that may arise from the application of this provision. 
Response to Standing Committee comment number 5(d). The Committee notes your advice and would appreciate receiving a copy of the guidelines concerning the handling of images and devices.
Please note that in order to protect its options in relation to this instrument, the Committee has agreed to give notice of motion to disallow on Monday, 9 October 2000.

RESPONSES TO COMMENTS BY THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON REGULATIONS AND ORDINANCES ON THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECT-ION AND BIO-DIVERSITY CONSERVATION REGULA-TIONS 2000
1. The Committee asked why certain offences are strict liability.
RESPONSE:
The offences referred to are strict liability where compliance is a matter over which those who are potentially criminally liable have control. They are also concerned with the protection or conservation of Commonwealth reserves and the biodiversity within them.
Regulations 12.28, 12.29, 12.43, 12.44, 12.48, 12.54 and 12.55 provide for notice to be given to the public about the activities which are covered by these regulations. The park management requirements are provided in the form of published notices, signs, directions given by park staff, etc. Compliance with those regulations is therefore a very simple matter and clearly within the direct control of potential offenders. In relation to Regulations 12.14, 12.50, 12.51 and 12.52, it is reasonable to say that compliance with those regulations would be within the control of potential offenders. It should be reasonably obvious to anyone that a person ought not to interfere with parking permits or vouchers, interfere with voucher machines, install voucher machines without approval or dump waste or litter in a Commonwealth reserve.
The activities to which these regulations apply - littering, camping, speeding, parking, and obeying signs - are essentially regulatory in nature and the regulations impose only minor penalties. The maximum penalties for these offences (with the exception of Regulations 12.14(2) and (3)) are at the lower end (3 to 10 penalty units) of the range of penalties that may be imposed for offences against the Regulations. Activities such as littering, parking, speeding etc are now commonly the subject of strict liability offences in State and Territory legislation. 
Having regard to the above matters it is appropriate for the particular offences to be strict liability offences.
In addition, the offences that carry strict liability - Regulations 12.14. 12. 28, 12.29, 12.43, 12.44, 12.48, 12.50, 12.51, 12.52, 12.54 and 12.55 - are offences to which the infringement notice provisions apply as prescribed in Schedule 10 of the EPBC Regulations. With the exception of Regulations 12.28, 12.29 and 12.54 equivalent offences were subject to the infringement notice provisions in the former National Parks and Wildlife Regulations. It is appropriate to continue this regulatory regime.
In transferring the regulatory regime to the new EPBC Regulations, it was appropriate to include camping and failure of vehicles to stop (Regulations 12.28, 12.29 and 12.54) as offences for which infringement notices can be issued. Having the capacity to issue infringement notices for these common, minor offences has the benefit of providing the defendant and Park staff with an alternative to court proceedings, namely the capacity to dispose of a matter expeditiously by payment of a lesser penalty than a court could impose.
The Criminal Law Division of the Attorney General's Department advised that in accordance with Commonwealth criminal law policy, infringement notices should only underpin strict or absolute liability offences. The Attorney General's Department examined the offences to which infringement notices where proposed to apply and confirmed that in all cases it was appropriate to attach strict liability.
It is also noted that the offences are strict but not absolute liability and the defence of mistake of fact under Chapter 2 (s9.2) of the Criminal Code (as applied by s7 of the EPBC Act) will be available.
2. The Committee is of the view that it may be appropriate to confine Regulation 12.13 on damaging heritage to intentional acts.
RESPONSE:
It is unnecessary to confine regulation 12.13 to intentional acts as having regard to Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code, Regulation 12.13 would seem to be limited to intentionally damaging, defacing, moving, possessing or interfering with heritage. The physical element of the offence consists only of conduct as defined in s4.1 of the Code (and not a circumstance in which conduct occurs or a result of conduct). As the regulation does not specify a fault element for that physical element so by default intention is the fault element for the offence. Section 5.2 of the Code `provides that a person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.
3. The Committee suggests that ""recording sound"" be included in the body as well as the heading of Regulation 12.24.
RESPONSE:
The Committee's research indicating that, there is a drafting distinction between visual images and sound is acknowledged. While it is agreed that the Committee's suggestion to including `recording sound' in the body of the Regulation may overcome possible confusion about this provision, such an alteration would make no change to the application of this regulation.
4. The Committee requested copies of the guidelines concerning the handling of images and devices.
RESPONSE:
The guidelines are still being prepared. A copy will be forwarded as soon as they are finalised.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letters dated 3 and 27 October 2000 responding to the Committee's concerns with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No.181. The Committee considered your responses at its meeting today and agreed that your advice has answered most of its concerns with these Regulations.
The Committee, however, has a continuing concern with the drafting of regulation 12.24 relating to the capturing of images or recording sound. In your response of 27 October 2000, you acknowledged that there was a drafting distinction between visual images and sound. You advised that the inclusion of the words `recording sound' would make no change to the application of the regulation but agreed that it may overcome possible confusion about this provision. After considering your response, the Committee is still of the view that a reference to recording sound should be included in the body of the regulation, thereby avoiding any confusion.
The Committee would appreciate your response as soon as possible as the last day for the Senate to resolve this notice of notion to disallow is 15 sitting days after 9 October 2000. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Senator the Hon Grant Tambling
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health
 and Aged Care
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Parliamentary Secretary
I refer to the National Food Authority Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 122. The Committee notes that the Regulations prescribe various charges for services provided by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, prescribe certain agencies to which the Authority may disclose confidential commercial information, and make other amendments to the Principal Regulations to reflect changes to the Act.
New subregulation 8(1) fixes a fee for an application of $2,800. Whilst a note to the subregulation explains the components of the fee, the Explanatory Statement does not explain the basis for these components nor for the total amount. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the basis for the fee.
New subregulation 8(2) deems that the application fee (if any) for an application is taken to accompany the application if it is paid `without delay' when the applicant receives notification under paragraph 13A(2)(a) of the Act that the application has been accepted. The Committee is concerned that the words `without delay' do not give the applicant sufficiently clear guidance about the time for payment and would appreciate your advice on whether it would be more appropriate if a time limit should be specified for payment of the application fee.  
New regulation 10 provides for the refund of fees in certain circumstances.  Subregulations 10(3) and (4) provide that one amount will be refunded if the application is withdrawn before `half of the work required for full assessment is completed', while a lesser sum is refundable if the withdrawal occurs after `half of the work required for full assessment is completed'. Neither the regulations nor the Explanatory Statement indicate how it is to be determined whether half of the work has been completed, or who is to make that decision.  The Committee would appreciate your advice on these matters.
New regulation 14 provides for the review of decisions under subsection 13A(2) or (3) of the Act. Subregulation (1) does not specify any time limit within which the applicant must apply for reconsideration of a decision. Subregulation (2) does not set any time limit within which the Authority must reconsider the matter. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether time limits should be specified for these matters.
Schedule 3 sets out the charges payable in relation to full assessment, drafting and inquiry. The Risk Impact Statement explains that these fees are based upon `an estimate of anticipated costs'. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to how this estimate has been made.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 9 October 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 in which you presented a range of questions that the committee has raised in connection with the National Food Authority Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 122. I apologise for the delay in responding. 
Our responses to your questions are below.
What is the basis for the application fee fixed in new subregulation 8(1)?
The fee of $2,800 referred to in the new subregulation 8(1) is intended to cover the work undertaken by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) in determining whether the application complies with section 12 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 (the Act), in carrying out a preliminary assessment of the application under section 13 of the Act, as well as the work required under sections 13A and 14 of the Act in relation to notifying the applicant, the public, appropriate government bodies and any other appropriate bodies or persons.
In making a preliminary assessment of the application, ANZFA must consider amongst other matters, whether the application relates to a matter that may be developed as a food regulatory measure, or whether the application is so similar to a previous application that it ought not to be accepted. In addition, consideration needs to be given as to whether costs that would arise from a food regulatory measure developed or varied as a result of the application, outweigh the direct and indirect benefits to the community, government or industry that would arise from the measure or variation, whether other measures would be more cost effective as well as any other relevant matters.
The relevant matters that are considered during preliminary assessment include: the category of assessment that the application will fit into; and whether the application may result in an exclusive capturable commercial benefit to the applicant.
The fee of $2,800 has been established based on extensive past experience and reflects the total costs to ANZFA based on an average of the total staff time that would be involved in this work.
The Committee is concerned about the words `without delay' in relation to payment of the application fee after the applicant receives notification that the application has been accepted. Should a time limit be specified for payment of the application fee?
As indicated in the explanatory memorandum, subregulation 8(2) constitutes a deeming provision in relation to acceptance of an application fee because a determination as to whether a charge is applicable cannot be made until after the acceptance of an application (in contrast to ""all comers pay fees"" type systems). The application will not be deemed to have been received until payment of the fee is received. The term ""without delay"" is intended to signify to the applicant that under subsection 15(2) of the Act, a full assessment cannot commence until the Authority receives the charge fixed. In the letter of notification to the applicant, it will be made clear that any delay in receipt of the charge will delay the commencement of the full assessment stage. In my view, a time limit does not need to be specified for payment of the application fee.
In relation to the refund of fees how is it to be determined whether half of the work has been completed, and who is to make that decision?
The question of the amount of a refund in the case of a withdrawal has been carefully considered. ANZFA has advised that in practice few applications are withdrawn in the middle of the full assessment stage, the usual practice being for them to be withdrawn at either the start or the end of that stage.
Regulations have provided for a refund to be made if an applicant withdraws their application during the full assessment stage. The work required to be undertaken by ANZFA during the full assessment stage will vary for applications depending on their complexity. The halfway stage is generally reached when drafting instructions are first issued to the legal team to prepare a draft standard or draft variation. ANZFA will err on the side of caution and provide a 50% refund to the applicant if they withdraw their application before formal drafting instructions are issued, as this point would signify a point in time at which significant assessment has been undertaken but which significant work is still required to be undertaken to finalise ANZFA's assessment.
As yet, ANZFA has not issued any invoices to applicants under these Regulations. When it does, the applicant will be provided with detailed administrative information on ANZFA's charging, refund and appeal arrangements.
Sections 12B and 15A of the Act make provision for ANZFA to have the power to refund charges. The ANZFA Board recently delegated the power to make decisions in relation to refunds to the Managing Director and General Managers of the Authority. In practice, it will be the relevant General Manager who will be the decision maker on the amount of a refund and that decision will be based on advice from the Project Manager.
In the case of a dispute occurring over the decision, the normal line of review will take place as it would for any other decision made by ANZFA in relation to application matters. 
In relation to an application for reconsideration of a decision as provided for in new regulation 14, should there be a time limit within which the applicant must apply for reconsideration of a decision, and should there be a time limit in which ANZFA must reconsider the matter?
I have considered this matter and ANZFA has given me an undertaking to amend the regulations to include a 28 day time limit for the lodging of an application for reconsideration of a decision under subsections 13A(2) and (3) of the Act. The regulations will also be amended to require ANZFA to notify the applicant of its reconsideration decision within 28 days of receipt of the application for reconsideration.
How has the estimate of anticipated costs been arrived at?
The fees have been set based on years of experience in dealing with applications. The applications that ANZFA receives can vary from very simple, involving half a dozen pages, through to highly complex ones accompanied by anything up to 40 boxes of supporting scientific evidence. Following extensive discussion with all stakeholders including major industry bodies, it was agreed that in the interests of fairness and simplicity for all involved, a five-tier charging structure applying equally to all applicants, including small business, be established. It was agreed that this would represent the most efficient and cost effective method of recovering costs.
The charges include all salary and associated administrative costs related to varying a standard or having a product or process approved through to the final decision making stage.
There will be regular reviews of the level of fees to ensure they are appropriate and also to ensure that any improvements in the efficiency of applications processing is passed on to applicants.
Yours sincerely

Dear Parliamentary Secretary
Thank you for your letter dated 24 October 2000 responding to the Committee's concerns with the National Food Authority Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), Statutory Rules 2000 No.122.
The Committee considered your response at its meeting today and welcomes your undertaking to amend the Regulations to specify a time limit for the lodging of applications for reconsideration of decisions and to notify applicants of the reconsidered decision. 
The Committee, however, has a continuing concern with the term `without delay' in relation to payment of the application fee in subregulation 8(2). The Committee is of the view that this creates uncertainty with the operation of this provision and that advising the applicant by letter of the need to pay without delay may not be the most satisfactory means of achieving its intended purpose. It may therefore be more appropriate to specify a time limit for the payment of the application fee, thus giving applicants clear guidance and certainty as to the requirements of this provision.
The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible as the last day for the Senate to resolve this notice of notion to disallow is 15 sitting days after 9 October 2000. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 2 November 2000 in which you advised that the Committee remains concerned with the wording of subregulation 8(2) of the National Food Authority Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 122. 
I wish to advise that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) has undertaken to amend the regulations in order to deal with the Committee's concerns. 
The cost recovery system that is implemented by the amendments to the regulations is somewhat unusual in that most applications processed by ANZFA will not be charged for. Charging of fees is limited to two kinds of applications: 
1. those that will confer an exclusive capturable commercial (ECCB) benefit on the applicant;  
2. those where an applicant chooses to pay a fee in order to have processing of a non-ECCB application commence earlier than would otherwise be the case based on its place in ANZFA's work plan. 
A result of this system is that ANZFA must first receive and then assess whether an application falls into the ECCB category and then advise the applicant before the applicant can know whether charges (and what amount) will be levied. In the case of a non-ECCB application the applicant will be advised as to the scheduled start date of the application according to its allotted place on the work plan. Places are allotted on the work plan to give priority to matters involving public health and safety and other matters are then listed in the order in which they are received. This currently means that non-ECCB applicants are usually advised of a due date two to three years in the future. 
In both of the above cases, applicants cannot know whether they are required to pay a charge or whether they have a choice to pay a charge until after their applications have been lodged.
This situation differs somewhat from the norm as, generally speaking, in situations where a fee is required to process an application of some kind, the usual practice is that the fee is paid upon lodgement of the application; the consequences of not paying the fee being that the application is not accepted or that processing cannot proceed until the fee is paid. As noted above, this approach does not fit neatly in the case of ANZFA's limited cost-recovery system.
Subregulations 8(2) and 8(3) have been drafted to work with paragraphs 13A(2) and 35(1) of the Act to deal with this situation. Subregulation 8(2) is a provision that deems an application fee to have accompanied the application once the application fee has been lodged. The words ""without delay"" were chosen to be purposely flexible, as stipulating a time period could encumber an applicant who was unable to meet the deadline for some reason. It may also have unintended flow on effects, including perhaps an obligation to re-lodge an application if the deadline for payment were missed. Specifying a time period would also raise questions regarding extensions of time, criteria for extensions, appeal rights for applicants if an extension were not granted, etc.
Notwithstanding the above, ANZFA accepts that the regulations could be improved by removing the ""without delay"" statement and remaining silent regarding a time limit for payment of the fee. As it is clear from the legislation that processing of an application for which a fee is payable cannot progress until the fee is paid, the necessary arrangements regarding payment of the fee could be handled administratively.
ANZFA has given an undertaking to amend the regulations consistent with the above.
I trust that such action will remove the uncertainty that has been of concern to your Committee, whilst retaining a framework to allow fair appropriate handling of applications subject to fees.
Thank you again for your comments and interest in this matter.
Yours sincerely

CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Parliamentary Secretary
I refer to the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 2), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 48, that implement recommendations relating to the therapeutic goods Advertising Code.
The amendment made by item 12 of the Schedule - which inserts new subregulation 5Q(5A) - permits the Secretary to the Department to delegate his or her power to withdraw approval for an advertisement to the chairperson of the Complaints Resolution Panel. However, new paragraph 42ZCAI(4)(a) permits that Panel to recommend to the Secretary that the latter ""withdraw the approval of [an] advertisement"". The Committee considers that in the light of that latter paragraph, the power of delegation in new subregulation 5Q(5A) may not be appropriate. 
New regulation 9, substituted by item 16 of the Schedule, permits the Secretary to the Department to publish orders either in the Gazette or on the Department's web site. The Committee suggests that publication in both places might be preferable, as it would provide for wider dissemination of the orders.
New paragraphs 9R(1)(b) and (2)(b), inserted by item 18 of the Schedule, create an offence of publishing generic information about therapeutic goods if the publication ""contains a claim that has not been verified"". However, the regulations do not specify by whom the claim must be verified, nor the standard of proof to be applied to that verification. As they stand, it would appear to be relatively easy for the publisher of such information to avoid liability for that offence. 
New Subdivision 2 of Division 3 of Part 6 of the Regulations, inserted by item 32 of the Schedule, regulates the procedure of the Complaints Resolution Panel. However, that Subdivision does not impose any time limits on the Panel in complying with that procedure. The Committee considers that the Panel should be under a statutory obligation to proceed with each step of dealing with a complaint within a specified time.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible to allow it to finalise these matters.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 8 June 2000 in which you raised four issues concerning the operation of the Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations 2000 (No2), Statutory Rules 2000 No 48.
The Committee raises the appropriateness of permitting the Secretary to delegate the power to withdraw approval of an advertisement to the Chairperson of the Complaints Resolution Panel (reg 5Q(5A)), when it is the Panel that recommends to the Secretary the withdrawal of approval (reg 42ZCAI(4)(a)).
The Government accepted the recommendation of the Advertising Code Review that there is a need for speedy sanctions for breaches of the Code. The action of withdrawing approval of an advertisement is an effective way to prevent the reappearance of an advertisement that breaches the Code. As this is an administrative power, it resides appropriately with the Secretary. However, there will be circumstances where it is necessary to stop an offending advertisement as quickly as possible after the Panel has upheld a complaint about it. By delegating the power to the Panel Chair, it can be exercised quickly by a delegate who is fully aware of all the relevant facts and  considerations. A decision of the Panel to withdraw an approval is ultimately subject to independent review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as well as the Federal Court under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.
Regulation 9 permits the publishing in the Gazette or on the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) web site of orders permitting the use of restricted or prohibited representations. The Committee would prefer orders to be published in both places to allow their wider dissemination.
Regulation 9 orders are of key relevance, primarily to the medicines and advertising industries required to comply with such orders. These industries increasingly are utilising electronic media in transacting their business (indeed, applications for marketing approval of complementary medicines is mainly effected through electronic lodgements), and allowances for publications to be effected on Government web sites is consistent with the Government's policy encouraging e-commerce. These industries have web access, as do consumer organisations and many public libraries. Bearing this in mind, and considering that the additional cost in administrative time and publishing fees must be borne ultimately by industry, I do not consider that every order needs to be published in the Gazette. However, I will ask the TGA to publish orders in the Gazette where the orders deal with significant public health and safety concerns.
I agree that the offence in regulation 9R about ""a claim that has not been verified"" could be improved. The changes that deal with generic information raised the most interest and debate with industry. The TGA has agreed to monitor the changes during a transition period to identify areas that require refining. This will be one of those areas.
The new regulations do not impose time limits on the Complaints Resolution Panel. The Panel meets regularly at six week intervals, although is prepared to meet more frequently should the need arise, through increased numbers of complaints for example. On average, it deals with complaints within a six week interval. Complaints come from both. industry and consumers, and both groups are represented on the Panel. Neither group pressed for time limits during the course of the Advertising Code Review. I would prefer the TGA to monitor the performance of the Panel during the transition period. I will introduce time limits if the Panel does not deal with complaints in as timely a manner as the TGA, industry and consumers would like. 
I am happy to provide more details on any of these issues if the Committee wishes.
Yours sincerely

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-11-27,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:
Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2000
Horticulture Marketing and Research and Development Services (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2000.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bills
The Bills will create a new horticultural service company that will operate under the Corporations Law to provide marketing and research and development (R&D) services to the horticultural industry, replacing the current Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation HRDC). The new company has been requested by the horticultural industries in order to provide better synergies between marketing and R&D programs, to build, competitive and profitable horticultural industries and to provide efficiencies in program administration.
Reasons for Urgency
The horticulture industry has unanimously supported the proposal and requested that the new horticultural company be established by the Government as a matter of priority, to become operational as soon as possible.
The industry is concerned that ongoing uncertainty about the company start-up date will cause disruption to existing beneficial programs and potential loss of key staff. Delay in the start-up of the new company would give rise to costs as the new horticultural services company is also expected to provide annual administrative savings of $600,000 per annum by merging the two existing statutory corporations, the AHC and the HRDC into a single company.
The proposal has been fully evaluated by the Government. In order for the new company to meet its start up date of December 2000, legislation will need to be introduced and passed in the 2000 Spring sittings.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-11-27,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely, a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 762.
I do so because this is an important motion. 
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Listen to the Labor Party cackle. Listen to them getting into defensive mode over there. The fact is that the Labor Party in some way—and they will be able to explain this, I am sure—feel defensive of the American Democrats, who are so much in the bailiwick of the multinational corporations. Maybe we will learn something about the Australian Labor Party through the contribution we are about to hear from them. Nevertheless, Ralph Nader, who is a consumer advocate, has the measure of the multinational corporations and has done for two or three decades now. He has come along and said, `Enough is enough.' As far as the big parties in America—and in Europe and, no doubt, here in Australia—are concerned, he is saying, by inference, that it is time the big parties were taken on and we ended this duopoly of two parties who are economic rationalists, who tug their forelock to the big corporations, and who base their election campaigns on donations coming from those corporations. This is all to the detriment of the average citizen, to the detriment of democracy, to the detriment of an equal society—which Labor used to stand for—and to the detriment of the global environment. My motion states that we congratulate Ralph Nader because he has offered the United States and the world honourable options to economic rationalism. Do Labor not support that? I suspect they do not.  
Ralph Nader has offered an end to the corporate override of democracy and to the two-party duopoly bedevilling Western democracy. I have no doubt that Labor, like the coalition opposite, will be opposed to that. The motion calls for the Senate to recognise Mr Nader's integrity, which has won nearly three million US votes. Who would oppose that? The motion calls for an end to the corporate donations to political parties in Australia. Here we are getting closer to the mark. No doubt both big political parties, which get about $30 million in each inter-election period from the corporate sector and other sectors, will be opposed to that component. Let's hear it if that is what they have a cavil with, because that bombs democracy; that corrupts democracy. This donation system bends democracy against the interests of the average citizens, who are not the donors and who lose out because of the influence that goes to the big parties through that system.
Finally, we are asking for endorsement of Mr Nader's assertion that the two parties need a jolt. Millions of Australians support that. They believe that there is less and less to be seen from the big parties on crucial issues like social justice, the environment, the administration of democracy and the need for separation between the wealthy influential corporate sector and the parliament. As Ralph Nader would say, the debate is clearly about who rules in our society. Is it the stock exchange, supported by Labor and the coalition, or is it the parliament, which the Greens are saying ought to have the pivotal place, ought to be the pilot of democracy? More and more that is not the case. It is interesting that it is the Labor Party that is howling objections in this debate. That is because the Labor Party feels vulnerable to this, because it touches a raw nerve, because the Labor Party no longer stands for the ethos that gave rise to its parliamentary power at the start of the last century. 
We are facing a world with great opportunities but also great dangers. I would rather this world be in the hands of a democratic system, a multiparty system, a system of one person, one vote, one value, rather than the current system, which is completely nobbled by the power of the corporates. Good on Ralph Nader. I have invited him to come to Australia to attend the global conference of the Greens next year. I guarantee that he will take on any of these people in debate at that time. They have nobody to ask here. This scion of Green politics will be welcomed back in this country. He was here 20 years ago. At that time, he had a great deal to say for the benefit of all Australians about democracy, the environment and workers' rights. Labor should be lauding a potential return visit.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I was listening intently to hear Senator Brown tell us why this motion was urgent. I am still waiting. I have not heard one word uttered by Senator Brown as to why the rest of today's business—including seven of Senator Brown's motions on the environment which were about to be debated—should be pushed down the order so that we can deal with a motion to congratulate Ralph Nader for apparently getting the Republicans into power. That is what Senator Brown is asking the Senate to do. Even if Senator Brown did not have seven motions on the Notice Paper today—and I see he is still having difficulty keeping a straight face—which dealt with his pet issue, the environment, the Senate could not have listened to his contribution and thought, `Yes, this is urgent; this is a matter we have to deal with.' 
Only today we have heard that it is likely that Mr Bush will succeed. I would have thought the anathema of the sorts of policies that Senator Brown pursues—and, indeed, that Mr Ralph Nader pursues—will be delivered by the Republicans under George Bush. The appropriate time to debate that is when we debate this motion. When Senator Brown has general business no doubt he will bring this matter on as a matter of priority over every other issue he has and we will debate it. We will have a great deal of difficulty, Senator Brown, in controlling our speakers list because I can assure you that there will be a great many senators on this side of the chamber who will want to contest the proposition that we ought to congratulate Ralph Nader. Sure he is entitled to stand, but the reality about his standing in the American electoral system is that the result that he may have achieved will be an anathema to the supporters of the environmental movement in the United States. However, we will debate this matter when Senator Brown brings it on and we will be listening intently. But nothing he said today in any way indicates that this matter is urgent.

I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to make a few remarks in relation to the report. 
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
It is my pleasure to table this report Conviction with Compassion: A report on freedom of religion and belief, which is the product of a long process of inquiry into freedom of religion and belief dating back to the committee's original reference of April last year. The committee acknowledged at the outset that religion is an intensely personal issue for many people and that questions of religious freedom are by nature complex and intricate. Because of that complexity, inherent challenges are faced by any body inquiring into the provision of freedom in relation to religion.
The committee's view—well stated in previous remarks—is that rights such as freedom are universal and indivisible human rights and that any violations of human rights are to be condemned. Thus any violations of freedom of religion and belief are violations of fundamental human rights. The committee was asked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to undertake an inquiry into Australia's efforts to promote and protect freedom of religion and belief. In fact, I think the chair of the subcommittee, Mr Peter Nugent, has in another place noted that the members of the committee themselves have a range of religious beliefs and views, as well as a range of views on notions of freedom. I see that Senator Schacht is in the chamber at the moment, and that was certainly the subject of a discussion at one particular hearing at which we were both present. So this report is reflective of the range of views on the matter which are then further represented across the spectrum of those who participated in the inquiry either by providing submissions or appearing as witnesses. I think it is important to thank in this place those Senate colleagues who participated either in part or in full in this inquiry—in particular Senators Bourne, Ferguson, Harradine, MacGibbon, Reynolds, Schacht and Synon—and to acknowledge the role and work of the committee secretariat, in particular Patrick Regan.
The committee received over 100 submissions ranging from those of individuals, religious scholars, theologians and religious organisations here in Australia. We received submissions from government departments and agencies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. Importantly, the committee held five public hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and heard from nearly 50 witnesses during the course of the hearings. The committee has made nine recommendations that broadly cover the issues of promoting religious freedom and also deal with the issue of cults. In brief, those recommendations firstly support the work of HREOC in the area of religious freedom and invite a response from government to the commission's 1997 report on religion and belief. They also call on Australian governments to ensure maximum protection of religious belief within their jurisdictions and, to that end, greater uniformity of human rights law and practices in Australia. The committee encourages the Commonwealth government to promote all human rights, specifically that of freedom of religious belief in our dealings with other nations. We note and support the work of the UN and other organisations, including the Centre for Democratic Institutions and the Australian Agency for International Development, in this area. Finally, the recommendations proposed include the convening of an interfaith dialogue to formulate a set of minimum standards for the practices of cults. 
What is important to take out of the inquiry and the report is a commitment to freedom of religious belief as an indivisible human right. In Australia, we are exceptionally lucky to have a society that is both accepting of, and home to, a number of religious organisations and systems of belief. And so through the process of migration, combined with what is essentially an egalitarian community, Australia is able to count amongst its population virtually every world religion. From Christianity to Hinduism, to Islam, to Judaism and many others in between, Australia's towns and cities represent an enormous diversity of religions. In my own area of activity in Greater Western Sydney there are representatives of all these religions and more, whether it is the Hindu temple on the Great Western Highway or the synagogue on Victoria Road. As you drive around Greater Western Sydney, the diversity in that reasonably compact area is representative of the greater diversity throughout Australia. Of course, our rich cultural heritage also includes indigenous Australians who have their own long-held traditions and very different notions of spirituality and sacredness from other organised religions. Providing freedom of religious beliefs across the globe has to also take into consideration the beliefs of indigenous peoples as well as those more establish traditional churches.
In preparing this report, and indeed in thinking about some remarks that I might make today, it is impossible not to reflect on the inherent challenge that is associated with the coexistence of various religions that often have conflicting beliefs. Domestically, we are fortunate to have a very harmonious society in this regard, where largely religious conflict is minimal—although differences do exist, and we see those unfortunately perpetrated in some of our cities by people who persist in expressing racial or religious hate in various ways. It is not the case with all of our neighbours. I think the parliament is in a unique position to demonstrate to the nation—and this is a personal view—the breadth and diversity of religious practices in Australia and to indicate that that diversity is a positive thing for our nation and should be addressed in an inclusive manner. I often think that we have a great chance in this place and in the activities we carry out more broadly to demonstrate to members of faiths other than Christianity how important they are in the huge melting pot that is this nation.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I rise to support the resolution on the tabling of this report Conviction with compassion: a report on freedom of religion and belief by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I am a member of the Human Rights Subcommittee of that committee which prepared this report for the full committee—and it was then adopted by the full committee without dissent. I must pay a tribute to, in particular, the chair, Mr Nugent, and the deputy chair, Mr Hollis, for their work on this committee. Because of my duties as shadow minister for veterans' affairs I was not able to be as active on the committee as I would have liked, but I would like to make a couple of comments. The first is to take note of a section of the report on page 130 titled `The right not to believe'. Although the inquiry was about freedom of religion, there were a number of submissions from organisations such as the humanist societies of Queensland and Victoria and the Rationalists Society of New South Wales, all of which pointed out that the right not to believe is just as important as the right to believe and that freedom of religion is to be taken as a protection of the freedom not to believe in any religion.
I am very strongly of that view myself. As a member of the Labor Party's informal caucus committee of humanists, I very strongly believe that that is the case. Often in societies where freedom of religion is trampled upon, it is those who are dissenters, those who are not true believers of the orthodox religion, who are the first to suffer the penalties and discrimination when religion is tied in with the power of the state in a theocratic system. Therefore humanists have a very strong view that the separation of the state as a secular organisation from any form of official religion is a fundamental issue for democracy in our society. It is unfortunate, in my view, as a humanist, that some of the worst abuses of human rights occur where a nation has adopted a particular religion as the official religion of that country and then imposes that view on everybody without the right to dissent or have a different view.  
These are the issues that arose 400 or 500 years ago in Western Europe at the time of the Reformation and the Renaissance, when there was the break-up of what you might call the monopoly the Roman Catholic Church had over the whole of Christianity. That was followed by the religious intolerance of Western Europe for the next couple of hundred years, when dreadful wars of religion were fought over who was the true believer in the following of Jesus Christ. Awful atrocities were committed not only in Europe but also in the new colonies of the New World. We still see today, in different parts of the world, people willing to kill each other on the basis of which religion they follow and which religion they wish to impose on others. We will not get full human rights and a democratic system adopted across the world where the right of the individual to dissent is guaranteed until all countries separate their religion from the government so that there is a complete separation.
We in Australia are lucky that we do have that separation, and it is a real strength of our democracy. It is a real strength of our democracy that people such as me, as a non-believer, with many others in our community—nearly 30 per cent, according to one calculation from the census—do not have to believe and can continue to participate in the full public life of Australia without restriction, without discrimination. That is a real strength of Australian democracy.
This report is very timely in that it deals with that issue. It also is a very good summary of the history of religious belief and rightful religious freedom as well as a summary of a number of the issues dealt with around the world at the moment. It makes some recommendations. A number of them relate to activities of appropriate areas of the United Nations and I certainly would urge the government to take note of those recommendations and adopt them. They strengthen our role as a democracy, as a country with a strong commitment to human rights, to further that advance in the rest of the world. I look forward to the government's response and I hope it very seriously treats these recommendations with the weight they deserve. In view of the fact that the reference was given to the committee by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I look forward to the response from the government. Again, in conclusion, I congratulate the members of the committee; the secretariat of the committee, especially Mr Regan for his work as secretary; and the people who made the nearly 100 submissions to the committee during the inquiry. I commend the report not only to the parliament but also to the Australian public.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2000-11-27,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present a report of the committee entitled Conviction with compassion: A report on freedom of religion and belief, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, minutes of proceedings and submissions received by the committee. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to make a few remarks in relation to the report. 
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
It is my pleasure to table this report Conviction with Compassion: A report on freedom of religion and belief, which is the product of a long process of inquiry into freedom of religion and belief dating back to the committee's original reference of April last year. The committee acknowledged at the outset that religion is an intensely personal issue for many people and that questions of religious freedom are by nature complex and intricate. Because of that complexity, inherent challenges are faced by any body inquiring into the provision of freedom in relation to religion.
The committee's view—well stated in previous remarks—is that rights such as freedom are universal and indivisible human rights and that any violations of human rights are to be condemned. Thus any violations of freedom of religion and belief are violations of fundamental human rights. The committee was asked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to undertake an inquiry into Australia's efforts to promote and protect freedom of religion and belief. In fact, I think the chair of the subcommittee, Mr Peter Nugent, has in another place noted that the members of the committee themselves have a range of religious beliefs and views, as well as a range of views on notions of freedom. I see that Senator Schacht is in the chamber at the moment, and that was certainly the subject of a discussion at one particular hearing at which we were both present. So this report is reflective of the range of views on the matter which are then further represented across the spectrum of those who participated in the inquiry either by providing submissions or appearing as witnesses. I think it is important to thank in this place those Senate colleagues who participated either in part or in full in this inquiry—in particular Senators Bourne, Ferguson, Harradine, MacGibbon, Reynolds, Schacht and Synon—and to acknowledge the role and work of the committee secretariat, in particular Patrick Regan.
The committee received over 100 submissions ranging from those of individuals, religious scholars, theologians and religious organisations here in Australia. We received submissions from government departments and agencies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. Importantly, the committee held five public hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, and heard from nearly 50 witnesses during the course of the hearings. The committee has made nine recommendations that broadly cover the issues of promoting religious freedom and also deal with the issue of cults. In brief, those recommendations firstly support the work of HREOC in the area of religious freedom and invite a response from government to the commission's 1997 report on religion and belief. They also call on Australian governments to ensure maximum protection of religious belief within their jurisdictions and, to that end, greater uniformity of human rights law and practices in Australia. The committee encourages the Commonwealth government to promote all human rights, specifically that of freedom of religious belief in our dealings with other nations. We note and support the work of the UN and other organisations, including the Centre for Democratic Institutions and the Australian Agency for International Development, in this area. Finally, the recommendations proposed include the convening of an interfaith dialogue to formulate a set of minimum standards for the practices of cults. 
What is important to take out of the inquiry and the report is a commitment to freedom of religious belief as an indivisible human right. In Australia, we are exceptionally lucky to have a society that is both accepting of, and home to, a number of religious organisations and systems of belief. And so through the process of migration, combined with what is essentially an egalitarian community, Australia is able to count amongst its population virtually every world religion. From Christianity to Hinduism, to Islam, to Judaism and many others in between, Australia's towns and cities represent an enormous diversity of religions. In my own area of activity in Greater Western Sydney there are representatives of all these religions and more, whether it is the Hindu temple on the Great Western Highway or the synagogue on Victoria Road. As you drive around Greater Western Sydney, the diversity in that reasonably compact area is representative of the greater diversity throughout Australia. Of course, our rich cultural heritage also includes indigenous Australians who have their own long-held traditions and very different notions of spirituality and sacredness from other organised religions. Providing freedom of religious beliefs across the globe has to also take into consideration the beliefs of indigenous peoples as well as those more establish traditional churches.
In preparing this report, and indeed in thinking about some remarks that I might make today, it is impossible not to reflect on the inherent challenge that is associated with the coexistence of various religions that often have conflicting beliefs. Domestically, we are fortunate to have a very harmonious society in this regard, where largely religious conflict is minimal—although differences do exist, and we see those unfortunately perpetrated in some of our cities by people who persist in expressing racial or religious hate in various ways. It is not the case with all of our neighbours. I think the parliament is in a unique position to demonstrate to the nation—and this is a personal view—the breadth and diversity of religious practices in Australia and to indicate that that diversity is a positive thing for our nation and should be addressed in an inclusive manner. I often think that we have a great chance in this place and in the activities we carry out more broadly to demonstrate to members of faiths other than Christianity how important they are in the huge melting pot that is this nation. What is a greater challenge, though, is for that harmonious nature to extend beyond our borders. In concluding, I would say that would then go further to ensuring that religious freedom as a human right is truly indivisible.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-11-27,"—The bill we have before us at the moment, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2000,  is quite a complex bill. It will be no shock to the Senate that it is about taxation. I can see that Senator Calvert on the other side is paying very learned attention. In my experience over the years, he has followed tax bills with an intensity only exceeded by 30 or 40 other senators in this place. I think that is fair to say, isn't it, Senator Vanstone?
—I think you are being unkind, Senator Ray.
—But I have to say he knows more about it than I do, so I am not being that unkind. These complex bills, however, are an increasing pattern before this chamber. I think we just have to face it that time and time again tax bills are going to be changed, and constantly changed. It is something we have to live with. Every time I get my tax done by my accountant, I always get a beaming welcome. I am really asked to do two things: keep the tax changes coming and concentrate on changing superannuation on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis, and their kids will continue to go to private schools and attend Derby Day races. I am not going to extend my speech any longer for the risk of embarrassing Senator Cook with my expertise. It is an old political lesson that you never outshine the frontbench, so I would like to invite Senator Cook to address the chamber.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-11-27,"—Let me say straight off that Senator Ray is welcome at any time to outshine the frontbench, something that I am sure he is ably capable of doing and would have done on this occasion had he completed his speech. I accept the compliment and am prepared to proceed. The legislation before us is Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2000 and this is the resumption of the second reading debate on this bill. This bill involves a number of changes to taxation legislation in Australia. Among the five major changes are additions to the list of community organisations which will become gift deductible entities—that is the formal term—and donations to them of $2 or more will be tax deductible. There is a list of some seven or eight new organisations about which I will speak in a moment.
Secondly, there are amendments to the pay-as-you-go, or PAYG, system for trusts. Thirdly, there are corrections to the rewriting of tax legislation into simple English. When that was done last time, some simple mistakes were found in the text and this bill remedies those changes. I will not be saying anything more about those other than what I have just said. Fourthly, the legislation is correcting the operation of capital gains tax provisions and, fifthly, there is a single technical correction to the legislation which denies tax deductibility for bribes paid to public officials, and that goes to enforcement issues. We are not opposing any of these measures although we have, through the agency of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in particular, paid special attention to the fourth change that I mentioned: correcting the operation of capital gains tax provisions. We are not going to oppose any of these changes and we are now satisfied that the changes to the capital gains tax provisions do not weaken the tax base. The pay-as-you-go amendments, which I have referred to, are further evidence of the government rolling back—and I use that word explicitly—its own tax package by continuing to make further amendments to that package.
Let me start with the gift deductible entities. The income tax law provides that donations to eligible bodies receive tax deductible status. Eligibility is determined by whether or not the recipient body is an endorsed gift deductible entity. The Treasurer issues a release from time to time that certain bodies will have gift deductible entity status and these names are then consolidated into an amending bill. This bill proposes that new bodies be granted gift deductible status and, as I have said, there are about seven or eight that are now to be listed. I do not propose to read out their names; they are in the legislation. However, I do propose to refer to one of them, which is the Community Disaster Relief (Sydney Hail Storm Assistance) Fund. This is a fund to which people donate to ease the difficulties created by the hailstorm that unroofed parts of Sydney and created difficulties not only for householders but for local governments. People's donations to this fund will of course now be able to attract the tax deduction.
My reason for singling this out, though, is to point to another major disaster in Australia. The overflow of the Namoi River in New South Wales has flooded Tamworth, Walgett and Wee Waa and has created, as I have read in one account, at least $600 million worth of losses to rural producers in that area. I mention this because it is in some senses, although not entirely, analogous to the Sydney hailstorm assistance fund. I also mention it to say that, should the minister deem it appropriate to list any body similar to the hailstorm relief fund for the Namoi River overflow for the damage to Tamworth, Walgett and Wee Waa that might attract any donations, Labor would be prepared to support that legislation and would encourage that such a step be taken. It is a major rural catastrophe, one that inflicts considerable loss on private land-holders and one that requires remedial works to be done, not the least of which is flood mitigation. It seems that, if the soliciting of public support for the massive amount of clean-up that is necessary were to occur, donations to that end should attract the tax deduction.
As to the PAYG amendments, the system of PAYG is the new integrated system of income tax instalments and withholding taxes, the system that is claimed by the government to be simpler but is in fact highly complex. The system has already been subject to many hundreds of amendments. This bill proposes even more, this time in the area of instalments paid by certain trusts. In keeping with past practice, Labor do not oppose these changes. This ensures that Labor cannot be blamed for the complexities and the growing body of red tape that businesses face in Australia. We are supporting this legislation because the government wants it, the government is asking for it and the government will have to accept the responsibility for the complexity that it introduces. However, we should strongly point out that this is in fact the government proposing yet more roll-back on its tax package. Ironically, the second reading speech introducing this legislation admits that the aims of the amendments are to `simplify the way beneficiaries work out their instalment income and minimise the compliance burden on the trustees of those trusts'. This is precisely what roll-back is about: making the new tax changes simpler. 
With regard to the capital gains tax provision, the explanatory memorandum describes these changes as consistent with the intended policy and it claims there is nil financial impact. However, at least some of these measures change the rules to benefit taxpayers; therefore, there is in fact some cost to revenue. That is not quantified. Maybe it is not quantifiable, but it is important to note that there is some cost to revenue as a consequence of the CGT changes.
There is a variety of highly complex and technical changes, some of which are difficult to evaluate on the limited information that has been provided. Non-controversial ones include correcting the unintended double counting of assets and correcting an inaccurate heading. We took the view of recommending that this be inquired into by a Senate committee and that has been done. The other provision that I refer to under this heading is the discount capital gains. The business tax reforms, the BTRs, introduced a new system of taxing capital gains based on 50 per cent of the nominal gain being taxable for individuals where an asset was held for at least 12 months rather than 100 per cent of the inflation indexed gain. I could go on and talk about this but it is something that the Senate committee examined.
I have already explained the rewrite corrections. The bribery provisions relate to Australian businesses overseas not claiming tax deductions for business related bribery. In certain economies, they might pay bribes to public officials. We do not believe that that should be tax deductible. We do not endorse or encourage that view. We believe that trying to make the economies and the rule of law in developing countries work is a fundamentally important thing, and corporate responsibility is such that Australian companies should not be engaged in any bribery activities. That is a wider issue, but these provisions mean that if they were doing this they now cannot claim it as a tax deduction.
That is a quick summary of what this legislation is about. As I have said, we are not opposing it. However, I would like to take the opportunity this afternoon to move an amendment to the bill. I believe this amendment has been circulated in the chamber.
—That is correct, Senator.
—I move the following amendment to the second reading motion:
At the end of the motion, add:
		""but the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households and calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001"".
These words would be added after the motion `That the bill be now read a second time'. In moving it and now speaking to it, can I say that this is quite an important amendment. For the last two weeks, I have spent the entire time—apart from the two days I was in Canberra for estimates—in regional Australia as chairman of the Australian Labor Party's petrol price review committee.
—It's not serious.
—This is a very serious inquiry. This chamber will recall that I took the opportunity some time back to move that the Senate should conduct an inquiry into petrol pricing. Nonetheless, this chamber, with the numbers of the government and the Democrats, ill-advisedly voted down the idea that there ought to be a Senate inquiry into petrol pricing. As a consequence of that decision, the Labor Party decided, `If the Senate's got it wrong, we'll get it right—we'll conduct our own inquiry.' As a consequence, I have spent the last two weeks, as I said, travelling throughout regional Australia—sometimes in capital cities, sometimes in the country—receiving, with my colleagues on the inquiry, submissions on petrol pricing.  
The first thing that I should say about that is that anger in Australia, outside of this building, is white-hot about the higher petrol prices that people are having to pay. The story that the government puts is that it is not its fault; it is all the fault of the Arab oil sheikhs and OPEC limiting production and therefore pushing up prices. It is not a story that is accepted in whole as the total explanation for why oil and petrol prices at the pump—and LPG and diesel prices—are so high in Australia. The government should heed these remarks because the government is virulently attacked in regional Australia because it has made a tax windfall gain out of the higher prices.
It is particularly ironic that, although the Prime Minister announced at 11.30 this morning a package of proposals for building new roads in Australia—partly to answer the criticism that this government has received because of higher petrol prices—most people in country Australia do not accept a road building program as being any sort of answer to the higher petrol prices they are paying. Let me cite an independent authority that we in the Labor Party would not often refer to in this context. The National Farmers Federation today put out a statement welcoming the roads expenditure, the $1.6 billion to be spent over the next four years on improving roads, but also demanding in very strong terms that the government freeze the indexation of petrol prices which is due on 1 February. That sentiment, the freezing of the indexation of petrol prices due on 1 February, is widely shared throughout regional Australia. The citizens of this country are keenly aware that the government has made a windfall gain out of the higher prices.
The people of Australia are also resentful of the fact that they are constantly told that that is not true. They were constantly told this by none other of an authority than the Treasurer, who blandly looks down the lens of every television camera pointed in his direction and says, `But excise has not gone up.' No-one is fooled by that. Excise is indexed on a six-monthly basis, and in the last six months it has not gone up. The excise amount has remained the same. The next indexation of excise is due on 1 February. What has gone up is the price of petrol, and what has gone up as a consequence is the GST rake-off by virtue of that increase in price. 
It is simple arithmetic. If you apply 10 per cent to a higher price, then that 10 per cent is worth a greater value than 10 per cent applied to a lower price. As a consequence of higher petrol prices, the government is taking out of the pockets of Australian motorists more GST revenue than it had anticipated. That is not the only area of windfall gain either. We all know that the resource rent tax, which mirrors international parity pricing, has been a windfall area for the government too. No lesser authority than the Australian Automobile Association, in evidence before the committee in this building on Thursday a fortnight ago, took their time to tell us that, on their objective and impartial calculation, the windfall gain to government revenue as a consequence of higher petrol prices was no less than $A1.5 billion this calender year. It is not surprising that I see now that the roads package is valued at $1.6 billion but over four years. So there is a bit of jiggery-pokery going on here. If what the AAA, the body that represents all of the motoring organisations in each of the states, says is correct—that is, in one year there is a rake-off of $1.5 billion—then no doubt in the debate that will ensue over the next few weeks there will be an attempt by the government to pretend that $1.6 billion over four years is somehow fair compensation. Of course, the truth is that the jig is up; people understand it is not fair.
During our inquiry, we asked witnesses, `Once we are able to establish what the total windfall is, do you want it handed back or should it remain in government revenue?' and the unanimous response was, `It should be handed back.' The next question to our witnesses was: `How would you like it handed back? Would you like it handed back in lower petrol prices at the bowser; would you like it handed back in more roads; would you like it handed back in lower rego for your cars; would you like it handed back in R&D expenditure on finding an alternative fuel to petrol, which might mean lower prices in the future?' More than three-quarters of the people who came before us said that they wanted it handed back in lower prices. It is true that local government authorities have come before us and said, `We would like these bridges built or that road repaired,' and there was some combination of `Handed back,' `In lower prices,' and `In new roads,' but overwhelmingly people said, `We want it back in lower prices.' 
When the government put this current budget to bed in May this year, they calculated fuel prices on the basis of an exchange rate for the Australian dollar at US60c and the barrel price of crude oil in the world at around $US20 a barrel. We know the exchange rate is around US52c and the price of crude oil is around $US30 per barrel. Those differences mean a huge windfall gain for the government, and it is coming out of our pockets. 
The reason they wanted it handed back is particularly evident in the country. In country Australia, you fill up your petrol tank more often than you do in the city, you travel further and you do not have access to public transport either. We know that tax in the form of the GST on petrol is a tax on distance: the further you are from a capital city, the more the petrol price is. And because the GST is a percentage tax, the more the petrol price is, the higher tax you are paying in GST off the higher base price for the petrol. People in country Australia know that they are being discriminated against. The amendment which I have moved to the second reading should be unanimously supported in this chamber.
I know that many honourable senators on the other side, government senators, mind opposition electorates in the hope that they might win those seats in the next election. One of them I ran into in McMillan was from Senator Troeth's office, trying to win McMillan, which is a marginal seat with a wafer-thin majority in favour of the Labor candidate. There is absolutely no doubt, having had hearings in McMillan, that most of those people will be voting for a relief on petrol. This is an opportunity for Senator Troeth to vote with those constituents she wants to impress. It is also an opportunity for the rest of the government senators in this chamber to vote for lower petrol prices by carrying this resolution. (Time expired)
Sitting suspended from 6.28 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-11-27,"—Earlier in the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2000 I thought I heard Senator Cook say, `Here we have yet more amendments to the GST and the new tax system regime.' Frankly, it is the opinion of the Australian Democrats that the government would be delinquent if it was not bringing forward amendments to the tax legislation. I cannot see that any piece of our legislation, even our venerable old Constitution, is a perfect document. I would be glad to see as many amendments as possible, including to the Constitution. I certainly do not draw any criticism to the government as a result of having a tax laws amendment bill before us.
The bill contains some 35-odd pages and has a very thick explanatory memorandum. It amends income tax deductions for gifts by adding eight foundations or funds to the list of organisations, donations to which are tax deductible. It also amends pay-as-you-go instalments legislation for certain beneficiaries of trusts. The bill will require a beneficiary of a trust who has a fixed interest in the assets and the income of a trust to include in the beneficiary's instalment income his or her share of the income of the trust for the period. The bill corrects errors in capital gains tax small business concessions. The bill corrects the capital gains tax provisions, rewritten as part of the taxation law improvement project. The bill makes some minor technical changes and improves integrity measures. 
None of those changes or provisions require much commentary. There were no significant concerns raised when the bill was considered by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and neither the Labor Party nor the Democrats submitted a minority or supplementary report. Indeed, in the way that the Senate deals with these matters, the bill could well have been dealt with on a non-controversial basis since there are no amendments before us, other than the second reading amendment which could have been taken on the voices anyway. However, here we are debating it in normal Senate time. I am not being critical of that. Any tax bill is worthy of detailed and proper consideration if that needs to occur. However, the Democrats can say little more about this bill than that we intend to support it. Therefore, it may be appropriate in my speech in this second reading stage to deal with Senator Cook's second reading amendment, which might be the only controversial thing we have before us. Senator Cook's amendment has two parts. The first part reads:
... but the Senate notes the serious impact of the taxation regime on Australian households ...
I presume that means the Australian taxation regime. That is an extraordinarily vague statement. In some respects it states the bleeding obvious—if I may use a colloquialism. I would like to know what taxation regime anywhere in the world does not have a serious impact on the households in the country. It would be a strange taxation system which had a minimal or a negligible impact. What serious impact is Senator Cook referring to? I am not so naive as to think that he is referring to positive impacts. I suspect he is referring to negative impacts. Is it a reference to price increases as a result of the imposition of the goods and services tax? Is it a reference to the GST generally or just on petrol? Is it a reference to our income tax regime and the fact that bracket creep impacts upon people's disposable income? Is it a reference to the fact that taxation takes a goodly slice of everybody's pay packet?
To disagree that the taxation regime has a serious impact on Australian households would be a strange thing because the alternative to that would be to suggest that the taxation regime has a funny, comical or trivial impact on Australian households. We all know that is not the case. We ask the question: what taxation regime does not have serious impacts on the people who are the subject of it? Perhaps Senator Cook should have been far more careful with his words. If he meant `negative' he should have had the words `serious negative impact'. `The taxation regime' covers every aspect of taxation which is in our tax regime, so he would need to qualify it. What aspects of the tax regime does he refer to? Which parts of the total system, much of which his government had a hand in, does he refer to?
In summary, when you look at the first line of Senator Cook's amendment, it is simply too vague for us to be able to understand what is meant by it. One wonders why the second part follows on from that. 
The second part of the suggested second reading amendment does deserve more serious attention since the first just states the obvious. The second part of the amendment reads:
... and calls on the Government to remove the effect of the GST from the fuel excise indexation adjustment in February 2001.
That would occur on 1 February. The difficulty you have with a specific call on petrol is that the indexation affects fuels—not just petrol but all fuels. It affects cigarettes, it affects beer and it affects spirits. I believe it is unfortunate that it does not affect wine, because I have always believed that we should have wine on excise and not on WET, but let us move on from that. Indexation was introduced by the Labor Party. Indexation of excise is a direct inflationary mechanism. Any serious policy person in the economics field will tell you that it passes on an inflationary effect and that it continues that inflationary effect. It is obvious; it is mathematical. I am one of those who would have argued and would still argue against that as a policy. But I now recognise that it is so embedded in our taxation system and it is so interlinked to other mechanisms and measures within our social security, taxation and administration system that it would be very difficult to change that system. So we have indexation courtesy of the Labor Party. It is a continuing policy supported by the government. So it is a bipartisan policy, certainly, and it might even be a multiparty policy. 
There is no suggestion from Senator Cook that indexation should not be continued. What he has suggested is that the fuel excise indexation adjustment, but only that portion of it occasioned by the GST spike and not by other forms of inflation, should be withdrawn. We ought to know what the costs of that would be and what the effect would be. The figures that I have been able to calculate are that the overall cost would be about $350 million, which I suspect is about 0.8c a litre. The Democrats, amongst others, have said that they believe the government is shy on its promise to cut petrol excise by about 1½c. Those of you who heard the Prime Minister's remarks on Sunday would know that he acknowledged that that was a claim against the government. Anyway, if you did what Senator Cook suggested and removed the GST spike from the fuel excise indexation adjustment on 1 February, it would have the effect for consumers of a cut of about $350 million, which I think would be about 0.8c a litre. Those are my figures. I suggest that, if you were to pursue such a policy, you could not do it in isolation. You could in theory but it would be wrong in policy terms.
So what would happen if you took the GST indexation spike off all the excises that are up for grabs? I think the figures move to about $600 million as a cost, of which about $50 million would be for beer, about $30 million would be for spirits and about $170 million would be for tobacco. We also have a government promise on the beer side. I remember that the brewers said they would be prepared to cop about $200 million worth of tax increases with the new tax system, and they reckon they were copping about $467 million. Then the Treasurer in his budget this year adjusted excise, in which we had a part in terms of our submissions to the government, by about $150 million, and beer was the beneficiary by about $120 million. So if we take that figure of $467 million that the brewers felt they were being copped with and knock off $200 million, it leaves you with $267 million. If you knock off another $120 million, you have around $147 million left. If you take out the GST index spike you would be down to a figure of about $100 million, which people were quarrelling about for beer. So you go some way to fulfilling what is known as the beer promise.
So you might kill some of those birds with one stone, both on the petroleum side and on the beer side. Spirits, however, would get a nice $30 million free kick, so you must consider whether you think that is worth while. They would not squeal; they would be happy. Then there is tobacco. Strangely enough for a party that is vigorously anti-tobacco, I think—and I suspect my colleagues also recognise the fact—that tobacco is pretty fully priced right now. The idea of raising the price of tobacco is to limit consumption. Again, anyone with an economic background knows that, in marginal cost theory, once you get to a certain price, an additional price increase will not result in a change in consumption behaviour in the way you want to see it happen. In other words, if you loaded tobacco with any further price increases, I suspect that demand would fall by such a great amount that you would actually earn less revenue. So if you gave tobacco a free hit of $170 million by withdrawing it from the GST indexation spike, it might not be that bad in policy terms but it is an awful lot of money to give away.
Let me go back to the heart of what I'm discussing here. I think it is a legitimate policy proposal that the GST indexation spike on excise should be considered for removal. But I do not think it is a legitimate policy proposal that it should only be for petrols. Either you do it for the lot or you do not do it for any. If you do it for the lot, you have to be aware of what the effects and benefits are. From a consumer point of view, it is a $600 million benefit, all told. From a policy point of view, in terms of beer and petrol it might well be meeting some of the government's promises. In terms of spirits and tobacco, it is just a free kick. It is for the government to decide what their policy shall be on GST indexation spikes, but if the Labor Party are going to offer up this second reading amendment as a serious policy suggestion, I would have expected to hear costings from Senator Cook, and I would have expected to hear a rational argument as to why this proposal is constrained in this way and what benefit it would deliver to the community. Unless I missed it—and I might have missed it—I did not hear that from Senator Cook. 
—Senator Sherry will do it.
—Perhaps Senator Sherry will. Sometimes Senator Sherry is very much the politician but at other times he is very much the policy man. So he might deliver a policy speech. We will hear. I do not think, therefore, that this is a serious amendment. That is my quarrel with it. I have tried to analyse it and react to it in a way which gives it some numbers and perhaps some rationale, if it was framed in another way. I am not committing the Democrats—certainly not at this stage—to one policy or another. All we have told the government consistently is that we think they are shy of 1½c on petroleum products excise in terms of our understanding of their promise, and we think they are shy on the beer side. Addressing the GST indexation spike might in fact address that particular problem but, for the rest, there we are.
I presume that people listening to those remarks would have got the hint by now that I am not going to support the second reading amendment. I think the first line is nonsensical, and I think the second line is deficient in a policy sense. Perhaps Senator Sherry will be able to make some sense out of it which I have not yet been able to.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-11-27,"—The amendment we are considering on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2000 is perfectly sensible. I did not hear all of your contribution, Senator Murray, but I will come to some specifics on the amendment shortly. 
The legislation covers a variety of areas of tax law. It covers new additions to the list of community organisations which will become gift deductible entities. For example, donations to them of $2 or more will be tax deductible. It covers further amendments to the pay-as-you-go system for trusts, the rewriting of tax legislation into simple English, corrections to the operation of some capital gains tax provisions, and a technical correction to legislation, which denies tax deductibility for bribes paid to public officials. So there is a wide range of amendments that impact on a wide range of the Australian tax base, and the Labor Party—as I am sure has been indicated—will be supporting the legislation.
On the issue of the Commonwealth's tax base, which the legislation deals with in part, I draw to the attention of the Senate the Mid-year economic and fiscal outlook that was released during the past fortnight.
—I have raised this issue with you, Senator McGauran, and I am going to raise some issues with  respect to the National Party's performance on petrol taxes a little later. I would like to draw the Senate's attention to page 168, table F2. I have remarked on previous occasions that the Liberal-National Party government is a high tax government. It is high tax not just in terms of total revenue collected—and the legislation we are considering is important to maximising revenue collection—but also in respect of percentage of gross domestic product. Of course, the legislation we are considering adds to tax collection.
Table F2 shows that, in the 2000-01 financial year, tax as a percentage of gross domestic product will be 21 per cent; the following financial year it will be 21.2 per cent; the following financial year it will be 21.1 per cent; and in the final year for which projections are given, 2003-04, it will be 21.2 per cent. That is tax as a percentage of gross domestic product—which is the most important relative comparison. Now, let's look at the last three or four Labor years. In 1991-92, tax as a percentage of gross domestic product was 21.5 per cent; in 1994-95 it was 22.2 per cent, and in 1995-96 it was 22.8 per cent. Of course, the Labor government was defeated, as I am sure we are all aware.
At first glance, this table shows tax as a percentage of gross domestic product, for this year and following years— 
—Senator McGauran is interjecting. I am glad he has interjected; it is unruly but I will take the interjection. He is saying it is fine. It is less: 21 per cent. However, it does not include the GST revenue, which we know is a Commonwealth tax, a Commonwealth head of power. It is collected by the Commonwealth and passed through to the states, but it is Commonwealth revenue. The Commonwealth collects it. Indeed, the Liberal-National Party are proud that they collect a GST. They might be giving it to the states, or at least a large part of it. Why isn't the goods and services tax revenue in this figure? If it were included, as it should be—
—It is too early.
—No, for 2000-01 and 2001-02. It is not in there for those out years, Senator McGauran. If we include what are considered to be relatively conservative estimates, in the first year of collection it would be $26 billion. That is your estimate, Senator McGauran, and the Treasurer's estimate. That would take tax as a percentage of gross domestic product to between 23 per cent and 24 per cent, which is almost certainly an increase on the last couple of years of the Liberal and National coalition government and certainly an increase over and above the last three or four years of the Labor government. I want to draw the Senate's attention to the deliberate exclusion of the GST revenue. I do not know whether Senator Murray regards this as honest or not in terms of the charter of budget honesty. How can you exclude GST revenue from—
—Where does it say it is excluded? You're saying that.
—Yes, I am saying that. It is true. If you were at the Senate estimates hearings you would have heard me quiz the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Evans. Treasury confirmed that it is not in the figures. This is a clear example of this being a high tax government. Whether you want to be a high tax government or a low tax government, there is a legitimate philosophical argument about the level of tax. But you say you are a low tax government when clearly, in trying to manipulate the figures by excluding the GST, you are not. But there are other reasons for you being a high tax government. Senator McGauran has been in the chamber when I have talked about the excise figures in Budget Paper No.1 for 2000-01. I think Senator McGauran knows these figures. I have read them out to the Senate before, and I do so again in the context of this debate. Before the recent increase in world oil, gas and diesel prices, the excise on petroleum products and crude oil in 1999-2000 was $11.419 billion. In 2000-01 the estimate is $12.968 billion—an increase of 13.6 per cent. 
In going back to the midyear economic review, it was interesting to note that we have had revealed, at least in part, the additional revenues as a result of a number of taxes. The midyear economic review reveals that the resource rent tax—which, in this case, is based on the price of oil—has collected for the Commonwealth an additional windfall of about $½ billion. So we know that so far. But when you look at the midyear economic and fiscal outlook, you should try to find the GST revenue collected, particularly the GST revenue collected from higher fuel prices. GST is a percentage tax. A percentage on a higher base—a higher base coming about because of higher world oil prices—collects more revenue for the government. It might interest Senator Murray and, particularly Senator McGauran, to know that the Treasurer did say that he expected to release these GST collection figures in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook. But—surprise, surprise—the midyear economic and fiscal outlook was somewhat earlier this year than previous years and we did not get the figures. So we could not ask Treasury what the revenue would be from the GST collected on petrol, diesel and gas.
—Or anything else.
—That is right. I suspect that we will not be able to question Treasury on these figures until after the budget is handed down next year. I would argue that this has been done quite deliberately to hide the second aspect of the windfall that the government has collected using the GST on higher fuel. In Senate estimates last week, Mr Evans, the head of Treasury, to the embarrassment of the Prime Minister and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, who was there, did admit that the GST was the culprit with respect to at least part of the increase in petrol prices around the country, particularly in rural and regional areas. My colleague Senator Cook said to Mr Evans: 
So my point is then that now we are paying more in tax when the price goes up. That is true, isn't it?
Mr Evans replied, `Yes.' We do know that when the price goes over the high 80s or low 90s the GST, being a percentage tax, collects more tax than the excise. Senator Murray quite rightly referred to the third area of windfall that the Commonwealth has collected through the GST. That has been in short-changing, particularly people in rural and regional Australia, with the reduction in the excise and then the addition of the GST, and collecting more tax. It obviously varies depending on where you live in Australia, but it has particularly hurt people in rural and regional Australia.
A number of statements have been made by members of the government in recent times arguing that you cannot reduce fuel taxes, that you cannot do anything in this area because of world oil prices. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have argued that, if you reduce the budget surplus—which we now know is higher than initially predicted in the budget earlier this year—interest rates will go up or there will be an even worse run on the dollar than we currently have.
—Are you arguing that?
—No, that is your argument, Senator McGauran. That is the Prime Minister's and the Treasurer's argument. Today we had a roads announcement—over a billion dollars over three years.
—Do you oppose that?
—Just listen, Senator Alston, to the argument. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are saying, `If we increase expenditure, if we eat into the budget surplus, there will be a further decline in the currency and interest rates will go up.' On that argument, how could you announce today a roads package that will eat into the surplus?
—So you are opposed to it?
—No, I am saying that your argument is inconsistent, Senator Alston. I am pointing out the inconsistency of the argument advanced by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. We know from the midyear economic and fiscal outlook that the surplus has increased. So I would argue that there is sufficient surplus revenue projected to spend money on roads, defence or reducing taxes on fuel. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are putting a false argument. I have not checked the currency value today. Did it go down after the roads funding was announced? Did interest rates go up? I have been in the Senate superannuation committee for the last seven hours, so I do not know. I suggest we check to see if the Prime Minister's and Treasurer's views are correct. We know that the Liberal and National parties are touchy about the issue of fuel prices. I am a member of the Labor Party's fuel inquiry.
—I hear Senator McGauran scoff. Actually, we were in your part of the country, Senator McGauran. We were in rural and regional Victoria.
—We were! I understand Senator McGauran's office is now in Benalla. It was in Collins Street in Melbourne for 10 years, which I have mentioned occasionally. We were in your area, Senator McGauran. We had some hearings, and 15 to 20 people turned up to give us their views on fuel prices. Sure, people accept that a major contributing factor to higher fuel costs has been the higher world fuel prices—that is accepted; and the lower dollar has increased the import costs—that is certainly true. The extent to which the lower dollar is a reflection of government economic policies is a debate for another time. Let us put that to one side. However, what is really aggravating people in rural and regional Australia and in outer suburbia is that they believe that they were short-changed with respect to the GST and the reduction in excise. Senator Murray has touched on it, and I touched on it earlier. I would argue that they have been short-changed and I know Senator Murray shares that view, but they believe they have been short-changed. Secondly, those that understand the relationship between the excise being indexed know that it moves with inflation every six months and that it will move next February. They also understand that, because of the GST, inflation is higher than it would normally be. So why should the GST—a new tax—lead quite directly to an increase in CPI and to a further increase in excise on the fuel? Why should that happen? 
Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer—who avoids answering the questions we put to him—says, `We are just doing what Labor did.' It is your government's GST. You have introduced it. It is your policy; it is your problem. Certainly, in the past Labor has indexed excise but it has also recognised that there were special circumstances. In 1988 it made sure that, because of special economic circumstances, the increase in general excise should not be equivalent to the CPI. In fact, a 50 per cent discount applied. So the Labor Party, where special circumstances called for it, have done that in the past. That is the issue that our amendment, moved by Senator Cook and spoken to by Senator Conroy, goes to. I think it is quite simple, it is quite effective, it is quite logical and consistent in policy terms, and it is important that the Senate pass this amendment. I think we have passed a resolution with respect to beer excise and the short-changing of beer drinkers in this country—and you have touched on that, Senator Murray. So why should we not pass a resolution with respect to the GST and fuel excise indexation from February next year?
This government has to deal with the legitimate concerns of Australians about higher fuel prices. It is not just petrol; it is also diesel and gas. We received, I might say, very angry submissions and evidence from a wide range of people in the community. I notice Senator McGauran is leaving the chamber. They did not have much to say about the National Party that was very complimentary. In fact, it would be unparliamentary for me to repeat some of the things they said about the National Party. This was coming from people who normally support the National Party. I think the Liberal-National Party government is making a grave mistake if it believes that it can ignore the legitimate concern, which I have at least outlined in part in this debate tonight, about higher fuel prices. The public believe—and they believe rightly—that they were misled with respect to the GST offsetting the excise. The government has not done that. It has more than offset it; it has increased fuel prices in some areas of Australia. They do not see why the GST spike, as it is known, should be included in the indexation of excise next year. It is important that the Senate makes its view about this issue very clear. Through some sort of disallowance process regulations, we will be debating this issue in the Senate next year.
If the Democrats do not want to support lower fuel costs, if the Democrats do not want to hold the Prime Minister to his word—and Senator Murray has confirmed that he believes that the Prime Minister has short-changed the Australian community—if the Democrats do not want to do that, so be it. We will remind the public that it is not just the Liberal-National Party that is responsible for higher fuel prices; it is also the Australian Democrats. I have refrained from that criticism so far, Senator Murray. If you join forces with this government, which has been gravely misleading on this issue to the Australian public, then you are the ones who will effectively provide for an increase in fuel excise when that indexation occurs next year.
Just one other point before I conclude: the government are getting very sensitive at the moment. We noticed that during the last two weeks apparently some anonymous minister accused farm leaders of being whingers. You know a government is in trouble when it starts abusing people like that, particularly its own supporters. It is not whingeing to complain about the short-changing of people in rural and regional Australia with respect to the tax arrangements on fuel. People in rural and regional Australia should not be treated contemptuously like this by the Liberal-National Party. The National Party have not stood up for people in rural and regional Australia for many years. They just do what the Liberal Party tells them, and that is why there is so much disillusionment in these regions about the position of the National Party. So I hope the amendment before the Senate is supported. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-11-27,"—The Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000 is the first aged care bill to come before this parliament in almost a year. We rarely see from this government legislation relating to aged care, and the serious and complex nature of problems in our aged care system suggests we should be seeing more. Since the 1997 aged care so-called reforms fiasco, I think there has been a deliberate policy to try to keep aged care off the agenda, and a decision by the government not to tackle the many problems that have emerged since the passage of the previous bill. That is why we have the failure in this bill to take up the many issues that need addressing in terms of both the legislation and the problems of the sector.
I welcome the opportunity to debate the issues contained in this bill. They are important issues, and I will come to the detail in a moment. But there are a number of important aged care issues that this parliament should be debating, and most of them are missing from the legislation before us. Labor is eager to engage in debate and work to improve the system, because we are committed to providing quality care for our frail aged. I find it sad that the government does not seem to share that commitment but continues to operate a policy of damage control through inaction in aged care.
Back in 1998 the government responded to concern about the financing of the aged care system. The sector was under pressure, providers were telling the Minister for Aged Care that funding arrangements needed to be reviewed, and a reference was finally given to the Productivity Commission. The commission took its time to undertake detailed analysis and make recommendations, and the minister took her time to read the report. When the report was finally made public in January 1999, the commission's recommendations were totally ignored. They are still being ignored today. 
The Productivity Commission proposed a new funding model for aged care based on a national benchmark of care. This will be the funding model of the next Labor government. We have made a public commitment to its development and implementation, because our primary concern is the provision of quality care in aged care. A national benchmark of care will set minimum standards on the level and nature of care to be delivered to all older Australians in residential aged care facilities. Residents and families will know what level of care they should expect to receive, providers will know what level of care they are required to provide, and the funding they receive will enable them to meet those standards. Funding based on a national benchmark of care is the way forward. It will be Labor's way. Sadly, the government remains committed to funding arrangements in which care is the balancing item after everything else is paid for, not the guiding principle. 
I wish the bill before us tackled that major issue of linking Commonwealth funding with the cost of providing care. It does not. I wish the bill responded to the Productivity Commission's calls to review the adequacy of indexation arrangements and the funding of the costs of workers compensation. It does not. I am pleased that the Productivity Commission is a tenacious creature, as the weight of its message has not diminished with time. New modelling from the commission estimates the cost increase in aged care for 1999-2000 to be 3.4 per cent, clearly greater than the indexation of 1.4 per cent provided under current funding arrangements. In 2001, accreditation will impose an additional one-off cost of $200 million on the sector, but no extra funds will flow from the government. The corollary can only be further pressure on care standards. Unlike the government, Labor will address issues relating to funding, because we believe that inadequate funding is hostile to high quality care. The government seems to believe that accreditation is a necessary and sufficient condition for quality care. Necessary, yes. Sufficient? Not on your life.  
Clearly the bill before us does not tackle funding problems; nor does it attack waiting times. The frail aged in our community and their families want reassurance from the minister that when an aged care assessment team finds that an elderly relative requires residential care a bed will be available. They do not want to be told that they will have to wait for three months. They do not want to be told that the only bed available is away from their family and friends. They do not want to be told they will have to wait in an acute care bed, placing further pressure on the public hospital system.
The minister does not like to talk about such things, but the figures show that these are the outcomes that her aged care system is delivering. As at 30 June this year, there was a national shortage of 9,700 aged care beds relative to the government's own targets. There are many regions across the country where shortages are chronic. The minister is fond of claiming that Labor's analysis has ignored the beds provided for in the year 2000 allocation round. I think there are three points to make there: firstly, the allocation will not make up the shortfall; secondly, the bed licences have yet to be assigned to providers, who then have up to two years to get those beds up and operational; and, thirdly, there will be more growth in demand in the meantime, so the demand will again outstrip the supply. The minister's allocation does not offer relief to families struggling to find a bed now. It does not offer relief to families who visit facility after facility and leave not with a place but with their name added to another waiting list.
In 1996-97 the average wait for a nursing home bed was 31 days. Three years on, it has blown out to 55. Access to residential aged care has declined every year under the Howard government and is now at an all-time low. But the bill before us does not address this; it does not even engage with the issue. A responsible government would have grabbed this chance to make changes, because things are only going to get worse come 1 January 2001, the date by which all residential care facilities must be accredited or lose Commonwealth funding. The standards and accreditation agency told last week's Senate estimates hearing that up to 50 facilities may close by New Year's Eve. These include the 31 facilities that have failed accreditation. As I said earlier, the lag between a facility closing and the licences becoming operational elsewhere can span two years. The expected closures will thus create significant bed shortages over an extended period. The department also confirmed that there are already 1,800 transfer beds that are not currently operating. How will the government ensure continuity of care for residents at a time when we have long waiting lists, not surplus beds? The minister continues to keep her own counsel on this critical problem, which is very much of her own making.
It is important to ask why we are in a situation where we are talking about the need for crisis management and contingency plans. The answer is the inability of this government and this minister to manage change in a competent and timely manner. Let me remind the Senate that the legislation dealing with the accreditation process was rushed through parliament in December 1998. We rushed because the government said it needed to get accreditation on the road, yet the minister took nine months to develop a simple accreditation fee schedule and did not sign off on enabling regulations until September 1999. As a result, the aged care sector and the accreditation agency are now under enormous pressure just five weeks out from the 1 January deadline. The last-minute rush is proving problematic for the facilities that have failed or will fail accreditation. Time will not permit second efforts, and more closures will result than need to have been the case. I am sure the residents in these facilities will lament the nine months lost to ministerial indecision. While Labor has supported accreditation as a means to promote quality care, the mismanagement of its introduction has indeed been lamentable. The government has seemed incapable of achieving any of the outcomes to which its reforms aspired. The government's aged care system has not delivered quality of care to all residents nor adequately protected their rights. The government also planned to raise substantial income from aged care fees but has failed there too. The reforms introduced in 1997 were designed to generate savings. This was a primary, albeit unstated, goal. The income tested fees introduced in March 1998 were meant to have raised $250 million by June 2000, but when 30 June arrived only $30 million was raised. Similarly, the government aimed to have 27 per cent of residents accorded concessional status. They now have over 50 per cent at that status, at an annual cost of $300 million. The minister likes to trumpet this as evidence of additional spending on aged care. It is more accurately cast as evidence of her failure to manage the aged care budget. 
The bill before us tinkers at the edges of aged care at a time when there is a clear need to address what are very serious and systemic problems in the aged care system. The problems have been identified and the government has received sound advice on how they may be addressed, yet the government prefers inactivity. Before I go on with the details of the bill, let me quickly summarise what it does not contain and what it will not do. It will not introduce a funding system based on a national benchmark of care, as recommended by the Productivity Commission. It will not ameliorate growing shortages of aged care beds in many regions and the flight from aged care of qualified nursing staff. It will not ensure proper monitoring of care standards. It will not implement the Commonwealth Ombudsman's recommendations to repair the complaints resolution scheme. It will not set out how the government will ensure continuity of care for old Australians resident in facilities that fail to meet the accreditation deadline of 1 January. In failing to address any of these issues the government has done nothing to rebuild the sagging confidence in our aged care system at a time when there is increasing community concern. 
This bill serves to highlight the difference in approach between the government and Labor in relation to aged care and responding to providers who fail to provide adequate care. The government is very much focused on a punishment through economic sanctions approach, and it has been applying that particularly since the failure of the Riverside intervention. I think the minister is too scared to again go down the path of closing a nursing home. Labor's focus is very much on the care of residents. The government seeks to enforce care standards by imposing financial penalties on providers. Labor's priority would be to enforce standards by intervening immediately to ensure the proper management of resident care. After all, it is the care of those residents that are at risk that is the government's primary responsibility to respond to. It now seems clear to us that the government's approach does not work. Cutting the funding to a substandard nursing home is not the way to get care standards to improve. It failed to work at Riverside; it failed to work at Kenilworth; and it has failed in a number of other instances which I could detail. Getting independent professionals into the nursing home to ensure that the care of residents is managed properly should be the government's and this parliament's priority. There needs to be scope for immediate intervention when residents are found to be at risk. That is what the sector has been calling for; that is what the Labor amendments will do. Our amendments will be adding to the minister's powers to ensure she has every power at her disposal to make sure residents get proper care.
Despite our concerns over the effectiveness of the government's punitive approach, we will not be attempting to block their amendments. We will give them all the powers they think they need to protect residents, and more. While the government's amendments are more of the same, our amendments we think will for the first time allow the government to intervene immediately to appoint an administrator where a nursing home has breached care standards and put residents at risk. We do not get many chances to amend the Aged Care Act. It is therefore important that the Senate takes this opportunity to make at least some improvements to the government's failed system to ensure that care standards are better maintained. That must be our priority here. I want the minister to be satisfied that this bill provides her with all the powers she needs to ensure that nursing home residents are properly cared for. In terms of the specific provisions in the bill, the minister has claimed that the first amendment contained in her bill will: 
... allow the Department to give notice to residents and relatives of action to be taken which would result in the revocation of approved provider status and bed licences ... and the probable closure of a home. It will also give the power to revoke bed licences, as beds become vacant. 
Labor agrees totally with the need to provide notice to residents and families about the closure of a facility. On 20 June this year, I tabled a letter from a family of a resident evacuated from Riverside. That letter graphically describes the confusion and distress suffered by that family. They were not informed about what was happening and were not consulted about their relative's care. Unfortunately, this bill comes nine months too late for that family. 
The proposed revocation of beds is yet another financial penalty imposed on providers who fail to provide care. It is more of the government's current approach to maintaining care standards which have so clearly failed in a number of instances. Nowhere is that failure clearer than in the case of the Kenilworth Nursing Home in Victoria. Like Riverside, it had a history of failing care standards. Reports on the nursing home in April 1999, and in March, September and October of this year, all identified serious risks to residents. Unlike Riverside, on this occasion the government decided to impose financial penalties on Kenilworth in an attempt to enforce care standards. It is now clear that this approach has simply left residents in that nursing home at serious risk for a period of over 18 months. Those risks continued throughout the government's range of penalties being applied to that nursing home. A report from the standards agency confirms that the penalties recently imposed on the nursing home actually contributed to the risks faced by residents. This is not an acceptable outcome.
The Kenilworth Nursing Home provides a powerful argument for the minister to reconsider the government's failed approach to enforcing care standards. It is important to note that the powers the minister is looking forward to in this bill—the revocation of places as they become vacant—is exactly the same penalty as that imposed on the Kenilworth Nursing Home. This bill is more of the same. What the government has not done at Kenilworth is to intervene to ensure the proper protection of residents. After four separate serious risk reports, dating back to April last year, residents remain in the care of a provider who has repeatedly failed to meet care standards. Labor's amendment would allow an administrator to be appointed within three days to manage the care of residents in the Kenilworth Nursing Home and in any other nursing that is breaching care standards. As a result, the provider would no longer have any role in the care of the residents. Labor's amendment reflects calls from across the aged care sector for a different approach to ensuring care standards. It seems that everyone but the government now realises that the current arrangements have failed to meet the prime criteria: ensuring the proper care of the residents in the home.
The bill also includes new provisions aimed at people who might be considered unsuitable. In her media release announcing the bill, the minister states that this amendment:
... will allow action to be taken against approved providers who have `key personnel', including company directors, who have been convicted of an indictable offence, are of unsound mind or become bankrupt.
What the minister did not say was that under the existing legislation there are already provisions on the suitability of providers and key personnel. The main change contained in the bill is to shift the responsibility for checking personnel suitability from the department to individual providers. As a result of this legislation, providers will be required to effectively police the suitability requirements of the act and will be liable for hefty fines if they fail in that responsibility. This is interesting, given the government's record on this issue. 
In a Senate estimates hearing on 23 May this year, the department indicated that it had received allegations in May 1998 about an approved provider who had a conviction for an indictable offence. The department then admitted that it had not bothered to investigate that allegation until December 1999. Apparently, it had been put on the file and forgotten about. As at the May 2000 hearings, the department had still not ascertained the truth of the allegations it received in May 1998. If the department was subject to the provisions now being introduced, it could be argued that it had not taken all reasonable steps to check the background of the provider concerned and, therefore, would be liable for a fine of up to $33,000 a day. On my reckoning, the department would owe about $24 million over the last two years on its own criteria. This failure to check the background of a provider is not an isolated case. The Ombudsman, in his report on aged care, noted the inadequate procedures to ensure that such checks were carried out. Having categorically failed to fulfil its responsibilities in relation to this issue, the government is now proposing that the responsibility be shifted to providers: `If we can't do it, we'll get you to do it for us.'
Submissions to the bill inquiry raised serious concerns about the actual implementation of these provisions which will require providers to assess the soundness of a person's mind and potentially disqualify them from a managerial role on the basis of this assessment. The government has not addressed the concerns raised about this section of the bill. To date, the government has not properly consulted with the aged care sector over these provisions, nor fully explained to providers what they will be required to do as a result of the bill. Labor will be moving an amendment which will require the government to go away and consult with the sector as to how these provisions are to be implemented and to come back with a regulation detailing what providers will be required to do. That will give the Senate the power of disallowing the regulation if required, which will act as a check on the government to make sure that it has done the consultation properly and has a system that will work and meet the objectives set for it.
In conclusion, this bill serves to highlight the government's failed approach to aged care and the need for some alternative approaches. Under the government's system, residents' care always seems to be an afterthought. The Productivity Commission rightly noted that, under the government's funding system, residents' care is the balancing item. The commission criticised this approach as `inequitable and inappropriate'. The same could be said about the government's policy on imposing financial penalties on some substandard nursing homes. It has done nothing to actually force improvements in residents' care and there is evidence that it may have contributed to the problem. While Labor will not be seeking to block the government's amendments, we do not believe that they will be effective in ensuring that all residents receive proper care. For that reason, Labor are proposing their own amendments that will, for the first time, allow for immediate intervention to ensure the proper management of residents' care in substandard nursing homes. I hope that the government will find its way to support those amendments to ensure that we get a much stronger system and a much greater ability to ensure that the care of residents is the primary concern. Any reports of inadequate care should be met with swift and active responses from the government and it, as its priority, should make the residents' care the overriding concern.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-11-27,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000. This bill makes two relatively minor changes to the Aged Care Act. It provides some flexibility on how sanctions can be imposed against aged care providers and introduces additional provisions on the suitability of providers and key personnel in the sector. Regrettably, it does not address the shortage of beds in nursing homes and hostels in many parts of Australia and will not deliver extra nursing home beds to those areas where people are waiting for access to aged care. It also will not assist the large number of young disabled people inappropriately accommodated in nursing homes. There is widespread concern in the community that the government's aged care system is not delivering proper care to frail older Australians. These concerns are not just the outraged stories in the media; rather they extend to the failure to properly monitor care standards and act in a timely and responsive manner when problems arise. They also relate to delays in accreditation, unavailability of places and long waiting times. All of this serves to create a gnawing anxiety for older Australians and their families when it becomes inevitable that hostel or nursing home care is the only option. Even at that point, many elderly people are having to spend months in an overcrowded public hospital system while they wait for a place to become available, and in a facility which is sometimes not their choice. 
It is now only six weeks until the deadline of 31 December 2000 and there are still up to 50 facilities, with 2,500 beds, which have not been accredited. These amendments do nothing to alleviate the concerns of more than 2,000 residents and their families that they will be left without care after that date. However, it is pleasing to think that there will be no unaccredited, and presumably substandard, facilities remaining in operation by 1 January 2001. It is still our concern that accreditation could create a substantial shortfall of beds in this industry where there is already an undersupply of beds. Furthermore, the Australian Democrats are concerned that the intensive resource necessary to speedily accredit facilities by the end of this year may mean neglect of other functions, such as unplanned visits and quick response to complaints.
However, while I could spend time addressing what the bill does not do, I do note that the bill provides greater flexibility in the staged implementation of sanctions, and also legislates for notice of sanctions to residents and their families when the approved provider of a residential aged care service faces a withdrawal of approved provider status, the revocation of places or the evacuation of residents. In its present form the Aged Care Act is unclear about the capacity for a sanction to be deferred so as to allow its correction without the need for resident removal. We hope we will not again have to witness the distressing scenes of elderly Australians being transported en masse in ambulances from the Riverside Nursing Home earlier this year when the sanctions imposed forced its immediate closure. By providing a staged process for imposing sanctions on a care provider, and by providing for notice in writing to be given to residents and their families, all parties in the matter can be better informed and be better placed to take action.
The bill specifies that, where closure is the only option, the notice period is 14 days. There is a tension here: if the breach of standards is so grave as to warrant the most serious sanction of closure, clearly residents are at risk. The desirability of giving notice is not the most important factor in deferring a sanction in these circumstances. Rather, the rights and wellbeing of residents must be adequately protected during this process, when disgruntled providers may be less concerned with the provision of care than they are with maximising last-minute profits. It is difficult to see that 14 days notice will give residents much opportunity to consider their future, identify new facilities and relocate thereto, but it is better than no notice at all. On the other hand, I am concerned that the bill does not provide for the maximum period of deferral of the sanction. I trust that the greater the risk to residents, the shorter the time allowed for deferral, if any. 
It is at this point that I cannot turn away from the concern for residents. The Democrats have long pressed for the creation of quick response teams, or flying squads, if you like, to immediately go in and set things right where risks to residents are identified. And we are not just talking about administrators, although there is certainly a need there. We are also talking about hands-on medical staff whose sole concern is the health and wellbeing of residents. The quick response teams can be drawn from a pool of highly accredited existing industry professionals who act while the sanction notice period is in force. This will include medical professionals who can respond to the immediate medical needs of residents where this is the issue identified. By adopting the Democrat strategies, the community would have confidence that, while measures are being taken to admonish providers for non-compliance with their responsibilities, at the same time there is the ongoing provision of quality care to residents. For this reason the Democrats will move amendments to include medical professionals in the management of the facility where residents are at risk and where absence of appropriate medical treatment has been identified as an issue. 
The second major element of the bill is to exclude the introduction of the term of disqualified individuals, and require that providers ensure that key personnel are basically suitable to provide aged care in an aged care facility. Key personnel who have criminal convictions, are of unsound mind, have been convicted of an indictable offence or become bankrupt are clearly not appropriate people to provide services within an aged care institution. Aged residents must not be placed at risk because of the potential actions or omissions of people with executive, management, nursing and operational responsibilities within the organisation providing the care, and it is therefore appropriate that they be excluded by means of an array of sanctions.
The Democrats are concerned that the bill does not require that the term `of unsound mind' be given by a person qualified to make that judgment, nor does it require formal psychological or psychiatric examination. A diagnosis of a person's mental capacities relating to their fulfilment of duties in providing aged care services cannot be made by unqualified persons. In its present form, this element of the bill has no semblance of fairness or balance. For this reason the Australian Democrats will be proposing amendments requiring that such a determination can only be made by a registered medical practitioner. The requirement in relation to persons convicted of an indictable offence will require providers to undertake police checks and statutory declarations from key personnel in relation to the state of their suitability. While maintaining the suitability of personnel as critical, the Democrats are pleased to note that the operation of the spent convictions scheme in the Crimes Act, together with the capacity for discharge from bankruptcy, will operate so as not to preclude suitable individuals from taking up responsible positions. Likewise, the certification of unsound mind can be revoked by a medical practitioner once appropriate treatment has taken effect and the person no longer suffers from the condition.
It is pleasing to note from our own community consultations and the report of the Community Affairs Committee that the aged care industry generally supports the bill in principle. The industry endorses the strengthening of the situation of residents and their families by providing additional powers to deal with issues arising from non-compliance with standards by providers and, further, providers who do not comply with the delivery of care to acceptable standards. Industry members generally support the concept of measures other than forced closure and resident disruption. However, universally all express concerns over the impost on the sector in complying with these key personnel controls. I call on the Minister for Aged Care to direct additional funding to facilities to enable them to comply with these provisions.
The Democrats will be	supporting this bill because ultimately it is in the interests of aged Australians. However, we feel it does not go far enough in addressing community concerns regarding the aged care industry. In fact, the bill is quite tightly focused on two issues only. Firstly, the manner in which the sanctions are imposed is directed more to minimising adverse consequences for care recipients when sanctions are imposed and it seems unlikely to have a direct role in improving the quality of age care. The second focuses only on weeding out certain people from the system where their track record suggests they would be undesirable participants for quite specifically defined reasons.
We would have liked to have seen other improvements which could have been achieved by legislative amendments, as I said earlier. The bill does not deliver one extra nursing home bed to the many areas where people are waiting longer and longer to access aged care. The reality is that, with the ageing of the population and the growing number of people needing residential aged care, the government needs to allocate a significant number of additional nursing home beds in every region and every year.

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000. This bill proposes several much needed measures to reform the provision of aged care in Australia. While broadly supporting the bill, the opposition will move several amendments to strengthen its impact. We will be moving these amendments because the current framework is not working. It is not working because the government continues with the mistaken belief that all of the changes it has made to aged care over the past four years have been of benefit. They obviously have not been and the government needs to do more to address the situation. There is continual evidence right across Australia that the standard of aged care provided to the elderly is declining. Nursing staff have been marginalised and some operators are rushing out to make a quick buck. The situation is unacceptable. While we welcome the government's move to address some of the issues, it needs to go further.
Before discussing the particular measures of this bill and how it can be improved, it pays to look at the history behind the legislation. In 1997 the Howard government announced a radical plan to overhaul aged care in Australia. Part of the plan included the setting up of accommodation bonds that would have to be paid by a person entering an aged care home. That would have raised $400 million for aged care homes, money that was being syphoned off by the government. But it would have come at the expense of the elderly and frail who were needing to enter an aged care home. After a huge outcry, the government overturned the accommodation bonds decision but took the money out of the industry anyway. At the time it promised to implement what would be the toughest accreditation and inspection system the country had ever seen.
But what did we see? We saw a bungled accreditation system and no surprise inspections until this year. The agency did not conduct one surprise inspection until after the shocking treatment delivered to elderly residents of the Riverside Nursing Home in Victoria was exposed. Only then did the minister and the department deem it worthy to act. And what have they done since Riverside? The department has ordered a few more inspections and cracked down on a few providers during the accreditation process. Unfortunately, the situation has not changed for the better. There continue to be problems in the industry, endemic problems that are only going to be solved by more government action and more government money. This bill is a start to fixing those problems, but only a small one. It could go a lot further. There are far too many reports of mistreatment of elderly patients in aged care homes. That is totally unacceptable to people on this side of the chamber and totally unacceptable to the public at large. The government, by ensuring that the system works properly, must ensure that the community has the highest possible confidence in it. The community needs to be satisfied that the government is doing its best to regulate and investigate the provision of aged care in Australia. Unfortunately, the current system of checks and balances is not working properly. The community has lost faith in the system and it needs to be restored.
Today I want to provide an example of some of the treatment that is occurring every day in nursing homes across Australia. I want to relate a story about the treatment of one particular aged person in a nursing home. I will not identify the source of this complaint or any details that might identify that person, but his story is similar to those coming out of dozens of aged care facilities all around Australia. These stories should indicate to the minister and her department that the current approach is simply not working. Recently I was informed of a case involving a man in his early sixties. Several years ago the man had a major stroke that left him paralysed down one side of his body and unable to speak. Since then he has suffered several more minor strokes, effectively stopping any chance of partial recovery from the initial stroke. The man has some mobility and can move short distances with the aid of a walking stick. He does, however, have great difficulty using stairs. For several years after the first stroke the man's wife did her best to care for him and look after his needs. Recently she found that the effort was becoming too much, and the man was admitted to a Brisbane nursing home. 
As some of you may know, many stroke sufferers retain their full mental capacity after a stroke. But their alert minds are effectively trapped inside bodies that often do not allow them to speak, and they have difficulty with eating. Swallowing for a stroke sufferer not only is very difficult but can be life-threatening, and the person is confined to eating food that must be crushed and mashed. This person had been in the particular nursing home for several months until he was apparently removed from the home without any notice given to his family. The reasons for his quick removal are yet to become totally clear but apparently there was some form of heated dispute involving the man and a tea lady. Staff at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, where the man ended up, reported that apparently the tea lady at the nursing home had placed two very large, uncrushed tablets on top of the man's breakfast cereal. The staff at the nursing home had been expressly instructed a number of times that the man's medication had to be crushed and mixed with his food. 
After the incident, the man was apparently ejected from the nursing home and sent by ambulance to the nearest hospital. His family were not informed of his discharge. When his wife arrived to visit him, she found someone else in her husband's bed. Unfortunately, she jumped to the conclusion that her husband had died. After being told by staff at the nursing home that this was not the case, she started the task of trying to track him down. The man's family were then led on a chase halfway across Brisbane, being told different things by people at the nursing home and at the hospital. Eventually—several hours later—the man was found sitting alone in the hospital's emergency room. It is disgraceful that a person in such a condition could be discharged from a nursing home without their family being notified. These sorts of situations should not be allowed to occur.
There are many more serious incidents that the current system has failed to deal with adequately. In March this year, complaints arose about the investigation of deaths at the Gladstone nursing home Alchera Park. Two war veterans who had been living at Alchera Park died—one in 1997 and one last year. Just before they died, both men were treated outside of the nursing home for extensive pressure sores caused by extended periods of lying in one position. Doctors at the time were shocked that the condition of the men had been allowed to deteriorate to such a degree. Two other deaths at the home were also the subject of complaints by relatives.
After the issues at Alchera Park became apparent, the minister and the department were greatly criticised—and rightly so—because of their slowness in responding to complaints. In the past few weeks, the principal medical adviser to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Dr Graeme Killer, expressed his concern over how the issues at Alchera Park were investigated. The issues were not properly investigated until parliamentary and media pressure forced the minister to act. These issues are very serious. They go to the ability of aged care providers to properly ensure the health of their residents. The issues also go to the confidence the public has in the whole system. The Australian community needs to be assured that the government not only is watching but also will act on issues as they arise. 
The problems being addressed in this bill came to light because of the shocking mistreatment of some of the residents at the Riverside Nursing Home. That instance was the first time the government used a number of provisions introduced in 1997. Many of those provisions were found wanting. Under the current legislation, the government is unable to provide residents and their families with prior notice of a nursing home closure because the act requires that the revocation occur immediately. The lack of any notice and the general uncertainty experienced by families in the lead-up to the closure of Riverside contributed to their distress. The minister readily acknowledged this flaw in the act at the time. The government has also found that the current provisions relating to the approval of providers and their staff are flawed. Cases have been reported in the media where approved providers and staff have been convicted of various offences, including fraud. The government has not yet moved to withdraw the approval of any of these individuals.  
This bill addresses just two areas where problems have emerged under the government's Aged Care Act. There are other problems that also need to be looked at. We will address some of these in the amendments we move, but it is up to the government to demonstrate that it is committed to fixing all of the problems its legislation has caused. This bill introduces two main changes to the current Aged Care Act. Firstly, it allows flexibility in the implementation of sanctions. This would allow the department to provide up to 14 days notice of any closure or to specify that the closure is to happen gradually, as beds become vacant in the facility. The bill would also establish more detailed rules on the approval of providers and their staff and allow an individual to be excluded from the operation of a nursing home without forcing the closure of the entire facility. Under these provisions, approved providers will have to ensure that all key personnel are not excluded from working in the sector under the specified provisions. 
Our amendment would ensure that in cases where risks to residents are reported an administrator would have to be appointed within three days. Under existing legislation, the provider has three weeks to nominate and appoint an administrator. Our proposed amendment would also provide clearer powers to the administrator to ensure that they can actually improve care standards. The proposed amendment will truncate the current process for choosing and appointing an administrator where residents are found to be at risk. Under the current provisions, the provider has two weeks to nominate someone and then another week to appoint the person. The amendment would shorten those periods to just two days and one day respectively by establishing a pool of suitable administrators.
In Queensland, a number of residential aged care facilities are engaging in practices considered to be against the government's stated intentions of continuous improvement in the provision of aged care services. A number of residential aged care facilities have significantly increased staffing complements and improved their skill mix to achieve accreditation. There are reports that, following granting of accreditation, usually for three years, care staff's hours and skill mix are significantly reduced, with no identifiable change in resident profile. This is also seen in those facilities that are under sanction and have engaged department approved administrators for a period of up to two years.
There are several issues that need to be addressed by the department concerning these issues, including the following questions. What is the standard form of contract that the department uses when entering into an administration agreement with a provider in lieu of revocation of the approved provider's approval under part 2.1 of the Aged Care Act 1997? What are the key components in relation to provider obligations once the department accepts administration of a facility under the sanctions principles of the Aged Care Principles 1997? Is the approved administrator an employee of the provider for the purposes of the administration agreement? What rights and/or obligations does the appointed administrator have in relation to the provider and the operation of the facility during the period under administration? What recourse does an appointed administrator have with the department if the `contract' between themselves and the provider is frustrated by provider interference? Is a copy of the contract or the agreement for administration made available to the relevant personnel, including the nurse in charge of nursing services? What provisions are contained within an agreement or contract of administration of an aged care facility to prevent reduction in staff numbers, skills mix and care hours following accreditation of the facility? Does the department or the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency have any requirement, in the interests of monitoring continuous improvement strategies of a residential aged care facility, for those facilities to notify staffing and key personnel changes following accreditation? These questions need to be answered so that the community can have confidence in the provision of aged care. 
The problem with the issues that I have identified is that they are not isolated. These sorts of things are happening to older Australians every day of the week. They are happening every day because this government is driven by an ideological belief in small government: small government at the expense of a decent education for ordinary Australians, small government at the expense of the health of ordinary Australians and small government at the expense of the health, safety and peace of mind of elderly Australians.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000. History does not seem to be of much importance to the Howard government. This is evident in the reduction of funding to the humanities and to universities and in a callous disregard of the elderly. As we are forced into a more competitive world where time and output, not quality, are measured, the elderly of our communities are alienated, as you cannot measure wisdom via performance indicators. `Do we remember them?' is the question. Do we remember the generations that sacrificed their lives and the dreams of youth to stop the tyranny of the dark simplistic fascist cloud? It appears that, with the setting of the sun, we are forgetting. Families are more mobile in today's society than at any other time in our history. As geographical changes in families occur, the possibility of the extended family caring for their own diminishes and more pressure will be applied to the broader society to find ways of managing the needs of the elderly in our society.
As the young are forced to leave the community areas where they live to find work, more demands will be placed on rural communities to fill the gap. How is this to be done? With the policies that are driven by the Howard government, it is anyone's guess. Rural communities may get some doctors in 10 years, but not much else appears to be in the pipeline for the country areas of Australia. Most of the facilities that cater to the needs of the elderly are of reasonable standard and, apart from the natural fear innate in any inspection, the establishments in the industry support the notion of spot checks. Thus it is surprising to see, as a result of the Howard government's policies on accreditation, that only two per cent of homes will be spot checked. This is hardly going to strike fear into the hearts of fraudulent providers. There is a 98 per cent chance of getting away with substandard provisions of nursing home care for the elderly. These are great odds in anyone's terms, particularly if you are a betting person. One could be excused for thinking that the Howard government do not want inspections done at the moment. They would rather leave it alone as any more revelations about the Minister for Aged Care would be embarrassing for the government—the last thing they want. They may find more people with sores and suffering from neglect, and they would rather not see or hear—and they certainly do not want to act. That would compromise their obsessive drive for power, not for the good of the country but for their own intoxication.
Accreditation visits do not rate as spot checks as there is a one-week warning prior to the commencement of any inspection. Thus, unless an agency is virtually falling down around people's ears, there is every chance that a pretence can be engineered. That is why spot checks exist: to stop the pretence being engineered. But what is the use of the option of spot checks if they are never utilised, or not done, until a threat from our side of politics revealed that, in two years under the current minister, no spot checks were done at all? That was until the media raised the issue and then some spot checks were done almost immediately. They found some problems right away, but it appears that, even when problems were found, they were not hit with a feather once or twice but four times and then they were given a chance to talk. It is a pity that those on welfare who supposedly rort the system were not given the same discretion. 
This may be as a result of the unrealistic accreditation system that seems to be all about rules, but there is no money to allow the agencies to be able to reach the recommendations contained in the rules. This is yet another example of misinformed policy direction that seems to be the catchcry of this government. The posturing may look good, but there is little substance under the tinsel that settles on the heads of the elderly as they lie isolated in their twilight years. This shambles in aged care policy impacts on the viability of state health systems, as the elderly have been housed in hospitals due to lack of adequate facilities to cater for their needs in the general community. That is happening in the community in which I live. When we see the waiting lists growing in our public hospitals, we must keep this cost shift from the Commonwealth to the states in mind before we direct our venom at our state colleagues.
My home state is an absolutely beautiful place—but I suppose we all think that about our home states—where many elderly people reside. In fact, in the north-west of the state, where I live, the elderly account for nearly 20 per cent of the population. We have not, as yet, seen pictures of the displaced elderly on the streets, as we did in the Riverside fiasco. It appears that the majority of our providers operate in a viable way. However, this will not be helped by the funding provided by the Howard government, which was singled out by the Productivity Commission as dealing badly with aged care in my home state of Tasmania. In some ways, the Howard government's attitude to the elderly in Tasmania reflects its lack of understanding of the communities outside Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney. I will reiterate a statement that I made in a speech earlier in the year. Economies of scale ultimately mean larger nursing homes in the inner city will find it easier to compete. There is no ineptitude on the part of rural providers; rather, it is the law of the market—something the bean counters in the government should understand.
Perhaps not surprisingly, when asked the question, `Would you prefer to move or stay in your own neighbourhood?' over 50 per cent of the older people in Tasmania suggested they would rather stay in their own neighbourhood than move. Thus it may be worth considering smaller homes that are locally run and owned rather than being obsessed by the bottom line in an increasingly dollar dazzled society. Many medical and psychological findings would support the preference shown by the elderly, as familiarity becomes more important at that age. They like to stay in their communities. They like to stay where they know people. The need to live locally is not just a selfish wish on the part of the elderly; it is good for their health, both emotionally and physically. Additionally, small nursing homes would provide employment for local people who would be known to the elderly. Probably the elderly would have known these people's families and, therefore, would be familiar with those that are caring for them. This would also be a positive outcome.
If the government were serious about reducing costs, they would do well to consider reducing the red tape. The President of Aged Care in Tasmania, Mark Stem, highlighted in the local newspapers recently that red tape is becoming a ridiculous burden on staff and depriving them of valuable client time. He went on to say that there is a massive amount of duplication. He also said this was not an attempt to avoid accountability; rather, the level of documentation was too high. His comments were supported by the state secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation, Ms Pam Wright, who stated that her members had expressed `enormous frustration' with the issue and that the required paperwork had `increased dramatically and we would like to see it simplified dramatically'.
These statements hardly accord with the Howard government's catchcry of simplifying systems and cutting red tape. It seems that managerialism and box filling have grown exponentially under the influence of a middle management ideology that seems more obsessed with measurements than outcomes. It means that the aged care industry, as are many others, are being stupefied by an encouragement of the iron cage of bureaucratic nonsense, thus depriving the elderly of often unmeasurable time for idle banter with the staff. The staff are too busy filling in forms. That chatter with the staff has a health benefit for the elderly. It gives the elderly who do not have people visiting some human contact. That cannot be measured on a pie chart. It worries me that in the brave new world of doublespeak and spin the elderly have gone from being invigorated and valued to being a burden or a liability. When we think of human beings in terms of cost or deficit, it indicates that the market has supremacy over humanity and we should heed the warnings rather than look for scapegoats. 
The contribution the elderly make can be found in a study by the Institute of Family Studies where it is revealed that 67 per cent of the elderly provide child-minding services, 40 per cent provide financial help and 27 per cent provide help for their children's tertiary education. Imagine in smaller localised communities what a benefit the elderly could be to the younger children in our communities. Some may not be mobile, but many are of sane mind. Those people could make an enormous contribution, particularly in rural communities.
I also found somewhat to my surprise that the elderly were more concerned about pesticides in food and water and about other additives to their food than any other age group. Stereotypes are destroyed again, it seems. It reinforces yet again the contribution made by those over 60 to the betterment of our world. Thus it is amazing that, according to the Productivity Commission, there is a shortfall in funding in aged care to the tune of $200 million. It was suggested by the commission that this $200 million be a one-off injection of funds to enable aged care providers to meet their obligations as demanded by the accreditation system. As a result of this money not being allocated, a number of home closures—up to 50 in the next five weeks—are mooted in the next year. I have a story about an elderly friend of my mother's, who cracked a femur. She lives in a small community. She had no family close by and so no social contact. As a result of that, she became very depressed. These are the sorts of things that will happen in small communities unless we do something to address those issues.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000. This is an important issue that the Senate has been canvassing for some considerable time. I think I should declare somewhat of an interest in this issue of aged care because my father, up until his death in June this year, was resident for five months of his life in a nursing home. I have to say that the nursing care he was given was first-class. But, boy, did they have some complaints about this legislation, because what it does is keep them away from the patients—from their clients or whatever you want to call them; whatever is the trendy `in' word these days. They also had concerns because this piece of legislation does not stipulate the number of registered nurses that should be employed. The legislation does not actually look at those particular issues. It sets out a whole set of criteria and benchmarks that have to be reached, and pieces of paper that have to be kept, but it does not identify the number of registered nurses, assistants in nursing or enrolled nurses that would be needed.
We have had all this controversy, and concerns and issues have been raised in the last couple of years. I chaired a committee that did an inquiry into this legislation. This is the legislation that you get when you say you are going to table legislation, you let it lie, and then give 10 days worth of consultation before the bill is brought into the chamber. This legislation is an example of the mess you get when the guidelines and the essential elements that go with it are not put down and are brought online later on. This is the legislation you get when the senior bureaucrat of the department, when asked about the consultation they had with the nursing organisations, says that they talked to the New South Wales Nurses Association or the ANF. The department did not comprehend that the setters of the professional standards within nursing are the two colleges of nursing—the New South Wales college and the royal college, both of which I have to admit to being a member of—and within those, Geriaction, which is the organisation formed by members of the colleges who specialise in geriatric care. But, no, four years ago, the government and the department did not talk to those organisations until it was drawn to their attention very forcefully by me that these were the groups they needed to talk to. But they had already introduced the legislation. 
Work was done by the colleges and the unions that showed that the categorisations and the standards of measuring were flawed. We had another disagreement with the department at estimates and other hearings, and eventually it had to be reviewed. This piece of legislation that we are debating yet again tonight has a very long and sordid history of mismanagement by this government. Nobody in this chamber—no member of parliament—would disagree with the in-principle attempts of any government to improve aged care, but the handling of the aged care legislation by this government has been nothing short of abysmal. It has not done the right thing. It has not consulted or taken cognisance of the knowledge and the expertise of those groups in the community who know what good aged care is about. So what is happening now? When we initially asked questions at estimates about how many nursing homes would pass accreditation, and how many the department expected to get three-year and one-year accreditation, we were given indications that the figures were very low: 60 per cent to 70 per cent were going to get three-year accreditation. Yet now we have discover that somewhere in excess of 95 per cent of nursing homes will get three-year accreditation. You would think that is great—that the standards are very high.
—For the senators across the way who are chirruping away, perhaps they should look at the web site of the department and see what it says about the service and approved accreditation decisions. Perhaps the senator making the noise would like to look at the accreditation decisions as they are posted on the web site. I might say that it is taking New South Wales several months to get the results of these accreditation processes and decisions up on the web site. So if you have a family member who is about to be put into a nursing home or a hostel, and you want to get the latest on where you might want to place them, and you go and have a look, chances are that you may not find it. There is one accreditation process that was done in very early June that appeared only a couple of weeks ago. So that sort of thing is happening.
I had a look at a number of them—I have been following it very closely—and what did I discover? There are four major standards that are published on the accreditation assessments. The first is management systems, staffing and organisational development; the second is health and personal care; the third is resident lifestyle; and the fourth is physical environment and safe systems. Within those four categories, there are about 35 elements. I have one here, and I will not mention the name of the institution, that has got a three-year accreditation. Good. Great. Let's look at what it says about health and personal care. It is `unacceptable'. One of the four categories is unacceptable, and this place has three-year accreditation. I will talk about another one shortly that has three unacceptables and got a one-year accreditation. The department and the minister said at estimates, `Oh, but it means we are able to bring them up to standard.' That is not what I thought this was about. Let's talk about the health and personal care assessments at this particular home. The information on the web site states:
... medical admission process was not always completed and documented within the acceptable timeframe.
It goes on:
Residents, relatives and staff interviewed ... stated that individual continence management programs are not consistently implemented in accordance with identified needs, and this was confirmed during an audit of the care plans by the team. There was little evidence of the use of contemporary practice to manage continence. Effective evaluation of continence programs was not consistently undertaken.
The service has a 24 bed dementia specific unit. Feedback from relatives and staff indicated that individualised behavioural management programs are not being consistently developed to address these residents' identified care needs.
Observations by the audit team confirmed that there were minimal opportunities provided to engage these residents in therapeutic activities. 
Feedback from residents, relatives and staff indicated that mobility programs, previously developed by a physiotherapist, are not being consistently implemented. Care plans do not always reflect the residents' mobility and dexterity care needs. There was little evidence of programs for maintenance of mobility and dexterity being developed or implemented.
The team acknowledges the feedback from residents and relatives about the caring attitude of staff ...
I agree about the caring attitude. These are the sorts of statements that the accreditation team are writing, and institutions are getting three years accreditation. I know that this particular institution will endeavour to overcome these deficiencies, but one has to worry and wonder about other institutions, which may be large corporations or organisations, perhaps in capital cities, where they have an old truck that runs around with lots of potted ferns and palms which they trot in for the accreditation process and are trotted out the day after the accreditation team leaves. This is not good enough. 
We also learned at estimates that there are quite a number of homes that have not applied for accreditation, and one has to wonder where those are going on 1 January. One also has to wonder what is happening to the standards in those homes in the meantime. I read of one that has had a supplementary review audit report. Mind you, it has never put itself up for an audit, but it has had a supplementary review audit report. That was conducted on 16 May and approved on 15 June, and it was made public—I presume—on 13 July. They were going to have some follow-up contact, but we are still waiting to see on the web site what the results are. There was going to be a report in July and another visit in September. That is now two months gone, and there is still nothing further on the web site. So one has to have concerns. When we get to review audit reports, we have only three categories. In health and personal care, it was unacceptable; in resident lifestyle, it was unacceptable; and in physical environment and safe systems, it was unacceptable. So for the three categories, this one was unacceptable. This is also a home that has not applied for accreditation, so one presumes that on 31 December it is going to cease operation. One has to wonder about the 59 residents who are there at present. If the three categories are unacceptable, what is this minister doing to ensure that the standards are maintained and that I will not read comments like, `the carpet is smelly'?
—Nothing.
—That is right, Senator Forshaw. There has been lots of hot air from this government, lots of talk, but they have actually failed when push comes to shove. They have failed to deliver. 
There is another institution that I will mention. It is a small, low care institution—what used to be called a hostel. It has 15 beds and four high care residents. It is in an area that I think is going to shortly have an MPS. This institution got a one-year accreditation—and you wonder what is going on. Their rating on the first standard—management systems, staffing and organisational development—was `unacceptable'; on the second standard—health and personal care—it was `unacceptable'; on resident lifestyle it was `satisfactory'; and on physical environment and safe systems it was `unacceptable'. Three out of four of the standard groups rated `unacceptable', and this institution gets accreditation for one year. 
I have spoken to members of the area health board in the area in which this institution is situated, where there are discussions about it becoming an MPS, and these people were not aware that the institution had got only a one-year accreditation. I do not know who is not talking to whom, but I think this federal government and department need to very carefully look at and perhaps review the systems that they have or have had for advising the state governments and the state departments about institutions and organisations where there has been what I would suggest is a bit of a failure in the system or a bit of a failure in maintaining the standards. That is probably being a bit euphemistic. I think it is incumbent on the federal government to make sure that the state departments know very clearly where these institutions are deficient. They are basically handing the money over to the state and saying, `You run it,' but they are not telling them, `Whoops, there's a slight problem there.' It is an issue that is of grave concern to me. 
I will look at another institution. You just keep seeing the rating of `unacceptable'. This is another audit review report. I have not been able to find its accreditation report, so I can only assume it has not had one. The audit was conducted at the end of July and on 1 August. It found that 25 of the 35 expected outcomes were not met. It had undergone a change of ownership in the previous 12 months and a series of changes at senior management levels. The report said `continuous improvement activities are in an embryonic state'. I would suggest that it is even more elementary and primitive than `embryonic'. The first finding was that the standard of personal care was at serious risk. There are about six pages. It says things like:
... strong smell of urine within the service...one brand of pad...being used and these are inadequate in addressing the continence needs of residents.
The report also mentions `behavioural problems'. It is just appalling. When you go to resident lifestyle, you find that it rates as `unacceptable'. It also says:
The emotional needs of residents is not documented on admission...
The third standard is `unacceptable' as well. This has been on their web site for a while. They were going to have monthly site visits, but there is nothing on the web later than 8 August. I ask again: what public evidence is the department providing for families to say that residents are being cared for? There does not appear to be a great deal there. It is really of concern.
—Can you tell us what happened in the 13 years you were in government?
—Senator, you keep bleating.
—No, I am not bleating; I'm just asking a question.
—At least we ensured that the money that was supposed to be spent on nursing was spent on nursing and personal care and not filtered off somewhere else. What is going to happen in the next three years? How many of these institutions that have three-year accreditation are actually going to be able to be assessed or reviewed during that three years, or will it just be a case of `wait until things have come along'?
This legislation, of course, does not indicate what the government is actually doing to address the shortage of nursing home beds. There are areas within most states where there is quite a degree of shortage. Even where the department says there is not a shortage, I certainly get anecdotal evidence of long waiting lists and evidence of people who obviously need some sort of care having to be cared for in the public hospital system. There are certainly areas in the north-west of New South Wales where they have had 100 or so people in the public hospital system who have been identified as needing straight nursing home care. These issues also have to be addressed. Maybe the department and the government have to review how they arrive at the bed numbers required per 1,000 people over the age of 70. Maybe it is changing. Maybe the needs are changing. People are living longer and are becoming more dependent in the last year or so of their lives. This is an issue that this government really does have to address. 
I am told that in Bathurst there is an oversupply of beds. But I also receive correspondence from groups like the RSL and pensioner groups saying that they are aware of people who are having to wait at home or in the hospital when they need to be in a nursing home. Acute hospitals are wonderful places and give wonderful care. But the care that is needed for somebody who is a resident in a nursing home is different to the care needed for somebody who is a resident in an acute hospital. Both are specialised areas of nursing and both should be recognised as such. 
I would like to end on the concern that I have about what this government is doing—I say this government, not the department—in the erosion of nursing standards. This minister does not appear to have any major commitment to ensuring that there are adequate numbers of registered and enrolled nurses at the bedside of people in aged care accommodation. The reports are indicating that very clearly. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-11-27,"—I rise to make some remarks in this debate on the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000. I must say that it is pleasing to be able to follow Senator West, because she will recall, as I do, the debates that took place in this chamber back in 1997—just on three years ago and pretty much to the time—on the then aged care bill introduced by this government. Many of the issues raised in the debate this evening—issues that this government have simply not addressed in this legislation—were issues that we raised at that time. We said in the debates in 1997—and I can well recall them, because I had the responsibility at that time as the parliamentary secretary to the shadow minister for health and aged care to handle the legislation—that there were going to be very serious consequences as a result of this government's legislation. But they did not listen to us. They said that we were wrong, that we were doomsayers. Furthermore, the government said that this was a new era for aged care in the country and that their reforms were going to dramatically improve the quality of care and funding for aged care throughout Australia. What a prediction to make! If you look at the history, we were right and the government was wrong. We said that the government's proposals in that legislation were actually going to do the opposite: they were going to lead to a decline in the standard of care, a crisis in funding and in bed allocation in aged care—and that is what we have today.
Some of the issues that we raised at that time, as I said, have been raised by members of the opposition here this evening. For instance, on the question of funding, we all recall the new system that the government wanted to introduce—wedded as they are to the ideology of user pays for everything—namely, the famous accommodation bonds system. We said at the time—and indeed I recall we were supported by the Democrats; but, in the end, unfortunately, the Democrats rolled over and supported the government's bill—that the system would not work. It would be a major financial burden on the elderly and their families in this country and that people would have to ultimately sell their homes to get a bed in a nursing home. We were howled down and we were lampooned. We were told that, `No, that is absolute nonsense. You are just scaring the elderly people of Australia,' and that this was all a furphy. Time has demonstrated that we were right. Indeed, it took only a few months before the government came to the realisation that their funding system for accommodation bonds was just not going to work. The government and the then minister were forced to try to fix the system that they had introduced only a few months earlier. We all remember the hapless minister at the time, Mrs Judi Moylan. She really got the dump when she was handed this portfolio and, of course, she went by the wayside in terms of her ministerial career.
—And what about Warwick?
—I am reminded that the next minister who took over the portfolio responsibility was Mr Warwick Smith—the supposedly bright and shining star of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He did not last very long either. Of course, the voters delivered him the ultimate lesson at the last election. And now who do we have as the minister for aged care? We have Bronwyn Bishop—a legend in her own mind.
 (Senator Knowles)—Mrs Bishop.
—Mrs Bishop—former Senator Bishop and a person who used to dream of being the Prime Minister of this country. She may well dream because, in terms of her portfolio and ministerial responsibilities, Mrs Bishop has been an abject failure. The members of the government know that, as do the people involved in the aged care industry.
—No, she has not. She has been a tremendous minister. She has done a great job. Pull your head in.
—Well, that statement only has to be made to demonstrate that it is self-evidently false. We raised funding issues. This government's proposals were a disaster. Ever since then, they have been grappling to fix the system of funding for aged care. This legislation does not attempt in any way to deal with that major problem. Nor does this legislation attempt to deal with another serious issue; that is, the waiting lists and the shortfall in beds for nursing homes and hostels. We warned the government in 1997 that the changes they were introducing were going to place added burden on the acute care system in public hospitals, as more and more elderly people would be forced to remain longer in public hospitals, and that there would be increasing difficulties for them to get nursing home beds. That has been demonstrated clearly. The situation has got far worse than it ever was at the time we were in government. Figures that have been produced in the department's own annual report for the last financial year bear that out.  
Just to mention some of the areas in my own home state of New South Wales, in the Central Coast area there is a combined shortage of some 1,171 residential aged care beds. What did that area receive out of this government's allocation for this year? An additional 300 beds. There was a shortage of 1,171. To meet that, they received only an additional 300. Similarly, on the Mid North Coast, there is currently a shortage of some 336 nursing home beds. They received only an additional allocation of 25 beds this year. The same story can be told for many other areas throughout New South Wales. It is particularly the case in the regional areas of New South Wales. I have just referred to the Central Coast and the Mid North Coast, but, if you look at the figures for the Far North Coast, the Illawarra, the Hunter and so on, you will find a similar story. There is an increasing need, an increasing shortage of beds, and this government is doing nothing at all to alleviate the problem.
You would think that, given that they were bringing in a piece of legislation to amend the Aged Care Act, which has now been in operation for three years, they might be looking for some real areas of reform and some real areas of improvement such as in the area of bed allocation that I have just mentioned. But no, there is nothing about that. The situation is similar for standards of care. Senator West quite correctly drew attention to the serious decline in care standards. We said back in 1997 that this government's legislation was going to potentially lead to a reduction in those standards. The changes that were implemented at that time were criticised by the Royal College of Nursing, the Nursing Federation and other eminent medical groups, as well as by agencies within the industry. But our criticisms went unheeded and the results have unfortunately come to pass. We have seen situations like Riverside and a whole range of other nursing homes that have been identified as being seriously below standard.
This government and this minister and previous ministers boasted about their new accreditation system and the major changes that they were going to bring about. It took three years for the first ever surprise inspection of a nursing home under this government to take place. And that occurred only because of the constant highlighting of the serious situation in nursing homes by the opposition in this parliament, particularly by Ms Macklin in the other house and Senator Chris Evans in this place, constantly asking questions and bringing these serious problems to the notice of the government. Eventually, three years after the legislation was passed, the minister announced that the first ever surprise inspection was taking place. Since then we have seen very little follow-up action at all.
I have referred to some of the major areas that this bill does not deal with. What does it deal with? You could be forgiven for thinking that it does not deal with very much at all when you look at the explanatory memorandum. It states:
The Bill gives more powers to the Department of Health and Aged Care ... over providers who cannot or will not comply with the Act. 
The Bill enables notice to be given to residents and relatives where the approved provider of a residential aged care service faces withdrawal of approved provider status, revocation of places and evacuation of residents.
Those two short paragraphs are saying that what this bill really deals with is giving the department some more power, some more flexibility in terms of sanctions, and also providing for notice to be given to residents and relatives where a nursing home is going to lose its provider status. They are important issues, but they are very much after the horse has bolted and they do not encompass all of the other major problems that exist in the system that we have highlighted in the debate this evening and that have also been highlighted in the Ombudsman's own report into the aged care sector. 
The title of this bill is very much a misnomer. It is the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000, but it contains very little when it comes to dealing with the real, systemic problems that exist in aged care in this country. As we said back in 1997, this government's so-called reforms and its blind obsession with user pays were going to cause increasing problems in aged care.
During the previous speech by Senator West, there was an interjection from Senator Calvert. I think the interjection was along the lines that he goes out and visits nursing homes. That is very commendable of you, Senator Calvert; we all should do that. Indeed, it is something that I have done on a regular basis since being elected to this chamber and is something that I particularly did when I was previously the parliamentary secretary to the minister for health and aged care. I can tell you that, despite and notwithstanding the misinformation and the haranguing that we used to get from Senator Herron and other members of the government in the past on what the Labor Party did when we were in government, there are many nursing homes and hostels that I have visited that were either built or upgraded during the 13 years of the Labor government that are a model for aged care. 
I give you the challenge. If you want me to take you to some of them, I will. I have visited a number of them. I refer to centres such as the John Paul Village centre in Heathcote, built and financed by a combination of federal government funds and funds from the local community and the Catholic Church. It is a magnificent centre, and I have had the opportunity to visit a number of those centres across New South Wales. I also had the opportunity on a number of occasions to actually represent the then minister in the previous Labor government in opening some of those improved facilities. Equally, I have seen some pretty terrible situations; they exist today, and I would not want to in any way suggest that they did not exist in the past.
If you go back to the time of the Gregory report and to the time when we were first elected, there were serious problems in aged care in this country both in terms of nursing homes and hostels. Nobody disputes that. What we were faced with was a long, long period of neglect by previous governments, over most of the years in which the coalition parties were in government prior to 1983. That was combined with significant demographic changes particularly in terms of the ageing population and also in terms of a lot of aged persons moving out of the major cities and to regional areas, particularly to coastal regions in New South Wales. We did start to address those issues, but I think everybody knew it was going to take a long time. What is needed now in this debate is not small pieces of legislation such as this bill, important as it is; this government needs to sit down and have a look at the real problems in aged care and bring back some legislation into the next sittings of parliament that tackles those real issues that we have spoken about tonight.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-11-27,"—Listening to all the former speakers, I was reminded of the old testament prophet Jeremiah. You recall that Jeremiah was always talking about calamities, denouncing wrongdoing and prophesying that all was falling apart. Every speech was about that. It took me back to my school days and Around the Boree Log, to a contemporary of that time, Hanrahan. Hanrahan was always saying, `We'll all be rooned,' if the drought did not break and then, `We'll all be rooned,' if the rain didn't stop. The Labor Party was only in power for 13 years. It had 13 years to do something about it. I would agree with Senator Forshaw in one regard: the changing demographics, the ageing population, et cetera. Four years ago when we came into office, the Auditor-General said that there were 10,000 aged care places in deficit in this country. But let us get things into perspective: only eight people in 100 over the age of 70 years of age access residential aged care in this country—eight people in 100. 
We are quite proud of what has happened since we came into government. It is interesting that even last week Senator Evans, in a speech in Perth, said that the Labor Party in power were going to keep accommodation bonds, were going to keep accreditation, were going to keep certification. They are all things that we have brought in. We have a very proud record—around 17,200 places have been allocated to areas of need across Australia since we came into office and of these around 6,400 have been residential care places and 10,800 have been community care places. In the 1999 aged care approvals round, around 7,000 more aged care places were allocated, and 40 per cent of these places were allocated to rural and regional areas. Emphasis is being given to caring for people in their own homes, which people want. Around 4,300 community aged care packages were allocated in the 1999 round. 
Coming to this Aged Care Amendment Bill 2000, on 7 September 2000 the House of Representatives passed the bill with support from the opposition. The amendments contained in that bill are designed to give more powers to the Department of Health and Aged Care through the secretary of the department and his or her delegates over providers who cannot or will not comply with the new aged care standards established under the Aged Care Act 1997. Time is running out, and I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The aged care reforms made by this Government, and put in place by the Aged Care Act 1997 and attendant Principles, are the basis of a sound and sustainable aged care system.
Key elements of those reforms are strategies to improve both building standards and care standards, namely, certification of buildings and accreditation in relation to care standards. The legislation sets a deadline of 1 January 2001 for all residential aged care services to be accredited if they are to continue to be eligible for residential aged care subsidies. During the accreditation phase, for the first time all residential aged care facilities will have been visited and two -thirds visited more than once.
On 27 July 2000, the Minister for Aged Care, the Hon Bronwyn Bishop, announced a further progression of aged care reforms including the creation of the Commissioner for Complaints and the Hon Rob Knowles would fill that position. The Minister also announced a stepped up program of continuing random spot checks right across Australia.
Amendments introduced by the Bill are twofold. The first amendment will allow the department to give notice to residents and relatives of action to be taken which would result in the revocation of approved provider status and bed licences, called places under the Act, and the probable closure of a home. It will also give the power to revoke bed licences, as beds become vacant. This includes an option for progressive revocation or suspension of places (that is beds) as a sanction.
These measures increase the range of options available to the department. Currently under the Act, there is no power to nominate a future time from which a sanction takes effect. This Bill permits notice to be given to affected residents and next of kin or another individual, who in the opinion of the Secretary, is concerned for the safety, health and wellbeing of the resident.
It is also important to note that the department, in making a decision to defer implementation of a sanction imposed, is required to have regard to any risk that there may be to the safety, health or well-being of the relevant affected care recipients.
The second amendment will allow action to be taken against approved providers who have ""key personnel"", including company directors, who have been convicted of an indictable offence, are of unsound mind or become bankrupt.
More specifically such key personnel, who are described as ""disqualified individuals"" in the Bill. include individuals who have been convicted of an indictable offence under Australian law or under corresponding foreign laws, who are of unsound mind to the extent that this affects the performance of their duties as key personnel, or who are insolvent under administration (an expression that includes bankruptcy and other arrangements).
This amendment will enable the department to take action to require the removal of such key personnel without revoking approved provider status. Removal of approved provider status however will remain the final option.
Particular measures introduced in the Bill in this regard include removal of such key personnel by order of the Federal Court in relation to approved providers that are corporations. Sanctions action under the Act continues as an option in relation to all approved providers (whether or not they are corporations) if they fail to comply with the new requirement to ensure their key personnel are not disqualified individuals. These provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure hat the care being provided to care recipients is not compromised by the actions or omissions of such persons. 
Where an approved provider is not prepared to comply with the new provisions, it risks action in the Federal Court or sanctions under the Act, in addition to consideration of whether the approved provider continues to be suitable to be maintain approved provider status under the Act.
These provisions also apply to applicants for approved provider status.
The Bill also introduces certain offences, with appropriate penalties, where a person, who is a key personnel of an approved provider, is a disqualified person and the approved provider is a corporation. These offences apply both to an approved provider, that is a corporation, and a disqualified individual.
In relation to such an offence committed by an individual disqualified on the basis of unsound mind it is imperative that aged care recipients are not placed at risk because of the potential actions or omissions of such persons. If, for example, such a person was not criminally responsible for his or her actions because of mental impairment then he or she would not be convicted of the offence.
The offence provisions will be a significant incentive for the removal of such key personnel from the important positions that they occupy. Again, the end result will be that the care being provided to individuals in Commonwealth funded residential aged care facilities is not compromised.
The proposed amendments to the Act continue the momentum of progressive reforms put in place by the Howard Government in aged care.
The Opposition has indicated that it is broadly supportive of the measures contained in the Bill. The Government welcomes this support but is concerned with the amendments that the Opposition proposes.
The Government gives the highest priority to protecting consumers and particularly residents in aged care facilities but the Opposition, as evidenced by the amendments that it proposes, seems more interested in pandering to industry at the expense of the most vulnerable group, the residents.
This becomes even clearer when the detail of the Opposition amendments is considered.
First, the Opposition proposes reducing the timeframes for the nomination and appointment of advisers and administrators to two days without considering that a provider's failure to nominate such a person within the times proposed by the Opposition it would mean that the provider's approval must be revoked and possibly requiring resident evacuation from the facility.
In other words, because the Opposition has not thought carefully enough about the effect of its amendments, they could hurt the very people that it claims it wishes to protect.
Second, the Opposition proposes the establishment of panels of advisers and administrators. The Government has no objection to this, since it in effect simply formalises arrangements that are already in place.
Third, in respect to the steps that approved providers must take to ensure that none of an approved provider's key personnel is a disqualified individual, the Opposition's amendment uses the term ""regulations"". This is not appropriate and the term ""Principles"" should be used for consistency.
In essence, what separates the Government from the Opposition in respect to this legislation is that the Government places the interests of consumers, particularly residents, above all else.
Despite the scare mongering of the Opposition, the standards framework of accreditation and certification will be fully implemented by 1 January 200 1. There have been tremendous changes to the residential aged care sector during the period of this Government to protect the quality of care of individual older Australians.
This Government is fully committed to strengthening the legislation where it is warranted as demonstrated by these amendments and believes that the new tools the Department will have as a result of this legislation passing will serve the interests of residents and the Australian community as a whole.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-11-27,"—I would like to talk about the unreasonable cost of insurance in the north of Australia, and the north-west in particular. In the last year, the high cost of property insurance premiums in the north of Australia has been brought to my attention by the Pilbara ward of the Country Shire Councils Association of WA. This is a very serious matter. It adds very much to the cost of living experienced by people who live in north-west communities. It also adds very much to the cost of operating businesses in the north-west as well as providing community services in the north-west. Indeed, the high cost of living and the high cost of providing services in these northern communities is commonly cited as a major disincentive to people living in these areas and for businesses to set up in the north-west of Western Australia. 
Concerns about this kind of issue were certainly evident at the northern policy forum I recently attended in Katherine, which was organised by the minister for regional development, Senator Ian Macdonald. One of the issues which came through very loud and clear at that forum was that people all across the north of Australia have to pay higher prices for all manner of goods such as food and fuel, said to be due to the higher transport costs incurred in getting goods to them—although, for example, in the case of the north of Western Australia, where we are told the price of petrol is so high because it is transported up from Perth, people who live there know it actually comes by tanker from Singapore into the ports of Broome and Port Hedland, so it is very hard to justify that particular claim as a reason for increasing costs. But on top of all the other costs that the people in the north of Western Australia and the north of Australia in general have to pay, they also have to pay property insurance premiums at levels which simply would not be accepted anywhere else in Australia and which I think are quite unjustified and amount to a simple matter of exploitation of the people of the north of Australia by the insurance industry.
The insurance premiums for general property insurance in the north-west were raised earlier this year following the significant flooding that occurred in the north of Western Australia as a result of major cyclones and the enormous wet that occurred over the last Christmas period. The Shire of Roebourne, which covers towns such as Karratha, Dampier, Wickham and Pannawonica, found that it had incurred significant increases in the cost of property insurance premiums. After reporting this to the Pilbara ward of the Country Shire Councils Association, they found that this increase was not an isolated experience but applied generally to every person who requires insurance for properties located above the 26th parallel in Western Australia. That means that every householder who owns a home in the north of Western Australia now finds themselves subject to these loaded premiums for house insurance.
The trouble is that we are not just talking about a small loading on premiums. Indeed, we are talking about massively increased premiums ranging from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. A 50 per cent to 80 per cent increase is enormous and, as I said, it is very hard to see such increases in any terms other than pure and simple exploitation of the people in the north of Western Australia by the insurance industry. If an increase in premiums was not a heavy enough extra burden to bear, the insurance companies also increased the excess that insurers have to pay to $25,000 per house before they will cover the cost for repair of damages. So people in the north-west found that not only do they have to pay more for their insurance in the first place but also, in the event that they do actually make a claim, they would be expected to pay an amount of at least $25,000 as an initial contribution towards the cost of repairs. It seems from that that the insurance companies are winning either way. They are winning because of the higher income from increased premiums and they are winning because the preliminary loading factor that people have to pay has been increased to $25,000.
In the case of local governments it is quite clear that, given that local councils have limited budgets, the increase in premiums is creating quite a severe degree of financial hardship. Local governments usually own a lot of property and having to pay these vastly increased premiums does substantially impact on their budgets. Of course, that is not only the detriment to the councils' budgetary positions; it also acts to the detriment of the ratepayers, who may find that public facilities may be underinsured or not properly insured because the councils may decide not to insure all of their properties because of the increased premiums involved. 
There is no doubt that one of the difficulties in the insurance market in the north of Western Australia is the lack of competition. The Shire of Roebourne, for instance, has been advised that there are only two or three underwriters prepared to insure property north of the 26th parallel. Concerns have been expressed that, in the future, there may not be any companies prepared to offer any kind of coverage in the north of Western Australia. There has already been a rationalisation within the industry that has resulted in the amalgamation of companies and the closure of offices in the north-west. The reason given for the increased premiums in the north-west, of course, is that there is an increased risk from cyclones. One has to question whether or not this is a valid reason because, in reality, if you look at the records you can see that cyclones are rare. In fact, the north of Western Australia is sparsely populated, as is the whole of northern Australia, and so the incidence and likelihood of damage to housing is really quite low. As I have said several times, it is hard to draw any other conclusion but that the insurance companies are exploiting the situation in the north-west by loading the premiums in the way they have and that they are in fact really profiteering at the expense of the people in those areas.
I believe this is a serious situation. I think the Insurance Council of Australia really should provide some counselling and advice to the insurance companies that do operate in the north-west, because this kind of profiteering does nothing for the image of the insurance industry, which in general is fairly bad. People assume that if insurance companies can get out of paying a claim they will. They have the rather dubious honour, I think, of being regarded as a profession with a status somewhat similar to that of used car salesmen—the sorts of people who you really would not expect to be well treated by. I believe that the question of these high insurance premiums in the north is certainly a key matter that should be considered among the other examples of disadvantages suffered by people in the north of Australia raised at the northern policy forum. People in the north accept that their location and relative isolation mean that they generally experience a higher cost of living than people in many other parts of the country, but I do think that these high premiums are quite unjustified.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Northern Australia: Insurance Costs</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
