"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-20,"—I move Greens amendment (28) on sheet 5285:
 (28) Page 83 (after line 20), at the end of the bill, add:
Schedule 6—Redundancy and hours of work
Workplace Relations Act 1996
Part 1—Redundancy
1 After Division 6 of Part 7
Insert:
Division 6B—Redundancy pay
316G The guarantee
                  If an employer has made a definite decision that the employer no longer wishes the job an employee has been doing to be done by anyone, the employer will pay the occupant of that job an equitable payment in accordance with this Division.
316H Definitions
                  In this Division:

a week’s pay means the ordinary time rate of pay for the employee concerned, provided that such rate excludes:
              (a)    overtime; and
              (b)    penalty rates; and
              (c)    disability allowances; and
              (d)    shift allowances; and
              (e)    special rates; and
               (f)    fares and travelling time allowances; and
              (g)    bonuses; and
              (h)    any other ancillary payments of a like nature.

business includes trade, process, business or occupation and includes part of any such business.

redundancy occurs if an employer has made a definite decision that the employer no longer wishes the job an employee has been doing to be done by anyone and that decision leads to the termination of employment of the employee.

transmission includes transfer, conveyance, assignment or succession whether by agreement or by operation of law and transmitted has a corresponding meaning.
316I Transfer to lower paid duties
                  If an employee is transferred to lower paid duties by reason of redundancy, the same period of notice must be given as the employee would have been entitled to if the employment had been terminated and the employer may, at the employer’s option, make payment in lieu thereof of an amount equal to the difference between the former ordinary rate of pay and the new ordinary time rate of pay for the number of weeks of notice still owing.
316J Redundancy pay
         (1)    An employee, whose employment is terminated by reason of redundancy, is entitled to the following amount of redundancy pay in respect of a period of continuous service:

* a week’s pay is defined in section 316H
         (2)    Provided that the redundancy pay does not exceed the amount which the employee would have earned if employment with the employer had proceeded to the employee’s normal retirement date.
         (3)    Continuous service has the same meaning as in section 228.
316K Alternative employment
         (1)    An employer, in a particular redundancy case, may make application to the Commission to vary the amount of redundancy pay if the employer obtains acceptable alternative employment for the employee.
         (2)    This provision does not apply in circumstances involving transmission of a business as set out in section 316M.
316L Job search entitlement
         (1)    During the period of notice of termination given by the employer in accordance with subsection 661(2), an employee must be allowed up to one day off without loss of pay during each week of notice, for the purpose of seeking other employment.
         (2)    If an employee has been allowed paid leave for more than one day during the notice period, for the purpose of seeking other employment, the employee must, at the request of the employer, produce proof of attendance at an interview in order to receive payment for the time absent. A statutory declaration is sufficient proof of attendance.
316M Transmission of business
         (1)    The preceding provisions of this Division are not applicable if a business is, before or after the commencement of the Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Act 2007, transmitted from an employer (in this subsection called the transmittor) to another employer (in this subsection called the transmittee), in either of the following circumstances:

              (a)    if the employee accepts employment with the transmittee which recognises the period of continuous service which the employee had with the transmittor, and any prior transmittor, to be continuous service of the employee with the transmittee; or
              (b)    if the employee rejects an offer of employment with the transmittee:
                    (i)    in which the terms and conditions are substantially similar and no less favourable, considered on an overall basis, than the terms and conditions applicable to the employee at the time of ceasing employment with the transmittor; and
                   (ii)    which recognises the period of continuous service which the employee had with the transmittor, and any prior transmittor, to be continuous service of the employee with the transmittee.
         (2)    The Commission may vary the operation of subparagraph (1)(b)(ii) if it is satisfied that the application of that provision would operate unfairly in a particular case.
316N Employees exempted
                  This Division does not apply to:
              (a)    employees terminated as a consequence of serious misconduct that justifies dismissal without notice; or
              (b)    probationary employees; or
              (c)    apprentices; or
              (d)    trainees; or
              (e)    employees engaged for a specific period of time or for a specified task or tasks; or
               (f)    casual employees.
Note:   serious misconduct is provided for in section 661.
316O Incapacity to pay
                  The Commission may vary the amount of redundancy pay provided for in section 316J on the basis of an employer’s incapacity to pay. An application for variation may be made by an employer or a group of employers.
Part 2—Hours of work
2 Paragraph 226(4)(g)
After “employee’s hours of work”, insert “, including the pattern of hours worked and any shift work,”.
3 At the end of section 226
Add:
Minimum rest periods – breaks
         (6)    An employer must take all measures necessary to ensure that if the working day is longer than six hours, every employee is entitled to a maximum rest break of at least 30 minutes.
Daily rest period
         (7)    An employer must take all measures necessary to ensure that in every 24 hour period, every employee is entitled to a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours.
Weekly rest period
         (8)    An employer must take all measures necessary to ensure that in each seven day period, every employee is entitled to a minimum rest period, uninterrupted by work for the employer, of 24 hours in addition to the 11 hours daily rest period specified in subsection (7).
         (9)    Where possible, the minimum weekly rest period provided for in subsection (8) must occur on Sunday.
Additional payment for work during rest periods
       (10)    If an employee is required by his or her employer to work during the rest periods prescribed in subsections (6) to (8), the employee is to be paid at a rate of two times their ordinary rate of pay for the time worked until a rest period as prescribed in subsections (6) to (8) occurs.
This amendment relates to redundancy. It amends the minimum conditions of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard for a stronger safety net on redundancy and rest breaks. The standard we are introducing in this amendment is based on an AIRC standard from 2004—except for small business having to pay a smaller scale. We also use the standard that applies in Western Australia and apply it to all employees. We do not believe that there has been any adverse economic consequence in Western Australia from such minimum conditions.
Redundancy payments are important for people to help them get on with their lives after what can be a traumatic experience. We do not believe there is a good reason for there not being minimum standards available for all employees. We believe that this is more appropriate rather than just extending the time that such payments are protected. We believe that all employees should be entitled to redundancy pay regardless of their instrument of employment.
As you will note from the table in our amendment, it scales back to 12 weeks after 10 years because this is the time when long service leave becomes available to all employees. Some states have better long service leave provisions that are available earlier, but 10 years is the latest. We believe rest breaks are also matters where there should be broad minimum standards, and that further protection can occur on an industry basis. We are facing a crisis at this point in balancing work and family life and yet no-one seems prepared to provide even the most minimal regulation to help employees out. We believe that these amendments go to providing a stronger safety net, which will be beneficial for occupational health and safety and our longer-hours culture that puts many workers at risk.
We believe that these are minimum conditions that should be part of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Redundancy is an area of importance. We know that it has been a matter of controversy and conjecture through the process of Work Choices and, through this amendment, we are working to address the problem of redundancies not being adequately provided to all employees. We commend this amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I would like to indicate Labor’s position in respect of these provisions. Labor have previously moved amendments which protect redundancy entitlements for all employees who make workplace agreements by including them in the list of protected award conditions. As we have previously outlined, the policy we are taking to the federal election will provide a statutory right of redundancy entitlements to all employees save for those employed in businesses with fewer than 15 employees.
As I understand Senator Siewert’s amendment, there are in essence two propositions. The first extends the period of operation of preserved redundancy entitlement when an agreement is terminated or transmitted from 12 months to the end of the employee’s employment with their employer. I have dealt with that by indicating Labor’s policy position. The Greens have also proposed an amendment to insert a statutory redundancy entitlement in accordance with the AIRC test case. Whilst this is largely in accordance with Labor’s outlined policy position, it does not provide an exemption from redundancy payments for small business, which our policy contains. On that basis, Labor will not support this amendment. We have made our position on redundancy clear in our Forward with Fairness document, which provides both flexibility and fairness.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-20,"—The Australian Democrats support the view that redundancy provisions should be provided through the Workplace Relations Act. However, we take the view that you have to be much more flexible than the amendments put before us. We believe that the broad basis for redundancy provisions has been outlined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in its test case and that the proper extension of that test case should be to the safety net—namely, through the award system. The Democrats have the view that awards should vary. We believe awards should be industry based and national rather than state based. They should be limited to a minimum number of allowable matters—we recommended at least 16—but the redundancy provisions should be designed as appropriate for the industry and, where an award is not applicable, they need to be worked out in an enterprise. Obviously, where there is a collective agreement, it should take into account those provisions. So we tend to prefer that the principles of redundancy are established in legislation but that the application of redundancy provisions be varied according to both enterprises and awards.
Furthermore, we are of the view that there are businesses that are just never in a position whereby they can provide redundancy. Micro and small businesses sometimes fall into that category, and it would be unwise to impose a legislative provision which they would simply be unable to meet. Whilst we respect the intention and the initiative of the Greens amendments for similar reasons to Labor but with our own slant on these things, we regret that we are unable to support them.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2007-06-20,"—Family First support greater protection for redundancy and the issues of hours of work, breaks and those sorts of things. The intention of the Greens amendments is to strengthen that protection. Family First has two amendments coming up, and the second of those will achieve what needs to be set out in a more flexible way than what is being proposed here. For those reasons we will not support the Greens amendments but certainly we support the idea of greater protection for workers’ redundancy entitlements and their hours of work.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-06-20,"—The government opposes the amendment. It basically deals with two issues: redundancy and hours of work. The government considers that parties should be free to bargain the terms and conditions that best suit their circumstances, and adding redundancy provisions to the standard reduces their ability to do so. Most importantly from the government’s perspective, the amendment does not include any protection for small business. The government legislated to protect small business with fewer than 15 employees from redundancy pay obligations.
The amendment would undo that protection. It will result in a cost imposition that may be unaffordable for many small businesses and a disincentive to growth in the small business sector. However, the government is keenly aware of the importance that some employees may place on redundancy entitlements. It is for this reason that the government last year moved amendments to preserve redundancy arrangements for 12 months when agreements are unilaterally terminated by the employer. Having said that and considered the matter further, we will support Senator Fielding’s amendment to extend this period to 24 months.
In relation to the issue of hours of work, the government opposes this aspect as well on the basis that the proposed amendment is unnecessary and, in many cases, unworkable. It seeks to adopt the one-size-fits-all approach that would severely hinder enterprise level flexibility. It is important to note that rest breaks are a protected award condition. This means that an entitlement to a rest break cannot be excluded or modified without fair compensation. The act already provides employees who are instrument-free with a new entitlement to a meal break if they work more than five hours continuously. Agreements and contracts can provide for meal or rest breaks. The proposed amendment would require an employer to provide a rest break in the following circumstances: a 30-minute rest period for each six hours worked; an 11 hour rest period in every 24-hour period and a 24-hour rest period in each seven-day period. These proposals limit the ability of employers and employees to negotiate arrangements that best suit their needs at the enterprise level. Senator Siewert, coming from Western Australia as she does, and Senator Murray would undoubtedly be aware of the situation that exists within the mining sector, where people work 14 days on and then have one week off.
That is by way of arrangement, whereas that which Senator Siewert is proposing would make that sort of arrangement impossible. That is why we as a government once again say that when you try to impose what you think from your office desk is a good, fair system, it might not necessarily take into account the needs of a particular enterprise or indeed the wishes of the workers. That is why we say these things need to be carefully balanced. They are matters that we say are important but, if people want to trade these things away on the basis of fair compensation, then they can. Often workers and their employers have come to arrangements that suit both sides and, as a result, assist the productivity of the country and the wealth that we are able to create and then share with our fellow Australians.

This set of amendments, by doubling the protection period of workers’ redundancy benefits from 12 months to two years, tries to avoid the Tristar fiasco happening again. Family First’s restoring family work balance bill proposed that to be extended to five years, and we have been able to get support for two. The amendments would deter employers from trying to avoid paying workers their full redundancy entitlements, which are vital for workers and their families. Currently workers’ redundancy payments are protected by law for up to 12 months after workplace agreements are terminated. Twelve months is not adequate, and Tristar shows this to be particularly the case.
You may recall that Tristar is trying to slash its redundancy bill by keeping its 29 staff at a Sydney plant without any work for them. You may recall that, under its workplace agreement which expired in February, the workers would be entitled to a total of about $4.5 million if they were made redundant now but would get only about one-quarter of that, or just over a million dollars, if they were made redundant more than a year after the employment contract expires. The Tristar situation is totally unfair and un-Australian, and for an employer to try to exploit the law to take away the redundancy entitlements of workers in that way is just not on. Family First appreciates the support of the government and the opposition to extend the protection to two years.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I will outline Labor’s position on Senator Fielding’s first set of amendments. As I have indicated to Senator Fielding, the opposition will support these amendments, but I do want to make a couple of comments. First, I make this point. The Tristar issue primarily revolved around the fact that the company refused to dismiss employees, as Senator Fielding outlined. Whilst the move from 12 to 24 months might assist with that, the reality is an employer could still choose to simply refuse to engage in the triggering event for the entitlement, which is in fact the dismissal. To some extent these provisions will not ameliorate that, although I recognise Senator Fielding’s motivation. It is a fact that 24 months is certainly better than 12, and Labor will support these provisions. I reiterate federal Labor’s policy, which is to provide a statutory right of redundancy entitlement to all employees, save for those employed in businesses with fewer than 15 employees. This constitutes real protection for redundancy entitlements and this would have protected Tristar employees from day one.
I also note that the government states that it will support this amendment. I will wait with interest to see if the government intends to support Senator Fielding’s next set of amendments, which are intended to include redundancy pay within the definition of protected allowable award matters. Of course, that would in fact require that any subsequent agreement altering a redundancy entitlement would need to be assessed against the new fairness test. I also make the point that, under the government’s laws, people’s redundancy entitlements can be abrogated by a new agreement and that, unless the government supports Senator Fielding’s amendment or something similar, the fairness test will not ensure that an employee is at least fairly compensated should such redundancy entitlements be traded away in that new agreement. So the government’s colours on redundancy will be demonstrated again later in the chamber unless the minister has instructions to support both of Senator Fielding’s amendments, in which case we would say it is belated but appropriate.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-20,"—The Greens will also support the amendments. We do not think that the amendments go as far as our amendments did. We have tried to move a series of amendments that we believe provide much better protection as to redundancy and, instead of limiting it to 12 months, we tried to extend it so it was open-ended. We think that would have been a better approach, but an extra 12 months is better than nothing, I have to say.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-06-20,"—Briefly, the government, as Senator Fielding has indicated, support the amendments. We do not support the next amendment, but we will deal with that during the discussion on that one. I note, in relation to these particular amendments, that they would mean in the Tristar context that an employer would have to deliberately employ somebody for two years to avoid the redundancy provisions.
I must say that, in this day and age, and I may well be wrong on this, I am not sure that redundancy provisions are being made which go for more than 104 weeks. As a result, I would think that this proposal really does cover the field and provides the security for those workers who see their redundancy provisions as being important. We believed in our first legislation that 12 months would be enough. But, as we have always said, we are willing to learn from experience and see what needs to be done to further enhance workers’ protections. This is a reasonable and balanced approach, and that is why we as a government are willing to support these Family First amendments.

6  Application of amendments
The amendments made by items 1, 4 and 5 apply in relation to a workplace agreement lodged after the commencement of this item.
The evidence given by the ACTU and others to the committee inquiry into the Family First bill, the Workplace Relations (Restoring Family Work Balance) Amendment Bill 2007, was that even if Family First managed to extend the redundancy protection to five years—although it has now been cut back to two years—Work Choices does not protect retrenchment pay, because there is no guarantee that retrenchment pay will be included in an agreement. Family First is concerned about that. Workers may easily sign workplace agreements without realising that redundancy is not a protected award item—and maybe without realising the full implications of that not being a protected award item. In fact, workers and their families tend to concentrate on day-to-day issues and may assume that they will be entitled to redundancy payments as a matter of course. So Family First moves this second group of amendments as a way of tightening up the issue of redundancy for workers and making it part of a protected award condition.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I note the minister’s indication in discussion of the previous amendments that the government will not support this aspect of Senator Fielding’s amendments. I want to be clear with the chamber about what that means. Yet again, the Howard government is indicating that it is not prepared to protect redundancy entitlements, which have existed within the Australian industrial relations scheme for many years. This is the government again saying that it is not prepared to place redundancy pay into the category of protected award conditions. So that means they are not protected—even though ‘protection’ under the Work Choices legislation is one of those Orwellian terms which certainly in the past has had very little meaning and will only have some meaning after the introduction of the fairness test.
The fact that the government will oppose this amendment means that redundancy pay will not be considered as part of the fairness test. What that means in practical terms is that an employee who has negotiated a reasonable redundancy entitlement over a period of employment—or who simply has the minimum redundancy entitlement as per the standard AIRC test case—can have that removed by a ‘take it or leave it’ AWA or by a new agreement. Under the government’s new so-called fairness test, they will not receive any fair compensation for those redundancy entitlements being traded away. So we are, yet again, very clear on the Howard government’s attitude to redundancy entitlements. I do agree with Senator Fielding that, for many working families, this is often a significant source of security. It is something that people and families rely on. It has been in place for many years, in recognition of the financial dislocation that being made redundant causes an employee and their family.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-20,"—The Democrats support the view that awards should be limited in extent. We supported the fact that federal awards were reduced from an open-ended approach to 20 allowable award matters. We now think that, in view of the way modern industrial relations is progressing, the safety net will permit further reduction in allowable award matters. In our own policy we think that 16 is the appropriate number. Having got to that position, you then have to ask: what should those allowable award matters be? In our view, redundancy should be one of those. It is a vital and integral part of the safety net that should apply.
What I like about Senator Fielding’s approach is that it replicates the Democrats long-term approach that, firstly, redundancy is important and should be protected in these ways; and, secondly, it should not be overly prescriptive—in other words, the development of the actual terms of redundancy should be relevant to the industry, relevant to the enterprise and relevant to the individual. The statute should not seek to be overly prescriptive in that area; it should merely require that redundancy pay be properly protected. So, in view of our long championing of this particular aspect of core conditions that should apply to Australians in a First World society, we of course do support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-06-20,"—The government oppose this amendment, as previously indicated. The law provides that redundancy provisions are allowable, but if the parties do not want to have them as part of their agreement then we believe that is appropriate for them to consider.
If it were something that were to be considered as an absolute, then of course you would not be giving exemption to small businesses that employ fewer than 15. So there is already an undermining of the assertion that this is an absolute fundamental, because I think we are all agreed—other than the Greens—that small businesses that employ fewer than 15 should be exempted. We also have the situation where there may be project-specific employment and also casual workers for whom it may be inappropriate, and that is why we say that these matters should be allowed to be dealt with in the marketplace on the basis of what is best suited to the needs of the workers and the employers. As a result, we as a government oppose the amendments.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-20,"—The Greens, as will have become evident during the debate, think that redundancy is a very important issue. We did seek to move an amendment to deal with the issue of redundancy by ensuring that it was a minimum condition of the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Family First has taken a slightly different tack, but again it addresses the issue of redundancy. I think none of us on this side of the chamber is surprised that the government will not support it. A range of amendments should have been made to this bill to make it a true Stronger Safety Net and to provide fairness, because there are many holes and loopholes in the so-called safety net that in fact have not been amended. Honestly, of course I am not surprised that the government will not support it.
The minister was right when he said that the Greens would not support an exemption for small business. We believe that these rules should apply, the same as we believe that unfair dismissal rules should apply, to everybody—all workers and all businesses. That is the same as we believe should apply for people’s expectancy of redundancy. So, while we think that our amendment was better, obviously we support moves to improve redundancy and require it as a protected allowable matter. It is a bit of a different approach, but we support it—but I am not surprised that the government does not.
Question negatived.
Bill, as amended, agreed to.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-20,"—The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007 has of course been the subject of a fair bit of attention in recent days, although Labor certainly would have welcomed greater scrutiny of such a significant change to the legislation which manages the PBS. Given the fundamental importance of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to the health of Australians, Labor would have appreciated more time for the parliament to undertake a longer and more substantial analysis of such complex and fundamental changes and to allow for improvements to be debated. For legislation that was flagged last November, it is extremely disappointing that the government was not able to make draft legislation available to the parliament or to key stakeholders until early May and only introduced this bill on 24 May. Then, without so much as a courtesy call to the shadow minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing threw some amendments to the bill into the mix a week later. Finally—with all respect to my colleagues on the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, who did very well within the constraints served up to them—we saw what can only be described as an extremely truncated Senate inquiry process. The Howard government, I am afraid, makes a mockery of this parliament when it refers a bill to a committee on a Thursday, holds a hearing for half a day on the Friday and expects a report scrutinising the bill to be tabled the following Monday—but that is exactly what we saw with this bill.
While Labor acknowledges that there have been many months worth of planning and discussion about these changes and that industry has been well consulted, there has been too little time available with the legislation before us to really examine the impact of these changes. And, while industry has been generally supportive of the package, consumer groups, academics and other advocates have expressed concerns, too few of which have been adequately examined in recent weeks. The sort of time frame imposed on the Senate committee severely curtailed its capacity to perform the tasks charged to it. As the community affairs committee itself recorded in its report in respect of this bill:
... this very short inquiry has provided insufficient time to analyse the specifics of some concerns raised in evidence, especially in relation to longer term possible impact of these reforms.
Of course, this approach to legislation and long-term reform is exactly what we have come to expect from this government and from this minister. Yet again we are in the position of having to ram through another significant piece of legislation with what many of us feel is totally inadequate analysis or scrutiny.
As my colleague the shadow minister for health emphasised in the other place, Labor knows that the PBS has been the envy of other countries around the world for its ability to control the cost to consumers yet also be a workable and predictable system for the industry. There is no doubt that the changes proposed in this bill are some of the most significant changes since Labor created the PBS. We want to be confident that this is the right step—something that this process has not allowed any participant to feel.
My colleague the shadow minister for health outlined a number of Labor’s concerns in her second reading speech. Firstly, the government asserts that this bill will deliver massive savings—some $3 billion over 10 years. Labor has been trying for months, without success, to uncover exactly where these savings will be drawn from. The government is hiding behind the general idea of ‘savings’ without explaining that the savings are to government, not consumers, and, in the worst-case scenario, may be at the expense of the consumer. These issues were not clarified to Labor’s satisfaction in the Senate committee process, which actually heard evidence from the Generic Medicines Industry Association, or GMiA, which completely contradicted the government’s claim.
The stated aim of the PBS reforms, of which this bill is part, is to ‘give Australians continued access to new and expensive medicines while ensuring that the PBS remains economically sustainable into the future’. This is an aim which, of course, Labor endorses. The shadow minister for health outlined Labor’s concerns in her second reading contribution when she stated that we wanted ‘to be assured and convinced that there were adequate protections for consumers within this package so that family budgets do not bear the brunt of the price reductions to government through increased costs at the pharmacy counter’. When the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs asked the department what savings from these changes might be expected to accrue into the hands of the customers of pharmacies, it was told that, while the department was aware of the Pharmacy Guild’s estimates, the department itself had not done any independent modelling. Labor remains concerned that the impacts on consumers have not been satisfactorily explored. The committee itself recognised its own concerns in this regard. In its report on the inquiry into the bill, it stated:
The Committee considers that as the changes implemented by the Bill will have major implications for the sustainability of the PBS and will impact on consumers and taxpayers, the Government should monitor the reforms as they are being progressively implemented and make as much information publicly available as possible.
The committee recommended that, 12 months after the implementation of the reforms, the minister report to the Senate on the impact of those changes, particularly the cost of medicines to consumers. Labor supports this recommendation and will move amendments to this effect.
The second area of concern is the impact of these legislative changes on the generics industry. As was noted in the committee’s hearings, generics have not had the market share in Australia that they have had in other countries, and the changes in this legislation do not provide any price signal to consumers to encourage greater use of generics. The common theme and criticism of this reform is that it does not do enough to facilitate the development of—and, indeed, may lead to the erosion of—the Australian generic medicines sector. Labor has always seen a strong generic sector as essential to increasing price competition in the Australian medicines sector, to reduce the cost to government and to ensure the future sustainability of the PBS. Labor would have welcomed a greater opportunity to explore some of these suggestions put forward by representatives of the generics industry at the Senate inquiry—for example, the use of financial incentives for consumers to use generic medicines—but, as I have already commented, the time frame in which we have been operating has severely curtailed any investigations of this nature. The government did announce in the budget a $20 million public awareness campaign to promote the use of generic medicines. Labor supports this campaign and will be monitoring its rollout to ensure that it is effectively targeted.
In addition to the issues already raised by Labor, a number of additional issues were explored in the Senate inquiry—firstly, concerning the transparency of processes being implemented by the department. As I noted earlier, the industry has been well consulted with regard to this package and is generally supportive of the reforms. However, it seems that not all have been equally consulted in the negotiations. Concerns have been expressed by the generics industry, consumer groups, academics and other advocates that they have been locked out of some discussions, with particular concern regarding the composition of the Access to Medicines Working Group. While the department argued that this working group essentially formalises the long-term, frequent and informal relations between the Department of Health and Ageing and Medicines Australia, and sometimes also the PBAC, concerns remain among other stakeholders that this group would inform decision making and that those stakeholders excluded from the group would also be excluded from the decision-making process. While representatives of the department argued that there would be a process of consulting and engaging with other stakeholders if anything were to come out of this group that would affect others, concerns around the transparency of the body remain. The Senate committee recognised these concerns in its third recommendation, which was that the department make publicly available information on the outcomes of the process being employed to effect the changes contained in the bill.
The treatment of combination products was another area of considerable discussion in the committee process. Combination products are products made up of more than one chemical, where pricing is usually based on the sum of the cost of the individual components, in accordance with PBS guidelines. The bill proposed a separate list for single brand fixed dose combination products and states that the price of these products would be linked to the price of the component parts. This would mean that the price of the combination products would fall in accordance with the mandatory price reductions for the component parts of the products. As I said, this is a complex piece of legislation and a half-day inquiry is not enough to be able to get your head around these sorts of issues.
Medicines Australia suggested to the Senate committee that the reform package could be improved by amendment to the way in which combination products were treated, recommending that single brand combination products should be classified into the F1 formulary, where they would effectively be protected from the mandatory price reductions to the F2 formulary. The department in turn argued that ‘the treatment of single brand combination products under these proposed reforms is highly consistent with the way in which combination products are currently priced’ and would ensure that the combination products would not be ‘priced in a different way to the component parts’. The committee considered this evidence and in its conclusions acknowledged the need to ensure that, ‘when a combination drug has been demonstrated to be no more effective than its component drugs, the level of the subsidy for the combination drug should be no more than that justified on the basis of its components’.
The committee subsequently recommended that the bill be amended to allow the minister, in determining the price of a combination drug when a statutory price reduction applies to its component drugs, to take into account the advice of the PBAC on whether the combination drug has advantages over its component drugs or other alternative therapies. In providing such advice the PBAC should consider evidence of significant improvements in compliance, clinical benefit or reduced toxicity associated with the combination drug compared to alternative therapies.
The government has moved amendments to the bill to reflect this recommendation. The amendments essentially represent a compromise between the proposed approach in the bill and Medicine Australia’s argument that combination products which provide an intrinsic value over and above their component parts should be treated differently in the formularies framework. Labor supports the government amendments, which will require PBAC to determine and advise the minister whether a combination product itself has an intrinsic value over its component parts which compels that the combination product should have a price advantage.
New section 101(4A6) provides guidance to the committee as to the factors it should consider when determining whether a therapy involving a combination item provides greater intrinsic value than its component parts. These factors include a significant improvement in patient compliance with the therapy or a significant improvement in efficacy or reduction in toxicity.
The department has noted that there are currently around 50 combination products on the PBS and that it is their inclination to send this entire list to the PBAC for assessment prior to the implementation of the 1 August 2008 price reductions. Labor believes that this is a sensible approach which will provide certainty to the pharmaceutical industry and flexibility to government.
A further area of concern noted in the Senate inquiry process but not explored sufficiently was around the concept of interchangeability. The bill adds a new provision in section 101(3BA) requiring the PBAC to consider whether or not a drug is ‘interchangeable on an individual patient basis’ and inform the minister. Dr Thomas Faunce, who appeared before the committee, argued that this new concept should be defined in the legislation. Departmental representatives argued before the committee that interchangeability:
... means that these drugs are pharmaceutically related, have the same mechanism of action and provide similar therapeutic outcomes at equivalent doses at the individual patient level.
While departmental officers were able to provide this definition verbally before the committee, it was a more complex exercise locating exactly where this definition was located. The department has argued that there is no need for a definition in the legislation as this is:
... one of the things that the PBAC looks at ... it is really formalising a role that the PBAC already has that has not really been mentioned.
However, the lack of transparency around the concept remains a concern to Labor, particularly as critics of this change maintain that this new concept of interchangeability will raise the burden of proof required to list a drug in the new F2 formulary, creating an opening for dug companies to argue that their drugs are not interchangeable and hence that they should remain in the F1 formulary. Labor remains concerned that this area remains unresolved—and we will keep an eye on how the legislation plays out in this area.
Labor’s approach to health is a compassionate one—we must care for those around us who are ill and need our support. But our approach is also one that goes hand in hand with our economic strategy. Clever health spending cannot and should not been seen merely as a cost but also as an investment in the nation’s future. Drugs play an important role in chronic disease management—they always have and they increasingly will.
Medicines funded under the PBS play a vital role in prolonging the active working lives of Australians. Used responsibly, medicines have the potential to improve both workforce productivity and participation, in addition to saving money in other parts of the health system. Responsible spending on the PBS contributes to improved economic growth and should be seen as an investment, not simply a cost.
To continue to improve participation in the workforce, we will need to maintain and enhance the health of our ageing Australian population. Continued access to medicines through the PBS will play a significant role in improving productivity. Medicines can positively contribute to workplace productivity and economic growth. By treating symptoms and extending life, medicines improve peoples’ activities and functions in daily life, including their physical, social, emotional and cognitive wellbeing. These all contribute to a person’s ability to participate in the community and in the economy—a value we must not forget. Labor will support this bill and the amendments that I have highlighted, but, as I say, we will continue to keep a close eye on how the legislation plays out.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2007-06-20,"—We have heard and we will continue to hear just how complex the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007 is. I am not going to take time up in the chamber today working through the various technical aspects of this bill. We have had that and we will continue to have that, and Senator McLucas has passed on a few of the issues that are important for us to consider. But I felt I needed to put some statement on record today as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which considered this bill.
I know that Senator McLucas mentioned our concerns about the focus and the process of our legislative committee, but I think it is essential to put on record the fear and anger that I have as a member at the lost opportunity that has been inflicted on the Senate and the wider community to effectively consider the impact of the PBS changes that are before us today. I do not pretend that there will be a large number of individual citizens in our community who will want to know every detail of the changes that are proposed in this legislation, but there are some who will. Even with the outrageous time frame that the government imposed on this committee, we were able to receive nine full submissions, and a number of other organisations and individuals made phone inquiries and raised concerns.
What was clear and what continues to be clear to all of us is that the Australian medical industry, the Australian pharmaceutical industry and many individual Australians have a great deal of regard for our PBS system. We have heard before here and we have seen in the literature and in the academic institution research that there is wide respect for the PBS. There is almost an individual relationship between people in our community and this system. It has been respected, it has grown with people over the last 40 years and there is a sense of ownership around the way it operates. People understand that there is a system provided by their government which gives them support to obtain safe, effective and cost-effective medicines in this country. So, when it is proposed that complex changes be introduced to this legislation, people demand to be advised about what is happening; they need to know what the impact on their own processes and on their safety is going to be.
When we had the American free trade agreement discussions, I think two years ago now, there was a huge component of public interest, media interest and also industry interest about whether that free trade agreement would have an impact on the PBS system. You would remember that there was extensive discussion in this place that varied between fear about what may happen and a commitment to ensure that the core values of the PBS would be retained by all governments into the future. That was a promise that was made. Now, as always, as legislation is introduced down the track, people need to know what is going on, and they are asking the questions.
We know that there is an ongoing process—no legislation remains untouched—and, particularly with the PBS, ongoing attempts need to be made to ensure that cost effectiveness is not only maintained but also backed up by an absolute security in the safety of all pharmacy products that are put before the Australian public. We have had that. There has been a sense of security in the process. All discussions around the, I think, almost iconic institution of the PBS must be based on safety being the No. 1 consideration, and after that comes the cost effectiveness of the process. Of course, we know that every system must be economically viable, and the cost effectiveness of the PBS to the government must be maintained. There is a shared commitment to that. Everyone understands that we must have the best possible way of ensuring that best prices are maintained so that effective innovation in the industry can continue. When people start talking about the figures involved in the cost of drug innovation and exploration, I get completely overwhelmed, because it does cost a lot of money for organisations to scientifically research and develop effective medications. We need to understand that, and we do. There is no question about the need to have the best spend for the Australian taxpayers’ dollar around ensuring that the PBS system is strengthened and maintained.
Underlying that, there must be a sense that the consumer is going to receive the best possible product. That is not just with the ongoing debate around this legislation, with the difference between drugs that have patents on them and the time when they come off patent, and we have that wide, burgeoning industry of generic medicines. A lot of the debate around these particular changes before us today is about the process of maintaining that, so that we are able to ensure that drugs are assessed adequately and that, when there are options, people are made aware of those options and the costs are maintained so that we are able to keep a solid base cost and people can receive good medication without either themselves or the government overpaying for it.
The various technical aspects of the different formularies and what drugs are going to go into them will be spelt out in detail in the legislation. What detail is not in the legislation is going to be placed in regulations that will evolve as the process continues. I want to say yet again, as I do consistently, that, when we have complex legislation before us which indicates that a lot of the detail is going to be in regulations and we have not got the regulations, I always have trouble. I cannot guarantee that I would understand all the regulations, but I am sure I would be able to get effective advice so that at least I would be able to see how the whole package operates. Very rarely can one stream in health legislation work by itself. We have the core legislation and then the regulation that works with it that allows the flexibility for things to be amended more quickly.
People in the industry do understand this legislation. They do study it, as we have found out through our committee process and through the range of visits that we have all had from people representing different areas of the industry. They do read and understand every element of the debate and they have quite specific questions, which they raised with us in the committee process. I return to my overwhelming concern of losing the valuable opportunity, through examining this bill in the committee process, to assuage some of the fears, to address some of the concerns and, most importantly, to keep the open discussion going. On a number of issues that came up in the committee process, we heard quite determined evidence by people who felt that things could be done better, who felt that there were threats to the PBS; there were specific allegations that things were put in the wrong area under the PBS. That came out in the committee process and the detail is available, for those who wish to read it, in Hansard and in our committee report.
When we were able to receive professional information from the department, when they came as witnesses to the committee, we were able to directly clear up a number of the issues. This is the value of the committee process: getting people together, making sure—through evidence, through submissions and through responses—that we are able to work effectively, through the Senate, to ensure that issues are clarified. It does not guarantee agreement, and we will probably see that when we go through the amendment process today. But nonetheless, we are able to work effectively towards coming to some understandings that make the legislation better. And we saw that even in the one-day process that we had on this bill. A number of the concerns that were raised about how people thought this legislation would work were cleared up simply by having that before us and being able to work through it. This is why I am disappointed. If we had had more time to get more discussion going, we may then have been able to have a stronger basis on which to move forward in this area. It is disappointing that, even at this stage of the process, we are still arguing about the lack of effective communication and consultation.
Now we know that the government, through the departmental processes, have regular meetings with the key stakeholders and certainly with the Pharmacy Guild. It was in evidence that there has been ongoing discussion with the Pharmacy Guild and their members about their role in this process, and we know there is a specialist agreement with the Pharmacy Guild and the government. That is strong and that should be maintained. We also had the same discussion with Medicine Australia and also with consumers in different times at different places. But there must be an opportunity for all of the stakeholders to get together at different times, to be able to at least hear—sometimes hear again, because there are certain people who do not move forward with their arguments, but nonetheless to get on the table again—what the key issues are.
Certainly a couple of the amendments that we have wanted to discuss with the government have been looking at that. We have been looking at clear definitions in the process. We have also been looking at a kind of monitoring process that would re-establish the role of the consumer, because, as I have said, from my point of view the role of the consumer must be absolutely valued in anything to do with our health system and in particular with the PBS. We had evidence from health consumers during the committee hearings that they were keen to continue in this way, in particular to see exactly what the impact of changes would be on the cost to people across Australia of their medicines. We have seen over the last decade an enormous rise in the co-contributions, and that has gone through this place in terms of exactly how the PBS operates for people who are going to purchase drugs at their pharmacies. The co-contributions have risen dramatically over last few years, but generally when people have understood how the process works they have understood the cost of the development of medication and they have had the security that the drugs they are going to be receiving on the Australian market are absolutely safe, that they are the best in the world that can be available.
They also understand that there is a genuine commitment from the government to minimise the cost and also to ensure access to generic brands. This is an industry that has risen in our country, as it has across the world. Generic products give people a choice at every level about the purchase of the medication that they going to receive. This is something that we on this side of the chamber celebrate with the government—that is, the decision to have the education campaign about the best use of generic products. There was some discussion at the committee about the best way of doing the program, and of course that is something that will evolve as it develops. But it seems to me one of the absolutely critical elements of how this legislation is going to work is the community understanding of exactly how the process operates, their understanding about the safety elements of using generic products, their understanding of their rights as consumers to work with their doctors so that they have some ownership over the types of medications they are purchasing and to be able to question that. It is part of the ongoing education process, which we have talked about many times, that an individual takes ownership of their own health, and the individual ownership of their health extends to the PBS process because this is an area where, once again, the person who is having treatment should have the knowledge about the treatment they are receiving and be able to engage effectively with the health providers who prescribe the medication as well as those who give it out at the pharmacy. That is something that we do celebrate, and it is an ongoing aspect of the legislation.
We are disappointed that there has not been more open dialogue about the process. We hope that, once again, that is a message we can take into the future. We are supporting the recommendation about the combination drugs because that came out clearly in the evidence, both in the written submissions, particularly from Medicine Australia, and in the evidence given before us at the committee. This is an aspect that can be looked at, and we are looking forward to the government’s response on that.
We acknowledge, as part of the government and also as health consumers, that the PBS is something that should be valued in our community. It is at many levels. We do expect that there is an increased understanding in the community about the way it works, and that came out consistently. Over the last 15 years there has been a growth in understanding of the way it operates and more questions are being asked by consumers about their rights in the system about not only the co-payment but also their right to question the way it works and to question what processes are put before them.
I would like to thank the organisations who gave their time and who responded so quickly to our committee requests. They came up with extremely detailed submissions. I would like to thank the department in particular and the officers of the department who gave their time to brief the committee. We could have done with a lot more, and we will continue to ask for this support, because, as we know, the PBS changes will continue. This is not a finite process; it will continue. I particularly note the speed with which they came back to the committee with responses to question that were raised. I also want to take this opportunity to thank the secretariat for helping us put together this report so quickly. We had the committee hearing and very detailed questions and comments came out and then we were reporting back to this place on Monday. If you do the maths, you can understand how speedily people had to get their heads across the process and get responses back. We are supporting the legislation, as Senator McLucas has said. There is a shared commitment to ensuring that the PBS is maintained and valued in this community. We do expect that there will be close monitoring of the impact on all stakeholders in this process and we do expect that, as changes continue to happen in this legislation, there will be a definite attempt to engage all of us so that we can work together to make this the best possible system we can have.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-06-20,"—Before I begin I would like to acknowledge Senator Moore’s wonderfully informative and passionate contribution to this debate. I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007.There are a number of matters in respect of this bill which deserve the attention of the Senate and the concern of members of the community. As senators will be aware by now, I take particular interest in the government’s actions when they concern the integrity of Australia’s universal health system, Medicare.
This government is full of rhetoric about its ongoing commitment to Medicare; however, when its actions over the past 11 years with regard to health are looked at closely there is a huge chasm between rhetoric and reality. For example, in its 11 years in office the Howard government has presided over the greatest stuff-up of medical practitioner training this country has ever experienced. No amount of self-serving spin will explain away the critical shortage of doctors created by the Howard government, particularly as it will take a decade or more to recover from it. As a result of the Howard government’s mismanagement, small country towns have now been forced down the path of incredible incentive payments to get a doctor into their town. Just last week the story made the news that one local shire is supporting a payment of up to half a million dollars—and that is on top of a salary of almost a quarter of a million dollars—to get a doctor. The Howard government has betrayed rural communities on a scale never witnessed before. The outcome is that rural Australia is now paying big time for the Howard government’s ‘she’ll be right because the market will deliver’ attitude. When is the Prime Minister going to wake up and work out that market forces alone are not going to deliver medical services to rural Australia?
What is more important than having access to life-saving medical care? There is no alternative. The Commonwealth government has a responsibility to do something about this sorry state of affairs. In my view, this bill is setting up Australia’s highly regarded universal health system for another hit courtesy of the Howard government. Already we are seeing patients having to meet an increasing share of the cost of PBS medicines as the gap between the cost of PBS medicines and PBS benefits widens.
There is now a real suspicion that the most significant changes to the PBS proposed in this bill have been driven by a need for the Australian government to appease US interests following Australia’s signing of the free trade agreement with America. We should be under no illusion: the pressure is on from the US drug manufacturers to bring about an increase in the price of PBS medicines in Australia. US drug companies and players in the US administration are very antagonistic to the fact that the prices of many medicines in Australia are significantly lower than they are in the US. For the US drug manufacturers, free trade with the US translates to Australians paying the same exorbitant prices for medicines as do US citizens.
Historically, the actions of our nation’s government have ensured that all Australians have affordable access to world’s best practice pharmaceutical treatments. This is something we cannot afford to have put at risk. Government involvement in the pricing and availability of PBS medicines extends to ensuring that Australians, regardless of where they live, are able to access required medical and pharmaceutical services. We know that the availability of medical practitioners, particularly GPs, often depends on where you live. We also know that, despite progressive improvements in average health status and longevity, there are far too many Australians whose health status and longevity remain well below those of the rest of the population.
Australians have a right to know how much of this difference can be attributed to sharp differences across the country in access to medical services. Available statistics indicate that people living in the mining and pastoral electorate of Kalgoorlie, which takes in all the Kimberley and the Pilbara, have half the access to Medicare GP services of people living in the leafy harbour side and North Shore electorates of Sydney. On a population basis, the Howard government spends in the order of $50 million to $60 million per annum less on Medicare GP services in the electorate of Kalgoorlie than what it is prepared to spend on Medicare GP services for people living in the well-heeled suburbs of Sydney. The statistics are not available but I suspect that the story with regard to access to PBS medicines would be similar.
The fact is that, the further from the centre of a capital city or the eastern seaboard you live, the more difficult it is to get timely access to comprehensive medical care when you need it. Take my home state of Western Australia as an example: the average per capita Medicare medical and PBS services are well below the national average. In other words, Western Australians on average have significantly less access to medical and PBS services than do other Australians. Lack of access to medical practitioner services inevitably results in lower levels of access to PBS medicines. It is difficult not to conclude that the lower health status and higher death rates of many people living in the Pilbara and Kimberley, particularly Indigenous Australians, are related in large part to poor access to Medicare medical practitioner services and PBS medicines. There is absolutely no point in the government claiming to be a supporter of Australia’s universal health system when it has allowed such uneven access to Medicare services to remain unaddressed after over a decade in government.
The truth is that the Howard government has no real commitment to protecting the rights of all Australians, no matter where they live in Australia, to access high-quality health care under the Medicare scheme. In 2005-06, average national per capita access to Medicare, medical and PBS services was, respectively, 14 per cent and 16 per cent higher than in Western Australia. Clearly, Western Australians are not receiving the same level of medical care as other Australians are. In 2005-06 the figures show Western Australians received three million fewer medical practitioner services and 2½ million fewer pharmaceutical services than the rest of the country. The provision of a lower level of Medicare, medical and PBS services to Western Australians saves the Howard government approximately $250 million annually. No wonder the Howard government has got hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to splash around on blatant, self-serving propaganda in the run-up to an election.
There are other examples that show how the Howard government is all talk and no substance when it comes to ensuring that all Australians have access to a fair and universal health system. The Howard government’s callous disregard to ensuring all Australians have universal and comparable access to needed medical and pharmaceutical services falls most heavily on, sadly, Indigenous Australians. Approximately 26 per cent of Indigenous Australians live in remote or very remote parts of Australia. I do not need to remind senators that Indigenous Australians continue to experience on average an appalling health status compared to other Australians who live in Australia’s capital cities and who have ready access to medical practitioners and required medicines. As the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has reported, the death rate of Indigenous Australians is over 1.4 times that of non-Indigenous Australians. Even worse, the death rate of Indigenous infants is 3.1 times greater than that of non-Indigenous infants.
These are scandalous figures when put against the relatively lavish way the Howard government is prepared to fund Medicare medical services in the well-off electorates of Sydney. Take for example access to Medicare safety net payments. I draw your attention to the Medicare safety net payment figures for 2005-06. To cite an example, the New South Wales electorate of Wentworth received $7.8 million in safety net payments. This was 16 times more than the total Medicare safety net payments received by people living in the large rural federal seat of O’Connor in Western Australia, despite the electorates having similar populations. The median annual family income in the Wentworth electorate at the 2001 census was no less than $86,000; however, in 2001 the median annual family income in the electorate of O’Connor was $38,000. In the electorate of Wentworth, only 10.5 per cent of families had a weekly income of $500 or less, while in the electorate of O’Connor 32.3 per cent of families were living on a family income of $500 or less. Under the Howard government, the higher your income, the better access you have to medical and PBS services.
On top of that, if you live in a higher income area you get a Medicare safety net bonus. In 2005-06 the top 10 Medicare safety net electorates with a total resident population in excess of one million people, and who in 2001 had a median family income of approximately $80,000, received in total over $50 million in Medicare safety net payments. In comparison, the bottom 10 Medicare safety net electorates—located almost exclusively in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, with an average median family income of approximately $40,000—received in total only $3.7 million. That is 13 times less than the top 10 Medicare safety net electorates. Where is the universal access in that? Where is the equity for all Australians? I will tell you where it is—out the window; unless you reside in the leafy Sydney harbour-side suburbs or on the North Shore, which includes the electorates of Wentworth, North Sydney, Bradfield, Warringah and Mackellar.
Australian patients, and patients throughout the world, deserve to have the best treatment options made available to them. One way to ensure this remains the case is for publicly employed Australian medical practitioners and researchers to continue to be actively supported by the Commonwealth—both on our shores and within the global pharmaceutical market. Australia’s public health system and its publicly funded medical researchers are, and continue to be, significant contributors in the advancement, development and use of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. Very recently, two Western Australian medical researchers who worked in Perth’s public teaching hospitals were awarded a Nobel Prize for their outstanding contribution to medical science. It is, therefore, well to remember that it is not unusual for advances in drug therapies to have come from research conducted in research laboratories attached to the country’s major public teaching hospitals, not just from laboratories of transnational pharmaceutical companies.
This bill has neatly packaged two important changes to the PBS arrangements. Firstly, it contains a measure that should have the effect of putting downward pressure on the prices of generic drugs. This is a good thing. Secondly, it contains a measure that may seriously weaken price competition between generic medicines and branded medicines. It would be a rather pointless exercise if this bill opened the door for drug companies to exploit the PBS to reduce price competition, rather than consumers getting the benefit from the lower cost generic medicines that the bill professes to support. In regard to generic drug pricing, I think it is true to say that the major pharmaceutical companies are not very supportive of the encroachments of generic medicines into the lucrative branded medicines market. I might also add that the medical profession have not been great advocates of prescribing generic medicines to their patients. It is typically pharmacists, rather than doctors, who are more likely to bring a patient’s attention to a lower priced equivalent generic medicine as a substitute for the brand name medicine on the doctor’s prescription.
This bill purports to strengthen the government’s stance on the pricing of generic medicines and, if all goes to plan, it could result in substantial savings to the government in respect to the cost of the PBS. That is good news. The bad news is that these savings will only be passed on in full measure to patients if doctors prescribe generic medicines where these are available for the required treatment. That is because the government subsidises a PBS listed medicine based on the competitive pricing of multi-brand medicines available in the market. When a medicine comes out of a patent and is able to be manufactured by multiple drug companies, this invariably has the effect of reducing the price of the drug due to competition. If doctors fail to prescribe the lower priced generic medicines and patients are not offered an alternative at the point of sale, patients will end up having to pay a larger gap for medications.
There is evidence that this may already be occurring. In the period from 2002-03 to 2005-06, the direct cost to patients of PBS listed drugs increased by 30.7 per cent, while the cost to the government increased by only 17.7 per cent. In other words, there has been a significant shift in PBS cost from the government to individuals in recent years. The question arises as to whether the legislative changes proposed in this bill will increase the incentive for the Liberal coalition government to shift an even greater share of the cost of PBS to individual patients. It will hardly be a great outcome for patients if the main result of the government’s proposed amendments to the PBS legislation is to shift more of the cost of medicines from the government to individual patients. Ultimately, the government’s attempt to reap the economic benefits of multibrand medicine price competition will only flow to patients if doctors are conscientious in their prescribing habits. The Australian Medical Association would do well to take this point to heart and aggressively encourage its members to help drive taxpayer health dollars further by prescribing generic medicines wherever possible as a valid substitute to a brand name medicine.
I would now like to move on to the measure contained in this bill that proposes two separate lists of PBS drugs: one for single brand medicines—medicines regarded as not interchangeable with any other; and one for multibrand, or generic, medicines. In Australia, as the government has stated, generic medicines account for approximately 18 per cent of medicines dispensed under the PBS. This is less than half the market share of generic medicines in the United States and the United Kingdom. The pharmaceutical industry knows full well that any substantial expansion in the number of generic drugs dispensed in Australia through the PBS will see a financial loss for them.
In the Weekend Australian of 9 June 2007, Professor David Henry, an expert in clinical pharmacology from the University of Newcastle, had this to say:
While accepting that a drug, on average, is no better than an older product, a doctor can often find a reason why a new product is not strictly interchangeable in every patient. As a consequence companies will likely argue for higher prices for drugs that do not offer better measurable performance, on the grounds that someone, somewhere, has a unique need for their products.
If the proportion of generic medicines used in Australia was in line with the US and the UK, this would reduce Australian taxpayer payments to pharmaceutical companies by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Hence, it is logical that the pharmaceutical industry is keen to see measures enacted which have the potential to lessen competition from generic drugs.
The Department of Health and Ageing has estimated that patents of over 100 medicines are due to expire over the next 10 years. With the enactment of this bill as it is, a new game will come to town: when is a generic medicine a generic medicine? I refer again to Professor David Henry in the Weekend Australia where, in referring to the amendments in this bill, he says:
On the one hand these aim (laudably) to cheapen generic drugs. On the other hand they appear to be designed to protect the patented products of the big drug manufacturers from having their newer products compared, for pricing purposes, with cheaper older products that work just as well.
He goes on to say:
The first formulary (Fl) will list drugs that are only available as a single brand and are not considered “interchangeable” at the patient level. The drugs listed in F1 will not be pricelinked to the drugs in the second formulary (F2), which will mainly be older drugs available in multiple brands. By requesting that drugs be proven “interchangeable” before they are priced down to the level of older equally effective products, the industry has made it harder for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to base their decisions on the results of clinical trials. This is a move away from evidence-based medicine, which has become a major driving force in modern clinical care.
The idea of the two lists seems to have been adopted by the government following concerns from the pharmaceutical industry that, in certain low-volume situations, it is therapeutically useful for a relatively small number of patients to have access to a particular brand name medicine rather than to a very closely related generic substitute. In other words, the bill contains a device whereby medicine manufacturers may be able to significantly reduce competition from generic medicines.
As medical patents expire, drug manufacturers may be inclined to tinker with the formulation of particular brand name medicines on the pretext of unique therapeutic benefit for particular patients. Given the hundreds of millions of dollars of sales revenue at stake from the expansion of generic medicine use in Australia, it is inevitable that drug manufacturers will have a strong incentive to test the government’s capacity to manage this device. I think it is alarming that experts in the field of pharmacology, such as Professor Henry, have identified the real possibility for drug manufacturers to protect their products from competition, yet the government seems oblivious to the problem.
This has already been pointed out in the other place but it needs to be stated again: Labor’s approach to the PBS is based on three core principles. I encourage the government to adopt the same principles. I know that the member for Warringah pays attention to my speeches about health. I hope he is tuned in on the other side. I am sure he will be paying attention to this contribution. The question is: will he and the government act? Sadly, I doubt it.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS SCHEME) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-06-20,"—The Greens have real concerns about the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007. In many ways, those concerns have been outlined by Senator Moore and Senator Sterle in the incisive speeches they just delivered to the chamber. This is very complicated territory, which is where we all need to concentrate a little more because otherwise it can lead to legislation that is not in the public interest getting through simply because it is not understood by the body politic.
The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an Australian institution which has been envied by countries around the world, but is also a matter of some chagrin for the globally big pharmaceutical companies which want to make more out of drugs. They are amongst the biggest income earners in the world. They earn phenomenal profits and they have huge political clout and the last thing they want to see is the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as practiced in Australia, which is aimed at getting value for money in dispensing clinically effective drugs to the Australian community, spread elsewhere. Australians voted for this scheme in a 1946 constitutional referendum and therefore it has an unequivocal democratic mandate. The PBS provides universal subsidised access to medicines to the Australian community. Along with Medicare and the public hospital system, it forms a central component of Australia’s much envied health system.
The PBS has been in operation for almost 60 years, and some of the benefits were first made available way back in June 1948. It has evolved, from supplying a limited number of life-saving and disease-preventing drugs free of charge to the community, into a broader subsidised scheme. Currently the PBS subsidises access to more than 600 medicines available in 1,800 forms and marketed as 2,600 differently branded items. The PBS covered around 168 million prescriptions in the year to June 2006. That is about eight prescriptions per Australian. It covers all Australian residents when they fill a prescription for a medicine listed on the schedule. So it would be a very rare person indeed who has not, in some way or other, benefited from the scheme—and known about the benefit of the scheme.
General patients pay up to $30.70 for PBS medicines, while those with concession cards—over a million people on low incomes—pay up to $4.90. These payments are called patient contributions or co-payments and they are revised annually, in line with the consumer price index, and on other occasions when the government seeks to further increase the share of the cost of the PBS borne by individual patients. For example, there was a 30 per cent increase in co-payments on 1 January 2005 which, you will remember, we opposed.
Government expenditure on the PBS for the year ending 30 June 2006—the last full year for which there are accounts—totalled $6.16 billion, compared with $6 billion for the previous years. That is up by 2.7 per cent. That amounts to about 83 per cent of the total cost of PBS prescriptions. The remainder of PBS expenditure is made up from those patient contributions—and that is increasing too. In this financial year’s budget papers it is suggested that PBS expenditure will increase to $6.433 billion in the current year and $7.279 billion the next year. Other governments are looking at this, and it worries the pharmaceutical industry greatly. I understand the Korean government is one of those that are studying the system at the moment.
The bill before us seeks to create a distinction between the way that generic drugs are priced and the way that new drugs with patent protection are priced. If the bill goes through, the US negotiators under the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement—we warned about this during the debate some years ago in this chamber—will have taken a step towards cutting the nexus between the price that will be paid for new patent protected drugs, largely coming from the big international corporations, and the existing drugs that deliver the same benefits. The result will be that Australian consumers and taxpayers will be paying higher prices for new drugs that are yet to be listed or that come on to the listing in Australia.
We were the only party to unequivocally oppose the inclusion of the PBS in the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which we opposed generally, because of its impact on a whole range of Australian economic and social considerations, from the agricultural industry right through to the health industry and the matter before us today. We predicted that the very thing that is happening in this bill would happen. In 2004, the chamber was told that the PBS would never be included in the free trade agreement. Then, after it was included almost from the start of negotiations, we were informed that no fundamental aspects of the PBS would change as a result. With the furore that arose through the passage of the evergreening amendment, little attention was paid to the creation of the medicines working group. I will be asking the government about that during the debate in the committee stages of this bill. Two key issues to focus on were the removal of the reference pricing and the role of the Medicines Working Group.
When it comes to reference pricing—as the previous two speakers from the opposition have made clear—Australia’s PBS is underpinned by this reference pricing system which links the amount paid for a drug by the Commonwealth on behalf of the Australian people to the relative effectiveness of that drug compared to drugs already available on the market and doing the same job. The US companies loathe reference pricing as they make their money inventing new drugs, patenting them and bringing them onto the market. I do not think things have changed since I was a general practitioner. I well recollect the bombarding of busy medical practitioners with information about new drugs—branding them as the thing your patients should have—and in practice finding no benefit over that available through other treatments or, if they had to be resorted to, from drugs already available on the market.
The notion that a drug should be priced according to what it can do to help patients rather than how much they claim it costs to produce is anathema to the big drug companies. They want to talk about getting a return on their investment and their research and development. That is how corporations work—they look at the bottom line—but the PBS is designed to give maximum benefit at the cheapest price to the Australian public. That is quite a different philosophy, and it clashes with the corporate philosophy. We will see the corporate philosophy have a win through the legislation before us, if it goes through this chamber.
Three years ago, when the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement was being negotiated, the US companies wanted reference pricing abolished. I have seen no evidence to say that they do not still want to see reference pricing abolished. Both governments on either side of the Pacific denied that this was a United States government objective. Mr Vaile, the then Minister for Trade, said:
... the Labor Party still cannot get the message. They cannot understand simple English: they are not going after the PBS.
That is, the drug companies are not going after the PBS. After it became clear that the drug companies were going after the PBS, the Prime Minister denied that they had succeeded. He said:
We have secured an absolute protection of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Yes, some of the American drug companies did try and get in under the radar on that subject, but we didn’t agree.
But it appears that the US drug companies are winning. They are getting their way. It is not a lay-down misere yet. This is a gradual process. However, we are seeing evidence of that in the legislation before us today. At the end of the day, it will be Australia’s pensioners and, indeed, all Australians who rely heavily on pharmaceuticals who will be paying the biggest price, or the taxpayers through the subsidy to the scheme paid by the government itself.
The Australia-US Free Trade Agreement included the formation of the access to medicines working group, which is made up of Medicines Australia and health department bureaucrats, to continue discussions about changes to the PBS. I will be asking some questions about this group, their role, where they are headed and what their philosophy is. The only substantive agenda item on the meeting of the first medicines working group that I am aware of was concerned with the pricing of pharmaceuticals.
The National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007, which is now before the Senate, undermines the reference pricing system that underpins and is a heartland to the success of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, going back for decades. The changes proposed in this legislation are exactly what the US drug companies are after and what they were after back in 2004. My questions about the Medicines Working Group include: isn’t this group and the department working closely and secretively—where are their minutes?—to change the nature of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to the detriment of all Australian consumers? The process is effectively outsourcing policy development on medicines in the PBS. Medicines Australia is the pharmaceutical equivalent of those policy working groups that benefit big corporations in other matters such as coal, tobacco, uranium and a whole range of other industry outcomes. I am putting that proposition, and I want to hear the government’s response to it, because we are here not to protect the interests of big pharmaceutical corporations but to protect the interests of Australians who are prescribed medicines for their health and at the lowest price possible. Where is the transparency in this process?
Let me finish with this: we trenchantly opposed the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. One of its problems is that, where there is a dispute between Australia and the US, arbitration goes to faceless organisations which are not obliged to report to this parliament. During that debate it was made abundantly clear that, when it came to arbitration, the appointees—three by the Minister for Trade in Australia and three by the President of the US—made a determination that there would be no input from this parliament or from the Australian public without their leave and that there would be no report back to this parliament, no transparency and no minutes. Even if there were a report to this parliament, it has no power left. This parliament was disempowered by that legislation, which was supported by both the big parties, from reviewing what those faceless arbiters would do and the impact that would have on Australians, whether they be in agriculture, in manufacturing, in the workplace or in issues like this.
This is not a dispute mechanism that we are talking about here; it is a policy development mechanism. This group ought to be accountable to this place. I will be asking the minister to table the minutes of this group so that we and the public are able to see how it functions, what it discusses, how its decisions are made and what its outcomes are. And if not, why not? Why the secrecy? This group is supposed to be acting on behalf of the Australian people. The Australian people cannot have faith in a process that is secret or when FOI applications have to be made to find out what it is doing. The deliberations and outcomes of this group should automatically come to this parliament for us and the people of Australia to investigate.
There are real concerns about this legislation and about the process that we are having in this place at the moment. Senator Moore spoke about how truncated the committee process was. That has been happening to everything since the government got control of the Senate and turned it into a rubber stamp for decisions made in the Prime Minister’s office and around the cabinet table. There will be an opportunity for Australians to change that and to take away that government majority at the election which is coming up later this year. But, for now, we are dealing with a situation where the government has the numbers to ram this legislation through, regardless of what the debate is. However, let us get more information about this matter and make sure that it is an informed chamber before this legislation comes to a vote, presumably later today.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2007-06-20,"—Before I make this speech, I would like to acknowledge Mr Ken Henrick, who is a retailer of some strength in Western Australia, and Mr John Cummings, who is the Chairman of NARGA, which represents the interests of the grocery industry in Western Australia.
I wanted to take the opportunity today to speak about the path that has led to historic legislation, which has been introduced to the House of Representatives today and will come up to the Senate probably at the next sitting, to amend the Trade Practices Act and particularly to strengthen the misuse of market power provisions of the act, which promote fair competition and protect business from unfair practices undertaken by their more powerful competitors. The legislation represents a big win for small business. For many years I have promoted trade practices reform to strengthen small business in the face of misuse of market power by market dominant firms.
In the late eighties, when Labor was in power, I went to then Minister Duffy and explained to him why he could not get his favourite yoghurt from the supermarket anymore. The retailers were charging such high upfront fees to suppliers that the yoghurt producer could no longer afford to buy the shelf space. I also had a good relationship with then Senator Chris Schacht, who had a soft spot for small business and some favours owed to him from the hierarchy of the previous Labor government. I suggested to him that he needed to call in some of those favours and help small business by strengthening the merger test. The outcome of this conversation contributed to Labor changing its position on trade practices reform and supporting a change to the merger provision to refuse those that substantially lessen competition in the market. The new definition changed the structure of markets in Australia by denying mergers of dominant players that would have decreased competition.
My interest in trade practices issues began with my experience as a manufacturer’s agent before entering parliament. I saw the increasing market domination in retail as a danger to healthy competition in Australia. I believe that a realistic aspiration to own your own business is the best way to maintain an equitable distribution of wealth in our society. This has been at the core of my work as a senator for 24 years. This week is a landmark in trade practices reform in this country. Today I want to explain its significance and importance to small business, whether a newsagent, chemist, car dealer, service station owner, grocer, hotelier, farmer or independent retailer. Yesterday the Treasurer introduced the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007. This will be the legal foundation on which Australia will build defences for its small business against the misuse of market power by dominant firms. The Treasurer deserves accolades for his foresight and determination to get this legislation right and get it through. It is a difficult job to balance the big and small business players and take both into consideration.
Small business has suffered from anticompetitive forces of misused market power. The High Court’s Boral decision in 2003 raised the threshold to the point where a business virtually had to hold a monopoly before it could be deemed to hold the legally required substantial degree of market power to proceed on a case alleging a breach of section 46 misuse of market power provisions. The ACCC has brought no new section 46 cases to court since Boral.
Further significant changes to trade practices were needed to keep Australian markets competitive. Numerous inquiries into supermarket domination have occurred. I brought various matters relating to the actions of large players to the attention of various ministers, Labor and coalition, who acted, but it was a piecemeal effort without legislative change. There were plenty of problems but, it seemed, very few solutions that could gain the necessary cross-political support from big and small businesses.
Small business was more hopeful when the most recent of these inquiries, chaired by Senator Brandis, gave support to recommendations to change section 46 of the TPA. Section 46 is vital to small business, as it sets the rules against the misuse of market power, including the practice of predatory pricing, where a business sells a product below cost to drive a competitor out of the market. Still, there was political inertia as long as the stalemate between big and small business continued.
The real breakthrough came when the Fair Trading Coalition, a small business group, talked with big business about measures advocated by the Dawson report, which the government was proposing to legislate. The government was proposing to legislate a change to section 46 and to collective bargaining, which small business needed. The outcome, after considerable effort, was the historical acceptance between small and big business sectors of a way forward for Dawson and trade practices reform. At this stage, February 2006, I went to the Treasurer armed with a single achievement. Essentially this consisted of three key areas: firstly, clarification in section 46 that a company can hold a substantial degree of market power without actually controlling the market and without complete freedom from the constraints of competition. This included legislative clarification that there can be more than one player in a market who can hold a substantial degree of power. The Boral case virtually took us back to the old monopoly test—where, if there were at least two big players in a market, it virtually meant that a business could not be deemed to hold a substantial degree of market power in a market. This new legislation would make it clear, for instance, that both Coles and Woolworths could be deemed by the court to hold a substantial degree of market power in the Australian grocery market and, hence, could be prosecuted under section 46 if they misused their market power against a small grocery store.
Secondly, there was a broad consensus on a predatory pricing amendment to section 46 to enable a court to consider the operation of a business supplying goods or services below cost and the reasons for this behaviour when deciding if that business holds a substantial degree of power in the market. This means that a court can consider below-cost selling over a significant period of time as an element in determining if a business holds a substantial degree of power in a market for the purposes of a section 46 case. Predatory pricing—where a business sells its product below cost to put a competitor out of business—is an example of the misuse of market power. If it could be shown that a national company was selling 500 gram packs of butter for an average of $1.50 across its stores whilst selling the same product for $1—below cost—in one small town with the purpose of knocking its competitor out of that market, then that would be a case of misuse of market power and predatory pricing.
Finally, the small business parties wanted to address concerns that the current section 46 does not enable adequate consideration of whether a misuse of market power action has resulted through coordination between two or more companies or through leveraging between two different markets. They wanted clarification that two businesses, when acting together, could be deemed to be unfairly competing. The Treasurer, encouraged by this new-found consensus, proceeded with reintroducing the Dawson bill. This would deliver much to big business, including the formal merger clearance process, and valuable collective bargaining provisions for small business. After my earlier personal discussions with the Treasurer, the proposed third-line forcing provision changes were dropped due to their damaging effect on small business. After further negotiations, the ACCC was made a full party to merger authorisation applications in the Australian Competition Tribunal. The bill passed the Senate.
Several discussions were held between the Treasurer’s office and small business groups—groups like NARGA and the Fair Trading Coalition, which includes chemists and newsagents—motor traders associations, hoteliers, HIA, the National Farmers Federation and COSBOA about delivering on the other agreed changes to trade practices. Roundtables were widened to include the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Fran Bailey, and more lately Senator Fielding. General agreement was reached on the thrust of proposed legislative reforms by this group. The government’s additional changes to section 51AC of the act, dealing with unilateral contract variations, were also discussed.
As part of these discussions on unconscionable conduct, concerns were raised by small business about the problems many businesses were having in negotiating fair retail tenancy leases. I applaud the Treasurer for announcing a Productivity Commission retail lease inquiry yesterday to address this important issue for small business. The bill will come to the Senate in due course, and I am confident that it truly reflects the breakthrough consensus reached between business and government. The outcome which has been negotiated with those most keenly affected, the leaders of respected industry groups, is a mark on the wall of trade practices reform in Australia. It is a credit to all involved and will do much to abate the negative impact of the unfortunate Boral decision, which was a key catalyst for renewed efforts for change. The trade practices amendments are long-awaited stabilisers for market conduct which threatens competition. There will always be more items on the agenda for trade practices, but this item deserves a standing ovation from all business.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Trade Practices Act</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-06-20,"—Yesterday in question time I had a question from Senator Murray on the government’s better superannuation reforms and undertook to provide further information. I would like to table further information provided in response to his questions and seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The answer read as follows—


RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS RAISED SENATOR ANDREW MURRAY ON 19 June 2007

Should tax-free super income be declared on annual tax returns?

The Government considers that providing tax free superannuation to those individuals who have already paid tax on their contributions and earnings throughout their working life is well deserved.


In particular, the reforms are targeted at boosting incentives to work by lowering tax on non-superannuation income and will increase the reward from making voluntary savings to superannuation.

Will wealthier retirees be able to qualify for the low-income tax offset?

As a result of the 2007-08 Budget tax cuts, from 1 July 2007, some low income tax offset can be claimed up to an income of $48,750.


Tax free superannuation will not count in determining whether an individual can claim the low income tax offset. This will reduce tax paid on other income, including work income, increasing the incentive to undertake work while drawing down on superannuation.


This is consistent with the Government's policy of encouraging workforce participation by older workers to address the challenges of our ageing population.

Can the minister confirm that the Medicare levy is not defined as income tax and therefore should not be included in tax-free super?

Tax free superannuation income will not be subject to the Medicare levy.

Can the minister confirm that all retirees over 65, well off or not, will qualify for the concessional Commonwealth seniors health card?

The eligibility test for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card has not been amended.


Tax free superannuation income will not count towards determining whether an individual is eligible for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.

If that concession is available to all, does the government think that better-off retirees should pay the Medicare levy on their income?

The Government is of the view that imposing the Medicare levy on tax free super would maintain all of the current administrative requirements, such as requiring retirees only earning super income to lodge annual tax returns and requiring superannuation funds to withhold Medicare levy from super payments. The Government believes this would be an inefficient approach that would outweigh the benefits of collecting revenues in this way.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, to questions without notice asked today relating to broadband telecommunications infrastructure.
What we have seen yet again today is a minister struggling to understand the technology issues in her own portfolio. She exposed herself yesterday. Yesterday she put out a press release called ‘Wireless is great for the bush—just ask Labor’. Let me read to you from a paragraph that she included:
What the Coalition Government has very clearly said is that we will provide broadband coverage to 100 per cent of Australia through a mix of technologies and regardless of the technology that is used, we are guaranteeing a minimum speed of 12 megabits per second.
Let us be clear. When challenged on this, Senator Coonan went to her website, without issuing a correction, without putting out a press release to say, ‘I made a mistake,’ and she amended one paragraph on her website to change it to:
What the Coalition Government has very clearly said is that we will provide broadband coverage to 100 per cent of the population. The rollout of a new, independent, competitive and state of the art national broadband network—the OPEL network—will extend high speed services out to 99 per cent of the population and provide speeds of 12 megabits per second by mid 2009. The remaining 1 per cent of consumers will be served via a $2750 satellite subsidy.
That is fine. Everybody is entitled to make a mistake and everybody is entitled to correct the record. But the problem the minister has here is that she repeated that in question time yesterday. So, on the quiet, last night she slipped the old paragraph out and put the new paragraph in—no correction of the record in here, no standards from this government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate should be saying to Senator Coonan, ‘Look, I’m sorry, Helen; I know you don’t have a clue about technology, but you’ve got to go in there and correct the record.’

Senator Patterson interjecting—

—Yes, that is actually part of the rules, Senator Patterson. When you mislead the Australian parliament, when you mislead the Australian public, you are meant to correct the record at the first opportunity. Let us be clear: this is a clear breach of parliamentary standards, it is a clear breach of your government’s alleged standards and you should be doing something about it, Senator Minchin, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate.
Let us get onto some equally substantive issues. It would not matter if the minister had learnt her lesson, but she was at it yet again this morning, on the 9am with David and Kim show. She was misleading the Australian public again. She said that everyone will get the same speed by 2009—that is, 12 megabits per second. She had to correct the record last night because she knows she cannot give 12 megs to everyone. God could not deliver 12 megabits by satellite.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—Senator Joyce knows it—he lives out in rural Australia—and any other senator here who is on satellite will tell you that they cannot deliver this. The minister, having not made the correction yesterday, then proceeded to go out and do it again today. But let us be clear about the technology that is being used here. According to the technology chief of phone giant Ericsson, the technology‘could be equivalent to the ill-fated Beta video’. It is what you have signed up to, Senator Barnaby Joyce. That is what you are delivering—the Beta equivalent—
—Senator Conroy, address your comments through the chair, please.
—Sorry, Mr Deputy President; I accept your admonishment. Senator Joyce has delivered the Beta option instead of the VHS option. Australians who live in regional and rural Australia, the mil-lions of families who are going to be trapped in this cul-de-sac, will not forgive you for trapping them in this area. The minister has demonstrated that she has no grasp whatso-ever. Do you know what the minister said the other night? When challenged by Kerry O’Brien on the 7.30 Report, the minister said that fibre is affected by the number of users. It is actually so embarrassing you do not know what to say next. The minister for technology has not got a clue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Broadband</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2007-06-20,"—All of this bluff and bluster from Senator Conroy is simply trying to hide the fact that Senator Coonan, on behalf of the Howard government, has announced a broadband access program that is far superior, far more detailed, costed and technologically savvy than the shallow announcement by Labor some three months ago. The fact is the policy announced by the government provides world-first policy initiatives and it will ensure that all Australians, regardless of where they live, will have access to affordable broadband—quite a contrast to what Senator Conroy said today. And of course, in contrast to that, the policy Labor released about three months ago is uncosted, untested and undeliverable. They have misled, or attempted to mislead, the Australian population into thinking that they can deliver fibre to the node to 98 per cent of Australians. You only have to look at their flimsy costings to demonstrate that this simply does not add up.
It is generally recognised that $4 billion alone will be required for the cities that cover 36 per cent of our population. So if you are quite generous and assume that you can get another 36 per cent in the less populous areas for another $4 billion, you still only have a total coverage of 72 per cent for $8 billion. That is nowhere near the 98 per cent the Labor Party have promised in their policy. What that means in practical effect is that, under Labor’s policy, some three million premises will be left without a broadband service, and they will have absolutely no prospect of getting one in the future.
Clearly, Labor’s proposal is demonstrably flawed. It is already unravelling because not long ago we heard Labor’s shadow minister for defence, the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon MP, bell the cat in a media doorstop when he was asked by a journalist, ‘Who misses out in that region’—his own region—‘under your plan?’ He said:
Well those things are yet to be tested; we will roll out fibre to the node right throughout the Hunter region. Obviously there may be some people excluded from that. We haven’t ... don’t have the technical backing to make those final conclusions.
So there we have one of Labor’s senior shadow cabinet ministers confirming that many are going to be left behind, including in his own Hunter region. So this is not a plan for the future. This is a fraud on the Australian people attempted by the Labor opposition. That is absolutely clear again today from what Senator Conroy said, and it reinforces the fact that we have an inexperienced Labor team. They do not have the necessary economic or policy clout. They still have not done their hard yards on policy development after how many years opposition?
—Eleven.
—More than the 11 years in opposition and still no hard, detailed facts in terms of policy development. How hopeless the Labor opposition are in this area of communications. They simply do not have the capacity to deliver in this area, just as they do not have the capacity to manage a trillion-dollar economy. All they are going to do is raid the Future Fund, put at risk Australia’s future prosperity and bandaid over their lack of hard policy work.
Let us see their costings. Where are their costings? All we have is a one-page summary announced three months ago. There is no further detail. There are no costings, no coverage maps, no back-up detail of the technical cognisance of their program. They are simply not competent in this area. There is nothing to support their wild claim that an $8 billion outlay will bring fibre to the node to 98 per cent of the population. Until they release the details of their plan, particularly with regard to people in rural and regional Australia, we simply can have no confidence that they are an alternative government, both specifically in terms of delivering communications networks and, more importantly, in terms of managing our economy and managing the Australian community.
We heard Senator Conroy refer to the Ericsson criticism of the WiMax facility. Of course Ericsson are going to criticise that. They have a direct interest in HSDPA or 3G mobile phones, which is a direct competitor with the WiMAX technology. So—surprise, surprise—of course they are going to criticise the WiMAX technology: it is their direct competitor. It is purely a business decision on the part of Ericsson to promote that criticism. In contrast, we ought to have a look at what Nokia have said. They are the world’s largest mobile telephone manufacturer and, of course, a competitor of Ericsson, but they have said that there is a very strong business case for the introduction of WiMAX.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I rise to take note of answers to questions today by Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and I am more than happy to take up the line used by Senator Chapman and talk about hopelessness. If you want to talk about hopelessness, Senator Chapman, then let us talk about 11 years in government—
—Senator Sterle, address your comments through the chair.
—Through you, Mr Deputy President, there have been 11 years of hopelessness. The government have been playing catch-up to Labor’s announcement about a broadband plan for Australia. In 11 years they have done nothing. They have sat on their backsides for 11 years and tried to fool the Australian people, but the Australian people will not be fooled. I will continue my comments about hopelessness by referring to the hopeless answer by Senator Coonan today when she was asked about the promise she made to John Laws and 2UE listeners about government funding on infrastructure duplication. She threw around a few weasel words and finally got to ‘minimalise’. What a hopeless effort that was. I take it from the minister’s answer that she did mislead John Laws and the listeners of 2UE.
Another example of the government’s hopelessness being uncovered was an article that I read with interest today on the front page of the Australian from that very professional and well-regarded journalist Mr Sid Marris. He certainly is very clear in his mind in what he says in the opening paragraph:
Optus will make significant inroads into potentially lucrative broadband markets in Brisbane and Perth—
and these are the key words—
despite the Government’s claim that taxpayers would not be used to build networks where the market should fight it out.
Well, here we go: hopelessness for 11 years has been uncovered. This minister dithers. In answer to question after question, we get five minutes of psychobabble from the minister. We never get a definitive answer. She has perfected psychobabble. And on the subject of confusion, this minister, as Senator Conroy remarked, sneaks around after hours and makes changes to websites—I think we are on mark 4 of the government’s broadband plan. But I could not make any sense out of the answers—and I feel like I am misleading the Senate in saying that, Mr Deputy President, because they were not answers; they were absolute embarrassments to this government. The government had a clean-out of their frontbenchers a few months ago but I think they stopped short before they got to the last quarter.
Someone should throw this minister a lifeline. This minister is clearly out of her depth. She really has no idea what mark we are up to at this stage. I urge those on the other side to do your mates a favour, for God’s sake, and interrupt, help her out—do something—because I learned one thing in my previous days: when you are in a hole, you normally should stop digging.
I also want to talk about the minister for communications—but maybe that should be ‘the minister for leaked communications’, when we find out that 40 Liberal Howard seats were targeted for this plan in some sort of kit. There had to be 40 Liberal held seats. In my home state of Western Australia, those seats—I will share them with you, Mr Deputy President, and with honourable senators opposite—are Hasluck, Stirling, Kalgoorlie and Canning, four Liberal seats. Let us not talk about Brand, Cowan, Swan, Perth or Fremantle, which are all in dire need of a quality high-speed broadband plan. No, they do not get a mention. They do not get a mention because they are Labor held seats.
There is an article in the West Australian that I would like to bring to your attention, and it was written in today’s paper by Mr Nick Butterly. The heading was ‘Broadband plan stays secret’. So, not only are we confused and not only can we on this side of the chamber see what is actually going on—a poll driven, tired, arrogant, out-of-touch government playing catch-up politics—but the newspapers around the country have got it and the voters of Australia have got it. They know damn well that they do not have a quality broadband plan or broadband access, and they can see through this government’s rhetoric. Mr Butterly says that some of the fastest-growing parts of Perth, which is the capital of my home state, including ‘the booming centres of Rockingham and Mandurah’ are ‘likely to be denied’ world-class services.
Just to let you know, Mr Deputy President, down in Brand, according to the data collected in the 2001 census, there were 15 secondary schools, 56 primary schools and 12,268 businesses in a population of 188,000 people. Quite clearly, why should the people of Brand be denied access to quality broadband? I will tell you why: because it is not a Liberal held seat. (Time expired)

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2007-06-20,"—I do not know what the Labor Party are on today, but if they had tested them for it at the door they would not have let them in! Something has really got to Senator Conroy. He was coughing, he was spluttering and he was drinking water. He pivoted, he turned, he frothed at the mouth, and he walked out. Then he was followed by Senator Sterle. Senator Sterle has just informed us that Perth is his home state. That is very interesting. I thought it was a town in his home state, but it is actually his home state. They are under pressure. The pressure is getting to them.
And then we have this Labor pluck-a-duck technology and the Labor pluck-a-duck policy—‘We’re just going to try and morph some policy, completely uncosted; we’re going to foist it out there’—because they have to come up with something. This is ‘Captain Kevin’. Captain Kevin has given them something to talk about. Right now, Senator Conroy is back with Captain Kevin saying, ‘I can smell burning flesh, and I think it’s the Labor Party’s.’ He will be talking to Captain Kevin, saying: ‘Look, Kev, I don’t know what’s going on. It’s coming unstuck.’ And Kevin will be saying to him: ‘Mate, this is your baby. If it doesn’t float, you go down with it.’
I sympathise with Senator Conroy because he is not a bad bloke, but he has just blown this one. It has blown up in his face, and he does not know what to do with it. He came up and said, ‘It’s the Beta option,’ but I think he meant to say, ‘It’s the better option.’ It is those notes—they are letting him down again.
This $8 billion to 98 per cent of Australians is fascinating. The Labor Party policy is based on the premise of your having a node, a post in the ground from which the fibre gets to you. They must believe that these nodes are interspersed through the countryside like tree stumps—that you just wander around and up pops a node. Here’s a gnome; there’s a node! It is the Labor Party pluck-a-duck policy. The trouble is that there are not nodes just randomly associated around the countryside. That is why you have to go to a wireless technology. If you do not use the wireless technology, you do not get delivery.
Look at some of the comparatives. They talk about 98 per cent of the population. I do not know why they did not say 100 per cent. It is the premise of the attitude. It is the reasoning behind their logic. There is no reasoning, just their pluck-a-duck policy: pluck a figure out the air, jot it on a piece of paper, walk it into the chamber and start praying. And then, when it comes unstuck, pivot, drink water, cough, splutter, acknowledge that the pressure is on you, then spin, pivot and walk out the door, like Senator Conroy has done.
It is going to be interesting. I am looking forward to the Labor Party actually tabling the statistical analysis, the costings and the relevance of their policy. It is going to be interesting to see whether anybody on that side of the house has actually done the homework. Or is this what we are looking for as we walk towards the election: these sorts of random assertions about general directions, about possible outcomes that might happen if certain things all line up? It is just rubbish.
The government has delivered an outcome that will get to more people. That is what we want to do: get to more people—as opposed to Labor’s outcome, which gets at more people! So this is the position. They always talk about 98 per cent. The Labor Party, the party that want to close down the Regional Partnerships program, then use this sense of concern. They always talk about the 98 per cent. Well, I am one of those people who live in the other two per cent. I am the senator in this chamber who lives furthest from the coast. They always seem to want to leave us out. Whenever you get a minority, the Labor Party’s approach is to marginalise it even further.
The position is that we are actually delivering something that can assist people in the remotest corners of our country. The other thing is that the Labor Party believe that this is just a line in the sand, that it all just stops here, that there will never, ever be another—  (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I also rise to take note of answers provided the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan. It is easy to see who is under pressure—boiling point, I would say. In the past week, Senator Joyce has been reported as saying, ‘There’s a lot more that needs to be done.’ Last week he said that he was concerned that the government planned to deliver fibre to the kerb in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth and wireless options in the bush. He went on to say that wireless has inherent limitations; it cannot deliver the same quality. Well, Senator Joyce, your colleagues have left you out in the cold on this one. The Australian people are unhappy with the government’s inaction on broadband. We know that. That is what their polling has obviously told them. That is why they are now attempting to do something about it.
—Mr Deputy President, I do not think I did say that the federal government was going to deliver fibre to the—
—Are you taking a point of order, Senator Joyce?
—I am—and whether it is correct. I know that Senator Wortley is not endeavouring to mislead; I just want to check that.
—There is no point of order.
—There has been 11 years of inaction by the Howard government and now, only months away from a federal election, they have a plan. Let me correct that. They have two plans: one for the city and one for rural and regional Australia. The government’s proposal will create a two-tiered system using fibre-optic cable in the cities and wireless in the country. It is a second-rate system for rural and regional Australia, a cobbled-together broadband plan, that only delivers high-speed fibre networks in the areas of five major capital cities, leaving students and small business operators in rural and regional areas to struggle along with an inferior wireless service. The government now have to deal with misleading gaffes, where they have tried to hoodwink the Australian people for their own political agenda.
The communications minister has said that Labor’s broadband policy was irresponsible. What Australians would like to know is: how can improving every Australian householder’s access to broadband speeds be irresponsible? Why is it irresponsible to invest in the pathway to our future? Why is it irresponsible to strengthen our position in the global economy? Why is it irresponsible to provide improved communication standards to Australians? Labor has steadfastly taken the initiative on broadband policy after inaction by the communications minister. While it is good to know that Labor’s plans on broadband have finally pushed the government into some action, although it is somewhat stumbling, the reality is that one cannot turn vinegar into wine. The government’s catch-up broadband policy is simply a poor second to Labor’s solid initiative on this issue.
Mr Howard says that working families have never been better off. Well, the government’s handling of broadband reflects a government that has lost touch and become arrogant. The fact is that the performance and reliability of wireless suffers because of the distance issues, bad weather, geography and congestion problems with the number of people using the service at any one time. A letter from a Queenslander, which appears in today’s Australian newspaper, says:
Living in regional Queensland, our only broadband option was a ... wireless internet service provider who placed an antenna on our roof which picked up a signal from a receiver tower ... When it rained, no internet, or occasional interrupted services, sometimes for days if there was a prolonged wet period. The ISP technical support admitted to us that “signals can’t travel through water”. The service is great in prolonged drought periods, but unreliable and often non-existent in downpours. As our business is internet-dependent, we required constant service. So we cancelled and are now back to dial-up speed ...
The regional wireless solution is a second-rate, unreliable service. That’s John Howard’s future broadband vision. Maybe he should advise the bush to stop praying for rain.
This is the 18th time the government has claimed it is going to fix Australia’s broadband problems, and now, in the government’s poll-induced terror, they have come up with a second-rate plan for rural and regional Australia. As part of it, we had the minister stating on Monday, as Senator Conroy pointed out, that her government, under wireless network, will deliver up to 12 megabits per second for 99 per cent of Australia. Then the minister changed her tune. On Tuesday she said that it was a minimum of 12 megabits per second, and then later on the same day she said that it was a minimum of— (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2007-06-20,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:

That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Aged Care Amendment (Residential Care) Bill 2007, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.

I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the Bill

The Bill amends the Aged Care Act 1997 to replace the Resident Classification Scale (RCS) with the Aged Care Funding Instrument (ACFI) as the means of allocating Australian Government subsidy to approved providers of residential aged care.  These changes are required to implement the  Government’s commitment to reduce the number of funding categories for basic care and introduce new payments to target residents with complex nursing or behavioural needs.

Reasons for Urgency

Software providers to the sector require approximately six months lead time to develop new products and incorporate changes into the computer systems used by aged care homes. These changes are complex and highly interrelated.  Passage of the Bill in the Winter sitting period and timely subsequent amendments to the Aged Care Principles (the Principles) will enable software providers to commence product development. An earlier commencement date was deferred at the request of the aged care industry because software providers would have been unable to deliver ACFI products on time.
The ACFI legislative changes are a discrete component of the Securing the future of aged care for Australians package announced by the Prime Minister.  Delays in the passage of this Bill create the risk that the commitment for these amendments to commence on 20 March 2008 will not be met. Other components of the Securing the future package require amendments to the Act to be introduced later in the year. 
The Principles detail the rules which form the basis of national aged care industry training prepared for approximately 3,000 aged care staff in September and October 2007 and a further 7,000 in February and March 2008.  There is a potential risk that any delayed amendments to the aged care legislation would result in incorrect information being provided at this training.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,9,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I present the seventh report of 2007 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I also lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 7 of 2007, dated 20 June 2007.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In tabling the committee’s seventh report of 2007, I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to provisions in the  Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007  that may be considered to trespass on personal rights and liberties. I drew these provisions to the attention of the Senate when tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 6 of 2007 and would like to comment further following receipt of advice from the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation.
Proposed new subsections 100B(1A) and 101AA(1A) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 apply strict liability to the element of the location of a foreign fishing boat in Australia’s territorial sea. The result of these proposed amendments is that, in a prosecution under either of those sections, the prosecution will only have to establish that fishers were in the territorial sea of Australia, not that they intended to be there. The committee sought advice from the minister about the imposition of strict liability in these circumstances and was advised:
The territorial sea is not generally depicted on Australian charts or charts issued under other jurisdictions. Consequently, it is highly unlikely that the person would enter the coordinates for the territorial sea into their technical navigational equipment. For this reason, it has not been possible to successfully prove that someone was intentionally in the territorial sea. The requirement to prove fault for the territorial sea aspect of the offences is therefore undermining the deterrent effect and the offence provisions are not operating as effectively as intended.
While the committee is sympathetic to the need to ensure that the law acts as a deterrent to illegal fishing in Australia’s territorial waters, the committee remains concerned about the fairness of applying strict liability in circumstances where ‘the territorial sea is not generally depicted on Australian charts or charts issued under other jurisdictions’, thus apparently making it virtually impossible for a foreign fishing boat to know whether or not it has entered the territorial sea. The committee considers that these provisions may trespass on personal rights and liberties but leaves it to the Senate as a whole to determine whether they do so unduly.
I would also like to draw the Senate’s attention to a provision in the  Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007  that may be considered to make rights, liberties or obligations dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers, in breach of principle 1(a)(ii) of the committee’s terms of reference. Proposed new section 41 of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982 would permit the minister to delegate to ‘any person’ all or any of the minister’s functions and powers under the act. The committee has consistently drawn attention to legislation that allows delegations to a relatively large class of persons, with little or no specificity as to their qualifications or attributes. The committee sought the minister’s advice on whether this power of delegation should be limited in some way. In response to the committee’s concerns the minister has sought to justify this very wide delegation to ‘a person’ on the basis that the new section is replacing an existing section of the act which does not limit the power to delegate to a particular class of persons and that it provides the minister with ‘flexibility to ensure that any of his powers are delegated to a person with the requisite skills and experience, which could be a person working within the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research or elsewhere within the foreign affairs portfolio’.
The committee’s view is that the fact that an existing provision in an act fails to put appropriate limits around the power to delegate does not justify a new provision that has the same failings. Amending an act provides the executive and the parliament with an opportunity to critically review the provisions of that act to ensure that they meet current standards of good practice. Unfortunately this opportunity appears to have been forgone in this instance. The committee has sought the minister’s further advice as to whether the limitations placed on the delegation in his response—that is, that the delegate would be a person working within the centre or elsewhere in the foreign affairs portfolio—could be included in the bill. Pending the minister’s response, I draw senators’ attention to this provision as it may be considered to make rights, liberties and obligations dependent on insufficiently defined administrative powers.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-06-20,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present report No. 84 of the committee, Treaty tabled on 6 December 2006. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to make a few remarks on the report, if I may.
Leave granted.
—Report No. 84 contains the committee’s findings on the Agreement between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Framework for Security Cooperation.
There is more than a little irony in the treaties committee considering this agreement between the two countries. Some senators may recall that there was an earlier agreement between Australia and Indonesia with regard to security, the 1995 Agreement on Maintaining Security, which was subsequently abrogated in 1999, I think it was. That earlier treaty was negotiated in secret, and it entered into force without reference to the parliament. In fact, it was that earlier treaty which was the inspiration for the creation of the Joint Committee on Treaties. That earlier moment of negotiation was, in my view, a rather disgraceful moment in the making of Australian foreign policy, one not to be repeated. Happily, we have moved on from that point. I am pleased to note that, with a certain exception, this particular agreement has  widespread committee support.
During the inquiry the committee received 56 submissions and held two public hearings in Canberra and a further hearing in Sydney.
Unlike the earlier agreement, this particular treaty is a comprehensive coverage of the issues and areas of cooperation and of common interest between the two countries. It specifically focuses on areas which might generally be called the non-traditional security area: law enforcement, counterterrorism, maritime security, transnational crime, people trafficking and illegal fishing. It is perhaps worth while noting that in many of these areas there is already a high degree of cooperation between Australia and Indonesia.
The committee found that the treaty is in Australia’s national interests and has made five recommendations, including the recommendation that binding treaty action be taken.
Perhaps I could just make a few remarks in relation to some of the areas of controversy that were identified during the course of the committee’s hearings. First, it was put to the committee that the agreement would be vulnerable to unresolved issues of the bilateral relationship. The committee acknowledges that some aspects of the bilateral relationship are stronger than others, but it regards the agreement as providing the basis to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.
It noted during the course of its inquiry that in 2006 the Lowy Institute in Sydney conducted a poll which showed that 77 per cent of Australians felt it was important that Australia and Indonesia work together to develop a close relationship. The relationship, however, is subject to some widespread public misperception, and it was in relation to that misperception that the committee decided that, particularly with regard to the progress of Indonesia’s democratisation, an effort to be made to try and address those misunderstandings. The committee has therefore recommended that the Australian government engage in a campaign to increase public support for the Australian-Indonesian relationship. The campaign would have the goal of increasing awareness of the democratic reforms in Indonesia and the value to Australia and regional security of a strong bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia.
The inquiry revealed that there is widespread concern with regard to article 2(3) of the agreement. This contains a commitment by both Australia and Indonesia that neither will support or participate in activities which constitute a threat to the stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity of the other party. Some witnesses argued before the committee that this would limit the activities of private individuals in Australia who wish to act, lawfully, to support issues such as human rights in Papua or Indonesia more broadly. Government representatives responded directly to this concern. They made it clear that the obligation in article 2(3) of the agreement does not in any way infringe individual rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The committee is satisfied that the article will not limit the lawful expression of individuals’ or groups’ support for Papuan human rights or independence in Australia, should they wish to do so.
In relation to the defence cooperation, the committee supports an approach which engages the Indonesian military, and the agreement provides the basis for cooperation which is intended to improve the professionalism of the Indonesian military. This is in both Australia’s and Indonesia’s national interest. However, many submissions to the inquiry expressed concerns about human rights abuses by the Indonesian military. To address these concerns, the committee recommends that the Australian government increase the transparency of defence cooperation agreements to provide assurance that Australian resources do not directly or indirectly support human rights abuses in Indonesia.
The committee is conscious that most of the submissions to its inquiry concern Papuan human rights and the defence cooperation provisions of the agreement. As media access to the province of Papua is restricted, the committee is not in a position to comment directly on human rights matters, particularly where they relate to the Indonesian military. However, the committee agrees that more open access to Papua would help to ensure greater respect for human rights. For this reason the committee recommends that the Australian government encourage the Indonesian government to allow greater access for the media and human rights monitors in Papua. The committee also recommends that the Australian government continue to address widely expressed concerns about human rights in Indonesia with the Indonesian government and in appropriate international fora.
The committee recognises the high degree of interest shown by particular groups and organisations in relation to this agreement. The committee considers the agreement to be in the national interest as it provides a basis for further cooperation on key issues of strategic importance to Australia.
The committee also considers close cooperation with Indonesia to be essential to maintaining security and combating terrorism in the Asia-Pacific region. The agreement provides the basis for that close cooperation to further develop, and for this reason the committee has recommended that binding treaty action be taken.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-20,"—The report Treaty tabled on 6 December 2006 is an important report, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to it as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. As Senator Trood alluded, there was not quite total unanimity in terms of the recommendation that the treaty should be ratified and adopted, and I was the dissenting voice with regard to that fact.
I do support the other recommendations the committee put forward, which I think were a genuine attempt to try to address the very genuine concerns that were raised through the three public hearings the committee had, as well as through the range of submissions—the 50-plus submissions that Senator Trood mentioned. Those extra recommendations attempt to address some of those concerns.
There is a key question here. I have spoken on the record in this chamber and more widely a number of times about the importance of our relationship with Indonesia, the need for us to strengthen that relationship and particularly, as one of the committee’s recommendations goes to, the need to much more properly acknowledge the quite incredible progress that Indonesia has made in a very short space of time with regard to democratisation, given not only the reality of that country’s history but also its enormous area, its large and diverse population and the difficulties of putting into place some institutions from scratch, particularly putting them in the place of what was basically an authoritarian regime. These are difficulties which we perhaps do not appreciate in Australia, given our history of democracy stretching back over a century. There has been incredible progress. I think that in Australia we very much underestimate that, and it is appropriate that we do a lot better to make our community aware of that.
That appropriately celebrated fact cannot ignore the reality that there are still very significant human rights problems in parts of Indonesia, particularly with regard to some elements—not all but some—within the Indonesian military. A key reason that makes this a very difficult issue to address and ameliorate quickly is that the military still obtains a significant part of its resourcing off-budget, outside of government funding, through other activities, so it is able to function, in part, independently of the government with regard to resourcing. We cannot ignore that area.
It is appropriate to learn from the history of the previous treaty, which was signed in 1995 by former foreign minister Gareth Evans, from memory, and Mr Ali Alitas, the Indonesian foreign minister at the time. It might even have been on a jet plane in midair; I do not know why I have that imagery in my head but that is what I recall. Senator Trood is right to criticise that as a disgraceful process, not just in terms of the secrecy and the lack of consultation—that was pretty much par for the course in those days—but also because it did what I still fear we may be at risk of doing here, even though a lot of the other circumstances are different, which is ignoring the reality of serious problems in some parts of the Indonesian military, including Kopassus. We knew that reality existed.
Leaving aside the inadequacies in the process of that agreement being reached, let us not forget what it also led to and the concerns the people raised at the time: that the defence cooperation component of that agreement could leave Australia open to training, in Australian facilities—including Canungra, in south-east Queensland, near Brisbane, where I am from—Indonesian military people who were later alleged to have been involved in very serious human rights abuses, particularly in relation to East Timor. We have got that history to be aware of and, whilst many things have changed for the better, I do not think we can ignore the fact that not everything has changed as much as we would have liked, particularly in that area.
I do not think we can just say that we are not in a position to comment on the human rights situation in West Papua with regard to the military. It is pleasing that there is a recommendation here—and I support it—that more be done in opening up access to West Papua, but of concern is the very fact that we are signing a treaty that involves defence cooperation with a government who will not let people in to see what is happening in the key area—not the only area but the key area—where there are repeated, continual, regular allegations, and a lot of documented reports, of serious human rights abuses involving elements of the military. I do not think we can just say that we are not in a position to comment about it. We might not be able to make a completely fully informed comment, but I think there is enough information around to make a reasonable degree of commentary.
That said, that still leaves us with that balancing act that is often an issue in international relations. I very much bow to Senator Trood’s far greater expertise and experience than mine in this whole area of international affairs and the like, but I was very much taken with the evidence, particularly by Hugh White. We had two people involved in the Lowy Institute who made similar assessments but came to different conclusions about how the treaty would help in addressing them. There is obviously still a lot of mistrust between our two countries, based in large part on misunderstandings, a lack of awareness and simply a lack of knowledge. That is why it is worth supporting any recommendation that goes to improving that understanding and cooperation, not so much government to government but more people to people, civil society to civil society and institution to institution to help repair those misunderstandings or build that awareness and some of that shared engagement that we need to improve on. It is extraordinary really, when you think about it, to have Indonesia as one of our nearest neighbours—such a major country on a global level, not just significant regionally—and we have not only quite limited engagement with it in lots of ways but also such a poor basic understanding.
There is no doubt that Papua is an issue of extreme sensitivity for Indonesia, and I understand some of the reasons for that. I also appreciate that it is a bit much for Australia to be appearing to lecture Indonesia in some respects about places like Papua. I, as many people have, could go through the history of how Papua came under Indonesian rule and the disputes there, but, frankly, I do not think Australia has much to lecture other countries on when it comes to self-determination for indigenous people and original inhabitants of a land. Whatever people may say about resources in West Papua being exploited and going to other parts of the country, and the people indigenous to that region not having enough of a say, a whole lot of our country’s mineral and resource boom is on the back of resources taken from Indigenous land in the north of Australia with the immense wealth there, and we did not give them any sort of referendum about whether they wanted other people to move in. So I think we need to be conscious that every country has its own failings, including Australia. Indeed, I would say our lack of ability to acknowledge our own extremely flawed history with regard to Indigenous Australians is a bit of a parallel in terms of our extreme sensitivity to criticisms about that and our blind spots about that. It is not a perfect parallel, I certainly concede, but I think there are some similarities there about how every country has its areas that they have particular sensitivities over.
The key approach, I think, that Hugh White put forward is really whether this will help or hinder in the long term in strengthening cooperation or whether putting in place this treaty will mean we are more likely to kid ourselves that we can ignore some of those areas that do need a lot of work—to use an analogy, whether we are papering over a small crack that will just help seal that in or whether there is actually quite a large crack there which, by papering over it, we will ignore and be less aware of when bigger problems are emerging. I am not convinced that the level of understanding between countries at all levels, at the societal level as much as at the government level, is such that this is the right time for this. I think more work on some of the other recommendations, particularly in terms of engagement, would assist with that—particularly judging from some of the other evidence that was given to the committee, for instance by Clinton Fernandes, about the potential consequences and impact of having defence cooperation in these areas.
It is an area I wrestled over a lot, but I do think that at this stage it is not the appropriate time. I think we can learn from history and see some of the reasons for that. That is not an anti-Indonesian view; in a way it is saying that I want as strong as possible a relationship with Indonesia and I think this may be premature in giving us the best chance of making that happen. There were a range of other issues that were raised that I do not have time to go through now. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2007-06-20,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present report No. 84 of the committee, Treaty tabled on 6 December 2006. I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to make a few remarks on the report, if I may.
Leave granted.
—Report No. 84 contains the committee’s findings on the Agreement between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the Framework for Security Cooperation.
There is more than a little irony in the treaties committee considering this agreement between the two countries. Some senators may recall that there was an earlier agreement between Australia and Indonesia with regard to security, the 1995 Agreement on Maintaining Security, which was subsequently abrogated in 1999, I think it was. That earlier treaty was negotiated in secret, and it entered into force without reference to the parliament. In fact, it was that earlier treaty which was the inspiration for the creation of the Joint Committee on Treaties. That earlier moment of negotiation was, in my view, a rather disgraceful moment in the making of Australian foreign policy, one not to be repeated. Happily, we have moved on from that point. I am pleased to note that, with a certain exception, this particular agreement has  widespread committee support.
During the inquiry the committee received 56 submissions and held two public hearings in Canberra and a further hearing in Sydney.
Unlike the earlier agreement, this particular treaty is a comprehensive coverage of the issues and areas of cooperation and of common interest between the two countries. It specifically focuses on areas which might generally be called the non-traditional security area: law enforcement, counterterrorism, maritime security, transnational crime, people trafficking and illegal fishing. It is perhaps worth while noting that in many of these areas there is already a high degree of cooperation between Australia and Indonesia.
The committee found that the treaty is in Australia’s national interests and has made five recommendations, including the recommendation that binding treaty action be taken.
Perhaps I could just make a few remarks in relation to some of the areas of controversy that were identified during the course of the committee’s hearings. First, it was put to the committee that the agreement would be vulnerable to unresolved issues of the bilateral relationship. The committee acknowledges that some aspects of the bilateral relationship are stronger than others, but it regards the agreement as providing the basis to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.
It noted during the course of its inquiry that in 2006 the Lowy Institute in Sydney conducted a poll which showed that 77 per cent of Australians felt it was important that Australia and Indonesia work together to develop a close relationship. The relationship, however, is subject to some widespread public misperception, and it was in relation to that misperception that the committee decided that, particularly with regard to the progress of Indonesia’s democratisation, an effort to be made to try and address those misunderstandings. The committee has therefore recommended that the Australian government engage in a campaign to increase public support for the Australian-Indonesian relationship. The campaign would have the goal of increasing awareness of the democratic reforms in Indonesia and the value to Australia and regional security of a strong bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia.
The inquiry revealed that there is widespread concern with regard to article 2(3) of the agreement. This contains a commitment by both Australia and Indonesia that neither will support or participate in activities which constitute a threat to the stability, sovereignty or territorial integrity of the other party. Some witnesses argued before the committee that this would limit the activities of private individuals in Australia who wish to act, lawfully, to support issues such as human rights in Papua or Indonesia more broadly. Government representatives responded directly to this concern. They made it clear that the obligation in article 2(3) of the agreement does not in any way infringe individual rights to freedom of expression or freedom of association. The committee is satisfied that the article will not limit the lawful expression of individuals’ or groups’ support for Papuan human rights or independence in Australia, should they wish to do so.
In relation to the defence cooperation, the committee supports an approach which engages the Indonesian military, and the agreement provides the basis for cooperation which is intended to improve the professionalism of the Indonesian military. This is in both Australia’s and Indonesia’s national interest. However, many submissions to the inquiry expressed concerns about human rights abuses by the Indonesian military.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I move:
That the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007 be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry and report by 7 August 2007.
This legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives in another form last Thursday and was passed by the House of Representatives earlier today. That is the period of time it has been before the parliament. I think it is important to note that on 22 May the Prime Minister announced the government’s plan for the future of wheat export marketing. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007 incorporates those changes and was introduced into the House of Representatives last Thursday, 14 June without consultation with growers or traders as to its form.
The Prime Minister’s announcement imposes an ultimatum on growers: you either get your act together and form a new entity without our help or we will impose complete deregulation on the industry. That is how it appeared to many in the industry. The effect of that threat is to further polarise an already divided industry, impose an incredible burden on the industry at a time it is busy planting the next crop and, if not facing the worst drought in history, trying to recover from the worst drought in history. All of this is in an election year and will make it even more difficult for industry to achieve what the government could not achieve, and that is unity.
I want to endorse the comments of my colleagues in the House of Representatives last night, Mr Crean and Mr Gavan O’Connor, who pointed out what this is: an appalling failure of leadership on the part of this government. Mr O’Connor described it as ‘the ultimate buckpass’. There are around 30,000 wheat farmers across Australia, and not one of them was given a chance to have a look at this legislation as far as we are aware—certainly none of them have come forward and said to us, ‘Well, we saw it.’ Nor have they had an opportunity to have a say on what they think is fair and reasonable. The fact is—and the Prime Minister has admitted as much—that this issue has divided the coalition party room. What they have concocted is not a plan for the future of the wheat industry; it is frankly a plan simply to get the government through to the next election. The fact is that in this regard growers have been denied natural justice in this process.
The government claims it has widely consulted growers through the Wheat Export Marketing Consultative Committee—or the Ralph committee process. This morning in the House of Representatives, Minister McGauran criticised Labor for not responding to the Ralph report. Frankly, what a stupid statement—the government has not released the Ralph report! Despite the fact that we called for its release some time ago, this minister declined to publicly released this report—not just to the opposition but to the public. Then the minister makes a goose of himself by suggesting that somehow the opposition is at fault for not responding to a report that it has not seen. Nobody has seen it, not even the growers who at least were part of that consultation. I called on the government to release the Ralph report back on 13 March. At that time I said growers had a right to know the basis upon which the government would be be making its decisions.
The government keeps referring to this mysterious Ralph report, claiming that more than 70 per cent of growers support what the government is proposing. Why doesn’t the government release the report? It is relying on a secret document. The committee reported to the government on the results of the consultation in late March. I note that on the department’s website it states:
...whether the Committee’s report will be made publicly available is a matter for the government to determine.
We know now that the government determined not to release it. Why? What has the government got to hide? Before I finish with the secretive Ralph report, I want to make a very important point: the Ralph committee only consulted less than 10 per cent of growers. Labor knows—because we are listening—that there are many more growers out there who do not support what the government is proposing. Apart from that, even assuming that the government is accurately quoting from the mysterious Ralph report, the government has not even done what the majority of growers have said they want done—that is assuming you believe the government when it allegedly quotes from the mysterious Ralph report. On 22 May, the Prime Minister told the parliament:
Very strong majority support was expressed during the consultations led by the respected businessman Mr Ralph with Australian wheat growers that they favoured the retention of the single desk. A figure was cited by him of 70 per cent of the people he spoke to, although only a small minority of that 70 per cent favoured the single desk remaining in the hands of AWB. That is a conclusion that the government completely shares and endorses.
However, despite this, the government introduced into the House last week a piece of legislation which in its current form will allow AWB to retain the single desk. I will say again: it will allow AWB to retain the single desk. Frankly, Minister McGauran tried to sneak this provision through. The legislation in its original form would have allowed AWB to be reappointed to run the single desk, including with the veto power.
According to the Prime Minister, this is in direct conflict with what the majority of growers want. Minister McGauran was rolled by Mr Tuckey and others, but the amendment they moved this week, which has been passed in the House of Representatives, will still allow AWB to run the single desk, albeit without the veto power. How could this happen? My understanding of this legislation is that, if the minister makes no decision to appoint a designated company, then after 30 June 2008, the single desk will revert to AWB, which is nominated company B only without the veto. That is how it works, that is how the legislation is structured at the moment, as it has been introduced into this place.
The minister knows full well that the single desk is defined by section 57(1A) of the act in combination with the constitution of AWB Ltd. Section 57(1A) of the act exempts nominated company B from applying to the Wheat Export Authority for a licence to export wheat. It is this exemption which bestows privileges upon AWB Ltd which are not conferred upon other wheat traders, and the minister has not proposed in this bill to amend this section of the act and has therefore somehow managed to hoodwink the entire government into believing that they have somehow removed the single desk from AWB. The fact is this legislation allows AWB to continue as a single desk holder—this is in the Prime Minister’s own words—contrary to what the majority of growers have told the government, through the Ralph committee, that they want. There can be no more damning evidence than this that the government has stopped listening to the farming community and has lost touch with them.
As I said earlier, up until last Thursday when the legislation was introduced, grower groups had not seen the detailed legislation and as such have not been provided an opportunity to consider the detailed nature of the changes. On Thursday, 14 June the government passed a motion to exempt the bill from the cut off in this place, which means it can be dealt with in this session—and that is the government’s intention. When the cut-off motion was introduced the bill had not been introduced. Since then, the government has moved significant amendments to the legislation, which I suggest means that the legislation was flawed upon its introduction and has been hastily amended. I suggest this indicates that the legislation is probably fatally flawed because, despite the fact that it has recently been passed by the House, the coalition, as I understand it, remains bitterly divided over what has been able to be agreed upon and what should be in it.
Why would the government deny growers a chance to have a say over this legislation? Why would the government deny the parliament an opportunity to have a say over this legislation through a committee inquiry? There is only one reason: the issue is still splitting the coalition party room and the government wants to get it out of the way. Now that is not fair to growers, it is not fair to the Australian people and it is not fair to the parliament. What guarantee can the government provide that the legislation as it currently stands is not still riddled with errors or tricks by Minister McGauran? I wonder if Senator Judith Adams is happy with this legislation, which she is apparently about to vote in favour of, paving the way for AWB to be reappointed to run the single desk.
My office has been in discussions with major growers and trading groups. We have done the best we can with the disgracefully short notice we have been given by the government in relation to this legislation. But what I can say is this: we have received many submissions, both in writing and verbally, which highlight concerns and, in some cases, serious flaws with the legislation. The number and nature of submissions my office has received demonstrates that the government has not adequately consulted the industry about its plans.
Last week, in response to these concerns, Labor announced its plan to move to split the bill to allow a bill extending the minister’s power of veto to be passed this week and incorporate other non-urgent aspects of the legislation into a separate bill that can be referred to the Senate rural and regional affairs committee for inquiry, and that is the purpose of this process. We did this so that the parliament and growers and the public could have a say over the legislation.
Our call to refer the legislation to the Senate committee was widely supported by grower groups. The Grains Council said in their media release on 14 June:
“We note that the Opposition is seeking to refer the amended Act to the Senate’s Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Standing Committee, for examination of the detail of the legislation and its impact on the industry. We support this move. The Committee is respected across the industry and has a depth of knowledge of the wheat export system”, Mr Jones said.
The Pastoralist and Graziers Association said:
Western Australian wheat growers are challenging agriculture minister Peter McGauran’s defence of the wheat marketing amendment bill and are urging Western Australian Liberal senators to back opposition agriculture spokesman Kerry O’Brien’s motion to split the bill.
And later:
We call upon Liberal senators to put the interests of wheat growers first with a close review of the legislation proposed by Minister McGauran.
And there are others. Labor also received support from other senators—from the Greens and the Democrats. There is obviously a need for more scrutiny, because the government itself found the original bill unacceptable and has amended it. But these amendments do not go far enough. Apart from the obvious flaw that the amended bill will allow the single desk to return to AWB, there is a range of other problems that we are aware of, and probably more that would come to light through the committee process.
In considering this legislation Labor has sought advice from the Grains Council of Australia, the National Agricultural Commodities Marketing Association Ltd, Australian Crop Forecasters, Grain Growers Association, Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, the New South Wales Farmers Association, AWB Ltd, Graincorp Ltd, South Australian Farmers Federation’s grains division, Western Australian Farmers Federation’s grains division, Western Australian Grain Group, the Australian Grain Exporters Association, and the Rural Marketing and Supply Association representing the box and container sector.
Some of the problems we have become aware of—that is, the types of concerns that have been raised with us—include: first, there was not any consultation about the legislation; second, there was an inadequate time frame for these organisations to consider the legislation; third, there was no opportunity to provide input into the draft legislation; fourth, widespread concern existed at the failure to limit how the minister plans to use his temporary veto power; fifth, there was a failure to provide for the assessment of export wheat applications ‘on merit’ as the Prime Minister announced to the House of Representatives on 22 May; sixth, there is no mention of the so-called ‘exceptional circumstances’ that the Prime Minister referred to in his announcement to the House; seventh, there is no threshold test to determine whether the new entity will be capable of managing the single desk after 1 March 2008—if it eventuates; eighth, some groups have grave concerns that the legislation does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that the designated company does not simply start to behave as the corrupt AWB did; ninth, the government claims the new regulator powers have been strengthened, but there is a widespread view that they have been widened only to capture companies other than the current single desk operator; 10th, some groups are concerned that the bill does not provide further contestability; 11th, there is also concern that the bill removes the current prudential check applied to box and bag exporters, and therefore increases financial risks to growers; 12th, there is no additional power to allow the regulator to apply real-time monitoring and measuring to AWB or the designated company, which in the view of some means that the designated company could simply continue to indulge in speculative trading, just as AWB has done, and, in the process, lose hundreds of millions of growers’ dollars; and, last, the Grains Council is concerned that the bill repeals sections 14 and 15 of division 5 of the act, which are the functions relating to reporting to the industry. I am advised that the government did not even consult with the industry about this aspect at any stage—not during Ralph, nor at any time during the past 18 months—so this proposal has come out of the blue. How could the government possibly know whether this move had the support of the industry when it had not consulted them about it?
Labor acknowledges that there is widespread support for extending the minister’s so-called veto power. The basis for this support is that growers do not want the veto of the single desk conferred back upon AWB. It is now apparent that this legislation will ultimately allow the single desk to be run by AWB in certain circumstances.
Something else we need to focus on is the power for the minister to change the single desk arrangement from 1 March 2008. We note that this schedule was the subject of further amendments in the House only this week. The effect of these further amendments is to put a sunset clause around the time for which the minister can exercise this power. This means that the minister has to exercise the power at some stage between 1 March 2008 and 30 June 2008. I want to make the following point very clear to my fellow senators, especially those from Western Australia. I draw their attention to page 9 of the third reading of the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill under schedule 3, clause 3AA, subclause 12. Subclause 12 means that, should the minister decide not to use his power to appoint a designated company, AWB will continue to run the single desk. I remind the Senate of the words of the Prime Minister on 22 May. He said:
… it remains my very strong view, that a retention of the status quo with AWB, given the circumstances revealed in the Cole inquiry, would not have been acceptable to the government, would not have been acceptable to me and would not have been acceptable to the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party.
He also said:
… only a small minority of that 70 per cent favoured the single desk remaining in the hands of AWB. That is a conclusion that the government completely shares and endorses.
Only two weeks ago the Prime Minister made it very clear in the House of Representatives that the regulator’s powers would be significantly increased, and the debate about WEA powers has been going on—and I have been conducting it—since 2000. The government ignored the recommendations of the National Competition Policy Review in 2000, the Senate committee report in 2003, several reports from WEA itself and ultimately the Cole commission. It simply ignored the Cole commission recommendation to review the Wheat Export Authority’s powers. From what we have seen, this legislation expands the reach of the regulator to companies other than ‘nominated company B’ but does not provide significant new powers to the regulator. The Labor Party finds this totally unacceptable. Also, how will the new Export Wheat Commission pay for the new responsibilities? There is no detail or financial impact statement. Will growers be forced to wear the cost? There is no new money for the Wheat Export Authority or the Export Wheat Commission in the budget.
Labor notes the amendment to put a 60-day limit on the time in which the minister must exercise his proclamation for bagged and boxed wheat deregulation, but some sections of industry have expressed concern about the proposal for quality assurance of bags and containers, with some groups claiming it is an unnecessary bureaucratic hurdle designed to put a false barrier in the way of trade. It is certainly arguable that there is no strong case for a quality assurance scheme. The market is more than capable of effectively dealing with these issues.
There are many other issues I could deal with, including the inadequacy of the Uhrig changes which this legislation contains. In relation to that proposition, we think the only way to deal adequately with this matter is to support Labor’s proposition, which will indeed allow for the urgent matters in the legislation to be dealt with while the rest of the bill is referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, a committee which has the respect of the industry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-20,"—The problem with debating notice of motion No. 2 is that the motion does not effectively do what the shadow minister is suggesting it should—namely, allow for the immediate passage of the veto provision and separate consideration of the other provisions. We are sympathetic to that. We are encouraged by the fact that the original bill has been amended. Frankly, it was extremely flawed and, whilst I have not had the chance to study the amendments in detail, I am advised that they certainly are an improvement on what was originally proposed. The problem for the Senate is that this remains an extremely contentious issue. It is a public policy issue, not just an industry issue. It is one of whether choice and flexibility should be provided to the farming community rather than what has become an authoritarian and monopolistic practice. The public policy issues do deserve to be considered by the parliament in trying to address this bill and the future of wheat marketing.
As we all know, there is a great deal of support amongst many members of the coalition for a partially deregulated system with greater choice and, frankly, the interim provision of giving the veto power to the minister effectively means that for this period, as it was for the last period, the single desk is dead, because more than one exporter has been licensed in the recent past and I expect more than one exporter will be licensed in the future. If that is the reality—and so it should be the reality; quite frankly, the east coast National Party should be defeated in this matter—then that would be a good thing. We would look forward to a situation where our Western Australian export farmers will have a choice of who they can export their product through. Of course they should be licensed, but that is the direction in which we should go. But in the meantime, to confirm that should be the choice, we need an inquiry. This is why the Democrats have been interested in the shadow minister’s reference and his proposal. My difficulty with the reference as it is put together is that events are overtaking us. It will be a while until we come back and the legislation is upon us. I would prefer it if the shadow minister would consider a differently phrased motion to be put to the bill tomorrow, to examine the public policy issues surrounding the provisions of the bill in a more general inquiry rather than on the specific bill itself. The bill, as I read the forward program, is bound to be passed tomorrow, so therefore the reference would be difficult to manage.
I would urge the Senate to consider that option favourably, despite the opposition of my good friends in the National Party to the idea of modern market economic mechanisms being introduced to the export of wheat. I know some of the Queenslanders have struggled to catch up to that, but I am sure they can be brought along.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I move:
That the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007 be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for inquiry and report by 7 August 2007.
This legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives in another form last Thursday and was passed by the House of Representatives earlier today. That is the period of time it has been before the parliament. I think it is important to note that on 22 May the Prime Minister announced the government’s plan for the future of wheat export marketing. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007 incorporates those changes and was introduced into the House of Representatives last Thursday, 14 June without consultation with growers or traders as to its form.
The Prime Minister’s announcement imposes an ultimatum on growers: you either get your act together and form a new entity without our help or we will impose complete deregulation on the industry. That is how it appeared to many in the industry. The effect of that threat is to further polarise an already divided industry, impose an incredible burden on the industry at a time it is busy planting the next crop and, if not facing the worst drought in history, trying to recover from the worst drought in history. All of this is in an election year and will make it even more difficult for industry to achieve what the government could not achieve, and that is unity.
I want to endorse the comments of my colleagues in the House of Representatives last night, Mr Crean and Mr Gavan O’Connor, who pointed out what this is: an appalling failure of leadership on the part of this government. Mr O’Connor described it as ‘the ultimate buckpass’. There are around 30,000 wheat farmers across Australia, and not one of them was given a chance to have a look at this legislation as far as we are aware—certainly none of them have come forward and said to us, ‘Well, we saw it.’ Nor have they had an opportunity to have a say on what they think is fair and reasonable. The fact is—and the Prime Minister has admitted as much—that this issue has divided the coalition party room. What they have concocted is not a plan for the future of the wheat industry; it is frankly a plan simply to get the government through to the next election. The fact is that in this regard growers have been denied natural justice in this process.
The government claims it has widely consulted growers through the Wheat Export Marketing Consultative Committee—or the Ralph committee process. This morning in the House of Representatives, Minister McGauran criticised Labor for not responding to the Ralph report. Frankly, what a stupid statement—the government has not released the Ralph report! Despite the fact that we called for its release some time ago, this minister declined to publicly released this report—not just to the opposition but to the public. Then the minister makes a goose of himself by suggesting that somehow the opposition is at fault for not responding to a report that it has not seen. Nobody has seen it, not even the growers who at least were part of that consultation. I called on the government to release the Ralph report back on 13 March. At that time I said growers had a right to know the basis upon which the government would be be making its decisions.
The government keeps referring to this mysterious Ralph report, claiming that more than 70 per cent of growers support what the government is proposing. Why doesn’t the government release the report? It is relying on a secret document. The committee reported to the government on the results of the consultation in late March. I note that on the department’s website it states:
...whether the Committee’s report will be made publicly available is a matter for the government to determine.
We know now that the government determined not to release it. Why? What has the government got to hide? Before I finish with the secretive Ralph report, I want to make a very important point: the Ralph committee only consulted less than 10 per cent of growers. Labor knows—because we are listening—that there are many more growers out there who do not support what the government is proposing. Apart from that, even assuming that the government is accurately quoting from the mysterious Ralph report, the government has not even done what the majority of growers have said they want done—that is assuming you believe the government when it allegedly quotes from the mysterious Ralph report. On 22 May, the Prime Minister told the parliament:
Very strong majority support was expressed during the consultations led by the respected businessman Mr Ralph with Australian wheat growers that they favoured the retention of the single desk. A figure was cited by him of 70 per cent of the people he spoke to, although only a small minority of that 70 per cent favoured the single desk remaining in the hands of AWB. That is a conclusion that the government completely shares and endorses.
However, despite this, the government introduced into the House last week a piece of legislation which in its current form will allow AWB to retain the single desk. I will say again: it will allow AWB to retain the single desk. Frankly, Minister McGauran tried to sneak this provision through. The legislation in its original form would have allowed AWB to be reappointed to run the single desk, including with the veto power.
According to the Prime Minister, this is in direct conflict with what the majority of growers want. Minister McGauran was rolled by Mr Tuckey and others, but the amendment they moved this week, which has been passed in the House of Representatives, will still allow AWB to run the single desk, albeit without the veto power. How could this happen? My understanding of this legislation is that, if the minister makes no decision to appoint a designated company, then after 30 June 2008, the single desk will revert to AWB, which is nominated company B only without the veto. That is how it works, that is how the legislation is structured at the moment, as it has been introduced into this place.
The minister knows full well that the single desk is defined by section 57(1A) of the act in combination with the constitution of AWB Ltd. Section 57(1A) of the act exempts nominated company B from applying to the Wheat Export Authority for a licence to export wheat. It is this exemption which bestows privileges upon AWB Ltd which are not conferred upon other wheat traders, and the minister has not proposed in this bill to amend this section of the act and has therefore somehow managed to hoodwink the entire government into believing that they have somehow removed the single desk from AWB. The fact is this legislation allows AWB to continue as a single desk holder—this is in the Prime Minister’s own words—contrary to what the majority of growers have told the government, through the Ralph committee, that they want. There can be no more damning evidence than this that the government has stopped listening to the farming community and has lost touch with them.
As I said earlier, up until last Thursday when the legislation was introduced, grower groups had not seen the detailed legislation and as such have not been provided an opportunity to consider the detailed nature of the changes. On Thursday, 14 June the government passed a motion to exempt the bill from the cut off in this place, which means it can be dealt with in this session—and that is the government’s intention. When the cut-off motion was introduced the bill had not been introduced. Since then, the government has moved significant amendments to the legislation, which I suggest means that the legislation was flawed upon its introduction and has been hastily amended. I suggest this indicates that the legislation is probably fatally flawed because, despite the fact that it has recently been passed by the House, the coalition, as I understand it, remains bitterly divided over what has been able to be agreed upon and what should be in it.
Why would the government deny growers a chance to have a say over this legislation? Why would the government deny the parliament an opportunity to have a say over this legislation through a committee inquiry? There is only one reason: the issue is still splitting the coalition party room and the government wants to get it out of the way. Now that is not fair to growers, it is not fair to the Australian people and it is not fair to the parliament. What guarantee can the government provide that the legislation as it currently stands is not still riddled with errors or tricks by Minister McGauran? I wonder if Senator Judith Adams is happy with this legislation, which she is apparently about to vote in favour of, paving the way for AWB to be reappointed to run the single desk.
My office has been in discussions with major growers and trading groups. We have done the best we can with the disgracefully short notice we have been given by the government in relation to this legislation. But what I can say is this: we have received many submissions, both in writing and verbally, which highlight concerns and, in some cases, serious flaws with the legislation. The number and nature of submissions my office has received demonstrates that the government has not adequately consulted the industry about its plans.
Last week, in response to these concerns, Labor announced its plan to move to split the bill to allow a bill extending the minister’s power of veto to be passed this week and incorporate other non-urgent aspects of the legislation into a separate bill that can be referred to the Senate rural and regional affairs committee for inquiry, and that is the purpose of this process. We did this so that the parliament and growers and the public could have a say over the legislation.
Our call to refer the legislation to the Senate committee was widely supported by grower groups. The Grains Council said in their media release on 14 June:
“We note that the Opposition is seeking to refer the amended Act to the Senate’s Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Standing Committee, for examination of the detail of the legislation and its impact on the industry. We support this move. The Committee is respected across the industry and has a depth of knowledge of the wheat export system”, Mr Jones said.

There is obviously a need for more scrutiny, because the government itself found the original bill unacceptable and has amended it. But these amendments do not go far enough. Apart from the obvious flaw that the amended bill will allow the single desk to return to AWB, there is a range of other problems that we are aware of, and probably more that would come to light through the committee process.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-20,"—The Greens support the motion to have the Wheat Marketing Amendment bill 2007 referred to committee. We believe it is essential that sections of this bill are referred. We believe that substantive sections of it need to be thoroughly reviewed. We believe there is unnecessary haste to force this bill through this place. While we acknowledge that there are areas that need to be dealt with more urgently, we believe that those should be dealt with first and the rest of it thoroughly reviewed and considered. That allows not only the Senate but also the community the time to adequately consider this bill. Because it is a major issue to the community, the Greens believe that there needs to be adequate time given.
We saw the debacle that occurred with our last system for marketing wheat. We need to make sure that we get it right this time to support our farmers and give them security and also to ensure our place internationally so that our name is not dragged through the mud of the international wheat scene again. We find the urgency quite worrying. This bill is being rushed through the parliament with what I believe to be indecent haste. It is obviously politically motivated. There has been a very strong debate within the coalition. I would suggest that there was some consultation carried out with the community by members of the coalition. That was obviously done in private. We believe that this debate needs to be fully aired so that we can have a public debate about the future of our wheat marketing because it is of such crucial importance to our farmers, our community and our regional centres. We are talking about the future of regional Australia when we talk about the future of our marketing system.
This debate is being rushed through so that the government can shut down debate on this issue in the run-up to the election not only within the coalition but within the community. The only urgent part is dealing with the veto. That could be dealt with while the rest of it is subjected to the proper scrutiny of a full inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I am a member of that committee. I know that we go through things with a fine tooth comb and I believe that is the appropriate way to look at this bill.
We saw the complete disaster of the previous arrangement. We certainly do not think that we should be exposing Australia and our farmers to that particular debacle again, because we do not believe the marketing of our wheat will survive another scandal like that. The way this bill is being rushed through means that it deliberately avoids scrutiny. Pushing it through will not enable us to have a full and complete debate on it and analysis of it. This bill has major ramifications for our future and the way that we sell wheat and we should have the opportunity to carefully consider it, to look at whether the appropriate approach is being taken and also to look for any loopholes.
We see loopholes coming up all the time. In fact, we were just debating some this morning on the safety net legislation. We had an inquiry into that, limited though it was, and the government introduced amendments to address some of the issues that came up during the inquiry. I strongly suspect that there may be the same sorts of loopholes written into this legislation, particularly as it has been so rushed and had such little time for outside scrutiny. I know that the coalition has had some consultation with some stakeholders on the bill, but this does not allow adequate time for people to do a proper, full, detailed analysis in public of the provisions of the bill. We believe, as I said, that the community needs to be able to have that debate in public.
The bill provides for the government to designate a company to hold the single desk and export privileges and make significant amendments to the Wheat Export Authority. What happens next year if farmers cannot put together an appropriate body is of concern to us. The failure of oversight is one of the biggest lessons to be learnt from the bribery scandal. We need to ensure that the oversight provisions are up to scratch and meet the accountability needs and that adequate safeguards are put in place. These are the sorts of issues that the community wants to look at and to be able to comment on.
The Greens can see no reason why the bill should not be referred to committee to allow the committee to look at it, to receive submissions and to look at these very significant issues. We strongly believe that, to maintain faith with the farmers of this country and the community, we should be referring this to committee. We will be supporting this motion. We are very deeply concerned, as I have said in this place before, about the contempt that is being shown to the community and to farmers by the fact that this is being rushed through in this manner.
Amendments to bills that are made on the run when further consultation is carried out before the bill comes before us is of concern. This is essentially what is happening here, which indicates to me that there are still issues that need to be looked at in this bill and that we should be allowed time to adequately consider them without the bill being rushed through at a minute to midnight, which is virtually what we will be doing tomorrow. At a minute to midnight we will be looking at this bill. Everyone is dead on their feet already, so not only are we not even referring it to committee but we are dealing with it at the very last minute.

In relation to the motion that is before us, the government will oppose this motion to refer the legislation to a committee. As I have previously stated, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007 provides extended certainty to the wheat-growing sector. I trust that Senator Siewert was not seeking to be too provocative to those of us on this side of the chamber with the suggestion that the Greens were championing the cause of the farming community. That is a very difficult one for us to swallow but I will leave it there.

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-06-20,"—Isn’t it amazing? We are talking about a piece of legislation, the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2007, dealing with an industry that is worth billions of export dollars to Australia. It was introduced last week into the House of Representatives. It has not been shared, prior to introduction, in any form with the grower communities. All we hear is, ‘It’s just a technical matter and we’re not going to support a reference to a committee.’
We gave the government every opportunity to deal with the only matter that it considered was urgent, when this bill was exempted from the cut-off. On page 31 of today’s Notice Paper, there is a contingent notice of motion of mine. That would enable the splitting of this bill so that the urgent matters could be passed and these other matters could be the subject of an inquiry for report in the next sittings in August. It would allow an inquiry to take place expeditiously over the break. There has been no indication from the government that they have given any consideration to that whatsoever.
There has been no indication from those senators who have been vocal in their criticism of the positions taken by the minister in relation to the single desk. There is a complete picture of unity on the government’s side, and that is what this is all about. The government and the coalition party room want this legislation out of the way and the problem put to one side until after the next election. We know there is not real unanimity in the coalition party room. Indeed, the grower community is not united as to the future for export wheat marketing, but the only thing this legislation is intended to do is to put the problem to bed until after the election. It is remarkable that, with all of the issues which are being raised by grower representatives and other parties to the industry, this government is prepared to rush the legislation through with a minimum of scrutiny and a minimum of an opportunity for the parliament to look at it.
We really believe that it is responsible for us to propose that this legislation be referred to a committee—a committee on which the government has a controlling majority. It is not a committee that is going to be hijacked by the opposition or the minor parties; it is a committee on which the government has a majority. It is a committee which, frankly, has a history of handing down unanimous reports. More often than not it has handed down unanimous reports. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee has, on a variety of occasions, looked at the situation of the wheat industry and legislation of this type, but the minister has obviously extracted concessions from his party room, and senators are apparently not prepared to challenge the view of the minister in relation to the passage of this legislation, for the reasons that I have outlined.
If this motion is not carried then of course there will need to be an extensive committee stage of this legislation, and the opposition will be insisting on answers to questions about the construction of the legislation and its impact. We will not accept a deferral of those matters to some other time. I put the government on notice that they will need to have material available to be able to answer questions about the impact of the legislation, if we come to that point. That, frankly, is an inadequate way of dealing with the legislation and the suggested problems that exist with it.
In relation to the comments from Senator Murray, I privately clarified his statement. He expressed to me the view that he had the impression that the government were going to vote down this reference and therefore perhaps some other course of action might be open. He was well aware of our contingent notice of motion which would allow the splitting of the bill. I took it that he thought that was a preferable course of action. As I understand it, the alternative position that he put was on the basis that he was aware that the government were committed to a course of action, irrespective of the arguments put, to have this bill not referred to a committee.
I say again that this is a bill which deals with an industry which involves billions of export dollars and thousands of farming families’ livelihoods, but this government are so arrogant that they are content that it be rushed through the parliament—with a week from its introduction until its passage—with no real scrutiny through proper processes, and with a behind-closed-doors process negotiating some amendments, the impact of which will probably only become clear some time down the track. They ask growers to believe that they have acted in their interest. Frankly, that is a laughable proposition. It is laughable to suggest that this parliament’s conducting itself in this way will be in the interests of the community or the growers or, indeed, the probity of the parliament.
I suggest that it would be best for those coalition senators who support this bill to hang their heads in shame. I understand why they would vote for it. I understand that it is about party unity. But I suggest that it is much more important that legislation which affects growers be conducted in a way that allows growers to have a real say, a considered say, in the outcomes of it. This legislation, frankly, might be with us for some time. One does not know the intention of the government after the election. One does not know whether the Prime Minister is suggesting deregulation to one group of coalition party room members and something quite different to another group of coalition party room members. Perhaps that is academic anyway. Perhaps we will never know. But it is an incredible shame that the government is intent upon preventing appropriate scrutiny of legislation when it concerns such an important sector of the economy and when it can have such a great impact on this industry and, indeed, on Australia’s international trading reputation.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator O’Brien’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee</title>,Committees,29,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2007-06-20,"—The Greens support the motion to have the Wheat Marketing Amendment bill 2007 referred to committee. We believe it is essential that sections of this bill are referred. We believe that substantive sections of it need to be thoroughly reviewed. We believe there is unnecessary haste to force this bill through this place. While we acknowledge that there are areas that need to be dealt with more urgently, we believe that those should be dealt with first and the rest of it thoroughly reviewed and considered. That allows not only the Senate but also the community the time to adequately consider this bill. Because it is a major issue to the community, the Greens believe that there needs to be adequate time given.
We saw the debacle that occurred with our last system for marketing wheat. We need to make sure that we get it right this time to support our farmers and give them security and also to ensure our place internationally so that our name is not dragged through the mud of the international wheat scene again. We find the urgency quite worrying. This bill is being rushed through the parliament with what I believe to be indecent haste. It is obviously politically motivated. There has been a very strong debate within the coalition. I would suggest that there was some consultation carried out with the community by members of the coalition. That was obviously done in private. We believe that this debate needs to be fully aired so that we can have a public debate about the future of our wheat marketing because it is of such crucial importance to our farmers, our community and our regional centres. We are talking about the future of regional Australia when we talk about the future of our marketing system.
This debate is being rushed through so that the government can shut down debate on this issue in the run-up to the election not only within the coalition but within the community. The only urgent part is dealing with the veto. That could be dealt with while the rest of it is subjected to the proper scrutiny of a full inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. I am a member of that committee. I know that we go through things with a fine tooth comb and I believe that is the appropriate way to look at this bill.
We saw the complete disaster of the previous arrangement. We certainly do not think that we should be exposing Australia and our farmers to that particular debacle again, because we do not believe the marketing of our wheat will survive another scandal like that. The way this bill is being rushed through means that it deliberately avoids scrutiny. Pushing it through will not enable us to have a full and complete debate on it and analysis of it. This bill has major ramifications for our future and the way that we sell wheat and we should have the opportunity to carefully consider it, to look at whether the appropriate approach is being taken and also to look for any loopholes.
We see loopholes coming up all the time. In fact, we were just debating some this morning on the safety net legislation. We had an inquiry into that, limited though it was, and the government introduced amendments to address some of the issues that came up during the inquiry. I strongly suspect that there may be the same sorts of loopholes written into this legislation, particularly as it has been so rushed and had such little time for outside scrutiny. I know that the coalition has had some consultation with some stakeholders on the bill, but this does not allow adequate time for people to do a proper, full, detailed analysis in public of the provisions of the bill. We believe, as I said, that the community needs to be able to have that debate in public.
The bill provides for the government to designate a company to hold the single desk and export privileges and make significant amendments to the Wheat Export Authority. What happens next year if farmers cannot put together an appropriate body is of concern to us. The failure of oversight is one of the biggest lessons to be learnt from the bribery scandal. We need to ensure that the oversight provisions are up to scratch and meet the accountability needs and that adequate safeguards are put in place. These are the sorts of issues that the community wants to look at and to be able to comment on.
The Greens can see no reason why the bill should not be referred to committee to allow the committee to look at it, to receive submissions and to look at these very significant issues. We strongly believe that, to maintain faith with the farmers of this country and the community, we should be referring this to committee. We will be supporting this motion. We are very deeply concerned, as I have said in this place before, about the contempt that is being shown to the community and to farmers by the fact that this is being rushed through in this manner.
Amendments to bills that are made on the run when further consultation is carried out before the bill comes before us is of concern. This is essentially what is happening here, which indicates to me that there are still issues that need to be looked at in this bill and that we should be allowed time to adequately consider them without the bill being rushed through at a minute to midnight, which is virtually what we will be doing tomorrow. At a minute to midnight we will be looking at this bill. Everyone is dead on their feet already, so not only are we not even referring it to committee but we are dealing with it at the very last minute. That is not the appropriate way to legislate for the future of wheat marketing in this country.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2007-06-20,"—I foreshadowed earlier today that the government would be moving an amendment, which I think has been circulated—item (1) on sheet QH363. The government amendment reflects recommendation 2 of the Senate Community Affairs Committee report into the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Bill 2007. The recommendation of the committee was that the minister report to the Senate 12 months after the implementation of the reforms on the impact of the reforms particularly on the cost of medicines to consumers.
What the government proposes here is just  that the minister must prepare a report on the impact of the reforms made by the bill and the impact on the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to patients as a consequence of the reforms. I should point out, however, that the preparation of the report, according to the amendment, must be completed by 31 December 2009. I understand that the opposition agrees with that because it is only at that stage that sufficient information will be available to make sensible conclusions about public policy. I move amendment (1) on sheet QH363 on behalf of the government:
(1)    Schedule 1, Part 1, page 63 (after line 14), at the end of the Part, add:
93A  After section 104A
Insert:

              (a)    the impact of the reforms made by the National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme) Act 2007; and
              (b)    the impact on the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to patients as a consequence of the reforms.
         (2)    The preparation of the report must be completed by 31 December 2009.
         (3)    The Minister must cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 5 sitting days of that House after the day of the completion of the preparation of the report.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-20,"—We are pleased to see that at least this amendment has come forward. But in saying that, this is the role of the committee. This is what usually happens in the community affairs committee. This is where you have discussions about what the appropriate date should be for reporting. If it had not been that there was an opportunity, because we went into matters of public importance, for the parliamentary secretary and I and our advisers to have a chat, we would be arguing about a date that was six months earlier. This is the appropriate date, 31 December 2009, for this to be reporting. At that stage we will have 12 months of real data and six months in order to conduct the inquiry.
That is why you do not truncate Senate inquiries—so that you have time to talk through and think through the implications of proposed amendments before the chamber across those people who are interested and involved. Unfortunately, because of the truncation of the inquiry, we have done that here. That is a bit of luck. I do not want to legislate by luck. I want to have a bit of time to think things through properly to make sure that we end up with the right result. Labor would have preferred our amendment in terms of the conduct of the inquiry—that it be done by the Pharmaceutical Services Federal Committee of Inquiry. We understand the government’s position on that. We would have preferred as a second option to have a group of people independent of the minister to conduct the inquiry. That would be our preferred position. But we will support this proposal as it stands given that it is better than nothing.
I am pleased to hear the parliamentary secretary confirm that this puts into effect recommendation 2 of the Senate committee of inquiry. The concern of Labor has always been around the cost to patients and consumers. The language, which has shifted slightly from our proposal, talks about the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to patients. As long as the cost of pharmaceutical benefits to patients means the costs of medicines to consumers including copayments and special patient contribution or premium payments is clear—and that is what the inquiry will be about—then we are somewhat happier than if we were not to have an inquiry at all. I thank the parliamentary secretary for at least negotiating as far as we have got on this—I think it is better than having nothing—and I also want to put on record my thanks to the advisers for their assistance and to my adviser who has gone back over to the shadow minister for health’s office where she lives.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2007-06-20,"—I also support this amendment. I would have preferred the ALP amendment but I recognise that the government wishes to keep control of this. I was not able to make a second reading contribution to this debate. It is a very complex bill and a difficult one to understand in a very short time frame. There were not a lot of submissions; there certainly were none, I think it is fair to say, that were able to make an in-depth critique of this legislation. So it was certainly our feeling that a review would assist us to know whether or not we were doing the right thing in supporting this legislation. The PBS is a fundamentally important part of our health system and we were very nervous about supporting something which might undermine it in any way. We were very supportive of the idea that we should be moving to generic-brand medicines in this country, acknowledging that we pay more for them than other countries do. So it is a complex and difficult issue to deal with. As I said, we would have liked more time to look into this legislation, but that was not to be. We look forward to the review that this amendment provides for and hope that it is done in a very comprehensive and honest way so that we know whether this legislation has been effective or not.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I rise to speak to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007. This bill is essentially designed to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to establish a new regulatory framework for live internet content, mobile content and convergent devices, such as mobile phones and other mobile communications devices that act as multimedia platforms and can deliver audiovisual content, so that children are protected from exposure to inappropriate or harmful content delivered via such devices. The bill will also amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to include the Indian Ocean territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos islands in reviews by the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee. I might leave my contribution at that point as a little introduction. I understand that our shadow minister Senator Conroy is going to seek to incorporate his speech and that Senator Wortley is keen to make a contribution.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTENT SERVICES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I rise to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007. This bill is intended to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 so as to establish a new regulatory framework for live internet and mobile content and convergent devices, including 3G mobile phones and other mobile communications devices that act as multimedia platforms and are able to deliver audiovisual content, so that our children are protected from exposure to inappropriate or harmful content delivered via such devices. So the purpose of this bill is essentially to protect minors from damaging content so delivered, and this purpose is to be achieved by way of a coregulatory approach on the part of government and industry participants. It will also see amendments to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999.
Labor supports the general intent of the bill. Labor has stated unequivocally that the protection of children from exposure to violent, pornographic, harmful and otherwise inappropriate material, whether via the internet or other convergent technologies, is paramount. Labor is committed to the protection of minors from damaging online content. All present in this place recognise the common ground on which this commitment is based: that young and vulnerable children must be protected from inappropriate and harmful content available on the internet and via mobile phones and other technologies.
This bill is based on the premise that clearly consumers are increasingly accessing avenues of information and entertainment through mobile phones and subscription internet sites. Mobile phones and other hand-held devices offer access to a range of media-rich services, including broadcasting, internet and telephone content. The scale of these related technologies is demonstrated by international research which, on the most recent data, puts the number of mobile phone subscribers globally at in excess of two billion; and the most recent data for mobile phone subscribers in Australia estimates the number to be more than 18 million. The adoption rate has been phenomenal, providing users with access to music, video, games, internet, SMS and video messages, to name just a few. In relation to the internet, there are in Australia 6.43 million active internet subscribers. A breakdown of this figure shows there are 761,000 business and government subscribers—this is subscribers, not users—and more than 5.6 million households that subscribe to the internet, with a varying number of users in each household having access to live streamed videos, chat rooms, blogs, video-file sharing and virtual worlds.
The benefits of such services to consumers and, through the creation of new commercial potentials, to carriage service providers and content service providers are enormous. There is also enormous potential for the dissemination of harmful, exploitative or otherwise offensive material, particularly to minors. Gone are the days when parents simply changed channels or turned off the television or radio if they considered broadcast material to be inappropriate in the context of their particular family circumstances and values.
This bill establishes a framework where content will be prohibited over the internet and on other convergent devices under certain circumstances including: when it has been classified RC or X18+ by the Classification Board; when it has been classified R18+ and access to it is not subject to an age verification system; and when it has been classified MA15+ and it has been provided by a commercial content provider, but it is not a news or a current affairs service, or it does not consist of text or still images, and it is not subject to an age verification system. This bill proposes that when such ephemeral content is accessed on a commercial basis it should be regulated via mechanisms that include pre-provision assessment, access restrictions or outright prohibition, and complaints protocols. Stored content will be similarly liable to regulation. There will be a significantly expanded role for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to include registration and approval of industry codes of practice, the determination of industry standards and service provider rules and the potential for imposition of penalties should a content provider fail to comply with a notice issued by the authority.
The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, which was recently charged with the role of examining this bill, accurately stated that industry and consumer groups that furnished submissions to its inquiry were generally supportive of the bill’s intent; however, it is important to note that each of these submissions articulated significant and specific concerns as to the bill’s terms and/or likely effect. Some submissions opposed the bill on civil liberties grounds or on the basis of general policy differences. Another submission looked to the needs of artists in setting out its concerns regarding the ambit of the proposed provisions. It submitted that the bill did not adequately take into account the needs of filmmakers and multimedia and digital artists.
ALP senators submitted a minority report highlighting some of the major concerns. They identified a number of issues, including the fact that the bill does not prevent prohibited material from being accessed through overseas content providers. A further issue was that content classified MA15+, which is now accessible to those aged 15 and over—for example, in movie previews—cannot be accessed from an Australian website without age verification. This would of course be problematic for minors between 15 and 17 years of age because credit cards are not available to those under the age of 18. A method of age verification would therefore need to be established. Other issues included: the fact that the bill would extend a prohibition to material rated RC and X18+, which would mean that this material could not be watched on the internet despite the fact that it would be legally available in some jurisdictions and could be legally purchased from other jurisdictions via mail order; that consultation with makers of content appeared to have been deficient; that there would be the potential for discrimination against artists using the convergent technologies for the creation and dissemination of artistic works including video art work, web and sound art, and short films; that the proposed mechanisms for furnishing a take-down notice to a hosting service that was hosting or was proposing to host content that was the same or largely similar to that identified in the notice, in their present form, would not be sufficiently certain for both the regulator and hosting services; that the reference to the provision of trained content assessors raised related questions as to the type and level of training required, the cost that would have to be borne and by what mechanism the cost would be met; and that the definition of ‘content service’, with its exemptions, is confusing and appears to confuse the roles of content service provider and of content carriage provider.
Labor support the intent of this bill but we are concerned that it may not be as effective as intended. It may also provide parents with a false sense of security because the bill only prevents children from accessing prohibited or potentially prohibited content when it is hosted on Australian sites. For children to be adequately protected today from accessing prohibited or potentially prohibited material via the internet, we must consider content filtering. Labor considers that this bill does not go far enough. Labor believes that we should make use of the available tools—including the use of internet service provider filtering—to protect Australian children from exposure to harmful and inappropriate internet content. A clean feed filtering service to homes, schools and public libraries can filter out Australian and overseas sites containing content that is harmful or inappropriate.
In conclusion, I draw attention to the fact that once again—as has so often been the case—Labor senators have formed the view, from the evidence, that submitting organisations were not allowed sufficient time to formulate and to furnish their views on the proposed provisions. Once again, this unseemly haste in dealing with a matter of significant complexity and importance demonstrates the government’s reckless and—if it is possible—increasingly blatant obsession with ensuring that its bills are passed without the benefit of proper and comprehensive external scrutiny. While Labor supports the intent of the bill, we emphasise the importance of realising that intent via a sound and reliable legislative framework.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTENT SERVICES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-06-20,"—I concur with the views that Senator Wortley has just put forward. I recognise that this is a growing and huge matter for debate. One only had to look at the Herald Sun on the weekend to confirm the concerns expressed by a lot of people in the community about the violence that passes for entertainment, no matter where you look. I was in Sydney on the weekend and I wanted to go to the pictures but it was very difficult to find a movie that was not predicated on the theme of violence. I was not going to pay $15 to be depressed about that.
However, the questions about the global culture of violence are ones that we are going to have to deal with. We will support any step along that road, and we support this legislation. But I expect that we are going to have to go into much more difficult territory to counter this culture of violence, before some sort of probity is brought into place to stop those people who want to capitalise on violence in order to make money and profit. They do our society no good.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTENT SERVICES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2007-06-20,"—I rise to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007, which brings with it amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. The bill is far-reaching in both its intent and its design, and it builds on the government’s Online Content Scheme. It attempts to address community concerns about the ability of current regulation to prevent children and others from viewing harmful or inappropriate content over the internet and convergent technologies. In doing so, this bill attempts to draw together and address some of the key issues in Australia today: technology, how that technology is used and how to prevent it from adversely affecting our children.
This is no small task. Technology evolves rapidly. Mobile phones came into popular use in the early to mid-1990s. Since that time, they have become smaller and ‘smarter’. In addition to making telephone calls, mobile phones, in many instances, now allow users to browse the internet, take photos, send emails or listen to music. Similarly, the internet is another piece of modern technology that came into popular use in the early to mid-1990s and has evolved rapidly since that time. Over the last decade or more, the internet has opened viewers up to a world of entertainment such as live streamed videos, blogs, chat rooms, video file-sharing and virtual worlds, to name but a few. Such technology has delivered a great many benefits to society and to economies the world over. However, given the nature of the internet and the ability of users today to browse content on their computer or mobile phone on any conceivable subject, there is concern that some users—in particular, children—may be exposed to inappropriate and/or harmful material in doing so.
This bill aims to protect children from exposure to inappropriate and harmful material by regulating content services delivered over the internet and by convergent devices, such as 3G mobile phones. Labor supports the intent of this bill. Children are one of society’s most important assets and deserve our protection. Under the proposed framework set out in the bill, content must not be delivered or made available to the public where it is prohibited or potentially prohibited or must not be made available without the appropriate age verification systems, where they are required. Content will be prohibited over the internet and on other convergent devices if it has been classified RC or X18+ by the Classification Board; if it has been classified R18+ and access is not subject to an age verification system; and if it has been classified MA15+, is provided by a commercial content provider—but is not a news or current affairs service—does not consist of text or still images and is not subject to an age verification system. Content will be potentially prohibited content if it has not been classified by the Classification Board. However, if it were to be classified, there is a substantial likelihood that it would be prohibited content. These prohibitions and limitations also apply to live content streamed over the internet or other convergent devices. Content provided by commercial content providers that is yet to be classified must be assessed prior to it being provided by a trained content assessor. The trained content assessor must advise whether the service might be prohibited, and the service provider must then take the appropriate action or face penalties under the bill.
The aim of the bill, then, is clearly to make sure that children and other users of the internet and convergent technologies will not be subjected to prohibited, or potentially prohibited, content. The bill also acts to greatly expand the role of ACMA. Drawing on the ‘take-down model’ set out in the Online Content Scheme, the bill provides that ACMA may issue service providers with a take-down notice where service providers are hosting prohibited content in breach of the bill. The take-down notice directs the service provider to remove the prohibited content. Where a service provider broadcasts potentially prohibited content, ACMA may issue it with an interim take-down notice. An interim take-down notice directs the service provider to remove the potentially prohibited content until the Classification Board has classified the material. If the material is subsequently classified by the Classification Board as prohibited content, ACMA may issue the service provider with a final take-down notice. ACMA may also issue a service provider that has been the subject of an interim or final take-down notice with a special take-down notice where it is concerned that the service provider is hosting, or is intending to host, content that is the same as, or similar to, the earlier prohibited content.
Further, in the case of a service provider broadcasting prohibited or potentially prohibited live content, ACMA may issue it with an interim or final service-cessation notice. In the case of a service provider with an Australian connection hosting links to prohibited sites, ACMA may issue it with an interim or final links-deletion notice. Where a service provider fails to comply with a notice issued by ACMA under the bill, it may face civil or criminal penalties.
The bill continues the co-regulatory approach adopted by the government in relation to broadcasting services. Under the bill, content providers should develop codes of practice to address the means by which they will endeavour to meet their regulatory obligations. ACMA should make reasonable efforts to ensure that the codes are registered. ACMA may also step in where it considers industry codes are necessary to safeguard the community or deal with the conduct or performance of particular participants in the industry. Under the bill, complaints about content may be made to ACMA. ACMA will investigate any complaints made in relation to breaches of the bill as well as possible breaches of the code of practice requirements. ACMA may also launch investigations on its own initiative into issues such as access to, or provision of, certain content. Service providers may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of decisions of ACMA related to take-down notices, service cessation notices, link deletion notices, the registration of industry codes and certain directions and determinations.
As I have stated, Labor supports the intent of this bill. Labor recognises that children are one of society’s most important assets. The things children see and experience today shape their future life experiences. Accordingly, Labor wishes for Australian children to have positive learning experiences so that they grow up to be confident and enriched young adults. It is for this reason that Labor is concerned that this bill, while espousing to protect children from harmful and inappropriate material, may not have its intended effect. Labor’s concern is that this bill is misleading Australian parents. The bill does prevent children from accessing prohibited or potentially prohibited content, but only when the prohibited or potentially prohibited content is hosted on an Australian site.
This bill does not protect children—or indeed anyone—from accessing harmful or inappropriate content from overseas content providers. As the internet is a global system, accessing such material, even with this bill in place, will be as simple as the touch of a few buttons. As such, this bill clearly falls short of its intended goal. The only way to truly protect children from accessing such material is by way of content filtering.
Labor has long supported ISP filtering as a means by which to protect Australian children from harmful or inappropriate content. A clean-feed filtering service to all households, schools and public libraries can filter out sites that contain harmful or inappropriate content such as pornography and violent material. As such, under a clean-feed filtering system, children will be protected from accessing inappropriate or harmful material hosted on both Australian and overseas sites.
Labor is also concerned that this bill poses an unnecessary restriction on content creators such as artists. Many artists today choose to use the internet or convergent technologies either as an artistic medium or as a means by which to disseminate their work. Many of these artists also create works that are thought provoking or even controversial and on subjects that may be considered prohibited or potentially prohibited content under this bill. Accordingly, this bill may unnecessarily censor artists using this medium. It would appear that the government did not adequately consult with content creators, such as artists, prior to the drafting of this bill. As a result, the bill may serve to disadvantage them. Australia has a thriving creative community. The potential impact of this bill upon the work of these artists and their livelihoods cannot and should not be overlooked.
It is for these reasons that Labor seeks to move a second reading amendment to this bill. Labor’s amendment intends to note the deficiencies in the bill which, while not fatal, have serious implications. Most notably, the bill will not protect children from accessing inappropriate or harmful material from sites hosted in countries other than Australia. The internet is a truly global network. Therefore, attempting, as this bill does, to regulate Australian content will have little impact when sites from other countries remain available for users to browse.
The internet and convergent technology such as 3G mobile phones have undoubtedly changed the way in which we communicate to others and also serve to act as new forums for entertainment. In today’s society, the use of such technology is growing. Labor, therefore, considers that it is in the interests of all Australians for the government to ensure that any regulation that may interfere with this technology, or how it is used, reflects the intent of the government in whole and not in part. I move:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate notes that:
              (a)    the Government failed to adequately consult content makers prior to the drafting of the bill;
              (b)    the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee inquiry into the bill did not allow for sufficient time to consider the bill and draft submissions to the committee;     
              (c)    the bill will not prevent access to prohibited material from offshore service providers; and
              (d)    Labor believes that children should be protected from inappropriate or harmful material on the internet, however, Labor would prefer to regulate for this via ISP filtering, as set out in Labor’s ISP filtering policy”.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTENT SERVICES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-20,"—To be cooperative I shall endeavour to be brief. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007 is a complex bill, as is often the case with this sort of regulatory framework, and because of time constraints I will not go into as much detail as I normally would. Everybody knows the history of this legislation, the genesis behind it and the need to try to regulate content services delivered over convergent devices such as broadband services to mobile handsets et cetera. There are a few key questions here. The first is: do we need to have a regulatory framework over those sorts of material and these sorts of devices? Given that we already have a regulatory framework in place, it seems reasonable to seek to extend the regulatory framework to other devices that are currently exempt from it.
The second question is whether the approach that has been put forward will work. That is a much more open question. Certainly there is a lot of strong opinion, some of which was put to the Senate inquiry, that suggests that the current setup with regard to the internet does not work terribly well. There is a very valid argument that having a framework in place gives people the assumption that content can be adequately controlled and contained, whether it is pornography, violence or other sorts of inappropriate material. If we have that framework there people assume that that means there are controls in place to regulate it adequately. If those controls do not actually work terribly effectively, then that can be counterproductive. People assume there is an effective mechanism in place and do not worry about doing anything further about it. If the mechanism does not actually work adequately, then not only does it not necessarily perform the task that it is intended for but it can create a false impression of security. There is a bit of an open debate there about how adequately it works and whether its inadequacies or limitations are such as to discredit the whole system.
That same debate can be carried over to the approach and mechanism that is being put forward here in this legislation. As I have stated, there are arguments on both sides with regard to that, and the workability is an issue as much as the principles behind it. Certainly some within the community and some who put forward submissions to the inquiry suggested that there were issues with regard to constraints on freedom of speech. That is an issued the Democrats have always taken very seriously.
We have always had a general approach that seeks to encourage minimum necessary censorship, but minimum necessary censorship does not mean no constraints or controls at all. Of course, there is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression. Article 19 states:
1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.
And:
2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression;
But it should be emphasised that part of that article 19 of the convention also says that the right in paragraph 2:
... carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:
(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;
Certainly we already as a parliament and I think as a community more broadly strongly support constraints on freedom of speech in regard to certain types of advertising—for example, cigarette advertising. Indeed, the Democrats pioneered greater controls and constraints on cigarette advertising. I think we could go a little bit further, frankly, in terms of cigarette sponsorship and those sorts of things. So our own approach has shown that we also support limitations on those rights at certain times. I do think that needs to be emphasised.
A lot of the focus around this is on pornography, and that always excites people a lot and generates a lot of debate around the place. I am much more concerned about the degree of violence that is on a lot of standard forms of the media, let alone convergent media. But there certainly are issues. In the same way as most people would believe that exposure of children to excessive violence is potentially harmful, exposure of children to explicit pornography is also potentially harmful. There is a case to be made. But the big question mark is whether or not the framework that is in place here will work adequately to enable that to happen. In large part it tacks itself onto the existing framework, so whatever limitations there are or are not on the existing framework are to some extent added to by the new framework and the new components that are put in place through this legislation.
As we are dealing with convergent and developing technology, it also means that we are continually having to assess how workable it is and continuing to play catch-up. It is certainly an area that will need continual monitoring. That is something that is necessary. The other thing that needs monitoring is the issues surrounding the wisdom or otherwise of how expansive a level of access we allow to some of the material and certain types of material that this framework seeks to regulate. Where do we draw those lines? I guess that is the ongoing debate that we need to have.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CONTENT SERVICES) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2007-06-20,"—I would like to thank senators for their contribution to this debate. I would also like to record my thanks to key industry stakeholders for their valuable contributions towards the development of this important legislation.
The development of a comprehensive and practical content regulation framework is a significant challenge, as speakers have noted, in an era of convergence and new emerging technologies and services. The introduction of new services like 3G and video services through mobile phones means that our platform-specific regulations are becoming increasingly strained as they are applied to new media forms. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007 will extend the current safeguards that apply to content delivered over the internet or television to content delivered over convergent devices, including live, streamed services. Content rated X18+ and content which is refused classification will be prohibited. Content classified as R18+ must be provided with appropriate access restrictions to limit the availability of this material to adults. Material made available on a commercial basis for a fee and which is classified as MA15+ must also be provided with age restrictions.
The new legislation will also regulate the online distribution of electronic editions of print publications. Material which has been classified restricted category 1 or restricted category 2 or refused classification will be prohibited—for example, adult magazines currently available in some newsagents and adult shops. Mechanisms will be established to enable the regulator to take action to direct material be taken down or access removed where it is provided in contravention of the rule. Strong sanctions will be introduced for noncompliance, including criminal and civil penalties.
Under this bill the government will also allow for industry coregulation as a means of providing for regulatory frameworks to evolve and adapt with the technologies and services which they regulate. We believe that the content services bill has struck the right balance between protecting children from harmful and inappropriate content, which of course we wholeheartedly support, whilst also allowing industry to develop new business models and utilise emerging technologies. The proposed legislation will form an important part of the government’s suite of initiatives designed to regulate online content and provide greater protection for children using new technologies.
The government opposes Labor’s second reading amendment, and it is appropriate that I place on record why. In terms of the issues raised in the amendment, first, the government has worked closely with all key stakeholders in the development of this legislation, including content developers. An exposure draft of the bill was circulated to key industry stakeholders in late November 2006 and provided a wide range of interested parties with an opportunity to comment. That has included content developers and suppliers, mobile phone companies, broadcasters and major internet portal operators and publishers. The process was subsequently extended into early ’07. Significant modifications were made to the initial draft of the bill to take account of the responses received from key industry stakeholders. A number of these issues have also been the subject of further discussions between the government and key stakeholders. The amendments to the content services bill which I will be seeking to move are designed to address technical matters that have been identified by the Senate committee in its report and to some extent by industry stakeholders.
The issue that I want to address that Senator Conroy went into some detail on was the prevention of access to prohibited material from offshore providers. The bill provides new safeguards to protect consumers from inappropriate or harmful material on convergence devices, such as 3G mobile phones, and services available via subscription internet portals. It will achieve this by extending the existing regulatory framework to regulate live, streamed content services, services which provide links to content, and include stronger obligations where these services are provided as commercial content services.
In the case of overseas content and services, the Australian government has limited jurisdiction, but there a number of measures that can be applied in such circumstances. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, is able to place on a blacklist the details of the locations—that is, the URLs—of prohibited content from offshore sites which it provides to the makers of certain internet content filters to block access. ACMA must also, if it considers the content is of a sufficiently serious nature, such as pornographic material involving children, refer the issue to the Australian Federal Police. ACMA and the AFP have also formally agreed that, where possible, ACMA should refer prohibited content hosted overseas to the international Association of Internet Hotline Providers, an association of 29 accredited internet hotlines from 26 countries in Europe, Asia and North America.
Further, the AFP’s Online Child Sex Exploitation Team, which was launched in March 2005, was created to provide the AFP with national assessment and coordination capability for internet and national referrals of child pornography. The clean-feed system has a number of defects, which I have gone into before. So for all of those reasons, and because of its limitations, it would not have, for instance, exposed the appalling case that came to attention yesterday, and we do not think it is appropriate to adopt it as a commercial or a government proposition. For those reasons, we will be opposing the second reading amendment.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-06-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I only have five minutes to speak and this document is about 380 pages, so obviously I will not be able to fully reflect on its detail. I will start by lamenting that it is unfortunate that we have such a comprehensive—and, might I say, very substantial and substantive—document about issues that have been, at least in part, very much in the headlines in recent times and the subject of some quite passionate and occasionally quite fiery debate in a range of areas, and yet it gets tabled, thrown to one side and we are lucky we can talk on it for five minutes on a Wednesday night. This document is from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, who is tasked with overseeing and considering the social justice situation in regard to Indigenous Australians and measuring it against the range of human rights benchmarks that Australia as a nation and as a government have committed ourselves to. I think this does not do justice to what are very important and significance reports and recommendations contained within them.
This report only contains nine recommendations. The key ones regard facilitating Indigenous access to government services. I think we need to continually monitor and assess how this is going. I know that one of the real frustrations amongst many Indigenous people and organisations is the fact that there is so much lecturing and public commentary from ministers, state and federal, from people in the media, and from people across the board talking about how Indigenous people have to do this, have to do that, have to take responsibility for this, have to lift their game in that, and all those sorts of things. As often as not there is a reasonable degree of truth in some of those things, but it is only one part of the story. There is another big part to this story—and there is plenty of evidence to demonstrate this; and there is a lot of it in this report—that is, whatever the failings of Indigenous organisations and Indigenous communities, there are very much comparable, if not greater, failings in the delivery of government services from the government point of view.
It is just so easy to blame Indigenous people for their own problems, and we have such a long history of this. Certainly there needs to be responsibility taken—you cannot just sit back and be a victim—but that should not be used as a way to excuse the reality that there is plenty of failure to go around on the government service delivery side of things. That is a message to all governments, not only the federal government but also the state governments. I note that recommendation 1 here is directed not only to the federal government but also to the federal parliament. I think it is appropriate for parliament itself to consider and debate that particular recommendation further. A significant part of that is to have a federal parliamentary committee regularly examine the progress of the new arrangements in Indigenous affairs and the progress in achieving whole-of-government service delivery to Indigenous communities—looking at all the different components there and outlining some terms of reference as suggested.
I want to emphasise a couple of other key recommendations which are labelled here as ‘Addressing the fundamental flaw of the new arrangements for Indigenous affairs—the absence of principled engagement with Indigenous peoples’. This is not just a matter of a nice form of words or of being polite and saying, ‘It is a nice thing to engage with Indigenous peoples about government programs, government service delivery and government policy.’ It is a matter of making these things work. Even if you want to ignore basic rights and principles in regard to this, if you want to have government services, policies and programs that work then the chances of them working are dramatically reduced if you do not have proper engagement and meaningful, realistic, ongoing, continuous, honest and equal engagement with Indigenous peoples themselves. They are the ones on the ground. They are the ones who have to live with a lot of these issues. So many people, as we all know, are working themselves into the ground trying to fix and address issues. If they are not properly engaged with the government—which is coming in with various programs, buckets of money or different allocations and requirements—then the chances of things working are dramatically reduced. We really need to take into account this report. It disappoints me that there is not more opportunity to examine it fully through the parliamentary process. It is certainly something I will seek to do to ensure that the very rich detail in here is taken more fully into account. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2007-06-20,"—As Senator Bartlett points out: there is an extraordinary amount of rich detail in a number of reports published in the past week or so relating to Indigenous issues. I want to quickly have a look at two of these reports. The first was released by the Northern Territory government called The protection of Aboriginal children from sexual abuse, written by Rex Wild QC and Pat Anderson. The second report—which could not be more different from the first—is the Cape York Institute’s welfare reform report, From hand out to hand up, formally presented to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Minister Mal Brough at a press conference yesterday, by Noel Pearson from the Cape York Institute and representatives of the Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge communities.
For me, these two reports, their recommendations and their respective government responses are in contrast. Both reports deal with the breakdown of the basic requirements for a functional community of any kind. They talk about alcohol and substance abuse, violence against people and property, sexual and physical abuse, lack of meaningful occupation and hopelessness. The Cape York report notes that: the infant mortality rate amongst Indigenous Australians is two to three times higher than that of the broader community; the per capita alcohol consumption in the Cape York communities is four times that the national average; life expectancy for Indigenous men and women is 17 years less than that for non-Indigenous men and women; and, most ominously in terms of a potentially better future, the Indigenous children of Queensland are nearly five times more likely to be the subject of a protective order than other children.
As everyone present would know, none of this is new, unfortunately. In fact, there has been a longstanding tradition of state government reports—very good reports, such as the Boni Robertson report from Queensland in 1999 and the Sue Gordon inquiry in Western Australia in 2001-02. As governments, we talk wisely about them, and then nothing; nothing really changes. At the launch of the ‘hand up’ report yesterday, the Mayor of Hope Vale, Greg McLean, described opponents to change and reform in his community as wolli-wolli people. He told us that wolli-wolli people were people who lacked focus and they lacked enthusiasm for action. I think we can class Clare Martin and the Northern Territory government as wolli-wollis. They were reluctantly dragged into accepting that there were any problems in the government’s management of Indigenous issues in the Northern Territory and they were reluctantly embarrassed into setting up the Wild-Anderson inquiry. Now that they have had the report for almost two months, they are going to leap into action in August.
The most significant aspect of the Northern Territory abuse inquiry is that it succeeded in attracting so many witnesses and submissions. It held 226 meetings with individuals, agencies and organisations. It visited 45 communities and received 65 submissions. That, to me, was one of the most heartening aspects of the report, because in the context of abuse, dysfunction, violence and a general loss of identity it is very difficult to comprehend how hard it must have been for people to come and speak to that inquiry, to talk about the worst possible sorts of dysfunction within their own family and their own community. These were very brave people and they were very desperate for change. Doubly so, given the sort of cynicism and exhaustion with imposed solutions that some of them talked about. One man from Gunbalunya said, ‘We have a 20-year history of six-month programs.’ An elder said, ‘We have been piloting pilots for long enough.’ For the sake of these people, this inquiry must achieve more than filling some more library shelves with worthy but neglected recommendations.
The NT Inquiry makes 97 recommendations, but the two core recommendations are on education and reduced alcohol consumption. It notes quite correctly that one of the major pluses of education is that children are safe from sexual abuse when they are at school. For me, this seems very worthy but long term and wolli-wolli. To suggest that one of the major reasons for sending children to school is that they are safe from sexual abuse is incomprehensible in the 21st century. What about the rest of the time, especially at nights, when the adult alcohol consumption spikes? What about those children who are too young for school—the three-year-olds who are mentioned in this report as victims of sexual abuse and also witnesses of abuse and violence? It is a very sad reason for advocating education, that children are safe from abuse between 8.30 am and 3.30 pm.
By contrast, the Cape York report goes straight to the nub of the problem. It says that we do not value what we do not earn. It accepts that the problems in the four communities of Hope Vale, Aurukun, Coen and Mossman Gorge stem from dispossession and racism over many years but primarily blames a deterioration of social norms. As Mr Pearson pointed out yesterday, there are many examples of countries were people live in extreme poverty and overcrowding, but cultural norms persist. In those communities it is not okay to be chronically drunk and violent, it is not okay to abuse young teenagers and children, and it is not okay to expose children to pornography and violence. The difference, according to the Cape York report, is passive welfare. It has turned cause and effect on its head. It says that dysfunction and poverty are themselves the issues to be fixed.
The report calls for radical welfare reform. It says that all welfare payments should be conditional. In other words, if you do not meet certain obligations, you do not get your welfare payment. It says that each adult who receives a welfare payment for a child should be required to ensure that the child maintains a 100 per cent school attendance record. It says that all adults must not cause or allow children to be neglected or abused. It says that all adults must not commit drug, alcohol, gambling or family violence offences. It obliges adults to abide by conditions related to their tenancy in public housing.
Just to confirm that these were not imposed conditions in any way, I will read the next paragraph of the report. It says:
These payment obligations were selected on the basis of three factors. They were consistent with the values expressed by community members. They relate to behaviour which, if allowed to continue, would have a negative impact on child wellbeing. The existing legislative and service delivery mechanisms aimed at addressing these dysfunctional behaviours in Cape York are unable to realise the desired outcome.
This report also calls for the establishment of a new statutory authority, a family responsibilities commission, to determine whether individuals have breached these obligations and to decide on an appropriate sanction if they have. The sorts of sanctions they are suggesting in this 400-page very detailed and very well set out report go from a warning through to paying the welfare payments that might have gone to that parent to another responsible adult so that the funds go to the child.
Some of the other aims in this report include addressing what is termed the ‘welfare pedestal’, whereby young school leavers can start off on $14 an hour and find that very attractive and more rewarding than a traineeship without thinking that in five or 10 years they are going to be better off not on welfare but in a real job. One of the other aims is to support individual engagement in the economy by converting Community Development Employment Projects into real positions, asking if those are real jobs that people should be doing, making communities business friendly and moving from welfare housing to home ownership.
Like Senator Bartlett, I have just recently visited the Yarrabah community near Cairns, and I was shown around by the Mayor, Vince Mundraby, and the CEO, Leon Yeatman. Leon is probably an unusual commodity in Indigenous communities. He is a Yarrabah local. He has gone home with an MBA— (Time expired)
