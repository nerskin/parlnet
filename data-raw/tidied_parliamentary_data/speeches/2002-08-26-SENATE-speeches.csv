"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-08-26,"—When debate was adjourned last week on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, I was discussing the federal cabinet's recent visit to Cairns and the associated Liberal Party fundraising opportunities. Our figuring put the potential profit at $135,450, which also included a fundraising breakfast with Senator Vanstone. In today's letters to the editor section of the Cairns Post, Mr Peter Clark, a well-known Liberal in the area, advises that only $30,000 was raised from the dinner. Only $30,000? I have to inform Mr Clark that that is big money to be made from a political fundraiser in a regional town like Cairns.
If we can believe Mr Clark, it was a much more cosy affair than we were earlier led to believe. I say `if we can believe', because Mr Clark then goes on to outline the proceeds of a tribute dinner to the former Treasurer of Queensland, Mr Keith Delacy, held by the Labor Party in 1999. Mr Clark says that entry was worth a lot of money but, for the record, all tickets for that dinner were $50, with the exception of tickets sold to people who were unwaged, which cost $40. That is nowhere near $2,000, Mr Clark. Mr Clark's informant, if in fact there is one, got it wrong on the auction, too. There was no Tony Blair book, no picture of Westminster, no Bob Hawke poster and nobody paid $5,000 for them. Sorry, Mr Clark, I think you are just making it up as you go along. Further, dinner with a former Prime Minister is very different from having to pay to gain access to the current one. Political parties have to raise funds, but to do it by selling access in such an obvious way borders on the obscene. This fly-in fly-out profiteering would make the member for Ryan proud.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to speak on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, colloquially known amongst the Labor Party as a `dash for cash bill'. Just to reiterate comments made by Senator Faulkner, from our perspective this bill is entirely without merit, given that its sole purpose is to settle internal disputes within the Liberal Party. It is not about addressing any deficiencies within the existing Electoral Act. It would seem that other political parties are capable of managing their internal affairs and reaching similar agreements, because they have not tried to abuse the parliament by resolving internal disputes with legislation. I think Senator Ray was granted leave to table a stamp the other day for Mr Crosby to write to the Queensland branch and say, `Do what every other party does and organise the public funding to come in centrally.' But they cannot get that level of cooperation. So here we are, wasting the Senate's time with stupid, trivial, internal Liberal Party shenanigans that ought to be addressed internally. 
I will not pass up the opportunity to consider the absolutely woeful state of the Liberal Party in my home state of Tasmania. The recent Tasmanian state election was a complete debacle for the Tasmanian Liberal Party and shows obviously that the Tasmanian Liberal Party, such as it is these days, is totally out of step with the Tasmanian electorate. In fact, their vote at the last state election was 27 per cent. When the Labor Party hit the nadir of 28 per cent in 1990, I thought we were doing pretty badly; but 27 per cent beats us at our worst. It is absolutely disgraceful. 
As a result of this, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynton Crosby, was called in—I feel very sorry for him—to produce a report on what happened to the Liberal Party in Tasmania. I have to say that it is extremely interesting reading. Anybody who has any interest in campaigning or politics, which is everybody in this chamber, should have a really good look at this. It is very interesting and—I do not think intentionally— it is also very amusing. I will be quoting extensively from this report. In his report, Lynton Crosby somewhat obviously makes the statement that the Tasmanian branch is rife with disunity and based on a flawed culture. He says:
... the election result was regrettably inevitable— the product in part of flawed processes which themselves were the product of a flawed culture.
The term `massive understatement' pops into my head in relation to that. Mr Lynton Crosby goes on to say:
The culture must change so that professionalism and competence are the motivating influences of the Division—not internecine battles which are self-serving and erode the Liberal Party's capacity to be the effective political machine that success demands.
`Somewhat axiomatic,' people in the chamber are probably thinking to themselves, but things are obviously so bad in the Tasmanian Liberal party that you have to get back to those sorts of basics. Anybody who lives in Tasmania or has any interest in Tasmanian politics knows that, at the heart of it, responsibility for this debacle lies with Senator Abetz—or `Comrade Abetz', as Senator Ray calls him. I would just like to go through some of the strategies that Senator Abetz put in place in terms of his vice-like grip on the Liberal Party in Tasmania, for which we are eternally grateful, and long may it continue.
First, Senator Abetz was responsible, as we understand it, for putting Bob Cheek into the leadership position and knocking off Sue Napier. Sue Napier was doing a reasonably good job, from our perspective—genuinely, she was doing quite a good job. I am not sure why—perhaps Senator Abetz did not like her, or Mr Bob Cheek was a good mate of his, or whatever—but she got the punt and in came Bob Cheek, and the rest, as they say, is history. Secondly, he was responsible, as I understand it, for knifing Greg Barns, who has subsequently joined the Democrats— maybe an action which he will regret more than joining the Liberal Party way back in the dim darks. Greg Barns made some public statements, which Senator Abetz did not like, in relation to the government's position on refugees. For that, it was made very clear, and there was a resolution of the state executive, that he would not be allowed to run in the forthcoming Tasmanian state election.
I have to say that is something we are also eternally grateful for, because, as far as we were concerned, Greg Barns was a real problem. Had he been allowed to run and had he got in in Denison—I do not know whether or not he would have—Greg Barns would have been a problem for the Labor Party. Again, we can thank Senator Abetz for his assistance, which he just keeps on giving, to the Labor Party in Tasmania. Thanks very much for knifing Greg Barns. We thought he was a problem but now Senator Abetz has fixed it for us. That is terrific.
Before I go to the next issue, I read in the Hobart Mercury that Greg Barns made an eleventh-hour appeal to Mr Bob Cheek, the erstwhile leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, and said, `Let's let bygones be bygones; how about letting me run?' Bob Cheek replied—and this is in the paper— `It's not up to me; you'll have to ask Eric.' This is the leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania saying that a prospective candidate had to check with Senator Abetz as to whether there was any capacity for him to run—somebody with a national profile, might I add. 
The other thing that Senator Abetz has overseen in his longstanding time as one of the leading lights, if not the leading light, of the Liberal Party in Tasmania is the increasing demise of the number of women in the Liberal Party in Tasmania. The other week I noticed that Liberal Party senators had put out a pamphlet to various electorates in Tasmania, with all their pictures at the bottom, running from left to right and in no particular order from what I could establish. When you looked at it, one thing became extremely obvious: there was not one woman. In fact, it was basically the same grey, boring old blokes. So there is not one woman in the federal Liberal Party in Tasmania.
Who knows, had the Liberal Party won any seats in Tasmania in the last couple of elections, maybe there would have been a woman but, to my recollection, there were no women candidates. Of course now, out of the paltry seven Liberal Party members in the Tasmanian state parliament, only one is a woman, and that is poor old Sue Napier, who was knifed by Senator Abetz. Clearly, the electorate have spoken pretty well about what they think happened there.
Senator Abetz and his colleagues—particularly Senator Barnett, who is a very good friend of Senator Abetz and thinks very similarly—are basically using the Tasmanian electorate as a bit of a playpen for their own petty ideological and totally out-of-step views. Let us look at the results of the last Tasmanian election: Jim Bacon was resoundingly elected. What was Jim Bacon's previous job? Jim Bacon was the secretary of the Tasmanian labour council. What was the previous job of the Deputy Premier, who also was resoundingly elected? He was also secretary of the Tasmanian labour council. Both of these people are long-time and proud union officials—and guess what? They were elected in spades in Tasmania, a state which in the past has not been noted for its progressive views, but that is fast changing under the tutelage of the Premier of Tasmania, ex-Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, Mr Jim Bacon.
The reality is that, as Senator Ray has indicated before, we are very happy with Senator Abetz remaining in a key position in the Liberal Party. I would be very keen to find out how many Liberal Party members there are in Tasmania. I understand it is an increasingly small number. The reality in politics—we are all in the game, so we understand it—is that it is a lot easier to control very few people. If you want to control a party, you do not encourage new members, you do not encourage talent, you stifle debate and then you have an increasingly small group that you can control. Clearly, this branch is all about control and being the playpen for few totally off-the-wall, extreme right-wing ideologues. I noticed that the Crosby report says:
It is essential that there be an overriding commitment to good outcomes for the Party, rather than an obsession with self-interest and internal processes.
So say all of us, and I would have thought that that would have been the bottom line in any political party. On Tuesday last week, we saw in Tasmania a clear example of the type of activity to which the Crosby report alludes, with the appearance of the newly elected Liberal representative for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, in the Devonport Magistrate's Court to answer charges relating to his distribution of an unauthorised how-to-vote card during the election campaign. For the edification of the Senate, I will take people quite slowly through this because it is important. Mr Whiteley was charged with distributing matter containing the names of candidates without the consent of the candidates—which, under the Tasmanian Electoral Act, is an offence—the other candidates being the other Liberals that he was running against in Braddon. I have here a copy of the how-to-vote card, which I will seek to table later. 
This is a clear breach of the Electoral Act in Tasmania and, accordingly, Mr Whiteley pleaded guilty. What else could he do, I suppose? Apparently, 3,000 of these illegal how-to-vote cards were distributed before their illegality was exposed four days before the poll date. In his interview with the police on 24 July, Mr Whiteley said he had planned for several months before the election to put out these illegal how-to-vote cards in an attempt to get his personal vote up. Those of us who have been in politics and in campaigning know that it takes a long time to organise a how-to-vote card; you do not just do it on the spur of the moment. Mr Whiteley, to his credit, fessed up, pleaded guilty and indicated that he had taken a long time in terms of the planning. So it was not a spur-of-the-moment thing as far as Mr Whiteley is concerned.
Mr Whiteley admitted to police that he knew that it was an offence under the Electoral Act to use other parties' candidates' names without their consent. So he was totally culpable from the outset; he knew and he still proceeded. In other words, this knowingly illegal act was part of his strategy to be elected as a Liberal representative for Braddon. This is really, as far as I can see, a clear demonstration of what Mr Crosby calls the self-interested and self-serving activities which are rife in the Tasmanian Liberal Party. Many people might expect that a premeditated breach of the Electoral Act would be grounds for expulsion, but oh no, not in the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He is not going to be expelled; he is going to stay there. He is the Liberal Party member for Braddon now.
I wish to indicate here in this chamber that speculation in Tasmania is rife that Senator Abetz assisted Mr Whiteley in the strategy concerning the how-to-vote cards. I personally find this very difficult to believe. I find it difficult to believe that the minister whose portfolio covers the Australian Electoral Commission and the management of the act would knowingly participate in what was clearly a breach of the Tasmanian act. I find it very difficult to believe; I am not sure whether or not it is true. But one of the things that this debate allows us to do is allow Senator Abetz to come into the chamber and advise on the following: did he or didn't he assist Mr Whiteley in this illegal activity; to what extent did he have discussions with Mr Whiteley; did he speak to Mr Whiteley; did he participate in the drawing up of the how-to-vote cards; and what advice did he provide Mr Whiteley and when? As I said, I find it difficult to believe that the minister for this area would have done this, because to do so would have been to participate knowingly in an illegal act. That is why I raise it here in this chamber: I want to give Senator Abetz the opportunity to come in here and clarify.
For a Labor Party person to hear about this, in terms of the internecine warfare that is going on in the Liberal Party, is not particularly usual. This is the subject of gossip all over—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Could you please rule on whether it is in order for a senator effectively to make an allegation of illegality against another senator and then challenge that senator to come in here and answer that allegation? The honourable senator opposite has quite clearly made an allegation against another senator, and I think we need a ruling on the standing orders as to whether or not that is within those orders.
—On the point of order: I really appreciate this opportunity to clarify. I am not saying that Senator Abetz was involved in any illegal activity—I am not saying that; I am saying that I have heard that. I am also saying that I find it very difficult to believe that he has. All I am suggesting is that he may wish to take this opportunity to clarify the situation. I am not accusing anybody of any illegal activity.
 (Senator Ferguson)—I think that has clarified the situation, Senator Campbell. If Senator Mackay has said that she is not accusing Senator Abetz of any illegality, I would rule that she is in order.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is common gossip in the north-west of Tasmania that this has occurred. I will reiterate that I find it difficult to believe. I do not think that anybody would be that silly, particularly not the minister. But I think that it is in the interests of Senator Abetz, of the political process which we all participate in and of the due processes of parliament— 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Could I ask you to take to the President the Hansard transcript of this. I think the problem we are facing here is that I could say that it is common gossip around the suburbs of Perth that Senator Mackay does very strange things illegally, that I do not believe that she does but that she should come in here and explain her private activities which are common gossip around the suburbs of Perth. It is tantamount to making an accusation. It is a gutless way of making an allegation—
—Order! You must withdraw that, Senator Campbell.
—It is a gutless way of making an allegation.
—Withdraw!
—Senator Campbell, I ask you to withdraw the term `gutless'.
—It is not a reflection on the senator, but I will withdraw it. If any senator comes in here and says that another senator is alleged, because it is common gossip in some part of Australia, to have done something illegal and that they therefore challenge that senator to come in here and say that it is not illegal, then—
—Senator Campbell, you are debating the issue.
—that is a gutless way to make an accusation. I would ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for a ruling on whether this is appropriate. I ask for the transcript of Senator Mackay's contribution here today to be referred to the President for a ruling and for him to report back.
—Senator Campbell, I have already ruled on the point of order, but I will get the transcript and I will refer it to the President to see whether any further action needs to be taken.
—I did not take up the Senate's time by speaking to that point of order, but this sort of stuff happens routinely, and one of the worst recidivists is Senator Abetz, who comes in here and makes allegations and has done so against me and a number of other senators. I am being extremely careful because I personally do not believe it to be true. However, I think the minister has to come in here and clarify that it is not true, because that this scuttlebutt is going around Tasmania reflects on all of us. I just want clarification. I am sure that if Senator Abetz were aware of it he would want to come in here and clarify it. So I have made the case in relation to that. As I said, I find it really difficult to believe but I would like to know the answer, as would many, I suspect. I am sure that it is not the case. 
The Crosby report contains what must be some sort of record—a total of 94 recommendations dealing with the Liberal Party in Tasmania, which shows that just about everything that could go wrong with a state political party is going wrong in Tasmania. Yet—and thank you very much to the other side for this—we still have Senator Abetz front and centre in the Liberal Party in Tasmania and for that we are eternally grateful. Long may he reign. It is no wonder that the federal Liberal Party has been driven to include what is colloquially known as the `dash for cash' in this bill. They need to keep bailing out people like Senator Abetz. But, according to Lynton Crosby's own report, the Tasmanian Liberal Party is in a dire financial state. It is so badly managed that it is barely capable of meeting its own administrative expenses.
We know about this in the Labor Party in Tasmania. We went through a very difficult exercise in 1992 after the intervention in Tasmania. We were faction riven, we had no money, we were down to 28 per cent of the vote and we went through a very painstaking reconstruction of the Tasmanian branch. One of the things that we did—and this is a bit of gratuitous advice for Senator Abetz—was ask the people who were the problem, in terms of creating this internecine warfare in the Labor Party, to step aside for a little while in order for the branch to reconstruct. Then we reconstructed, we had new rules, we essentially got our campaigning act together and we went from strength to strength to the point where we are today: we have five federal seats in Tasmania all being held by the Labor Party and we hold state government in spades. 
As another result of the Crosby report, Senator Abetz sent what could be described as an SOS to the Prime Minister that the branch needed a bit of assistance after what was a humiliating debacle. ABC Radio advised that Senator Abetz had been given an extra staff member to assist the Liberal Party in Tasmania. I do not know what other senators think about the act but my understanding of the act is that you cannot just get extra staff to help out for party political reasons; you cannot just send an SOS. He is the minister, so who would he go to? It is like Caesar judging Caesar. He has an extra staff member—and I have a great deal of time for this person, so this is not a personal thing— who just happens to be John Shaw, who used to work for Senator Brian Harradine. I feel a bit sorry for Mr Shaw, because he has been given the poison chalice, as it were.
I want the minister to come in here and indicate what the rules are in relation to staff, be they electorate or ministerial. Is it appropriate that, as a result of an internal Liberal Party report, Senator Abetz gives himself an extra staff person to do, absolutely and entirely, party work? Now that Senator Abetz is here, I would appreciate clarification in relation to that. Now that Senator Abetz is here there are two things I would like clarified. The first one we have been through in great detail: the allegation in relation to Brett Whiteley, which I find very difficult to believe. The second one is this: what were the circumstances and issues surrounding the additional staff person? We would all like to know that.
Time does not permit me to go through the Crosby report in great detail but be assured that I will be doing so in various speeches, because it is a hoot. Anybody who has ever been involved in campaigning at a basic level would find this quite an amusing document but I will be going through it at another time. I will leave you with one quick quote from Mr Crosby's report. It is headed `The Liberal Strategy', and the first sentence is:
There was no real Liberal campaign strategy.
That is just a taste of what we will attempt to put down over the next few weeks in relation to this report.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-26,"—A little bit of the story of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 has been lost, perhaps, since the debate began, but let me remind the Senate that this bill is about an attempt by the Howard government to centralise the receipt of public finding by the Liberal Party from the November 2001 election. The Finance and Public Administration Committee recommended, as you would expect, that the bill be proceeded with `expeditiously'. I must say that is a phrase I have not seen recently in committee reports about bills. Labor has been strongly opposed to the bill and produced quite a good minority report outlining why the bill should not be proceeded with.
But the import of the bill—and let me make this quite clear—is to override the Commonwealth Electoral Act in certain respects. The act provides that public funding is paid to the agent of the state or territory branch of the party for which the candidate stood. There is also a mechanism which allows the state branches to request the payment to be made to another party, and this amendment short-circuits this process. Rather than allow the state branches effectively to get together and talk about how to distribute the funding, we have a bill that says it should go to the national organisation, which should distribute the funds as it sees fit. This would allow the secretariat of the Liberal Party to control the disbursement of all the public funding due to the Liberal Party. That might be a good thing but I do not think it really comes into this debate.
Much has been said about a whole range of extraneous matter, which I will comment on because this is the central part of the debate. The interesting question is: where is the public policy that is embodied within this bill? I do not think there is any and I have not heard Senator Brandis, Senator Johnston or Senator Mason talk about what the public policy initiative is within this bill. They have talked about branch stacking and a range of other matters but not about the public policy implications of this bill: whether there is any public policy merit or whether we should have this amendment to the Electoral Act. 
I did take the opportunity to read Senator Brandis's contribution and I could not decide whether he was in support of the bill or whether he was speaking against the bill. I know that Senator Brandis has now contributed to the debate, so I will not ask him to clarify that. I will assume he spoke for the matter. Perhaps I have to take a longer bow to come to that conclusion. Some time ago, on 21 August 2001, this matter did arise in the press. The article is headed `Rebels stirring in Liberal ranks over funding'. It says:
Liberal Party backbenchers are rebelling over control of party funding, as legislation passed the House yesterday that directs funds to the party's central office instead of the states.
The article is by Kirsten Lawson. I can report only what is written here, so I am not sure of the veracity of the report, but it does say:
One Liberal backbencher described the funding chance as a “power grab by the Federal body” and said there was wide concern among Government MPs, who hoped the Democrats would join with Labor to defeat it in the Senate.
The article goes on to name three politicians. It says:
Three MPs—
I will fill in the blanks: Senator John Herron, Senator George Brandis and Senator Brett Mason; the article leaves out their title of `Senator' but otherwise that is a correct reading of it—
... spoke out in the Coalition party room and Hume Liberal Alby Schultz said later the party could have given more thought to how it dealt with the matter.
I assume they spoke out against it but I am happy to be corrected. I presume that they have now had a change of heart in the sense that they now support the bill.
—A lot of assumptions.
—Unfortunately, you are right. That is the difficulty I have and that is why I went to Senator Brandis's contribution to clarify that, to resolve the inconsistencies so that I would not have to presume. I know he has spoken once in the debate and he cannot speak again. There will be an opportunity, perhaps, in the committee stage that he may wish to take up and I certainly hope he does enter the debate in the committee stage. I was left with the difficulty that I have to assume that they are speaking for it and we are against it, although by that article one might be mistaken as to whom the Liberal Party backbenchers were and whether those members of the Senate were rebelling or what they were doing. Certainly, it will be of great interest to find out.
The difficulty I have is this: so much for the cooperative federalism that the Liberal Party has spoken about for so many years and so much for state rights. This bill takes away that; this bill denies cooperative federalism. It does not provide any policy prescription or reason why, which is a little bit disappointing. Many have called it a `dash for cash'; I am not going to call it a `dash for cash'. Scott Emerson, perhaps, said it a little better in an article in the Australian on 23 August 2002. He wrote:
Lynton Crosby is the Jerry Maguire of Australian politics. You could almost hear his plea of “Show me the money” as the Senate this week debated a bill that would result in the Liberal Party's federal director taking control of millions of dollars of public election funding, rather than allow it be paid directly to the party's state divisions.
Perhaps we could now call it the `show me the money' bill, because that is what it seems to be.
The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 is ostensibly a bill designed to amend aspects of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. These amendments will enable an agent of the Liberal Party's national secretariat to determine the distribution of public funding from their national secretariat to their state and territory branches. It is surprising that the state branches have agreed to this—or perhaps they have not and that is the reason for this bill. Perhaps they have not at all and they are constrained in being able to present themselves here to talk about it. Nevertheless, I find the Liberal Party's need to come before the federal parliament seeking to have it pass legislation intended to assist it in managing the Liberal Party's internal financial affairs an amazing display of arrogance and contempt of the parliamentary process. However, as we know, the situation is in fact far worse. 
The real purpose of this bill is to use the legislative power of the federal parliament to put an end to the internal power struggles and factional warfare within the Liberal Party itself. It has become clear to all that the Prime Minister and Mr Lynton Crosby, the supreme power brokers of the Liberal Party, have lost faith in their state and territory colleagues. In particular, Mr Howard and Mr Crosby have completely lost faith in their Queensland division—at least what is left of it. You have to admit that at least in this case the Prime Minister and Mr Crosby are probably correct in their assessment of their state colleagues. How anyone could have faith in such a faction ridden bunch of infighters is totally beyond me. However, this is a subject I will return to shortly.
Let us be totally clear about this: all this bill is intended to do is give the federal Liberal Party in the form of their national secretariat the power to pull their infighting and their faction riddled branches into line by gaining control of public electoral funding. The use of legislation like this to help the Liberal Party manage their internal financial affairs, let alone resolve factional disputes within the Liberal Party, is totally wrong. No other Australian federal government has attempted this unprecedented misuse but we have it here. It says volumes about the state of play of the Queensland Liberal Party. I heard Senator Mackay refer to the state of play of the Tasmanian Liberal Party and they appear to be in a similar state of disarray and faction ridden trouble. The action of the Liberal Party in this matter, from the Prime Minister down, has shown that they are still locked in their mentality of, `I've got control and I'm not letting it go.' The Liberals are having internal squabbles—if you do not want to call them factions, but it seems to me that they are internal factional fights.
In response to the crisis, rather than working it through, rather than talking these things through, we have a bill. Parliament is going to resolve your problems. The parliament of Australia is there to help you. This is why I do not think it should be used in this manner. Talk your way out of it. As I think Senator Ray suggested, grab a stamp and work out how you are going to split these matters up. It has been available for some time; you do not need this bill at all. 
In the first half of this year, from 1 January through to 30 June, the Senate sat a mere 21 days, or 197 hours and 40 minutes. This is in comparison with the same period last year when the Senate sat for a total of 32 days, or 260 hours and 30 minutes. If it were about policy we might be having a reasonable debate, but this is not about a policy debate at all. The Senate's time, as I just highlighted to you, was underemphasised in the last half of the year and there are good debates to be had on important policy issues for the next half, and yet we still have the political infighting of the Liberal Party before us. What we should be doing is going on to legislation that does have policy implications that we can have reasonable debates about.
But me talk about some of the issues that were raised by Senator Mason during his speech. Perhaps he did go on to talk about what was, in essence, the problems confronting both Senator Brandis and Senator Mason in the debate. Senator Mason said on 22 August during this debate, `This is the ultimate insiders' debate.' He did not go on to explain other than to say that the Liberals are actually interested in trade globalisation and industrial relations reform. But I think he let it slip by saying it is the ultimate insiders' debate. It is your insiders' debate; it is not ours. This is a debate about the internal affairs of the Liberal Party, not about public policy issues—it is not about issues such as trade globalisation, industrial relations reform, mutual obligation and welfare reform, as Senator Mason comments, which is a pity.
Curiously, he then went on in the same speech—and I think we really get to the nub of what he was referring to and what I have been arguing today—to say: 
Someone like Senator Ray or Senator Faulkner ... will never come in here and debate policy, because when they do they lose.
In a policy-free debate this is raised by Senator Mason. It is quite extraordinary. He is talking about a policy-free zone in relation to a bill that does not have any policy. I think Senator Mason should wake up. Then he goes on to say:
It has become increasingly apparent, so they come in here and talk about the internal structures of the Liberal Party. 
That is what the bill is about. If Senator Mason would just slow down and perhaps read his own speech, he might work out that what he is talking about, in fact, is that. But it did not talk about what the bill was about at all. It did not have any public policy implications and it did not go on—
—What it did was expose the hypocrisy in the Labor Party.
—to talk about the hypocrisy in the Liberal Party at all, especially the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. In fact in my own state of Queensland we have seen the Liberal Party take massive losses in the Brisbane City Council elections: no policy—and in the state elections: no policy. Following these losses, we in Queensland have seen the remaining survivors of the Liberal Party turn on each other, just like you are doing now, like a pack of jackals fighting over a carcass. Indeed, this battle is for the carcasses of the Queensland Liberal Party. We have see Mr Caltabiano and Mr Quinn—both factions as I can understand them—engage in some of the most spectacular branch stacking, it seems, ever seen in the state of Queensland. 
If the Australian report about a fortnight ago is to be believed, then the Queensland Liberal Party executive considered some 800 new applications for membership, 500 from the Caltabiano faction—from what I understand the Australian to say—and 300 from the faction of the poor embattled leader of the state Liberal Party, Mr Quinn, who is, as I understand it, trying to reform the party in Queensland to ensure that there are no branch stackers and they have reasonable rules. I watch with interest as to who wins that battle. Perhaps Senator Mason or Senator Brandis can tell us who eventually wins and what the cost was in terms of power within the Queensland Liberal Party. 
Perhaps it is endemic to the Liberal Party. Their born to rule mentality has got them in a bit of the bind in Queensland. But indeed it also appears to be the attitude of their federal director, Mr Crosby, who said recently:
One man's branch stack is another man's membership drive.
Perhaps not surprisingly, this sad view of branch stacking was supported by the good Senator Brandis, as I understand it—but I am happy to be corrected. In his contribution to this debate last week when he concurred with the federal boss, he went on to state:
In the Liberal Party our doors are open to all, and that is why we have become a great mass based political party of Australian politics—
Yes, Senator Brandis, your doors are open to anybody even if they are not on the Australian electoral roll. Indeed, the Australian Liberal Party is so inclusive you do not even need to live in Australia. Apparently they will ship them from anywhere. 
Yes, Mr Howard and Mr Crosby are quite correct in their assessment that the Queensland Liberals are not to be trusted, as I understood what they were saying, as an operational branch. That can be the only import of the bill. It can only mean that they do not want you to have independent financial control of your branch. They do not want you to be able to determine your electoral successes or your electoral non-successes, as the case may be. The federal body of the Liberal Party want you to be subservient to their wishes. They do not want to negotiate with you as to how equitably the funds should be distributed. They simply want to control the manner in which the funds are distributed. They want to use the Commonwealth Electoral Act for that purpose, which is indeed disappointing.
Another article in the Brisbane Courier Mail on 17 July this year likened the web of conspiracy, threats and melodrama that currently exists within the Queensland Liberal Party to an episode of the X Files. This article went on to state: 
Most of the Liberal Party senior members have adopted that show's celebrity credo `Trust no-one'.
This is the environment the Queensland Liberal Party members exist in. I think the Queensland State Liberal Party is a shell of its former self slowly being destroyed by faction leaders interested in their own self-aggrandisement rather than their party's electoral credibility, an electoral credibility that has reached all but rock bottom with Queensland voters. The ultimate test is to ask: has the electorate endorsed the approach the Queensland Liberal Party has taken over the last three to six years? The answer is no; it clearly has not done so.
—How did you go at the federal elections?
—It has not done so because the Liberal Party's national secretariat—at the behest of Mr Howard and Mr Crosby—wished to take control of the distribution of public electoral funding. You will have to interject better than that to jag my attention! Why is it that they wish to settle their internal power struggles and factional warfare within the Liberal Party itself? This is the reason we are here debating this issue. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-08-26,"—The purpose of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 is to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The primary purpose is to allow the Liberal Party federal secretariat to determine the distribution of election funding between the federal secretariat and the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party. There is a very simple answer to what this bill is all about and that appears to be, in brief, the answer. 
Currently, a decision is being made by the Australian Electoral Commission based on the agreement between the state branches and the federal secretariat. If an agreement is absent, election funding would go to the state branches. It is essential to note that most of the funding would go to those state branches whose candidates achieved the best polling during the election. The Labor Party feel that the bill is unnecessary. The problems that the Liberal Party are having with their distribution of funds should have been, and could have been, resolved within the party if they had sat down together and worked out exactly how this should work. They could even call upon the ALP national secretariat for advice in relation to this, because we have no difficulty with the arrangements as they are. The government are really hiding behind their own mismanagement. And in hiding behind that mismanagement, they have introduced a bill into this chamber that should not have been introduced. It is apparent the government do not trust their state parties, and when there is no trust between the federal and state parties then you are doomed to failure.
Another rationale could be that the amendments serve to relieve the Liberal Party of an unnecessary administrative burden associated with the goods and services tax. There has been speculation about the Liberal Party and the Queensland branch in relation to that. The federal secretariat, for the purposes of managing a federal election campaign, is a taxable supply under the new tax system—that is, the goods and services tax system. While the arrangement is financially neutral from the perspective of the state division and the federal secretariat— because the state division is entitled to reclaim the GST payment in the form of imputed tax credits—it does impose a modest compliance burden on both parties. It is true that they have become unmanageable, uncontrollable and are causing difficulties within their own party. Due to the Prime Minister's lack of leadership, we are now witnessing this bill in order to avoid nasty confrontation with some of their state and divisional directors by simply getting parliament to legislate to solve the problem. That is simply what they are doing: asking this place to fix their internal squabbles. That shows that, whilst they may be in government, the reality is they cannot govern themselves. 
Some might recall the contribution of Senator Mason last week. Quite frankly, I thought that the evangelicals had descended upon the parliament and Jimmy Swaggart was reincarnated within the chamber! He played well to the crowd but he forgot to mention the bill, and he forgot to mention the real issue of why we are here debating this bill—the internal problems of his own party. It was a grand display that said nothing. He was holding up his parliamentary handbook as if it were the Holy Bible. He was going to tell us all about senators on this side, but he did not quite get to that part. But it looked good for the gallery. He was going to tell us what union backgrounds we all had. The fact is that we are all quite proud of our union backgrounds and we have no difficulty coming to this place— 
—We are all thankful for it, too.
—It has not done you very much good at all, has it? You are hiding behind legislation—
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Buckland, you should address your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, I will do that. I was just saying to Senator Abetz that, if they were a good government, they would be sorting out their internal problems themselves instead of asking this chamber and this parliament to resolve their internal problems.
The bill specifically addresses the Liberal Party's internal problems. That is what it is really all about; you cannot get away from that singular fact. It is about the problems and what is required by the Liberal Party to resolve the bickering over the disbursement of public funding within the party. That is what it is all about: who is going to get the most out of the public funding during election campaigns? With the party in government, one has to laugh and think, `If this is the best they can do, how are they governing this country properly?'
The bill really has nothing at all to do with anyone else. It is an absolute disgrace that we are being asked to resolve the Liberal Party's problems and it is an absolute disgrace that the Liberal Party was so barefaced in coming to the parliament to resolve them. I suppose we can understand that the government's desperation is such that it is now trying to force through and pass this bill. It is a futile exercise because the people can see through it. The Liberal Party is no longer in government in any of the states or territories because it cannot run its own party machine in such a way that it can translate into governments elsewhere. Being the party in federal government is always a wonderful stepping stone if one is looking to state governments, but of course it did not work on any occasion for this Liberal Party government. All the states are in the competent and good hands of the Labor Party.
In South Australia alone, the federal government would have great concerns about the frittering away of money on internal fights and internal preselections among its state branch. It is probably somewhat concerned about the money being frittered away on current court actions over the South Australian Speaker. It is a futile exercise.
—It was a grubby deal.
—It was a good deal—
—No, `grubby deal' was what I said.
—There is no grubby deal with the Labor Party associated with that, but there seem to have been some grubby deals, or so much effort and so much money would not have been spent on that exercise. It is an indication that the state and federal parties just cannot agree about what is going on. I would be highly surprised if the Prime Minister or indeed the national secretariat were supportive of such actions. In fact, my understanding is that they are not. I am happy to be corrected on that.
In 1993, the Liberal Party had one of the biggest election victories, winning 37 seats in South Australia. In 1997, the Liberal Party won 23 seats. In 2002, when they lost government, they held only 20 seats. No wonder the federal Liberal Party does not trust the state branches when, over a span of nine years, the Liberal Party lost 17 seats in South Australia alone. It is understandable. Some of us have been through similar internal fights in organisations— 
—Senator Abetz, don't suggest that I have not, when I can assure you that I have.
—You shocked me, that is all. I did not think that you had done that.
—Thank you very much for bestowing charm on me.
—Order! I think we should return to the bill.
—However, that does happen. It is a shame when one thinks that by taking your tie off and waving your handkerchief at people you can win an election when hard policy comes down. It was the hard policy that the Labor Party put forward that brought the state Labor government into South Australia earlier this year. For a party that used to do as much as possible to protect the states from the big, bad feds, it is certainly an about-face for the Liberal Party. They always said that they looked after the states. Now they are saying, `We don't trust the states. We don't trust our own organisational structure within the states and we don't trust the states.' The Labor Party will not support this bill. It is an absolute waste of the parliament's time and it is a waste of resources being here to debate the bill.
What the Prime Minister and Lynton Crosby want to achieve can be done by simple agreement. As I said earlier, it might pay for you to call upon the Labor Party National Secretariat to come and give you some advice as to how to run and organise your state and federal branches. I am sure that we would be happy to do that. The offer is made quite openly and I am sure it will stand. I notice that the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 makes no reference whatsoever to the Labor Party. I guess that is really why we are saying that the bill has no merit. It is one-sided and has no reflection upon the total. It has reflection on a part of the parliament—a reflection on the Liberal Party only. Whilst it is fine that you have not mentioned us—you realise that we do not have internal problems—it is also a reflection on the Liberal Party that it is prepared to have itself exposed through the parliamentary process for its inability to manage its own affairs.
The Parliamentary Library has produced a wonderful Bills Digest on this particular bill. It really goes to the very heart of what the bill is all about. We have an internal fight of massive proportions going on within the Liberal Party between its states and its national body and, simply, they cannot determine who should get the biggest bite of the pie. In fact if the national secretariat had its way, the states would not get to see the pie or taste the pie and they would certainly get no benefit from it. It is a traditional Liberal Party states versus federal argument.
Madam Acting Deputy President, this is the first time I have been under your good grace since your elevation to that position. In concluding, let me say that, if the Liberal Party were fair dinkum, they would avoid bringing legislation of this nature to the chamber. It has wasted our time—this is the second day it has been debated. It is a clear indication that they have no ability to control their own destiny and certainly it is a matter that has wasted public money and is—
—They will waste a lot more.
—Thank you for that, Senator Carr. It is a waste of a lot more than that as well, but it also shows the lack of depth within the Liberal Party to resolve internal disputes. We will not support this bill and, as I said before, it is a waste of time and a waste of resources.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to make a contribution to the second reading debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. This bill provides that the Liberal Party's national office, the Federal Secretariat, may write to the Australian Electoral Commission before polling day specifying the federal percentage of public funding— that is, the amount that will go to the Liberal Party's Federal Secretariat—and the state percentage—that is, the amount that will be paid to the state or territory division of the party. If there is no such written notice, the Federal Secretariat will receive all of the public funding. The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 declares that its purpose is to, as stated: 
Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes.
This bill of course takes a most broad and liberal construction of the two words `other purposes'. It is an amendment to the act that is an attempt to use the parliamentary processes to settle internal factional disagreements in the Liberal Party.
We all know that in every political party there are differing groups, people with different philosophical outlooks and different ideological perspectives. We saw that manifest in a debate in this chamber last Wednesday or Thursday, when Senator Stott Despoja made the point that she had been receiving an inadequate amount of support from her own colleagues within her parliamentary party and through the party room. As a consequence of that, she was forced to make certain decisions affecting her own future and the future of her party. Similarly, within the Australian Labor Party it is no secret that there are people with wide-ranging perspectives on a range of issues that face us on a day-to-day basis. And, similarly, it would be unrealistic to suggest that the same does not apply in the two parties that comprise government—the Liberal Party and the National Party.
But I suppose the matter that distinguishes the opposition and the minor parties in this place from the government parties is that the opposition in particular—I am more familiar with its rules—has rules that determine how state branches are established, how they are set up and run, what the financing is, how funds are to be received and how funds are to be distributed. That is essentially resolved at a national level by a national executive that is elected by and from delegates in all of the states.
It has long been the practice that funding received by our party at a national level goes to the national organisation and is distributed to the various branches consistent with the national purpose. That is why you have national structures, national organisations, receiving funding via the national parliament for national purposes. The Liberal Party in opposition could have gone down that path many years ago when the issue of public funding of political parties was squarely put on the agenda and the various parties consulted amongst themselves and with each other as to the appropriate way that political parties across Australia were going to receive public funding from the Commonwealth. The Australian Labor Party, in its wisdom, made a particular decision at the time. It has never sought to revoke or revise it and, as I understand it, is quite happy for the decision made some years ago to be applied now and into the future.
The Liberal Party made a similar decision. We are advised that they consulted with their state branches, their state divisions, and made a particular decision that the funding was to go to the organisation at a state level and that the state organisations or state divisions would expend those funds, presumably consistent with their rules, on purposes decided at a state level. Presumably, there was also acknowledgment that there would be the appropriate degree of contact between the state divisions. Now, as we look around Australia at each of the state divisions of the Liberal Party—each in opposition, each the subject of major losses in the last two or three years, each the subject of change, each the subject of leadership challenge and each trying to decide where they fit into the political cycle—we observe that the agreement freely entered into within that party, for reasons that have not been made clear and are not fully detailed in the explanatory memorandum, is no longer adequate, and this bill is before us because there is a view that the funding direction should be altered.
As I outlined in my opening remarks, the change that is sought is for the Liberal Party's national office or federal secretariat to write to the Australian Electoral Commission prior to a scheduled federal election and advise where the funding is to be directed, what percentage—somewhere between zero and 100 per cent—is to be directed to the federal party and what outstanding amount is to be directed to the various state or territory divisions of the party. Where there is no such written notice, the federal secretariat will receive all of the public funding. So the central purpose and clear direction of the bill is that all Commonwealth funding that is going to be directed to the Liberal Party is to be directed to the national office of that organisation, subject to that organisation advising the Australian Electoral Commission in writing what percentages might be directed elsewhere to the various state divisions. That means that the bill addresses the issue of `other purposes' in the 1918 act, and this amendment to the act is a clear attempt to use parliamentary processes to settle internal differences within the Liberal Party. The national office of the party wants control of the money that the state branches need because that gives it power over the branches; that is, he who pays the piper calls the tune. In this case the clear intention is for the national office of the Liberal Party to intervene, set up directions, set up staffing and set controls so that the various state divisions or state branches act consistently with the directions of the national office. That purpose is to be achieved via the mechanism that if they do not comply they do not receive funding, and that is what this bill is about. 
For obvious reasons the various state divisions of the Liberal Party do not want this change to occur. If they did want it to occur, it would presumably be a relatively simple process to organise a properly convened meeting for the state divisions to come together to consider a resolution, and the resolution would in outcome be similar to or identical to the outcome that will be contained in this bill if it is passed by a majority in this place. But it is clear that that normal process of negotiation has been entered into and, as is sometimes the case in negotiations, the result has been unsatisfactory as far as the proponents of change are concerned: they have been unable to persuade a majority of their colleagues on their own national governing body or all or some of the various divisions to agree to change.
Yet eight years ago when the present system of funding was introduced, the Liberal Party argued for this dual system dividing funding between state and federal branches of the party. At that time they argued that it was inconsistent with their ideological belief in state rights, so the Labor Party agreed to amendments to the bill—the government of the day agreed to accept the amendments sought by the then opposition, the Liberal Party—and the bill was amended to let the then opposition party be funded in the way that they thought to be appropriate. So the questions thus arise: what warrants such serious intervention by our federal parliament? Why can't the Liberal Party sort this out internally? That is what they should do.
We heard last week that the Australian Democrats apparently have differences in philosophy and approaches as to where their party should go. Whilst that debate has been conducted in a relatively public fashion, it is clear that, as is appropriate, they are seeking to resolve their differences internally. They do not resort to ask the parliament, the government or the opposition for advice or seek to have previous acts of parliament amended to suit the desires of a particular group or clique. Similarly, within the Labor Party, my party, it is clear that we are undergoing a serious internal discussion as to what are the appropriate structures that should guide our party into the future. Serious discussion is occurring about the level of union involvement, how delegates should be elected from the various branches, how delegates should be elected from the lay component and a range of subsidiary issues deriving from those key or core principles. But at no time have we ever asserted that it is anything other than a matter of our business that we bring our various state divisions together, put the issues on the table and attempt to resolve them by negotiation or discussion, and in the event of that failing we resolve it by the usual process of a vote.
We do not think it is any business of the government as to how we conduct our affairs. We do not think it is any business of any other party how we conduct our affairs. We do not think it is any business of the government how we allocate funding that is received via the Commonwealth Electoral Act, as long as that funding is spent properly, consistent with the rules of the party and consistent with the law of the land. Having received the funding consistent with an act of parliament, we expend it, consistent with our own rules, and that is the end of the matter. We do not seek the assistance of any other political party as to how we establish our structures or how we spend our funds, and we do not seek to go back on past understandings, past commitments or, more importantly in the context of this debate, to overturn decisions and agreements reached via various internal processes of our party. Yet, on the other side of this chamber, this issue was squarely faced eight years ago when the government was in opposition. They consulted with their various divisions, their various state branches, and they came to us with a proposition that reflected, at that time, the will of their party. How do we know that? Firstly, they advised it; secondly, it was reported in the press; and, thirdly, they referred us to the various resolutions passed by the state divisions authorising their national officers to conduct themselves in negotiations in a particular way. 
Compare that with the current situation where, similarly, internal discussions and internal negotiations have been conducted in the Liberal Party. There has been no agreement to shift, to change, to alter, to move and so the national office simply walks around to the Prime Minister's office and says, `This is unfair. We've got six or seven divisions around Australia. They've considered a proposition. All of them have rejected the suggestion of change, but we still want to go down this path and we want to have a bill introduced into the parliament which would change the status quo.' That is what they are doing here now. They are attempting to change the status quo inconsistent with, and contrary to, the express desires and wishes of their party, but, more importantly, inconsistent with, and contrary to, the express policy decisions of their own divisions and express resolutions passed by their own party.
When you engage in that sort of activity— where you simply come in the back door, take the $25 million or $35 million a year that is available via public funding, allocate it to national office and allow only national office to choose how to spend it, and for national office to privately and secretly decide what conditions or what amendments will be attached to the distribution of those funds— you get to the stage where you have a total perversion of the ideas of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Repeatedly over the last five years, the opposition have been told in discussions over various pieces of legislation that one of the core attributes of the Howard government is responsibility in the raising and disbursement of public funds, accountability to the various agencies of the Commonwealth for the distribution of those funds, and, more importantly, accountability and responsibility to taxpayers—either personal or corporate entities—who provide those funds to the Commonwealth. Yet, in this debate—when it is a matter that affects their own party, and future funding and how those funds will be allocated—they go back on all those core principles. They reject every proposition they have put in financial bills and budget bills over the last five or six years and they say, `The national office, in its wisdom, on its own, makes a decision that that body will receive the $25 million or $35 million.'
What is the alternative? The alternative, of course, is to sit down and engage in negotiations with the various state divisions and identify the various problems that might exist in the various parties around Australia— whether they are policy problems, whether they are branch-stacking problems, whether there is a lack of leadership at the various levels, whether there is too much alternate leadership at the various levels in the various states, whether it is about the drifting or whether it is about the break-up of their vote to a range of other political parties on both the left and the right. You could go through a serious sit-down in each state and do a serious analysis of what the problems are in a particular division of the Liberal Party, do a serious needs analysis as to what funding is required, and come up with a set of solutions that could be worked through that party and which might receive membership support and membership endorsement, and which might result in significant structural and procedural change being implemented in the various state divisions of the Liberal Party.
The effect, of course, of going through that policy and organisational review process, is that you modernise your party—you bring it up to date; you get rid of the old, you get rid of the stuff that has been rejected, you get rid of the stuff that is no longer acceptable, you get rid of the people who are no longer performing and you get your finances in order. What happens when you do that? At the next election in the various states, two, three or four years hence, candidates in the various divisions of the Liberal Party will most likely be serious candidates for election in the various states and territories. At the moment, they are not. They simply say, `We don't really have any problems, although we've lost eight of the last nine elections. We don't have problems in Western Australia or in South Australia'—where they really did give away the election in both cases. Those elections were there to be won and should not have been given away. They were given away simply because the proper processes of organisational review, preselection, financing and fundraising had not been gone through in a consistent, logical and principled fashion. 
That is one way you could identify the problems in your own party in the various states: you could go through that open, accountable, transparent policy review. Put your ideology and your philosophies on the table, engage in the discussion and the argy-bargy around what are promises, what are commitments and where the electorate wants its government to lead it. Then, having established the rules, there is no doubt that the funding from the private sector, from the business community and, indeed, from the Commonwealth would flow, because you would have a viable organisation, a viable opposition, that is presenting sound alternative paths upon which the community might, in those circumstances, be ready to adopt, adapt to and follow.
But, no, in this situation the Liberal Party do not do that. They say, `All those things are fine. We do not have any serious need of review. The map has changed from blue to red in every state and territory over the last four or five years, but we are going to continue with the old way. We are going to continue with the structures that were established many years ago. We are going to allow the branch stacking to occur. We are going to allow—and, indeed, encourage— the branch stacking in particular states to go out of all proportion. We are going to allow membership numbers in various divisions to increase from a normal, run-of-the-mill 25 or 35 persons who attend, participate and are elected to office.' All of a sudden, overnight, those numbers increased to 300 or 450.
We only have to look at the various press reports of what has occurred in Queensland in recent times where, when you have a small rump of people controlling the party, federal preselections are on order, state preselections are coming on stream, and the membership numbers are so minor that you can do an afternoon doorknock in a few of the better-off suburbs in Brisbane and increase your membership numbers from 25 in particular division to 100. Of course, they do not have to live in the division; they do not even have to live in the state—or in the country, as was witnessed in South Australia. All those new members get to vote in preselection procedures, and you can change a particular candidate simply because you go through that rorter process. The net result of that—not to take Brisbane or Queensland in isolation—is that, after many years, you do not become an opposition and you do not become a party; you are not registered as such.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to add my comments on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. In doing so, I say that we should get from this government a charter of bill honesty, because I think our Senate leader had it right when he said this bill should be renamed the `Liberal Party central office dash for cash bill'—because that, of course, is what it is. What a contrast there is before the people of Australia at the moment as both parties attempt to look at their internal structures and to modernise. What a contrast it is to see Labor engaging with its rank and file, very soon to discuss at a national conference very important rule changes designed to make us a party of the future. What a contrast it is to see that the Liberal Party approach to obviously much needed reform is to try to move this bill through this parliament—this dash for cash bill which looks at filling up the coffers of their federal office: `Don't bother talking to the state branches; don't bother talking to the rank and file. Let's just try to use our parliamentary mechanisms and our clout as government to push a piece of legislation through to get the type of reform the Liberal Party want.' 
I say that is unacceptable. It is unacceptable on two counts. It is a complete flouting of our democratic institutions, particularly this parliament, and I think that the Liberal abuse of institutions of this country through their period of government has been well documented. The way this government has gone about its affairs in office has been to much embarrassment of many Australians who take such pride in our democratic institutions. I think the second important point is how political parties conduct themselves. We are in an era when issues of corporate governance and morality in management are at the forefront of everybody's minds. How ironic is it that we find ourselves arguing about such issues before the parliament today as the Liberal Party sound off about the need for higher quality corporate governance in the private sector when they are using the parliamentary processes and this particular bill to sort out their own little issues of corporate governance.
I would like to take this opportunity to inform the chamber of the next chapter in what can only be described as a soap opera, although I hesitate to do that because it is about the integrity of our democracy. On the AAP wire today, at 12.22 p.m., was an article headed `Qld: Liberal leader makes second bid to win reform war'. The article states:
BRISBANE, August 26, AAP: Queensland Liberal leader Bob Quinn is stepping up his campaign to clean up branch-stacking with a second mailout to party members.
The move was met with concern today by state Liberals president Michael Caltabiano.
Mr Quinn has already produced a glossy, full-colour leaflet targeted at getting his reforms— which were rejected by party officials—approved at the party's state convention next month.
But a second mailout will further push his case for reforms on which he has staked his leadership.
Mr Quinn believes that for a party member to vote in a preselection they should be on the electoral roll for that electorate, be a member for at least 12 months and be a member of the local branch for at least six months.
The state executive's power at preselections should also be reduced and senators should be chosen by a wider number of members from throughout the state, he said.
Cr Caltabiano—a factional opponent to Mr Quinn—
it is lovely having your dirty washing all over the news, isn't it?—
told AAP today he was unaware of Mr Quinn's plans for a second mailout.
“The role of the parliamentary leader is to lead the division and take the fight up to Labor,” Cr Caltabiano said.
“There seems to be an extraordinary amount of effort that is not going into taking the fight up to Labor.”
You could not put it to your colleagues any more bluntly than that, could you? The article continues:
The party's state executive has received almost 1,000 membership applications ahead of its annual convention in Brisbane next month, with officials and MPs being accused of endorsing rampant branch stacking.
A raft of constitutional reforms, which Mr Quinn says do not go far enough, will be debated at the Liberals convention to be held in Brisbane from September 6 to 8.
It goes on:
The convention will also consider a new platform for the Queensland division and the reintroduction of an Upper House which was abolished in 1922.
Cr Caltabiano said the platform would set out a “fundamental system of beliefs” for the party.
They certainly need it! Once again, we see this drama continuing. We see the Liberal Party using this chamber inappropriately to resolve their own internal affairs, their own internal rorting, branch stacking, and who gets their hands on the money. It should be called the `Dash for cash bill'. What about a charter of bill honesty; what about calling this piece of legislation what it is? I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-08-26,"—In answer to a question from Senator Brown on 22 August this year, I undertook to provide further information, if it was available, in relation to a question concerning the Australian Protective Service's role on Manus Island. I have that now, and I seek leave to incorporate that information in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Further to my response to Senator Brown on 22 August 2002, I provide the following information:
The Australian Protective Service (APS) contingent on Manus Island does not have access to tear gas or OC spray. The contingent has been equipped with civil disorder equipment, including riot shields, helmets and batons. All of this equipment is secured and may only be drawn for service based on operational requirements and at the direction of the APS Contingent Leader.
APS officers working at Offshore Processing Centres at Nauru and Manus Island are appointed as Reserve or Special Constables under agreements with the Nauru and Papua New Guinea (PNG) Governments. The agreements were facilitated at the request of DFAT, DIMIA and PM&C. Accordingly, there are arrangements in place for the conferral of each contingent to be sworn as Reserve or Special Constables. The conferral of Reserve or Special Constable status was to enable APS Officers to legally perform protective security functions at Offshore Processing Centres. 
The current deployment of APS officers are in the process of having their conferral papers signed to facilitate their status as Reserve or Special Constables. Due to operational requirements, deployments to Nauru and Manus Island are for limited periods only. Whilst there is no formal MOU between the APS and the Nauru and PNG Police Forces in respect to this matter, all officers sworn as Reserve or Special Constables are advised of their powers in writing by the respective police agencies.
The APS are responsible for responding to incidents within the Offshore Processing Centre at Manus Island, which requires working in close co-operation with the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF). The PNGDF response to any incident is under the authority of the PNGDF Base Commander.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: Border Protection</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sherry and Conroy today relating to superannuation and taxation.
What the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer's responses highlight is the double standard approach by the Liberal government. On the one hand, there are the problems of the family tax benefit overpayments which are being deducted without the authority and, in many cases, without the knowledge of many Australians from their tax refund. On the other hand, there is their soft attitude towards the top end of town. 
The issue that I raised today concerns the matter of Commercial Nominees, which is a superannuation savings vehicle. Theft and fraud in the superannuation industry is not significant but in the case of Commercial Nominees, where this has occurred, some $25 million from the retirement superannuation savings of hundreds of individuals, both pre and post-retirement, who are members of Commercial Nominees, was stolen. We know that is a fact because the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act provides for compensation to be paid where theft and fraud occurs in respect to superannuation.
We know that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, did receive advice from a senior legal counsel through the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—commonly known as APRA—which concluded that fraudulent conduct did occur by a number of individuals who were managing, in this case, some $25 million of hundreds of Australians' retirement income savings. We know that fraudulent conduct has occurred. Legal advice went to the minister via APRA and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, has accepted that legal advice, correctly. We do not criticise her for accepting the legal advice that fraudulent conduct has occurred. The minister then went on to award compensation.
In the Labor Party's view, in these sorts of cases where we are dealing with compulsory retirement income savings—superannuation—we believe that full compensation should occur. It has not occurred in this particular case. That is an important issue but it is a side issue to the central issue of this minister and the Liberal government in particular being soft when it comes to the top end of town in these sorts of fraudulent cases. We know that fraud has been found in this case: the legal advice is that fraud has occurred in respect of the superannuation system. So if fraud has been found, why, 18 months after the removal of the trustees from this superannuation fund, have no charges been laid against anyone? We have received evidence on a number of individuals who have been involved in this fraudulent conduct. One of these individuals is apparently somewhere in Nicaragua in Central America, and no effort has been made to get this individual back to Australia to have him charged, to try to hold him accountable for the $25 million that has been fraudulently stolen from Commercial Nominees, being the superannuation savings of hundreds of Australians.
It is all very well for this individual to be in Nicaragua, living it up in exotic locations in Central America, but this government has done nothing about getting him back to Australia. This government has done nothing about laying charges against this individual. This government has done nothing about laying charges against the other individuals who were involved in the Commercial Nominees superannuation fraud, yet the government has accepted that fraud has occurred: it has acted to award compensation. As for the perpetrators of the fraud involving some $25 million in retirement savings, nothing has happened to those who have stolen the retirement savings of some hundreds of Australians in this case and caused an immeasurable amount of suffering while this individual suns himself in various locations in Nicaragua. It is about time the government did something about it and got him back here and laid some charges.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2002-08-26,"—Congratulations, Mr Deputy President, on your appointment. Senator Sherry is not 100 per cent correct on three important issues on which he is challenging the government. Firstly, he refers to CNA as the top end of town. 
—No, the executives who run it.
—Well, even the executives who run it, Senator Sherry—
—Not the investors but the executives.
—You are even starting to qualify what you have already said. They were hardly the leaders of the top 100 companies in Australia; they were second, third or fourth string. 
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. He is grossly misleading the chamber. I did not refer to the investors at the top end of town; I referred to the perpetrator who has stolen the money and whom this government will not bring back from Nicaragua.
—Resume your seat. There is no point of order, Senator Sherry.
—I am not referring to CNA as one of the top investment performers or investment houses in Australia, as he tried to imply; it was third, fourth or fifth rung at the very best. The people who were ravaging it were certainly not the directors or trustees of the top end of town; they were certainly well down the list. So on that reference he fails. The second issue is that there have already been two references to the DPP, including that of the director who went off some years ago with some money to America and then on to Nicaragua, so the truth is that there have already been two references to the DPP who are already looking into it— error No. 2. As for error No. 3, the problem was that while there was some theft or fraud perpetrated quite a number of years ago— and I could go right back to about 1997—in relation to the total loss, the theft or fraud was relatively minuscule. I hope that Senator Sherry's outburst is not going to lead certain people to challenge the levy, when it is ultimately provided, on all super funds across the country.
Let us get some background to what happened to Commercial Nominees. Until recently it was the trustee of approximately 475 small APRA funds, a master trust known as Confidens Investment Trust and two trusts known as Enhanced Equity Fund and Enhanced Cash Management Trust, often referred to as ECMT. There were also a number of corporate and public offer superannuation funds, including the Australian Workforce Eligible Rollover Fund, the Network Super Fund and the Midas Super Fund, the total assets of which were around $300 million. CNA was an APRA-approved trustee. The size of the losses caused by the collapse of CNA is estimated, however, to be about $25 million and the collapse has affected close to 25,000 investors. Most of those were in the 475 small APRA funds. The losses have caused major emotional and financial difficulties for a large number of people, many of whom placed their lifetime savings with CNA, expecting reasonable returns on their investment for their retirement. Unfortunately, some investors have been left feeling confused, helpless, angry and frustrated and they have lost a lot of confidence in APRA, to which they have naturally assigned the blame. I would like to take this opportunity to say that, since coming to office, Senator Coonan has moved very quickly and through her action a lot of people are receiving compensation.
During the committee inquiry a number of issues were raised which highlighted the performance of CNA as a trustee and the role of the regulators, including the adequacy of the regulatory framework, as well as the auditing of superannuation funds. As part of the investment strategy—and this is really where CNA went wrong—the majority of the funds should have been invested in cash. Unfortunately, they were invested in things such as strawberry farms and other undertakings; they were not invested in the likes of BT, the banks, Merrill Lynch et cetera. The other problem was that a lot of these investments were not made at arm's length. All this was not theft or fraud, which was bad and contrary to APRA's rules and all that sort of thing. In response to the committee's questions on this issue, APRA advised the committee that within the superannuation industry it is common for trustees of superannuation funds also to be trustees of other entities in which superannuation moneys are invested. This is probably where some of the weak links which needed to be tied up were. For example, Mr Phil Dally, the General Manager of Saxby Bridge Financial Planning, said that `it would appear that CNA used superannuation money to prop up investments made previously'. So the losses incurred now are not necessarily directly due to the losses by theft or fraud which occurred quite some years ago.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I intend to speak to the second part of the motion to take note of answers referred to by Senator Sherry. `Mean and tricky': they are the words that the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Shane Stone, used to describe Mr Howard—at least he did so in a letter published in the Bulletin magazine last year. Those words, `mean and tricky', ought to be remembered because, when we are dealing with a matter that Senator Vanstone was talking about today, that is the best description of what the government has done. It has to be recalled that Senator Vanstone, prior to coming into this place, was a lawyer. Therefore, you have to listen very carefully to what she says in order— 
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the honourable senator has clearly misrepresented the position. As I recall, Mr Stone did not say that of the Prime Minister at all. I would have thought that that misrepresentation must have been inadvertent and the honourable senator might like to correct the record.
—That is not a point of order, Senator Hill.
—I take the honourable senator at his word. I think he is right: it appears to be mean and tricky and he appears to conduct a mean and tricky campaign. But the words `mean and tricky' are there, and here is a classic case of where those words are properly applied. Senator Vanstone wants to give an impression that families in some of the lowest income areas in Australia are somehow rorting their entitlement to social security. In answer to a question today, she says, `Well, of course, people know how much money they receive from the Commonwealth.' No-one is disputing that. The impression of her answer is to put the emphasis on low-income, working families in this country somehow misconducting themselves and that is totally unfair. The truth of it, as opposed to what is asserted by the minister, is that the minister expects ordinary working families to know, in every case, when and if ever they receive an overpayment, and, if they do, to immediately return it. 
Of course, the way the Commonwealth is supposed to advise these people is through a regular report on their income—an income reporting mechanism. Have they provided that information to the families she is now accusing, by inference, of ripping off the system? No, of course, they have not. They are behind time; they have not come out yet. And yet families—low-income earners—are being slugged to pay back, in lump sums, amounts that they did not know they had and did not know that they were supposed to repay. That is where the mean and tricky part comes in: blame the victims; shift the blame from the government; remove any possibility of the government having a compassionate and human face about struggling Australian workers and their families. The impression she gives is different from the actual circumstances.
So what is the situation here? In the budget brought down in the year 2000, the government changed the administration of the family tax benefit scheme to remove the 10 per cent tolerance families had in estimating their next year's income for the purpose of determining the level of family tax benefit they received. This had the effect of creating a debt with Centrelink for 650,000 families in Australia—one family in three— that received the family tax benefit because very few families can accurately estimate their next year's income in advance, with changing employment and work patterns in their families. That is what the government expects them to do: estimate in advance what jobs they will have next year for each member of their family and how much income they will get. It is on that basis that these recovery actions have been taken.
In the middle of last year, when thousands of families found themselves in a situation of owing large debts to Centrelink, the government moved in and asked for the money immediately. Minister Vanstone's own backbench is in uproar about this. The issue has been taken off her by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. On the weekend, Ms Helene Weston-Davey reported that she had received an overpayment, despite keeping Centrelink informed. When you add it all together, the job she had—and we are encouraging Australians to take work— meant that her family was out of pocket by the time she paid for childcare and returned the figure to the department of social security. In fact, the government has invented a poverty trap to catch Australian families who are low-income earners in this country and it shows no human compassion, assistance or help, to help those struggling families not only get a job but also manage their obligations to the Commonwealth.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-08-26,"—The first thing that I would like to say during this motion to take note of answers is that the allegations that Senator Sherry let fly earlier against the Hon. Senator Helen Coonan are most unnecessary and offensive. Senator Watson gave a comprehensive response to the allegations that were made by Senator Sherry. Immediately the response was provided by Senator Watson, Senator Sherry departed the chamber. He was not interested in the response—in the facts as the government sees it—and he departed the chamber. Senator Cook made a very vigorous set of allegations as well, and now he has departed the Senate chamber. That certainly underscores the sense of commitment from the other side of the chamber to these matters, whereas we have certainly—
—Get on to the debate. Haven't you got an answer? You don't have an answer, that's why. Stop wasting time.
—We certainly do have an answer. Senator Coonan and, indeed, Senator Vanstone have set it out very well in the chamber in the last two days—if you were listening. But, for the record, I am quite happy to go through it with you. Senator Sherry indicated that this government had a soft attitude to the big end of town and was crying crocodile tears in honour of small business. I remind Senator Sherry and senators on the other side about the 13 years of Labor when we endured interest rates for small business at record highs—and now they are at 30-year record lows. As a small business person myself, I have been very thankful for those low interest rates.
Addressing the issue of the family tax benefit overpayments offset against the tax refund: yes, Senator Cook has made those allegations and Senator Vanstone has responded to them. But it is no surprise that the offsetting of family tax benefit claims against tax commenced on 1 July this year for tax returns for the 2001-02 year. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the mechanism whereby tax credits are used to offset family tax benefit debts is similar to the offsetting arrangements which have been in place between other government agencies and the ATO for some time. So it is not rocket science; this is not a huge surprise.
What we need in this country is a strong welfare system that will work and a good administration system that will work fairly and honestly to the benefit of the family. The people on the other side know full well that this is a very pro-family government. Our Prime Minister has always been pro-family, and this is exactly what we are doing: we are implementing pro-family policies on our side. We support the concept of mutual obligation, and we will do whatever is necessary to improve the system. If there are improvements to be made, be assured that we are in a position to make them and we will be very happy to do so. It is quite a simple philosophy that if you get paid too much then you have to pay it back. Australian taxpayers need to be protected. We need to stand up for them.
The ATO can also offset tax refunds against tax debts. Offsetting ensures that the debts are collected simply and easily for both the taxpayer and the government. That is what we are on about: protecting both the taxpayer and the government. The taxpayer does not have to make provision for the payment of a separate debt, because the amount owing to the other agency is withheld from the tax refund and sent to that agency. It is quite clear. In this case, the tax office is collecting overpayments of family tax benefit by the department of social security. The alternative to the use of offsetting against the tax refund is for the department to either take recovery action itself or allow the overpayment to stand. For the first year of the family tax benefit the offsetting provisions were not used while taxpayers developed a better understanding of the new family tax benefit system.
—Bring back Senator Mason! 
—Those on the other side are quite happy to interject and are not interested in the answer. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I also rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Coonan and the answer given by Senator Vanstone during question time. What those opposite fail to get is that this is not an issue about the rights and wrongs of any individual family's circumstances. It is actually about a flawed process. It is about bad legislation and bad administration. In fact, it was pleasing to hear Senator Vanstone admit today that there is actually room for improvement. It is about time!
This is all about a failure in public administration that the minister is attempting to cover up by referring to our fellow Australians as `welfare whingers'. It is not about welfare; it is not about the welfare system. It is not in any way a welfare issue. It is about support for families. There are lots of vulnerable parents and children out there—and, I am sorry, not all of them are on welfare. All of them—not just those who get direct support through the welfare system—need our support. This is actually about tax. It is about your family assistance tax measure. It is not about welfare, it is not about whingeing, it is not about trying to rip off the system; it is actually about tax. It is about a piece of tax legislation that aims to provide rebates to Australian families, a tax that just happens to be administered on behalf of the Taxation Office by Centrelink. There are obviously administration problems with that. But it seems that the government's only advice to its fellow citizens who are finding it very difficult to receive their proper rebate is: `Have patience and endure. Just wait, and we'll try to sort it out.'
One therefore has to wonder what policies, instructions and training were provided to Centrelink staff to assist in the implementation of this legislation, because the failure here is not on the part of Centrelink staff. With new legislation and without clear directions on possible ramifications, they were in the position of implementing the letter of the law. Let us remember that the legislation requires that the only change is to current payment from the time of the new estimate. It does not include an automatic recalculation to ensure that the person is given a choice to minimise their chances of an overpayment. In fact, as I understand the situation, Centrelink staff now actually advise their clients that they face a potential overpayment and that, by clients providing a further increased estimate, the payment is likely to balance itself out over the full year. In fact, I am informed that some Centrelink customers are now advising Centrelink on a fortnightly basis of fluctuations in their estimate to attempt to ensure that they do not end up with an overpayment.
Yet all the minister can do in response to that is call them `welfare whingers'. Honestly! Why does this have to be the case simply because the staff concerned with the frontline implementation of badly drafted legislation have realised that providing this advice minimises the number of Australians who end up becoming debtors to the Commonwealth? It minimises the number of Australians who have their tax refund stripped away to pay back the debt. It minimises the number of Australians who are disadvantaged because of a lack of information as to how the assistance package really works.
Commonsense suggests that Australian families are not trying to rip off the system. Commonsense also suggests that a computer system of the agency administering this assistance should be capable of handling basic recalculations of payments to wipe out potential debts. I am sure it could, if the government would only instruct that that should happen. Commonsense displayed by the Centrelink staff on the ground now assists families facing potential overpayments and actually encourages them to overestimate, so they go without income support in the first instance to minimise their chance of receiving an overpayment. Commonsense would also suggest that the government should have a better approach to re-estimating and recalculating during the course of the year, rather than engaging in an exercise where 650,000 families are faced with the consequences of being overpaid. The failing here is not the fault of our fellow Australians; it is a failure of legislation and its implementation by this government. 
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-08-26,"—A Senate return to order of 20 August of this year orders the tabling, by no later than now, of various pieces of financial information relating to public universities. The minister has asked me to supply the Senate with the following information:
The minister's department prepares reports which contain financial projections calculated by the department and information provided by the institution. These are forwarded to each university as a precursor to annual profiles discussions. The reports are used as a basis for confidential bilateral discussions between each university and the department. The preparation of these financial projections is not required under section 14 or any other sections of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. When the department requests education profile information from institutions, it makes clear that certain information collected will be regarded by the department as commercial-in-confidence.
On 12 August this year, the Secretary to the Department of Education, Science and Training responded to a letter from Senator Carr on this issue. I table this response today. In his letter, the secretary noted that the strategic and financial planning information and student load data supplied by institutions is inherently commercial-in-confidence in nature and was sought and supplied on that basis. As well, the information collected from institutions for the preparation of the forward projections and the outcome of discussions with universities are used by the department to advise the minister and the government on policy issues with respect to the financing and regulation of the higher education sector. For these reasons, in accordance with past practice, it would be inappropriate to provide this information to the Senate. 
The formal minutes produced following each profile visit are the record of confidential financial bilateral discussions between the universities and the department and, as mentioned previously, the outcomes of the discussions form the basis of policy advice to the minister and the government. As advised, and in accordance with past practice, it would be inappropriate to provide this information to the Senate.  
Section 14 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 does not require the preparation of a summary report along the lines requested by Senator Carr, nor does the department prepare such a report as part of the profiles process—other than by way of providing policy advice to the minister. The department does prepare a summary of the higher education sector's performance and publishes this information in the higher education report for the relevant triennium. I am happy to table a copy of the Higher education report for the 2002-2004 triennium on the minister's behalf. Parts 1.1, 1.5 and 1.6 of the report deal with enrolments, prudential assurance and Commonwealth funding and institutions' performance respectively. A commentary on the financial standing of the sector can be found at page 47 of the report.
Detailed information on the involvement profile for 2000 for all institutions is provided in the publication Students 2000: selected higher education statistics. I table a copy of this publication. The operating result for 2000 for all institutions is available in the publication Finance 2000: selected higher education finance statistics. I table a copy of this document. These publications also contain data for all institutions and the sector for 2000 covering the requested financial information, selected research performance measures and enrolment information.
Changes in the operating result for all institutions for the period 1996-2000 can be found at figure 1.19 on page 52 of the Higher education report for the 2002-2004 triennium, which I have already tabled. Section 14 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 does not require the preparation of summary reports along the lines suggested at point six of Senator Carr's request, nor does the department prepare them as part of the profiles process, although it may produce such information in order to provide the minister with policy advice.
Much of the information requested for 2000 has either been published in the publication Finance 2000: selected higher education finance statistics or been previously provided to the Senate Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education in response to questions on notice. I am happy to table these answers today. I would also like to inform the Senate that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee supports the minister's response to this request.",SENATE,"<title>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS</title>",<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,10,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-08-26,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
We see today a response from a government who are desperate to hide the true nature of the financial crisis in the Australian higher education sector. We have heard today from a government who clearly do not want the public to know the nature of the financial state of Commonwealth funded universities. They are saying that this is not the business of Australian taxpayers. They are not prepared to indicate whether or not our universities are in a financially secure position. They are saying that that is none of the business of this Senate. 
Dr Nelson is running around the country, conducting a review of the country's higher education system, but he will not give this Senate basic information about the financial circumstances facing Australian universities today or about what the department knows, in terms of its projections, is the likely situation for universities across the next three years. We have been provided with a number of published documents about events that occurred in the past, which of course anyone who knows anything about higher education is only too well aware of and more than capable of accessing. It shows contempt by this government to respond to this return to order in this way.
At the June Senate estimates, departmental officers confirmed that there was detailed financial information prepared by the department, of exactly the type that the Senate has asked the government to provide today. What is provided by each university is collected, collated and processed by the department on an annual basis. This information includes forward projections. There are forward projections for every university in this country. This information—these projections—is based on estimates that the universities themselves provide, but it is also processed by the department and produced in graphic form—in colour, no less. 
Here is an example of the so-called highly confidential information. Here is an example of the information that this government says will bring down the universities of this country if this Senate is given copies of it. It is information about the availability of funds, expenditure by activity, student-staff ratios, funding for students and staff, fee-paying students, the ratio of salary costs to total expenditure of staff et cetera. I will ask leave to table this document that is so secret and confidential. This information relates to one particular college, Batchelor College in the Northern Territory. There are figures and tables such as this—I have others here— from every university in this country. We are told that this information is so secret that this Senate cannot be provided with it. Information that is widely known across university administrations in this country is prepared by this government every year—information that is vital to an assessment of what is actually happening in our universities; information that is critical to any proper public debate about the future of higher education in this country.
Associated with each of these reports are basic assumptions, outlined in detail, as to the effect of government policies on these universities. What we are being told here today is that information is provided by the department to the universities. At every estimates they have this information, and it comes back to the Senate in that form. The difference is, of course, that you have to know what questions to ask. You are not provided with the full, glossy report that is provided to each of the universities; that is information that they can have that the Senate cannot have.
Dr Shergold has written a letter to me, and it has been tabled here today. He wrote about the department's failure to answer these basic questions at Senate estimates. After the hearings, his officers confirmed that the information I was seeking was readily available in the department. We are not asking for new information to be created; this is information that is used day in, day out by the officers of the Commonwealth. I showed the letter that has been tabled here today to Mr Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate. He made a few comments in response, and I will seek to table those responses in full, too. Dr Shergold's claims were, as has been repeated today, that making the information available would severely damage the interests of individual institutions. That is a claim that is not demonstrated. No evidence is produced to support that claim. Dr Shergold also provides the view that it could `give incorrect and misleading pictures of the present and future financial health of institutions'. We are entitled to ask why it is that only the government officers are the ones who can rightly claim, in their view, that they have a correct view of education policy in this country. That is a nonsense. Quite clearly, this is the basis on which the department is relying for its judgments about the future of higher education in this country.
Dr Shergold's letter also goes on to say that releasing the information might `adversely affect Australia's reputation internationally'. The Clerk of the Senate advises me that this is effectively the LAPD excuse, named after a Los Angeles mayor who said that the public could not be told about offences committed by the Los Angeles police, because it would undermine confidence in the police force. Surely there is reason for all of us to be concerned about—to fear for, in fact—Australia's international reputation when the public that pays for these institutions is not entitled to have basic information about how the system is running—not about what happened in the past but about what is happening now, to get an assessment of what the government knows is happening into the future.
Dr Shergold's letter says that the financial projections constituted `policy advice to the minister'. Quite clearly, they are based on data which is advice made available through public means, through the department by departmental documents, and in no way cover normal provision of the concept of ministerial advice. It is like saying that every single item in the department is protected from disclosure to the Senate on the presumption that one day it might be required for advice to a minister. Clearly, that is a nonsense. 
Dr Shergold also goes on to say that the HEFA does not require the financial projections to be provided to the Senate. Not explicitly—but section 14 of the act specifies that information be provided by universities to universities as part of the profiles process, in a form approved by the minister. The minister, through the department, obviously requires the information to be provided. Again, it is a nonsense to say that this government can excuse itself from public scrutiny and accountability because it does not suit it that information be made available which will clearly expose the deep, structural financial crisis within Australian universities.
The information is available, the government acknowledges that it is available, it is prepared on an annual basis, it is required to be provided by an act of this parliament, and the government is now seeking to deny this parliament access to that information. That is quite clearly a situation that is unacceptable. I repeat: these documents are readily available. They are easy to produce; there is no great cost involved. There will be no basis for a claim that the Senate is inhibiting the work of government. The documents indicate in their financial statements the income and expenditure, the movements of funds throughout the year, assets and liabilities, and the various effects of the government policies on the actual operation of the university. How can that information be commercial-in-confidence? How can it possibly be the case that universities—public institutions—should not provide this information when each and every one of them is required to provide it?
There is quite clearly a case here. There is no argument about this, as far as I can see, other than the fact that the government is seeking to hide behind a cloak of secrecy to avoid accountability. These are obviously matters that will not rest here, and I would suggest that these are questions that need to be pursued through the full processes of the Senate. It may well be that this is a matter that we will have to revisit. I have reports already on a number of these institutions. I know that the reports exist, and I think it is totally inappropriate for the government to seek to avoid its responsibilities to higher education, and to the public education debate, by hiding behind this pathetic, miserable excuse of claiming commercial-in-confidence when quite clearly these are issues that universities know fully about. It is not hiding anything from the universities; they actually know what is going on. I would think that it would be appropriate for the government to reconsider its view.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-26,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a Matter of Urgency:
Given that, one year on from the incident involving the turning away of the MV Tampa from Australian waters, the Government's so-called `Pacific Solution' is directly resulting in: 
(a)	the continuing enforced separation of families;
(b)	the ongoing detention of men, women and children on Nauru and Manus Island, including many people who have been determined to be refugees;
(c)	huge and unnecessary costs which remain undisclosed but are likely to exceed one billion dollars;
(d)	stresses on our relationships with PNG, Nauru and our other Pacific neighbours and a major distortion to Australia's aid program,
the need for the Government to:
(e)	allow all people on Manus Island and Nauru who have been determined to be refugees to be released into the Australian community, and
(f)	immediately end the practice of detaining children, by exploring methods such as placing unaccompanied children in appropriate foster or community care and allowing family groups to live in a model like the Woomera alternate detention trial.
On this issue there is no need for any of us to make specific speeches because all Democrats have identical views on this incredibly important issue, as we do on virtually all policy issues.
—That's why you're always brawling, is it?
—I can understand the coalition senators wanting to jest and laugh, but it is not a laughing matter. We are talking today, as the Senate just voted, about a year since the government really plumbed the depths, lower than anybody believed possible, even by this Prime Minister's standards, and took Australia down one of the most divisive and socially destructive paths that it has ever experienced. As I have said before, in the current Prime Minister we have probably the most destructive Prime Minister that we have had in our nation's history, with the possible exception of Billy Hughes.
As a result of the Tampa incident—and I do not particularly want to talk for long about that; this motion does not address the Tampa incident itself but the entire so-called `Pacific solution' that flowed from that incident—we have seen a continuing, deliberate policy, as this motion indicates, from our so-called `profamily' Prime Minister aimed at keeping families apart. We have seen the ongoing detention of thousands of men, women and children in Nauru and Manus Island as well as the continuing detention of people in Australia, including people who have actually been through the process and have been assessed as refugees. There are still hundreds of people like that on those Pacific islands at the moment.
There have been enormous costs—in excess of $1 billion more than would have been needed to have been spent if the government had not changed its policy specifically as a consequence of the Tampa and the upcoming federal election—and those costs are still being incurred. This is not a policy that happened 12 months ago, won the government the election and then it moved on. This policy is still being prosecuted today, and the cost in human misery, social division and the degrading of the Australian social fabric— and the cost in taxpayers' dollars—is continuing to escalate. We have the new purpose-built detention centre that is being fast-tracked on Christmas Island and being given special exemption from all of our national environmental laws at the same time. This is at a cost of more than a quarter of a billion dollars, when we have empty detention centres sitting in Australia, solely so we can keep them off the mainland for some political purpose so that the Prime Minister can say they have not set foot in Australia.
We have the immense damage being caused to our reputation in our own region, the Pacific region, the stress on our relationship with PNG at a particularly crucial time with a new government coming in there and the total perversion of the most central part of Australia's aid program focused on the Pacific. The highest percentage of our aid program is in our own region, in the Pacific—as it should be—and we have completely distorted and perverted the whole message, the whole intent and the whole purpose of that program, not for any social good or for social development, empowerment or the hauling of people out of poverty but to actually put people into misery and for political purposes here in Australia. That is the consequence of the events of one year ago with the Tampa. 
That is not to say that before that the government's policy was sweetness and light. That was just the outcome of what the government had been doing, particularly for the last three years, with its continual distortion, propaganda and misinformation to the Australian public about the facts relating to refugees and asylum seekers. It was deliberately trying to turn the Australian people against the refugees and asylum seekers and portray them as people who were not deserving. That had been going on for years, and then with the Tampa it descended to depths beyond those I think anybody believed would occur. Nobody would ever have believed that an Australian government—even a Liberal government—would send in the troops and use the military to board rickety, overcrowded and barely seaworthy vessels. The evidence before the so-called `children overboard' inquiry was astonishing: the use of the military to board those vessels, one of which was so overcrowded that, in order for the military to be able to board it, they actually had to take some of the people off so they could fit on. The extent to which the government went was absurd but, unfortunately, it was reality.
This motion seeks not only to recognise that but to indicate that it is a matter of urgency. It is urgent because it is not just noting an anniversary but noting that this is still happening and that thousands of people are still suffering today. It is not just people and children in detention who are suffering but people in our own community. There are thousands of people who have been recognised as refugees and are out in the community who are being deliberately denied settlement assistance and support from agencies. For what I hope must be the first time in Australia's history, a government minister was actually saying to welfare organisations who received government funding, `You are not allowed to provide assistance to these people. Even if they are in need and meet the precise criteria you were set up to assist, you cannot help them. If you do, you will lose your funding.' It is just extraordinary.
This motion also seeks to call on the government to act. The Democrats would like to see massive change. But at an absolute minimum we must recognise that there are refugees who are still detained, who have been recognised for months as refugees, on Pacific islands. They should be allowed to be free. It is a blatant breach of the refugee convention to be detaining people who are refugees.
—Maybe they should go home!
—They are refugees. They cannot go home, you fool! That is why they are refugees. We must get the children out of jail. At a minimum we must get the children out of detention. I am glad to see the ALP recognised and supported that last week. I am glad to see them working to improve their policy. It is crucial that we present the Australian people with alternatives because they exist.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! Senator Bartlett, could you withdraw the reference to the senator as `a fool', please. It is unparliamentary.
—I take your ruling and withdraw my remark, and I apologise to the honourable senator.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-08-26,"—In the last few minutes from Senator Bartlett, as he saddles up for a run at the Democrat leadership, we have seen the adoption of the comfortable posture of the Australian Democrats—a cocktail of indignation, inaccuracy and outrage. Senator Bartlett singularly failed to address the two most fundamental facts about the Pacific solution, the policy adopted by the Howard government. The first of the facts which Senator Bartlett chose to ignore about the Pacific solution is the fact that the policy has worked. The policy has been an outstanding success on its own terms.
—That means it has worked, does it?
—You voted for it in the last election.
—Senator Kemp, you never know where the Labor Party is on this. At various stages late last year the Labor Party was actually supporting the policy, as you know, Senator Kemp, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. So the first proposition which one could have been forgiven for failing to appreciate, having heard Senator Bartlett, is that the policy has been a success. Since 16 December last year there has not been one unauthorised boat arrival in Australia. That is the first proposition: the policy worked. 
The second proposition, which again was ignored entirely by Senator Bartlett in his remarks, is that the policy attracted the overwhelming support of the Australian people at the general election on 10 November last year. I know that there are few species in Australian politics who have more contempt for public opinion than the Australian Democrats. Their conduct and behaviour in the last few weeks has certainly been a textbook example of disregard and contempt for public opinion. But, truly, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would think that at least some respect for the wishes of the Australian people would be shown in debating this policy. So there we are: the policy is a success and the policy is supported by the Australian people.
One of the paragraphs of Senator Bartlett's motion deals with the detention centres. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of the position in relation to the most well known of the detention centres, the Woomera detention centre. At the moment, for all the fuss, do you know how many people there are now in the Woomera detention centre? As of today, there are 181. Of those 181 people—these are all unauthorised boat arrivals—do you know how many there are awaiting a determination as to their application for refugee status? There are two. Two people are all who remain in the Woomera detention centre awaiting determination as to their refugee status.
—I haven't heard that on the ABC.
—You probably have not heard that on the ABC, Senator Kemp. Of the remainder, there are 84 people who are appealing adverse determinations and 93 people who have appealed adverse determinations and whose appeals have been unsuccessful—that is, they have exhausted the avenues of appeal and are awaiting deportation. There are two others who are awaiting temporary protection visas, having had their applications for interim refugee status successfully determined. So there it is: there are two who are about to be released on temporary visas; more than half—93 of them— have exhausted their rights of appeal and are awaiting deportation; another 84 have failed in their application for refugee status but are appealing through the system; and there are only two who have not yet had a primary determination. For all the fuss about the Woomera detention centre, that is where it lies now.
I want to turn to what seems to me to be the central point in this entire debate and yet is deliberately missed by the critics of the government's policies. People like Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown, who I see over there about to participate in the debate, love invoking the language of social justice. They love saying, `Social justice or fairness or humanitarian concerns demand that we condemn this policy of the Howard government.' I say that social justice means that the places go to the neediest. There is not an unlimited number of places in the Australian refugee program. Having regard to the fact that Australia is per capita the second most generous country in the world when it comes to receiving refugees, you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that places are not unlimited and that every time an unlawful entrant comes across our borders he or she takes a place that would otherwise have gone to a more needy and deserving person.
On 16 April this year, the `children overboard' inquiry, of which Senator Bartlett is a member, heard some very moving evidence from officers of the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, particularly from Mr Bill Farmer, the secretary of the department. Mr Farmer described to us in graphic detail the situation of the world's population of unsettled refugees, which he estimates as being between 14 million and 20 million people. These are stateless people; they have nowhere to go. They are people who are in limbo and, in some cases, have been housed for up to a decade in the most appalling destitution in refugee camps in the Third World. For instance, Mr Farmer told us about the situation of the people in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya which houses a varying population of about 100,000 human souls. These people live in situations in which sanitation and housing are inadequate, they have no access to adequate medication, women and children are constantly at risk from predators and there is widespread malnutrition. These people are the neediest in the world. 
Wouldn't you agree, Mr Acting Deputy President, that any Western nation's refugee program should be focused on the neediest people, not the people who buy passage from people smugglers, not people who—according to the evidence we heard at the `children overboard' inquiry—spend anywhere between $US2,000 and $US7,000 to buy passage, who arrive in Malaysia and Indonesia by commercial jets and pay their money to people smugglers and who then seek to enter this country by unlawful means? Our refugee program—and anybody who is serious about social justice has to concede this, surely— should be directed to the destitute people of the world and not to people who, in the words of Mr Farmer, the secretary to the department of immigration, have been described as middle-class refugees. A well merited fear of persecution does define a refugee, but surely there are other criteria when it comes to allocating the finite places, and of all of those criteria surely the most acute must be human need.
Earlier this afternoon, in answer to a question in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, informed the House of Representatives of the effect upon the availability of places to truly needy refugees of the Pacific solution and the success of the border protection policies of this government. Originally, we expected that in the financial year just gone only 6,500 places would be available to genuine refugees but, because of the Pacific solution, in 2001-02, 8,416 placements were able to be offered by Australia—an extra 2,000 people, destitute people, who did not pay, who did not arrive by commercial jets, who did not break our laws, who now this country, one of the most generous countries in the world, has taken into its bosom. We are made to feel by Senator Bartlett as if we are committing an offence against humanitarian values. On the contrary, our refugee program reflects our humanitarian values by concentrating on the people who need their protection most.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-08-26,"—The contribution we have just heard from Senator Brandis, who I would remind the chamber is a lawyer, is fairly typical of the shifty and shady sorts of contributions we have had from the government at least in part on this issue.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order: to refer to a senator as shifty and shady is most unfortunate; I do not think it is appropriate and should be withdrawn.
 (Senator Watson)—I think Senator Sherry was referring to the speech rather than to the senator as being shifty. If that is the case, there is no point of order.
—As I was saying, it was a very convoluted contribution from Senator Brandis, who, as I pointed out to the chamber, is a lawyer. Whilst I am not one who is fond of looking at the backgrounds of senators before they come into this place, you cannot help but notice that the modus operandi of lawyers is to turn black into white or white into black, and at least half of the senators on the other side in the Liberal-National Party are lawyers who have done nothing else in their lives but go through law school and work as lawyers. Indeed, at least half of the frontbench—with the exception of Senator Kemp, I would have to say—are lawyers. As I said, their modus operandi is to turn black into white. Only a lawyer could argue before the election that children were thrown overboard and then after the election, when the truth was discovered of course that that event did not happen, argue that it in fact did happen. That is the assertion from people like Senator Brandis.
I think this is an appropriate debate in which to put down a few background facts as to the arrival of refugees in this country. When the Howard Liberal government took power in 1996, there was an appreciable increase in the number of asylum seekers that sought refugee status in Australia through boat arrivals. It increased. Many were granted refugee status, many were detained and many were sent home, in accordance with the system that was set up during the Labor Party's time in government. Between March 1996 and the 1998 election, 1,072 people arrived on our shores—under a Liberal Party government, under the current Prime Minister. Between the election in 1998 and January 2000—when our then Labor leader Kim Beazley, aware of this increasing problem, announced his coastguard policy— 4,064 people arrived on our shores by boat. So between our previous leader Kim Beazley's announcement on 3 January 2000 and 22 August 2001, the 213th boat—let me emphasise this—prior to the Tampa, 6,348 people, had arrived. That is a total of 11,484 people arriving in unauthorised boats in Australia, whether via the mainland, Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef. 
The current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, did not care a damn about people smugglers up until one critical moment. He let the situation drift along for six years after their election in 1996 with an ever-increasing and significantly increasing number of refugees arriving in an authorised way through the actions of people smugglers. He let this situation increase dramatically over the six years. The government allowed 11,484 arrivals and did absolutely nothing about this issue until—surprise, surprise—just before the end of their second term in government when they decided to do something. As I have said, our then Labor leader, Mr Beazley, had flagged a coastguard to deal with the situation almost two years before the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, decided to use this influx of boat people for political purposes. The Liberal government has picked up the sensible policy proposals of engaging with the neighbourhood—Indonesia, Malaysia and Timor—off the back of Labor Party policy.
What is amazing about these figures that I have just read to the Senate is that they make a mockery of the Liberal Party election slogan, which was `We decide who comes into the country and the circumstances in which they come'. Mr Howard had failed to signal, tell or do anything about the 11,484 asylum seekers and many profiteering people smugglers who had decided over two terms, almost six years, of his government to head for Australian shores—up until one famous incident: the Tampa incident.
This incident started on 26 August last year, when a routine surveillance flight by Coastwatch revealed the presence of a vessel approximately 80 nautical miles north-west of Christmas Island. The KM Palapa I was carrying 433 potential asylum seekers en route to Australia before it broke down. One can only speculate about whether, if the KM Palapa had successfully reached Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island, the Howard government would have done no more than to treat it like the earlier 213 boats and taken the asylum seekers on board to detention centres on the Australian mainland for processing but, with an election to be conducted within two months and the Liberal government trailing Labor in the polls, the KM Palapa was an electoral opportunity too good for the Howard government to miss. On 27 August 2001, Australian Search and Rescue broadcast a call to any merchant ships in the vicinity to render assistance to the stricken vessel. A Norwegian freighter, the MV Tampa, responded to the call, intercepting the vessel and bringing its passengers aboard. The master of the Tampa, Captain Arne Rinnan, had intended to take the people rescued to a port in Indonesia, but the passengers demanded to be taken to Christmas Island. The captain then requested permission to berth at Christmas Island. This request was denied by the Liberal government, which directed the asylum seekers be taken to Indonesia. When the Tampa continued to proceed to Christmas Island and entered Australian waters, Australian Special Air Service troops boarded and took control of the ship.
It was in this atmosphere, and guided by the polls, that the then Liberal government conceived its political Pacific solution as an election strategy based on the broader issue of border security. In pursuit of this strategy, the Howard government attempted a number of unseemly and inappropriately desperate actions. These included the attempt to push through the Senate border protection legislation which would have legalised murder—I suppose as a non-lawyer, Senator Kemp, you would not understand how serious that is— and a round of hurried approaches to other nations to take the asylum seekers on the Tampa. These approaches included the foreign affairs minister, Mr Downer, asking the UN administration in East Timor to allow the Tampa passengers to be transferred to a camp in East Timor. This request, made on the day of East Timor's first election, was refused—despite a separate approach from Mr Howard to the UN Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan. There were also unsuccessful approaches to the governments of Fiji, Tuvalu, Palau and Kiribati about the possibility of setting up new detention centres. On 1 September 2001 the Prime Minister announced a truly Pacific solution to the dilemma he had created by promising that no asylum seeker on board the MV Tampa would be allowed to set foot on Australian territory. This Pacific solution was based on striking agreements with New Zealand and Nauru to allow the 433 Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers to be transferred to holding camps on their soil while their claims to refugee status were being processed. 
I wish this government would pay a bit more attention to the Russian money laundering—the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been moving through the territory of Nauru. We hear very little of that from this government—that is so desperate to rank up the issue of terrorism. I would say to the Senate that I would like to know where this Russian money that is being cycled through the various Nauru offshore financial vehicles is coming from. I strongly suspect that a good deal of it is coming from terrorist movements in the former Soviet Union.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Sherry is now dealing with matters which are not the subject of this motion. I suggest you direct Senator Sherry to return to the motion before the chair.
 (Senator Watson)—Senator Sherry.
—Thank you. I have made this point on previous occasions—what is this government doing about the hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian money being laundered through various financial instruments operating out of, and endorsed by, the Nauru government? What is the origin of these hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian money? I suspect very strongly that at least some of it is coming from some very odd sources in the former Soviet Union.
The Pacific solution was conceived in haste. It was very costly, it was unsustainable, and it had no ongoing benefit other than changing the way and the location in which the asylum seekers are processed. Let us look at the staggering costs of this so-called solution to date. The 2002-03 budget allocates the following over four years: $5.6 million for travel, $430.8 million for detention on Nauru and Manus—and we would like to know where this money is going, particularly in the case of Nauru, where money from the Russians is coming from very odd sources—$75.4 million for the regional cooperation agreement, $7 million for AusAid for Nauru, under a memorandum of understanding, and $2.1 million for the continuation of DFAT's temporary consulate on Nauru. So far, this totals $520 million. Importantly, these figures give no indication of how much it is costing to undertake the processing by the department of asylum seekers on Nauru and in PNG.
All processing of asylum seeker claims is being carried out by the department, except for those asylum seekers who came off the Tampa and the boat intercepted at sea known as the Aceng. The processing of these people is being handled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These figures, also, do not disclose how much the Pacific solution is costing in relation to ongoing aid, including the provision of security on Nauru and PNG by the Australian Protective Service and the Federal Police. Whilst the Federal Police are on Nauru I would like them to have a close look at the Russian moneys that are moving through Nauru financial institutions. That is a fairly important issue. To continue the list of costs of the Pacific solution: there are also additional costs to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to deal with the government-to-government issues arising out of the arrangements, costs for the department staff to visit these offshore locations, and the cost to the Defence Force of taking any intercepted asylum seekers to Nauru and PNG. 
It is even more difficult to trace the money already spent on the Pacific solution as it was hastily cobbled together without any clear budget allocation midway through the last financial year. The government has confirmed that the setting up and operation of the detention centres in 2001-02 cost $72 million in Nauru and $42 million in PNG. Once again, these figures do not include any of the department's costs for processing, additional defence expenditures or transportation and costs incurred by the APS, the Federal Police and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In terms of aid moneys, it is known that the memorandum of understanding with Nauru pledged a total of $30 million in aid.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-26,"—The Greens support this urgency motion. This is Tampa Day, and as such it is a day of ignominy as far as politics in Australia and this nation are concerned. While I hear the case being put by the opposition just now, which sounded very much like it supported the motion, we have in the last 12 months, besides seeing a government which has acted with enormous inhumanity towards people in distress for political ends, seen a government which has been consistently paired with an opposition arguing valiantly the case against the policies which it supports. It is an extraordinary situation in Australian politics where you have a government supported, aided and abetted by an opposition in doing the wrong thing. I frequently get asked: `The majority of Australians support this, don't they?' Opinion polls show that, but there has been no leadership from the opposition, and there is still no leadership from the opposition, to restore not just humanity but dignity and probity to immigration policy.
We Greens stand strongly for a more humane option as practised by many European countries, for example, in dealing with large numbers of immigrants. But let me again say this to the government and the opposition in this week of the Earth Summit: the failure of another policy—and that is environmental policy—is going to lead to many tens of millions more refugees as this century unfolds. A primary villain—for example, through the agency of global warming—will be the current government and its policies which will lead to a legacy of enormous environmental, economic and social disruption further down the century. The movement of people and the numbers of refugees which, as Senator Brandis pointed out, are somewhere in the order of 14 million to 16 million people in the world at the moment, is nothing compared to what is coming unless a more mature assessment of the future is made by a government which at the moment is in ostrich mode and has its head very much in the sand.
What an appalling failure to relate to other human beings as this government and this Prime Minister have exemplified in these policies. What a failure to relate to humanity at its basic level. At the forefront, it is dollars, economics and tugging the forelock to international trade, but when it comes to human values they are being put on the shelf. Just 12 months ago, Ben Oquist from my office told me about the cabinet decision, having asked the Tampa to pick up those 400 refugees, to turn away the Tampa. We immediately held a press conference and appealed for a more humanitarian outlook, for the people to be received, taken ashore and properly processed, and for the cheats to be sent home and the genuine refugees to stay here. This remains our policy. It would have saved Australians at least $1 billion, but it would have, more than that, saved this nation its reputation, which is being dragged through the mud.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-08-26,"—I must say that I am not surprised to see this urgency motion moved by Senator Andrew Bartlett today, because we are all well aware that the Australian Democrats would do anything to move some of the attention away from them and onto other issues. Certainly, Senator Andrew Bartlett would be the first one to do that. I am also not surprised, of course, to hear Senator Brown speak in the way he has, because the one thing you can say about Senator Brown is at least he is true to form. He never lets you down. He always sticks with the same line, which is supported by probably three or four per cent of Australians. Senator Brown, if you were to come in and say anything else, we would be disappointed. 
I have looked very closely at the urgency motion that has been put forward by Senator Bartlett. He is trying to highlight the fact that it is 12 months since the issue of the Tampa became one of public notice and one that was reported in the newspapers. Senator Bartlett is using the 12-month anniversary since that happened to try to highlight some issues which are important to him, but the vast majority of Australian people actually overwhelmingly support what the government did 12 months ago today. It seems as though that fact is lost on Senator Brown and on Senator Bartlett and on at least some of the members of his party. They have lost the fact that this was done with the overwhelming support of the Australian people. If you go and look at all of the polling that was done in relation to this particular issue, and it continued in the following months, you will see that there was and still is overwhelming support for the Australian government's policy in relation to asylum seekers, to turning away the vessel and the way that we have handled those people who sought to come to Australia illegally.
I do notice that in paragraph (d) of the matter of urgency Senator Bartlett talks about the `stresses on our relationships with PNG, Nauru and our other Pacific neighbours and a major distortion to Australia's aid program'. Where he pulled those facts out of the air from I simply do not know because, in fact, the Australian government is very grateful for the cooperation of the Papua New Guinea and Nauru governments in the establishment of asylum seeker processing centres on Nauru and on Manus Island.
The new Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael Somare, is on record as saying that the presence of the processing facility on Manus Island has not created any difficulties amongst the people on the island and in Papua New Guinea as a whole. So where are the stresses on these relationships that Senator Bartlett wants to include in his urgency motion? There is absolutely no basis for him suggesting it, no basis for it being part of his motion, because it is not backed up by facts.
The Pacific Islands in general share strongly our concerns about people-smuggling. Let us not forget what the issue really is about. The issue is about people-smuggling and how we as a country can best handle the very difficult situation of people fleeing their own countries, trying to circumvent the normal refugee and immigration processes in order to get to Australia. The Pacific Islands have been immensely cooperative on these issues. Transnational crime issues, including people-smuggling, have been a regular item on the agendas at meetings of the Pacific Islands Forum. So for Senator Bartlett to say that it is putting `stresses on our relationships', I think, is a major distortion of the facts, and he should recognise this.
The level of concern over this issue in the region is also reflected in the number of Pacific countries which attended the Bali conference in late February. Nauru, Palau, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Fiji and Vanuatu all attended the Bali conference because of the concern that was raised about people-smuggling and transnational crime issues. Australia very much welcomes the excellent cooperation and support that we have received from the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea in developing offshore processing arrangements for asylum seekers; both Papua New Guinea and Nauru have received significant benefits from assisting Australia. The establishment of processing centres in those countries has resulted in substantial infrastructure development and an increased flow of technical assistance to those developing countries which can only help them as they seek to further their lot in their area.
Senator Bartlett talks about a major distortion to Australia's aid program. It is not based on fact at all but it is another emotive little issue that he just wanted to throw into his matter of urgency. The focus of Australia's aid program has not been altered by offshore processing of asylum seekers. Our aid continues to be a partnership with the countries in the region to help them achieve better standards of living for their own people, and that should be the major criterion. When he talks about the need for the government to do a range of things for people who are detained on Manus Island and Nauru who are determined to be refugees, we need to remember that those people on Manus Island and Nauru are not held in detention under the Australian Migration Act—it is an important thing that we need to remember—but they are being subject to the laws of the countries in which they are being processed. It has nothing to do with the Australian Migration Act. The asylum seekers and refugees accommodated on Manus Island and Nauru were admitted to those countries on restricted visa conditions. They are required to remain in those centres pending processing or to return to their country of origin for resettlement. 
Australia has already indicated that it will take its share of refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The government has already indicated that. Of the 581 persons who so far have been found to be refugees, 136 are already in Australia and hold temporary humanitarian visas. Eighteen of them arrived between late April and early July, 42 arrived on 30 July and a further 76 arrived during August. So the Australian government is taking its fair share of refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Senator Bartlett says in his motion that all of those who are determined to be refugees should be released into the Australian community. He is simply suggesting to us that we should be taking more than our fair share of the burden of refugees that there are throughout the world. It has been well noted and well documented that, in fact, per head of population we do take our fair share of refugees. On a personal note, I wish that more places would be made available for refugees who are not trying to enter this country illegally but who are living in squalid conditions in Africa and in Pakistan and in many other places around the world. I do not see why those who can afford to pay vast sums of money to people-smugglers, to criminals, in order to get to Australian shores should have an advantage over those who are without money and living in squalid conditions in Africa and in other parts of the world.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to support this urgency motion moved by Senator Bartlett in relation to the MV Tampa. The events of a year ago were some of the sorriest in Australian history, and I think that as time goes by historians will document them in that way. Senator Ferguson started off by saying that it was appropriate for Senator Bartlett to raise this motion today because it was a means of taking attention away from the problems of the Democrats, but what this issue did a year ago was exactly that. This was an issue that was fomented by the government in order to take the people's attention away from them and the way that they were conducting affairs in this country.
One year ago a number of boats arrived in Australia, and we turned them away. Not since the 1930s when we turned away a large number of Maltese who came here by boat, not since the early 1940s when we turned away a number of Jewish people fleeing from the first days of Hitler had we turned away boats in this country. Let us get this in historical context: not since those days did we turn boats away. We wound back the clock. In this instance, the people were fleeing from Saddam Hussein and from the Taliban, and we turned them back. We did not have any room for them here; we would not let them engage our system. We did that and, in doing so, we put people's lives in jeopardy and lives were lost. We truncated Australia's reputation. One year later, the problem is still there; the problem still exists. Of the 294 Afghanis who were sent to Nauru, 233 are still there.
I will get back to the big leak in Operation Relex and the big leak in the Pacific solution in just a few minutes, because some time soon this is all going to come a cropper. Unfortunately policy debaters in this country have not focused on that as yet. In the meantime, the taxpayer pays: $1 billion. As a former immigration minister, I know the importance of keeping the system under control; I know the importance of protecting borders. But I also know that there are ways of doing things. A $1 billion payment to accommodate what was a relatively minor problem at the time is not the way to go. The public do not just pay by direct outlays, they also pay indirectly, through government policies. This is the ironic aspect of this. That socioeconomic group that John Howard went out to whistle Dixie to this time last year, whose votes he wanted, are the ones who are now paying. They are the ones who are not getting the services they expected. They are the ones who are paying extra by way of taxes than they were promised otherwise. They are the ones who are not getting the social benefits. They are the ones whom Senator Vanstone is ripping payments back from. It is ironic that they are the ones who are paying. 
This country is also paying in the way that our reputation has been truncated. If people do not believe that, there was more evidence of it in the newspaper this morning. In one of the comment pieces, Alison Broinowski documented very well the way Australia's reputation has gone low only two years after the Sydney Olympics had our reputation riding high around the world as a successful multicultural society: tolerant, accommodating of diversity, and celebrating our multiculturalism. Tampa undid all this. But let us not be misguided. This country has always had a policy of determining who is allowed into this country. We have always had the state-of-the-art technology to ensure that we could vet those with security risks. A year ago we were told by the Prime Minister that that may not be the case. We were being warned that people who had bombed the World Trade Centre may have had links to boat people coming into Australia. One year later we discovered that was a fiction as well, as was the fiction that John Howard tried to perpetrate that he was the only person who had been concerned about it.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I thought that it may have been a slip of the tongue by Senator Bolkus earlier, but he should call the Prime Minister by his proper name.
 (Senator Watson)—Address the Prime Minister by his correct title, please.
—The Prime Minister—your Prime Minister—not one that I am proud of, not one that most of the public is proud of, but your Prime Minister, Senator Ferguson; the one who writes your speaker's notes, the one who prods you when you do not stand up for him, the one who gets really angry, the one who is so paranoid that he has closed off the area in front of his office. That has never happened before. People who come through the normal entrance in the ministerial wing now cannot go by the Prime Minister's office. Why? Because he has a touch of the vanities, that is why.
We used to have the security checks and the criminal checks, but we were told a year ago that we had to be warned that there might be criminals coming in on these boats. Two weeks ago before another parliamentary committee the Federal Police Commissioner made it clear that that was not the case. We have also had an independent refugee assessment system, which had been working quite well, and can continue to work well if this government takes its hands off it. We also had an advance warning system. As the minister for immigration I was quite well aware of that and invested enormously in making sure that it worked. We also worked cooperatively within the region with the UNHCR to ensure that there was burden sharing when it came to issues like this.
What happened here was a failure of policy. This government knew a year beforehand that these boats were coming. Minister Ruddock made it clear that he expected some 40,000 people to arrive. Did he do what Senator Ray did when he was minister; what Mr Hand did when he was minister; what I did when I was minister: go off at that first call, that advance notice, and set up a regional arrangement to ensure that Australia did not cop all the burden? No, he did not. He sat on his hands for a year, and now the taxpayer is still paying for it.
I mentioned earlier that the Pacific solution is not working. One reason it is not working is that offshore in Nauru, for instance, of the 295 people from Afghanistan who went there to be processed, 233 have failed the test and are still there. They have failed the test. If the Taliban government were in control in Afghanistan most of them would probably have passed the test. But what happens to these 233 people now? Senator Ferguson says, `It's none of our business. We've got nothing to do with it.' But, Senator Ferguson, look at the agreement between Nauru and Australia. It is littered with comments like, `Australia will arrange for the day-to-day management of the asylum seekers' facilities. Australia will arrange for day-to-day administration of facilities. Australia will ensure no people are left on the island. Australia will return both sites to the original,' and so on. What we have here is an agency arrangement. Can I tell you why that is important? As I say, policy makers have not caught up with this point yet, but I am sure they will very soon. Just two weeks ago in the Federal Court of Australia a Palestinian person was released because it was found by the court that the government could not return that person to Palestine—they were not allowed in. What we have here with these 233 people is a situation where the governments of Iraq or Afghanistan will not take them back, particularly the Iraqis. 
Let us concentrate on the Iraqis. They cannot be sent back. Under the law that operates in Australia governing Australian officials, wherever they operate, it will not be all that long down the track that these 233 people will have to be released. Under the arrangement with Nauru, they will not be released to stay in Nauru. In the absence of any place to send them to—and I know the minister has been running around the world trying to find Middle Eastern countries particularly to take these people back, but not just them—those people will be released in Australia. One billion bucks later, and that is what is on the horizon. At the same time as that the government says, `This is not affecting Australia's reputation.'
This week or next in Sweden there is to be a conference organised by the International Office of Migration, the office so critically involved in the operations in Nauru and PNG. What is that conference all about? It is all about giving the captains of ships like the Tampa more authority to override the sort of resistance that they got from governments like the Australian government one year ago. The way the Australian government acted in respect of that ship presented enormous problems for those who captain ships across the world. That conference is designed to see if that problem can be overcome.
We get Senator Ferguson in here talking about this issue and claiming that all is kosher in the system. We do not get the Prime Minister talking about it; we do not get the Prime Minister prepared to front the cameras and talk about it. He wants to talk about other things that happened a year ago, but he does not want to talk about his government's role in this issue. Is he ashamed of it? Is that why he will not talk about it now? Has he been identified as being the dog whistler that a lot of people in this country always thought he was, pitching the tunes of racism and xenophobia in order to attract votes to one part of the constituency?
—Only you do that!
—Not only me, Senator Ferguson; thinking people in this country know that. Those who got sucked in by him are starting more and more to appreciate not only that he treated them like mugs but also that the money has gone out of their pockets—the services are not going as promised. He treated them like mugs because they were tuned into another song. They are waking up to the fact that that is what happened and, progressively and increasingly, they are starting to ask questions like, `Why is $1 billion going to try to accommodate these 200 or 300 people and why is that money not going into infrastructure services—into dental services for pensioners and so on?'
—You do not like it, but you were part of it. (Time expired)
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Bolkus referred to the Prime Minister as having racist policies. I do not believe that is in order; I believe that is an unparliamentary reflection on the Prime Minister which happens to be untrue and should be withdrawn. 
—On the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I did not accuse the Prime Minister of being racist— not this time. I have on other occasions, but not this time. What I did this time was accuse him of pitching his messages to invoke racism and xenophobia in the community— to exploit those fault lines that may have existed there and to do so for his and his government's political advantage. That is not out of order.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2002-08-26,"—Senator Bartlett chooses this matter of urgency for two reasons. Firstly, of course, he wants to enhance his credentials to lead the Democrats, however bizarre that may appear to most of us in the Senate. Secondly, he wants to undermine our immigration policy in the broad and its essential core values—for what purpose one can only speculate. The first of the core values he seeks to undermine is that Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy under which anyone can seek to migrate here for economic, family or humanitarian reasons, regardless of ethnic origin, gender, colour or religion.
Secondly, immigration is about nation building and must always be in Australia's national interests. A third core value is that our immigration policies must enable Australians with non-Australian partners or dependent children to be reunited in Australia as permanent residents and, in time, as Australian citizens. Fourthly—and importantly for this motion—Australia must contribute its fair share to the resettlement of those people who are most in need of humanitarian assistance. In resettling refugees the Australian government devotes very considerable resources to ensuring that these people have the support they need to become fully integrated members of our community as time goes by—and of course we have a very successful multicultural society. Last, and by no means least, we must have the capacity to manage the movement of people across our borders in an orderly and efficient manner. Without this crucial element the idea of a managed immigration policy rapidly becomes meaningless, like so much else that the Democrats espouse these days.
I have been handed a transcript of a doorstop interview with Senator Bolkus in Adelaide in 1994 when Senator Bolkus was, I understand, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It concerns an announcement that the then government had made regarding border protection. I will read this transcript into Hansard, because it makes very interesting reading in the context of Senator Bolkus's comments just a few moments ago. He said:
The message of today's announcement is a clear one. The objective of today's announcement is to basically stop boat arrivals coming into Australia, and we expect that the announcement of the measures in the package today will have a substantial effect on the number of boats coming here.
The fact is that we want to send a very clear message to anyone who is intending to come to Australia illegally by boat with no valid claim that the doors are closed.
They are not wanted here unless they have got a valid claim.
Essentially you are not wanted here if you haven't got a valid claim. Don't even bother trying.
That was Senator Bolkus as immigration minister in 1994. It is interesting that he should be singing to such a different tune today.
The government have put in place a number of measures which have been effective in strengthening the integrity of Australia's migration and humanitarian program. This range of measures has allowed Australia to continue to provide protection to those people who are at risk, while at the same time disrupting the operations of people smugglers. Some senators seem to have forgotten that the government's action in relation to the asylum seekers on the Tampa was firmly based on our desire to ensure that the asylum-seeker system protected those most in need and was not abused by those seeking migration outcomes. You will recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that when the Tampa incident occurred exactly a year ago it was supported by the ALP because it was becoming increasingly clear that people were paying criminal gangs to access Australia and gain a migration outcome to which they were not entitled ahead of those with a much greater need. 
Australia has been a mecca for people coming to our shores to start a new life and, as Senator Ferguson pointed out, as a nation we can be very proud of the fact that we have an unarguably unrivalled reputation and record of assisting people in great humanitarian need. Australia is an active participant in global refugee settlement and that contribution goes back to the 1930s. Since World War II, Australia has taken over 600,000 refugees and humanitarian settlers—about 10 per cent of our total migrant numbers. The majority have been resettled through Australia's offshore humanitarian resettlement program.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-08-26,"—I thank senators for their contribution. It is an important issue; it is one that affects many thousands of people in our community and in our region. Senator Brandis, at the start of the debate, stated that this policy of the government's has worked, that it has been a success. I guess it all depends on how you define `success'. Yes, he is right in that there have not been any boats with asylum seekers arriving in Australia this year. There are, of course, many thousands of refugees. In Indonesia, there are people— some of whom I visited just recently—who have been assessed as refugees, as well as other asylum seekers who are stuck there, in particular the Iraqis. They cannot go forward; they cannot go back. They are simply in limbo.
This policy might have worked for the government. I am sure it has been a success: John Howard is back in the Prime Minister's seat; the Liberals are back in government. If that is their definition of success, then it has worked. But from the Democrat point of view, a policy can hardly be described as successful if it has cost an unnecessary extra billion dollars that could have been used for environmental repair, for assisting industries that the coalition like to go on so much about, for helping rural communities and for helping our schools, our health system and our education system. That is $1 billion which could have been used for social good that has been used for social destruction— hardly a successful policy. It is hardly a success for those many hundreds of children who have been detained indefinitely throughout that period of time and who continue to be detained. It is hardly a success for those people who are refugees—who have been assessed and acknowledged as refugees by either the UNHCR or our own departmental officials—to still be on Pacific islands in detention while the government tries desperately to find any country in the world but Australia to take them. It insists on keeping the refugees there because it knows that, as soon as it starts taking numbers of refugees, the pressure on other countries will subside. 
It is an urgent matter. One year on from the Tampa incident, you would think that things could not possibly get worse. But one thing the Prime Minister continually astonishes people with is that, every time you think he has gone as low as he could possibly go, he finds a way to go even lower. He has done it on this, and he is continuing to do it. The policy is ongoing; the human, financial and social impacts are ongoing. It is an important matter that needs urgent action. It needs to be turned around as soon as possible, because the ongoing cost to the Australian community in dollars and in social damage will be immeasurable. The longer it goes on, the more damage will occur and the longer it will take to repair. (Time expired)

Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The statement read as follows—
In 1999, the Government sought to amend the Norfolk Island Act 1979 to ensure that only Australians could vote in or stand for election in the Norfolk Island Assembly elections. The Senate rejected the bill, seeking greater consultation with the people of Norfolk Island on the matter. It was referred to the External Territories Committee in March 2000.
Current electoral arrangements on Norfolk Island raise serious concerns. The franchise for Assembly elections is based on residence on Norfolk Island rather than Australian citizenship. There are also requirements for eligibility to vote that are 30 times the period that applies in other parts of Australia—a residential period of 990 days or two and half years residence in the previous four years; whereas the usual period in Australian states and territories is one month, or six months in Tasmania. The result is that some Australian citizens are prevented from voting in Norfolk Island elections and non-Australian citizens are entitled to vote and to stand for election. The Committee concluded that this was unacceptable.
Under the proposed provisions in the rejected 1999 bill, only Australian citizens would have been eligible to enrol and stand for election to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. An `ordinary resident' qualifying period of six months for enrolment was proposed, and the enrolment rights of those currently on the electoral roll would have been preserved. Since Australian law does not require a person to renounce any other citizenship, dual citizenship, combined with the `grandfather clause', would have provided security of voting rights and existing citizenship for all those currently entitled to vote.
The Norfolk Island Assembly, which gave evidence to the Committee argued the special nature of Norfolk Island's traditions and culture, as well as the concern felt by some Islanders that these may be threatened by allowing relative newcomers a voice in island affairs.
The Committee was not persuaded that there was either a proven risk or a need for special protection, particularly when such protection, entrenched in electoral law, served to deny a basic human right to a group of citizens. Moreover, the Committee argued that, because the role of the Norfolk Island Assembly extended well beyond simple, local issues, it was vital to Australia's national interest that Ministers and other Legislative Assembly members were Australian citizens. The Committee also noted that Australian citizenship is now a requirement, or is being considered as a requirement, for enrolment and election at local government level on the mainland.
The Norfolk Island Government also objected to what it saw as the Commonwealth legislating on matters which were the province of the Norfolk Island Assembly. 
The Committee recognised the right of the Norfolk Island Assembly to legislate in this area and it believed that it was preferable that it do so. However, the Committee was aware that a succession of Norfolk Island governments had rejected electoral changes proposed by the Commonwealth. Consequently, it was clear that the likelihood that a Norfolk Island government would act unilaterally to implement changes, which the Committee considered to be fundamental to a strong democracy, was remote.
The Commonwealth made it clear during the inquiry that self government for Norfolk Island continued to be desirable; however, it did not believe, and the Committee concurred, that the changes to the Act affecting the electoral system in any way diminished the Island's self government. The Committee also believed that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to ensure that the Norfolk Island Government met its existing fiscal and social obligations to the community. Moreover, the Committee recognised that the Commonwealth has, and will continue to have, the legitimate right to intervene if it believes that an issue of national and international importance is at stake.
The Committee hoped that there would be increased cooperation between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island governments and would be disappointed if Norfolk Islanders should ever be required or feel obliged to choose between increased independence and the benefits of citizenship. 
The Committee concluded that a requirement for Australian citizenship in order to vote or stand for election to the Legislative Assembly was appropriate. It was satisfied that adequate safeguards could be provided for non-citizens who were already enrolled and noted both the relative ease with which a New Zealand citizen might acquire Australian citizenship and the opportunity that existed in both nations for holding dual citizenship. 
Two referenda were held on this matter on Norfolk Island, both strongly supported the Norfolk Island Government's position of no change. However, the Committee was not satisfied that the conduct of the referenda was accompanied by clear, comprehensive information. There was also concern about perceived levels of intimidation on the island of people who disagreed with majority views. Therefore, it was the view of the Committee that popular referenda were not appropriate mechanisms for determining such questions. The right to vote is a fundamental right, not a matter of popular opinion. This is particularly important where those without the vote are excluded from the referendum to give them the right to vote. Popular opinion often opposes the rights of minorities, the very groups which human rights seek to protect.
The Committee made three recommendations to the Government. First, that the Norfolk Island Act be amended to make, with appropriate safeguards for those on the electoral role, Australian Citizenship a prerequisite for both suffrage and the right to stand for election. Second, that referenda and elections on Norfolk Island come under the supervision of the Australian Electoral Commission. And third, that the eligibility period for voting be reduced to six months.

However, the Committee was not satisfied that the conduct of the referenda was accompanied by clear, comprehensive information. There was also concern about perceived levels of intimidation on the island of people who disagreed with majority views. Therefore, it was the view of the Committee that popular referenda were not appropriate mechanisms for determining such questions. The right to vote is a fundamental right, not a matter of popular opinion. This is particularly important where those without the vote are excluded from the referendum to give them the right to vote. Popular opinion often opposes the rights of minorities, the very groups which human rights seek to protect.
The Committee made three recommendations to the Government. First, that the Norfolk Island Act be amended to make, with appropriate safeguards for those on the electoral role, Australian Citizenship a prerequisite for both suffrage and the right to stand for election. Second, that referenda and elections on Norfolk Island come under the supervision of the Australian Electoral Commission. And third, that the eligibility period for voting be reduced to six months.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-08-26,"—With great regret, I will leave the soap opera story of Caltabiano and Quinn. Hopefully, I will allow an opportunity for my colleagues to take that up later. The saga does continue, such is the absurdity of the organisation of the Liberal Party in this country. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
“the following matters be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for inquiry and report by Thursday, 24 October 2002:
(a)	any amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 circulated in the Senate chamber; and
(b)	the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002”.
I move this amendment because there is a whole series of very important issues raised in the amendments proposed by Senator Brown and Senator Murray in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, and moving this amendment will allow the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to consider them in some depth. Whilst there is nothing in this appalling bill that Labor find worthy of support, there are some issues raised in the proposed amendments by the Democrats and the Greens that we believe are worthy of further inquiry, investigation and exploration.  
I turn first to the Democrat amendment. They are proposing a very complex amendment to the act, to provide for a general right of access for political parties to national funding. They argue that, through different mechanisms, the funding of both the Labor Party and the Democrats is paid directly to the national or principal agent to the party, and the legislation proposes to make it accessible to the Liberal Party in its particular circumstances. The amendments go to the detail about how this bill applies in those circumstances. One thing that struck me was that it is a very lengthy amendment and it will significantly change the intent of the bill. That is why we see conducting this inquiry as essential if it is to be given due consideration.
One of the other issues that the Democrat amendment raises is a very big question of public policy, about the way in which parties choose to structure themselves. I spoke earlier about some of the absurdities that are occurring in the Liberal Party at the moment and held up in contrast an appropriate way for political parties to go about organising themselves and modernising themselves. I think Labor presents itself as a very diligent and exemplary organisation in seeking to manage its internal processes equitably, fairly, openly and with some dignity. In stark contrast, the Liberal Party are dragging themselves through the mud. This causes some hilarity in some quarters, but clearly the government is abusing its status as the elected government of this country in bringing this bill before the parliament. Nonetheless, the Democrat amendment is thoughtful. It is worthy of lengthy consideration, and I think it is incredibly important that the Australian Electoral Commission be asked their views and that their input be sought on this amendment—its impact, its merit, its implications and so forth. The most appropriate way to do that is to take it to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That will allow us the mechanism to seek that advice from the Australian Electoral Commission.
I turn now to the Green amendment. Senator Bob Brown proposes an amendment to the bill so that, where a corporation makes a political donation of over $1,000 and the corporation is wound up or made insolvent within three years of making that donation, an amount equal to the amount of that donation is payable by the political party to the liquidator and may be recovered by the liquidator as a debt due to the liquidator by action. I should note that this amendment is not proposed to be retrospective.
This is an issue facing democratically elected governments and political parties in democracies around the world, particularly in an era where corporate governance is at the forefront of political agendas. According to many reports, many US politicians have been given money from the likes of Enron. There have been other collapses of funds set up for former employees, creditors or charity. So the US is grappling with this issue as well. The Greens amendment raises very important issues of public policy that are both relevant and credible in the context of the current debate. The proposed amendment will significantly change the intent and purpose of the bill before us. As I said earlier, Labor cannot find any merit in the bill before us, but it can see some merit in exploring the amendments proposed by various members of the cross-bench in an inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.
It is worth noting that, here in Australia, the situation described in the Greens amendment has occurred: it is well and truly on the record that HIH has reportedly given many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party. In 1999, when insolvency was already on the cards and that company was apparently facing losses, over $100,000 was donated to the Liberal Party and some money was also donated to the National Party. That is clearly an example. However, this is not something that is peculiar to the Liberal Party. Labor received some donations from companies: for example, froggy.com donated some money to the New South Wales Labor branch. The company is apparently facing losses of some $65 million and I know that the ALP's WA branch has agreed to repay a $10,000 donation. So it is not something that is peculiar to one political party or another. It is not even something that is peculiar to political parties here in Australia. It is being grappled with throughout the world. 
This is a very important issue of public policy and it is a very important long-term issue. I would argue that its importance extends significantly beyond the vested interests and the self-interest demonstrated in the bill that the coalition has put forward. This is a very complex issue and worthy of a high degree of investigation. That would most appropriately be done under the auspices of an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Most significantly, it would allow the Australian Electoral Commission, which has not been involved with these amendments, to provide some detail about the implications of these amendments for our democratic structures and the laws that they administer. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is very much the appropriate body to get advice on this subject. It has always considered these matters. Amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act have always been referred to this committee because of the experience and depth of knowledge of the participants in this committee. The advice, insights and points of view of the witnesses that come forth would be most gratefully welcomed by the senators participating on the committee.
One thing that is being shown in this debate is that, when this chamber applies its collective cross-bench and opposition minds to a problem, there are opportunities for good to be done through amendments to bills. I think that it is a display of the shallowness of the coalition that they did not take the opportunity to move constructive amendments to the Electoral Act on important public policy matters such as the implications of corporate collapses or important definitions or the structure and method of organisation of political parties between federal, national and state bodies in the way that the Democrat amendment does. Labor is being very responsible in creating an opportunity for these amendments to be investigated in some depth. I commend to the chamber the amendment that I have moved. I urge fellow senators to support it and also to give maximum consideration to the merit and implications of the significant and complex amendments proposed by both the Greens and the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-08-26,"—I support the motion moved by Senator Lundy on behalf of the opposition to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I think that these are extremely important matters. I certainly appreciated Senator Lundy's contribution and her description of the amendment that I have foreshadowed on behalf of the Australian Greens. If the amendment were to be adopted by the parliament, it would effectively mean that if a corporation that goes broke has made a donation to a political party within the last three years that donation will go to the liquidator and would therefore go towards helping the shareholders, who of course are hurt very badly when they lose their money in this way. I have no objection to that amendment being scrutinised by a committee and I welcome any input it might have into that amendment.
I have not had time to have a very good look at the amendment being proposed in the Committee of the Whole by Senator Murray, but it does appear that that amendment is going to effectively expand the government's intention in this legislation which not only would give the Liberal Party the right to ordain centrally that the states give public funding to the central body but would make that an option for all parties. That is effectively an amendment coming from the Democrats that is going to facilitate the government getting its way on this legislation, which it has been unable to do for some time. I think the Labor Party has argued cogently that the parliament ought not be intervening in the workings of a political party in this way and certainly, if the Liberals and the government parties are unable to get their branches to pay into a central fund through a general agreement, so be it. It ought not be for the parliament to be overriding the wishes of the branches in that case and saying, `You shall do so,' but a mechanism for that has been found here.
The history of this mechanism is that it was first found for the Democrats some years ago when Senator Kernot was leading the Democrats and there were difficulties with the Western Australian branch. At that time special legislation was put through that gave the Democrats the ability to effectively collect all the money for public funding from around the country and have it put into a central deposit. Now the government parties want that, and the move is here to allow all parties to do that if the central party wishes. 
The Greens will continue to oppose this legislation. We think it has a very strong political imperative in it, with the idea that political parties should be centralised in their function. So be it if that is what the Liberal Party and the Democrats want, but to use this mechanism to get their way to override the branches is quite untoward and quite remarkable for the Liberal Party, which is so much a states rights party. So much for states rights when it comes to the Liberal and National's own interests, which are very quickly overriding that states rights sentiment through this legislation and saying, `Bang! We will have the money brought into the national organisation, whatever the regions may think.' The Greens are not going to be part of that.
However, it is notable that if all of the Democrats support this legislation it will go through. Senator Lundy, if all of the Democrats oppose your motion, it will go through without being scrutinised by a committee. What could be less democratic than that? I hope that is not going to happen, but I fear it is. I think this matter should have some debate about it. To get amendments like this is, as Senator Lundy has said, extremely important. But to get them put through at the government's behest, with the support of the Democrats, is strange politics to me. I do not think it is right.
I say to Senator Murray, who has proposed this quite complex amendment with far-reaching impacts, that I would have thought he of all people would want time for the public and party members to scrutinise this—for people to have a good look at it, for there to be input and then for the Senate to consider it. So I do hope you will be supporting Senator Lundy's amendment. Senator Lundy is proposing a two-month stay while the matter is considered in a committee. I think that is fair enough. We have been dealing with this matter for some years now, and here is a new complex amendment with a very big impact and we ought to have time to look at it properly. I support the opposition amendment and appeal to Senator Murray and the Democrats to do likewise.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-08-26,"—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Lundy on behalf of the opposition to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. I do so for a number of reasons. If you look at the amendment moved by Senator Lundy, you will see it does two things. Firstly, it redresses a `policy-free zone' that this bill originally created, which may partly explain why it was not subject to a committee in the first place to ensure that the bill was examined in full and dealt with appropriately and that parties had an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the bill. Secondly, it gives the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters the ability to call in the Australian Electoral Commission to deal with some of the matters that are raised in the two complex amendments that have been circulated in the chamber.
It is comforting to hear from Senator Brown that he supports our motion. I was going to go to his motion at first, but to be kind to it generally—given that he now supports our motion for the matter to be referred for further inquiry and report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters— there are difficulties raised as to whether or not it achieves its purpose. Proposed section 306A refers to repayment of donations where corporations are wound up. There are a number of points to go through. The amendment deals with an amount of $1,000. There is an issue as to whether that is the appropriate amount it should be put at. The amendment refers to three years as the period, when making donations, one can go back to. The third matter contained within that proposed section is the ability of the liquidator to be able to recover debts due by action in a court of competent jurisdiction. In themselves, those matters deserve far more scrutiny to ensure that, if that is the import of the amendment, they can—although making no comment in respect of it—achieve their purpose. You have to ensure that the amendment to add a section 306A is the only amendment that is required to ensure that the Commonwealth Electoral Act permits section 306A and that there is no other law that might otherwise disallow or obstruct the purpose of that amendment. 
The bankruptcy laws as administered by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, also have to be correctly understood and utilised to ensure that the purpose of the amendment can be achieved. The amendment can easily be examined and considered by the joint committee, which can then have the experts from the Australian Electoral Commission or ITSA, dealing with bankruptcy, examine the amendment to ensure that it achieves its purpose but without making any particular comment in respect of the amendment itself.
I enjoin Senator Murray to support our second reading amendment that the matter be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Senator Murray's quite complex amendments go to some 11 in all. One of the curiosities of the amendments relates to proposed section 287B, which provides for a designated federal party. It goes on, as I understand it, to explain that that party might be other than the Liberal Party. So there are some complex legal issues that arise when you are dealing with national entities, state entities and a third entity, which is usually divisions or parts of a national body. I am not so sure whether they are all encompassed within amendment (2) as proposed by Senator Murray.
The Senate would benefit from the AEC and perhaps the Attorney-General's Department or the Government Solicitor's office being able to give us a view about whether the amendment as proposed by Senator Murray would achieve its purpose, without going to whether we agree or disagree with the proposed amendment. If there is going to be a debate in the committee stage on these amendments, it would be helpful to ensure the Committee of the Whole does have the benefit of the views of the Australian Electoral Commission, ITSA, the Australian Government Solicitor's office and the Attorney-General's Department and their competent solicitors as to what those amendments actually do, whether they achieve their purpose, provide a clear path and do what they are supposed to do.
When you look at legislation and when amendments are made one should always guard against unintended consequences. Unintended consequences are usually brought out or highlighted by, as in this case, a joint committee or other committees. That is why legislation is often referred to committees—to not only examine the bill but also ensure that unintended consequences do not arise. Clearly, there can be problems if unintended consequences are discovered. It would be helpful if the joint parliamentary committee could examine Senator Murray's complex amendments to ensure that that is not the case here. I undertook not to take too long in this debate, so I will not go on. There are matters that trouble me in relation to the Queensland Liberal Party, which I will not go into in detail—
—You mean repeat.
—I have to report to Senator Abetz that there are new issues in relation to Queensland. I only discovered this on the news service today. The relevant article was headed `Liberal leader makes second bid to win reform war', but I do understand that Senator Lundy took the Senate through that. It is interesting to examine some of the quite unusual things that they are pushing forward, but one of the more serious aspects that highlight a problem we always face in dealing with this area is that there is a party convention coming up from 6 to 8 September and that, although there is a significant amount of movement, those sorts of matters should not be confused and brought up within this debate. I am sure the government will tell us that they are separate and distinct from that and that it has nothing to do with this `dash for cash' bill.
I think the best course of action—and I am sure the government would agree—is to send the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have an inquiry and report on those amendments by Thursday, 24 October 2002. That would take the matter well beyond that September conference, and I am sure we will know by then whether Mr Quinn has won or lost his reform agenda. We might even know by then whether Mr Santoro, as it is sometimes reported, will be in the Senate and perhaps he will be able to explain his role in those issues. We certainly look forward to that debate. To ensure that I do not take too much of the Senate's time in relation to this, I think it is necessary to refer this bill to the joint committee, given the state of the bill, the type of bill and the type of amendments. That is one of the guiding principles Labor has always had when amendments such as these are proposed which are fundamentally different from the thrust of the bill itself. Let us face it: the thrust of the bill is a dash for cash or `Show me the money from your federal director,' as I have now decided to call it, because I think it is more apt.  
That is the import of the bill, but these amendments actually take away that idea and move the bill to something else. I am not too sure what that something else is, and that is why I think it is very important that the joint parliamentary committee examines the bill to ensure that we do understand it and, more importantly—and I think Senator Murray would agree with this—that people have an opportunity to understand what is being proposed here and have an opportunity to comment and understand the import of the amendments and what they intend to do. It is important that the state branches and especially the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party, as it has been reported, but also other branches and political parties that might be caught by these amendments understand the amendments and what they intend to do and have an opportunity to examine whether they will work, work effectively or not work at all or will require adjustment, amendment or removal in some respects. I would be disappointed if Senator Murray was not like-minded in ensuring that there was proper scrutiny of the legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-08-26,"—I rise to speak on the proposed amendment by Senator Lundy to the second reading of the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and indicate to the chamber that One Nation will be opposing the amendment. The reason we oppose the amendment is that we believe it is each political party's right within the process of their party to administer their affairs. If the Liberal Party choose to do theirs in such a way and have it enshrined in legislation, then that is the right of the Liberal Party. I do not believe that sending the issue off to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is the correct way to proceed with this issue.
Having placed that on the record, I just take the opportunity to speak very briefly to Senator Murray's amendments, which in actuality are even more far-reaching and have greater implications for all political parties— for the reason I have raised that each individual political party should and must have the right to actually manage their affairs as they see fit. The Labor Party themselves have a set process that has been determined by their party as to how they distribute and administer their electoral funding, and that is their right. I believe that the same opportunity should apply to the Liberal Party.
I agree with the basis of Senator Brown's amendment. This may not be the appropriate time or the appropriate way to move it. This is one amendment for which I would support some sort of additional scrutiny before it is enshrined within the act.
For clarity, I indicate to the chamber that I will not be supporting Senator Lundy's second reading amendment and will not be supporting the Democrat amendments because of their potential to impact right across the board on all political parties. I do not think it is even the prerogative of this place to do that. To administer through law the process of an election, I believe, is the function of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. These amendments go way beyond that, and I will not be supporting them.",SENATE,<title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-08-26,"—I never thought we would get to this stage of coming to the final speech on the second reading of this bill. I thank honourable senators. I say that with tongue in cheek, but it is usual to thank honourable senators for their contributions to these debates. We are in fact debating the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and not all of the extraneous matters that senators opposite appear to have had great delight in raising. It was somewhat shameless of them to raise a whole host of issues, trying to exaggerate and fabricate matters that allegedly were occurring in the Liberal Party here and there, whilst turning a blind eye to the fact that they had their own party officials such as Karen Ehrmann end up in jail, the Sword-Feeney dispute within the Labor Party—indeed, as I understand it, now the Senator Ray-Senator Conroy fall-out et cetera. 
We could trawl through all of that, but let us look at what this debate is all about. It is not that sort of bill. In fact, very simply, the bill is to allow for the public funding payable to the Liberal Party as a consequence of votes obtained at federal elections to be paid to the federal manifestation of the Liberal Party or as requested by that federal manifestation. When federal officers run federal campaigns it is appropriate for the federal office to get that funding. My colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, in introducing this legislation in the other house, made that point and indicated that in fact since 1999 that is how the Liberal Party had been conducting its federal elections.
Put in another way, federal taxpayers' money paid pursuant to federal legislation will be provided to the federal manifestation of the political party—in this case, the Liberal Party. Nothing could be simpler, nothing could be fairer, and why the Australian Labor Party needed 15 speakers in all during the second reading debate is beyond me when we have got such a very restricted bill before us. We did have a very tedious display of mock outrage by a gaggle of Labor speakers. Their filibustering through quite useless contributions has cost the taxpayers literally tens of thousands of dollars through wasted sitting time.
The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate started the debate and made his usual and expected shrill contribution. Full of his trademark hysteria, he generated some heat but, as always, no light. The honourable senator could not have believed his objections and his own conspiracy theories. Indeed, the other Labor senators—especially the newer ones who participated in this debate—will be devastated to find out that they threw themselves into this debate, lemming-like, for no high principle at all. Let us remember that in 1995, when in government, Labor amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act in a similar manner at the request of the Australian Democrats. The then Senator Kernot thanked Senator Faulkner's Labor government for their `assistance' in getting the amendment ready. That must have been during the time that Senator Faulkner was starting to warm up the coffee plunger. It was not in active use at that stage, but undoubtedly that was part of the warming-up process of that now infamous coffee plunger. Senator Kernot said during the debate:
... I am grateful for the assistance that has been given by the minister's office ...
At that time Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook, both of whom made contributions in this debate, were senior ministers in the Keating government, fully aware of their government's policy in this matter. This was a specific provision for the Australian Democrats. We, as a principled opposition at the time, listened to the arguments put forward and voted with Labor and the Democrats. I understand it was carried on the voices. That was because we took a principled stance as an opposition. Now Labor are getting so used to opposition that they are opposing things for opposition's sake. They are doing backflips from when they were in government. They say, `A specific provision for the Democrats is okay, but not for the Liberal Party'—then they try and claim it as a matter of high principle. It is like their arguments on privatisation. When in government, they privatise everything they can lay their hands on—then all of a sudden, when in opposition, they say, `There are matters of great principle here. Of course we can't support privatisation.' They are showing all the characteristics of a party ready for a very long stint in opposition.
It is interesting that opposition senators have suggested that the amendments ought to be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. In 1994 the ALP submitted to the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters that public funding for elections should be provided directly to federal or national offices of registered political parties. The ALP argued that such a reform: 
... establishes the principle that funding provided by the national parliament for national elections should go direct to the national offices of parties.
That was their view when they were in government; that is what they argued. Now they are in opposition, and all of a sudden the principles they espoused in government are thrown out the window for cheap political opportunism—embarrassing a lot of the newer senators who honestly believed that what Senator Faulkner was putting forward was a longstanding principle of the ALP. I think that Senator Faulkner did not brief his party room as to the Labor Party's history in this matter, when they quite properly assisted the Australian Democrats when requested. I invite the new Labor senators to have a look at section 288A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and go up to Senator Faulkner and say, `How on earth did this get through the parliament? Did you vote for that, Senator Faulkner? Did you vote for that, Senator Cook?' Of course, the answer will be, `Yes'. Then all they have to do is ask, `What is the difference on this occasion?' The answer will have to be, `We are in opposition.' That will be the policy free zone approach of the Australian Labor Party on this matter.
If the parliament regulates the operation of the registered organisation, it is appropriate for the government to listen to requests, as Labor did for the Democrats. As a principled opposition, we supported the move then and I invite Labor senators and other senators in this place to do it on this occasion. I understand that the Democrats have indicated their support for the government amendment, and I thank them for it. I note that they have proposed further amendments. The government see the merit in those amendments and we will be supporting them. It is interesting to see how different parties behave in this chamber. From the Labor Party there is simply negativity. It is unwilling to really engage, whereas the Australian Democrats do have a constructive approach to this matter and have proposed further amendments. In a spirit of cooperation, we see merit in those amendments and we will be supporting them. It is a pity that Labor cannot drag itself into relevancy and make a positive contribution.
I note that, at the very last moment, the Labor Party have moved a second reading amendment as a delaying tactic to try and refer this off to the committee system. Let it be remembered that this bill has already been to a committee, as long ago as September 2001. This is such an important matter of public principle that the committee was overwhelmed, in fact inundated, with submissions. How many? Four in all: one from the Australian Labor Party and one from a member of this parliament. There were two submissions from the public. That is all the excitement it generated amongst our 19 million fellow Australians. Now the Labor Party are of the view that this matter should go to yet another committee because there is a matter of such great moment in these amendments. I pose the question: where were the Labor senators in 1995 when section 288A was put through? Was that rushed off to another special Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry? Of course it wasn't. You know that what you as the Labor Party are going through is an absolute charade.
We also have an amendment from the Greens. It has been rushed, it is politically opportunistic, it is flawed and it is bad policy. We were told during the contribution that the Greens believed that donations from the corporate sector to political parties should go into an opaque trust and then be disbursed according to the vote at the election. It is a pity that the Greens did not do that with the $90,000 they got from the Commonwealth Bank and with the other donations they received. They did not hand that out. What they are saying is: `Don't do as we do; just do as we say.' It is quite duplicitous of them to make that suggestion. If, as they are suggesting, you have to repay the money if the corporation goes into liquidation within three years, then no political party could in fairness use that money for a period of three years, just in case the company did go into liquidation. You would have to quarantine it in your books, just in case. You cannot do business, I would have thought, on that basis. It would be interesting to know whether the Australian Greens conduct themselves in that way and quarantine their own donations. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I always like to have good information sourced. Would Senator Abetz source his information in relation to that Commonwealth Bank donation? I would like to know about it.
 (Senator Watson)—There is no point of order.
—What Senator Brown is seeking to do with his amendment is to apply one rule for a political party and another rule for every voluntary organisation, and in fact it is quite bizarre. Indeed, if parties have to repay moneys when a company goes into liquidation within three years of the donation being made, you would have to ask the question: should the $1,947 spent by HIH on liquorice all-sorts also be required to be repaid by the manufacturers of liquorice all-sorts? Or, indeed, should the tobacconist be required to repay the $1,600 on cigars? In the list of HIH purchases, one that would have been a very handy item in relation to the Labor Party's contribution to this debate was $75,000 worth of eau de toilette spray. Given the contribution by the Australian Labor Party, a good dose of some of that would have been of assistance.
If honourable senators bothered to read the Corporations Act and acquaint themselves with it, they would know that the act contains provisions that permit liquidators to apply to a court to reverse transactions made by a company leading up to its failure within certain time limits. That is available to liquidators. If the court finds that the transaction is reversible because of the company's insolvency, the payment will be returned to the liquidators for distribution to creditors. The provisions prevent companies disposing of assets or transferring funds from the company leading up to its failure at the expense of unsecured creditors. In other words, the Corporations Act sets out the circumstances under which a company liquidator may apply to a court to set aside certain transactions. These rules, as they should, apply to all recipients.
The Greens, in a cheap political stunt, are saying: `If it is a political party, it is all going to be different.' Does Senator Brown want Monash University, for example, to repay all the funds that HIH made available to it? No, that is not a part of these amendments. Indeed, if Senator Brown were genuinely concerned about this, the amendment he is proposing should be an amendment to the Corporations Act, not to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, because, quite frankly, I doubt that anybody trying to deal with their responsibilities in corporate law would turn to section 306, or whatever it is, of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to find out their duties and responsibilities. They would be, I suggest, in the framework of the Corporations Act.
—Senator Harradine, you have made a very valid point in relation to that, and that is why I asked whether Senator Brown was anxious for the creditor to pursue the donation to Monash University by way of a special piece of legislation— which takes us down the path of why a political party should suffer more than the supplier of liquorice all-sorts, cigars, the Monash University or whoever. There has to be one rule that applies to all, and that is in the Corporations Law. I assume that Senator Brown simply is not aware of that provision in the Corporations Law.
As I said before, we have had a number of shrill contributions to this debate from the other side. Honourable senators have taken the opportunity to seek to discredit the Liberal Party by trawling through all sorts of things. Allow me to quote from the Labor Party submission of 1994 to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters because it is a very good summary of what this bill is simply about. The ALP argued in their submission when they were in government that such a reform:
... establishes the principle that funding provided by the national parliament for national elections should go direct to the national offices of parties.
And that is exactly what we are doing in 2002. Sure, since 1994 the Labor Party have gone into opposition. Since 1995, when they cooperated with the Australian Democrats to get specific proposals into the legislation for the Democrats, what has changed? Nothing—other than that they have been put into opposition. So for cheap political purposes, now in opposition, they are using the opportunity to oppose that which they argued for whilst they were in government. It is in fact this cheap opportunism by Labor in relation to a whole host of issues, including privatisation, that has led the Australian people to the conclusion that the ALP are not fit to govern because they have gone back on their principles whilst in opposition. 
I commend the bill to the Senate. It is a simple bill. It was looked at by the relevant parliamentary committee as way back as September 2001—12 months ago. Now we have a rush of cheap amendments from Labor and the Greens to try to stall the process yet again. This has been in the public arena now for well over 12 months. The Australian people were aware of it and they got that excited by it that, out of our 19 million fellow Australians, two of our fellow Australians put in submissions to the inquiry— other than the Australian Labor Party and a member of the parliament. This is sound public policy, and I invite the Senate to support the bill.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-08-26,"—I rise tonight to speak on the disgraceful state of disabilities education under the Carr government in New South Wales. Recently, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education began its hearings. In Sydney, the following tragic situation came to light. Imagine yourself in this situation: your daughter is 11 years old and has multiple disabilities which include mild autism and severe chemical allergies; if she walks into a freshly painted classroom she stops breathing. Because this young girl did not fit the requirements to attend a special school in New South Wales she has been attending a comprehensive high school all her life. Due to the lack of state funds, the school finds it very difficult to provide for her special needs and she is often moved from various school situations and environments that often make her ill. Is that an appropriate learning environment for a student? Obviously it is not, given that it has already held her back two years.
There are so many families in our society, a number of which I have spoken to, that must face the day-to-day horror of seeing their child with a disability go off to our state school system with very little recognition and very little support. Many families with children who have a disability spend much of their lives fighting losing battles against state bureaucracies. Often, the community is unaware of the extent of the problem. If your child has a disability it is all a bit hit-and-miss in New South Wales. More than half of New South Wales teachers have absolutely no training in disabilities education—it is really pot luck for the parents and for their children.  
Shedding some light on this important area of education is a current Senate inquiry into the education of children with disabilities which met in Sydney earlier this year. The New South Wales government treated this serious inquiry disgracefully by producing a lousy 3½-page document which did not arrive until the afternoon before the hearings. Are our children with a disability in New South Wales only worth 3½ pages? Given that the New South Wales Department of Education and Training had been aware of this inquiry since late last year, I could not help but expect 3½ pages of gold. What I actually read was waffle. The document contained no facts, no figures, no strategies and no assessment details. The submission was a complete joke. By submitting this inadequate document, the New South Wales government have proved that they are derelict in their duty to provide for the education of these children and for appropriate training for their teachers.
Life has dealt children with disabilities a very difficult life experience, and the last thing they need is for a state government not to exercise a proper duty of care. What the inquiry did hear was clear evidence from groups such as the Australian Parents Council, AUSPELD, Isolated Childrens Parents Association, the Royal Institute of Deaf and Blind Children, the Autism Association of New South Wales, the Australian Association of Special Education and the Australian Guidance and Counselling Association, who gave the true story. They outlined a disturbing picture in New South Wales of the neglect of our children with disabilities. No wonder the Carr government tried to hide the submission from these groups and the situation from our community.
The overwhelming response from all parties has pointed out the following shortcomings in disability services education in New South Wales under the Carr government: no systematic program to test whether children have a disability; virtually no pre-service and in-service training of teachers in the identification of such children and how to teach them; lack of support services for children with disabilities in mainstream classrooms; insufficient coordination in the management of such children when they move between sectors—for example, from preschools to primary schools. Our children with disabilities are being seriously short-changed by the New South Wales state government, which seriously needs to look at its budget priorities.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>New South Wales: Disabilities Education</title>,Adjournment,22,1
