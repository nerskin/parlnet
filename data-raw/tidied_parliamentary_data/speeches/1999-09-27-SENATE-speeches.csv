"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I am disappointed that the minister is not here to hear this important debate, but I am assured by the manager of government business that he will be here shortly.
Senator Ian Campbell interjecting—
—Thank you. I hope you do that quite accurately, Senator Campbell, because if you do it accurately I am sure 
 that the minister will see the strength of the argument that is being presented by the opposition.
I say at the outset that the opposition requests that this particular question be divided because we intend to vote differently on the two key elements of the question. That goes first of all to Senate amendment No. 21, to which the House has disagreed, and House of Representatives amendments Nos 1 and 4, that have been made in place thereof. It is the opposition's intention to vote against that question. And, in relation to the other key element of this particular matter that we are now debating—Senate amendment No. 26, to which the House has disagreed, House of Representatives amendment No. 2, which has been made in place of it and the additional amendment made by the House of Representatives there, which is amendment No. 3—it is the intention of the opposition to support the motion.
This is, as you would be aware, Mr Temporary Chairman Watson, a very important matter for the Senate to give consideration to. There are two key elements here on which I have indicated the opposition will be taking a different approach. The first one relates to the question of assisted voting, the second relates to the amendments and issues that the opposition has been advocating now for a considerable amount of time in relation to strengthening the Electoral Act to deal with vehicles such as the Greenfields Foundation.
Since we last looked at this bill, the  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 , we have a situation where the House of Representatives has, in large measure, accepted the 34 amendments to the bill which were made by the Senate. I think that the amendments that were agreed to in relation to closing the Greenfields Foundation loophole in the act once and for all are going to be very positive in terms of the disclosure provisions of the act. The government has also moved in the House a variation to its radical assisted voting provisions, and these new provisions were drafted back in May this year. I must say that they were drafted at a time when, as I am sure senators would appreciate, the balance in the Senate was a 
 little different from the way we find it today. I would not be at all surprised if they were drafted with the views of Senator Harradine—who made his views clear in the committee—in mind. But, whatever, these are important issues. They certainly have been carefully examined by the committee.
The committee deliberated for some time the question of assisted voting and the marking of ballot papers because these issues raise some very fundamental concerns about the rights of voters. There is the fundamental right of Australians to cast their vote in private, free from interference, free from coercion; that is a basic tenet of our electoral system. And, as a general principle, the opposition believes that a person's right to a free and fair vote should be the paramount motivation in structuring any legislation, with the needs of political parties—whether it be the Labor Party, either of the coalition parties, the Australian Democrats or any other party—of secondary importance.
If proposed changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act in fact compromise this paramount right of the voter, then those sorts of changes should be discarded. Currently, section 234 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act and other related legislation provide that in the case of a voter's sight being impaired—or if they are incapacitated or illiterate—the voter can appoint a person to assist them to carry out their vote. As the Electoral Act currently stands, the voter would just take their voter friend in to assist them to vote. We have always said that this is a very practical way of handling the voting processes. We also think that it is fair and that it preserves the secrecy of an individual's vote. It does not compromise an elector's rights nor in any way compromise the proper functioning of polling booths, particularly busy polling booths.
I want to say that it is pretty clear that the Australian Electoral Commission does not support the government's proposed changes to the Electoral Act in this area. It is quite clear that the Australian Electoral Commission thinks that the current system works well. Currently, it is the voter who has all of the say about who is to assist them. Appropriately, the voter is free to choose someone that 
 they trust. As senators would be aware, this sort of delegation is not unusual under Australian law. Our laws provide for a person to give another person whom they trust the power of attorney in dealing with their affairs. It is well accepted that this system only works when the person appoints someone that they trust to deal with their affairs. It would be ludicrous for anyone to suggest that the delegation should be given to anyone else. But, of course, that is really the bottom line in what the government is proposing here. It is proposing—for such an important community obligation as voting—that a person who is unable, for whatever reason, to fully execute or exercise their right to vote should not control whom they delegate that right and obligation to. The legislation currently being proposed by the government would see that fundamental freedom of the voter taken away.
The government's original amendment proposed a situation where at least four people were in the booth: the voter, their friend, the presiding officer and the scrutineers. That is a pretty intimidating sort of situation, particularly for voters with a disability or with literacy or other language difficulties, and it is certainly not in the spirit of the act, which tries to ensure that a person's vote should be personal and confidential. You would have a situation where a person's secret ballot would be shared by at least three others. If the principle of secret ballots is as important as the conservative parties argue it to be in other areas, you have to ask why the conservative parties are so ready and willing to do away with that important principle in relation to this provision. I think it probably has something to do with pretty cynical political motives. Perhaps they think it will put them back in the running for seats where there are high levels of illiteracy. Perhaps it is because it would be largely the rights of Aboriginal people, disabled people and migrants that would be affected. I would be disappointed but not surprised if that were the motivation.
Unfortunately, the government's proposal seeks to increase the rights of the candidate but diminish the rights of the non-literate, the non-English speaking or the disabled elec 
 tor—and they, of course, are often amongst the most vulnerable people in our community. Perhaps it suits the government's interests to make it even harder for the disadvantaged and the vulnerable in our community to exercise a vote. The proposal the government has now put forward would still have the presiding officer marking the paper, with scrutineers free to observe in some circumstances. It remains a proposal that in our view will pollute the principle of the secret ballot and take rights away from people in our society who are already disadvantaged.
The key problem with the new proposal is that it is not the voter's friend but the presiding officer who would complete the ballot paper. I think this is going to be particularly intimidating for Aboriginal voters in the Northern Territory, in Western Australia and in regional Queensland. In an Aboriginal community the voter's friend is invariably an Aboriginal person, whereas the presiding officer will most likely be a non-Aboriginal person. A situation exists here where explanations and instructions may cross languages and will certainly cross cultures. Intimidation of the voter, conscious or otherwise, could easily occur. There will be three people in the ballot box, rather than two. With the intrusion of the presiding officer, the voter's privacy is compromised—and, with that, the integrity of the ballot is also compromised. With scrutineers present, of course, the problem multiplies further.
Any reasonable person concerned with maintaining the integrity of the process would support an appropriate level of control or supervision by the presiding officer. The opposition argues, as does the AEC, that we currently have a system which provides the appropriate level of control. Indeed, in relation to assisted voting, the AEC's submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters stated:
In relation to ERAB 2, the changes to the assisted voting provisions would represent a significant weakening of the secrecy of the ballot for many disadvantaged members of the community. The AEC is of the view that the current federal legislation relating to assisted voting is operating properly, as the parliament intended, and should be left unamended.  

The current assisted voting provisions, with the voter's friend filling out the ballot paper, work as they are and they ensure the greatest possible participation in the democratic process. There is no reason to change it. It is for those reasons that the opposition will be insisting on omitting all of the provisions of this bill that relate to assisted voting.
To this effect, we will also be moving consequential amendments to remove the other sections of the bill relating to assisted voting. I commend the opposition's approach to the committee and, at a later stage during the committee's deliberations, I wish to canvass the second element of this message that we are debating in relation to the provisions around the Greenfields Foundation.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-27,"—I seek the call briefly because I indicated to Senator Faulkner informally, prior to the commencement of the debate, that the minister would be delayed. I have been informed, while Senator Faulkner was articulately exposing his arguments to the scrutiny of the chamber, that the minister has been further delayed, and may be delayed some time, so I thought I would inform the whole chamber of that. The government will be listening carefully to the arguments and putting on the record our arguments as a proxy for the minister.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-27,"—I thank the government for that explanation. I am sure Senator Campbell will put forward the government's perspective ably. I also am sure, after they have listened to the various arguments put forward, they will take on board some of the concerns raised. I want to speak briefly to the motion that is before the chamber. Firstly, I agree with the approach that Senator Faulkner suggested of splitting the motion. The concerns that the Democrats want to explore as part of this debate relate to the amendments dealing with assisted voting. We are quite happy to support the government's approach in relation to the Greenfields amendments. I want to outline to the chamber the various 
 perspectives that the Democrats believe need to be taken into account and should be explored as part of the debate on assisted voting.
I suppose it is always appropriate to say that when we, as members of parliament, debate an electoral bill, or any component of it—I think I said this in the second reading debate—we are dealing with legislation which intimately affects how we go about getting elected to this place. It can impact on lots of matters relating to the fundamental aspects of the parliamentary, political and electoral process. Obviously, all of us have an interest—in the full sense of the word—in these matters and it is appropriate to highlight that. Despite having looked quite closely at the issue of assisted voting, I find it hard to see how there is much potential electoral benefit to the Democrats, one way or the other, in relation to how things operate at the moment. Certainly, any suggestion of any political advantage one way or the other is, in my view, not relevant from the point of view of the Democrats.
There are a couple of important issues which need to be balanced and explored fully, and they are both fundamental ones. The first is the secrecy of the vote—the secrecy of every person's vote is something that has a long history in Australia—and the second is integrity of the vote, that each voter has a vote cast on their behalf that accurately reflects their wishes and their beliefs. To some extent, this issue has been presented with those two principles being seen in competition with each other. I am not so sure that that is necessarily the case. In many ways, they are complementary principles and the way we approach the whole issue of assisted voting can take both of those principles into account and ensure that they are both met.
Since this matter was last dealt with in the Senate, as part of the broader legislation, I have had the opportunity to explore this specific issue in a lot more detail in my capacity as the Democrat spokesperson on electoral matters and as a representative on the Joint Standing Committee on  Electoral Matters. That committee made two visits to 
 the Northern Territory—to Darwin and Alice Springs. The issue of assisted voting was prominent at both of those public hearings. I have received a number of submissions, both through the committee and privately, on this issue so I certainly feel much better informed to comment on and assess the various arguments being put forward.
The first thing is that this issue does seem to be very much driven by Northern Territory politics. I know it has been raised to some extent in respect of remote South Australia and also North Queensland but the driving force behind it seems to be the Northern Territory. Having been to a couple of those hearings, my main comment on politics in the Northern Territory is that they seem to play it pretty rough up there. It certainly struck me that there is a fairly intense, shall we say, approach taken to the electoral process in the Northern Territory. I guess robust democracy is a good thing but it seems to go a little above that line from my perspective and that is relevant in terms of where this issue is coming from.
It also seems to be almost exclusively focused on perceptions of voting in relation to indigenous people. Obviously, indigenous people are not the only people that utilise assisted voting—significant groups of disabled people and many people of non-English speaking background utilise it. It is curious that it seems to be focusing solely on concerns expressed about the operation of assisted voting when it comes to indigenous people casting their vote but not other people of non-English speaking background in the capital cities, for example. I think that gives some indication of some of the other aspects that may be behind these proposed changes.
The proposals the government has put forward in the House of Representatives on reconsideration of the bill are much preferable to the Democrats than what was initially put forward. We had very great concerns with those. But the fundamental issues that lie behind the operation of the voting process in the Territory, in particular, still need to be explored. The proposal that was being put forward by those who were pushing for changes such as those put forward by the 
 government is that somehow or other the integrity of the ballot may be in doubt because of undue influence or guidance on the part of the voter's friend and that to ensure that there was no undue influence there needed to be scrutineers or more direct involvement of polling officials. When that argument was being put forward, I understood where people were coming from, but the issue also needs to be highlighted from the point of view of the voter being encouraged to participate in the electoral process. That is clearly an issue of great importance, particularly for indigenous people, not just in the Territory but around the country.
On one of the visits that the committee had to the Territory we visited a community in Arnhem Land—Maningrida, I think. Some of the issues and difficulties that have to be addressed on polling day in communities like that were, from my perspective, quite an eye opener, being Brisbane born and bred and not having lived anywhere else. Significant numbers of people pass through polling booths in that area, many of whom go bush for large parts of the year. A wide range of different languages are spoken in the community—there is no one dominant dialect. I think about seven or eight different languages are spoken by different groups of people in that area—people with English as a third or fourth language, if they had it as a language at all. There are difficulties in having people from such a wide range of different cultural backgrounds voting through the one booth on polling day, many of whom may not have been in town or had access to, interest in or connection with any form of media for the vast majority of the year. Trying to ensure that those people are able and comfortable to participate in the voting process is a very important issue.
As I said before, one of the other things that struck me in the Territory is that they certainly seem to play it quite hard there. At one of the booths in particular—but I assess from some of the other evidence that it was not just that one booth—there is what could only be described as a very intimidatory atmosphere. In that sort of circumstance there is a need to ensure that people are comfort 
 able in casting a vote. That they are comfortable in going to a polling booth in the first place is an issue in itself. Their ability to vote being made as easy as possible is something that cannot be undervalued.
The most problematic booth at the last election only existed because of a CLP objection to the Electoral Commission conducting mobile polling around the Aboriginal camps around Alice Springs. The Electoral Commission had to accede to that objection and therefore established a polling booth. That booth then became the subject of a number of incidents which I will not go into here. Suffice it to say that the atmosphere on the day clearly would have been potentially quite intimidatory to people going to cast a vote there. I think the last thing you want to do to people when they do turn up on polling day or when they are considering turning up on polling day is to have them feel like the whole thing is going to be an extremely stressful and unpleasant ordeal.
It is important that many of these places where assisted voting occurs are reasonably small communities. In those sorts of circumstances it is unreasonable to say that secrecy of a vote becomes more important. It is more likely that people are actually going to know presiding officers or polling officials in the booth, and it can be very intimidating to people if they have someone witnessing their vote—or, in the case of the government's proposed amendment, actually filling in their ballot paper for them—and if they are not comfortable with that person knowing how they voted. That is no reflection on the Electoral Commission polling officers; it is just a reality of life.
It should not be underemphasised how awkward it can be for some people to have somebody know how they are voting if they are not wanting them to know. That is the whole point and rationale behind the voter's friend—that they have someone they are comfortable with assisting them to vote, not someone they are not comfortable with. Having someone they are not comfortable with witnessing their vote is more likely to produce an outcome where the integrity of a 
 vote could be called into question. I think those issues do need to be highlighted.
One other issue that I would highlight and that we all need to acknowledge and try to address as a Senate is that—as I understand it, anyway—because of perhaps an oversight when this bill went through the first time, if the Senate insists on its amendment No. 21 relating to assisted voting, we will actually end up with the circumstance where we will have different provisions for assisted voting in the Commonwealth Electoral Act than we will have in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act. That will not particularly be a problem for the referendum in November but, if at another time in the future we do have an election and a referendum occurring on the same day, it will be an absolute nightmare for the Electoral Commission to try to administer different assisted voting provisions for people filling out their voting paper for the referendum from those for the House of Representatives or the Senate.
That is a concern, and I would be interested in comments from other senators about how we should address that particular issue, because that is an anomaly which, if retained, would be potentially a very major problem down the track in terms of the administration of polling day for the Electoral Commission. That is an issue that has to be highlighted and addressed as part of this debate, so that we will not have what appears to be an accidental oversight causing further problems in relation to differing views as to how we proceed on the substantial issue of assisted voting provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I remember that when this issue first came before the Senate some months ago a number of us put fairly substantial arguments before the Senate as to why the status quo should remain. Basically, those positions have not varied today—except that, as Senator Bartlett said, the issue has been considered by the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters and has been subject now to comments by the Australian Electoral Commission. Let me say from the outset that, with all due respect, there are very few senators here in this chamber who have witnessed either what it is like 
 in the week preceding a federal election or the conducting of a ballot on election day in extremely remote communities.
I stand here today actually defending the rights of at least one-third of my constituents to continue to cast their vote in this country in the way that they have done so in preceding years. There is no doubt that, if this act is amended in the way in which the government is seeking to do, there will be fewer people who feel comfortable about casting a vote; there will be fewer people in this country who will actually want to front up to vote on election day. My interests naturally lie with Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, but there are significant numbers of people in this country—and, in particular, in the Northern Territory—who are of Chinese, Greek or Vietnamese origin and who rely on a vote assisted by someone in their own community whom they trust and who can clearly explain to them what the issues are and in fact what candidate is associated with which party.
A single presiding officer is not able to do that. In the Northern Territory, when we have pre-polling in the week preceding the election, as in the case last year, we can go to anywhere from three to five communities in any one day. You get on and off light aircraft from dawn till dusk and you have sometimes no more than, or not even, an hour—or, at the most, two hours—in some places, for anywhere between two and 400 Aboriginal people to cast their vote, on a day when you and I have 12 hours to do it. So we are talking about a very concentrated time frame here. To the Australian Electoral Commission's credit, they are able to get to all of those remote places, particularly in the Territory—I do not have knowledge of Queensland or Western Australia—and, to their credit, they are able to ensure that as many people as possible get to vote preceding the election or on election day.
What we as members of parliament ought to be about is ensuring that we enable more and more people to vote and that any changes we make to the Electoral Act ensure that people are comfortable about voting and feel that their vote is fair and that they have a free vote. I find it very difficult to actually explain 
 to people how frustrating it can be if English is in fact your third or fourth language and how reliant people in remote communities are on getting people they know who understand their language, or even perhaps who have the right kinship relationship to them, and taking them in to vote.
In all the times that I have been in remote communities at polling time, I have never seen the assisted voter provision rorted or manipulated to the detriment of either party. You see, when somebody who is not an English speaking person walks into a polling booth to cast their vote, their assisting voter is able to clearly explain to them which parties are standing and whom the candidates are. But I have seen in Aboriginal communities presiding officers—who are mainly white males that fly out from Darwin—say to Aboriginal people, `Do you want to vote Labor or Liberal?' They do not understand that. Some people might; some people might understand `Australian Labor Party' or `Liberal Party'. In the Northern Territory, we do not have the Liberal Party; we have the Country Liberal Party. I have seen presiding officers hold up how-to-votes and say to them, `Do you want to vote this way or that way?' If you cannot read or write English, sometimes a how-tovote card does not help you either.
So what question does a presiding officer actually ask the voter to elicit the response that is necessary for them to clearly understand how they, as the presiding officer, will cast that person's vote? An assistant voter may well be somebody within the family who is literate in Aboriginal and English. It may well be somebody in the community who has been, on behalf of ATSIC, teaching Aboriginal people how to vote. It may well be a teacher or an Aboriginal health worker—or one of a number of people in that community—whom that person knows and feels comfortable about casting their vote in front of.
That is what assisted voting should be about. It should be about ensuring that your vote remains secret between you and somebody you trust. If a presiding officer has to be the one and only person who fills in your ballot paper, then the secrecy of your ballot becomes irrelevant and something that most 
 people, even if you are not a migrant, disabled or Aboriginal, would feel uncomfortable about.
Senator Faulkner alluded to some comments by the Australian Electoral Commission which I think are pertinent here. These are the people who know best about what happens in a polling booth. In a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on 12 March this year the Australian Electoral Commission said that they are of the view that the federal legislation relating to assisted voting is operating properly as the parliament originally intended and should be left unamended. The AEC themselves can see no reasons why this legislation should be changed.
They have searched and I have searched for any cases or any substantial evidence that has been brought before the AEC that would show us or convince me that this legislation needs to be changed. There has never ever, so the AEC have informed me, been a single substantiated allegation of impropriety or electoral fraud concerning assisted voting. So if we do not have any evidence before us that the current system is not working properly, then you have to ask yourself: why is the government seeking to change this?
Coming from the Northern Territory, and I concur with some of the comments from Senator Bartlett, there is only one reason why we are seeking to change this. It is based on the premise that an informed vote by an Aboriginal member of our community for the Liberal Party is a good vote, is an informed vote; but if a non-literate Aboriginal person decides to vote for the Labor Party, it is construed as being a manipulative vote. We can cut to the quick here. We all know the arguments about fair voting and free voting and the secrecy of your vote. But let us face it: at the end of the day, people from this government, particularly people from the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, believe that an assisted vote is a manipulative vote on behalf of Aboriginal people which therefore translates to a vote for the Labor Party.
It is about sour grapes on behalf of people in the CLP in the Northern Territory. It is 
 about them not being able to attract the majority of votes from Aboriginal people for their own political party. If that is the case, then there is some belief that Aboriginal people are not electorally aware of the issues when it comes to election day. They are well and truly aware of the issues. When Aboriginal people go to vote they know exactly whom they want to vote for. Sometimes they need to relay that to people who understand their language as opposed to a presiding officer who would not. They may need some clarification—and, by and large, in the last election of the Northern Territory 80 per cent or more of people voted for the Labor Party—as to where they would put No. 1 on their ballot paper so it translates into a vote for the Labor Party person. But, by and large, once they have had that assistance they know very well whom they want to vote for.
Let me leave you in no doubt whatsoever that the changes to this system are about ensuring fewer people in the Northern Territory get a vote, which in reality translates to fewer people in Aboriginal communities voting for the Labor Party. This will ensure that this government minimises as much as possible the votes in the Northern Territory with respect to Labor Party votes from Aboriginal people.
The amendments that we have considered are based on submissions by the Country Liberal Party to the inquiry on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, an inquiry that was conducted into the 1998 federal election. The CLP submission to that committee also accuses the Australian Electoral Commission of collusion and overt political action, but there is no evidence of any of that and there is no evidence, as I said before, of any impropriety or fraud concerning the use of the assistant voter. This is purely and simply about a political party making changes to the Electoral Act for its political gain. If that is the case, then the motivation for restructuring this legislation to accord with the whims of a political party makes this a sad day in relation to what we have held up to be a fair and free voting system within this country. 
In the Northern Territory nearly 27.3 per cent of our population are indigenous but only two per cent of the population in the rest of the country are indigenous. The literacy levels in the Northern Territory are the worst in Australia. Our school retention rates are abysmally low. Of those indigenous people who attempt secondary education only nine per cent complete their education compared to 54½ per cent of non-indigenous people. So we are talking about not only people who have second and third languages—Aboriginal languages before English—but also people who are not literate in the English language, and of course ballot papers are presented only in English.
Under this proposed scenario we have not got just two people in the ballot box, that is, the person wanting to vote plus the assisting voter—an assisting voter is the person whom they choose to assist them filling out the ballot paper—but we now have the presiding officer in the ballot box. And not only that, but the very first question the presiding officer will ask the voter is: do you want a scrutineer? What does that mean? Do you want someone else to watch you vote? No, thank you, not if I have a choice. So we could have a situation where we may even have four other people in the booth besides the voter. Under the current legislation we have only two people in the booth and that second person is only there at the invitation of the voter, whereas under the proposed changes to the legislation once that voter decides to bring a person in to help them then the presiding officer must fill in the ballot paper.
We have no evidence that the assisting voter has never recorded a vote in the way in which the voter wants it to happen. We have no evidence of that. So we ask ourselves, `Oh, yes, if the presiding officer fills in the ballot paper, then we have at least some guarantee that they may well record the vote impartially. They may well record what the voter actually wants.' There is no guarantee of that. There is no more a guarantee about that than there is that the assisting voter would fill in the ballot paper correctly.
If you cannot guarantee that the changes you are suggesting will improve what is 
 happening, then leave the current scheme alone. We do not have any evidence that the current system relates to fraud or is up for any impropriety. We do not have any evidence that the current system disadvantages people from voting, but we do know from our experiences of being in the bush that, when people do conduct their ballot and do try to cast their vote, the system you are proposing will disadvantage them and is entirely unfair.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,1999-09-27,"—The legislative changes to the Electoral and Referendum Act proposed by the government are essentially to remove the current provision which allows people who are sight impaired, physically incapacitated or illiterate to select the person whom they wish to assist them. Currently, the voter decides whom they want to assist them. Appropriately, the voter is free to choose someone they trust. The provision is intended to preserve for these people the closest approximation to a secret vote. The principle is that the person who knows how an assisted person votes is someone that that person trusts. The legislative changes currently being proposed would see that principle being abandoned. If this proposal becomes law, detrimental and radical changes will occur in the provision of assistance to some voters.
The amendment proposed seeks to remove the ability for the person with the incapacity to select their assistance and directs the presiding officer to complete the ballot paper on their behalf. The result of the amendment would see a voter with a disability presenting to the polling booth. They might have someone with them, and the amendment will allow for that friend to accompany them through the process. The voter will request assistance in casting a vote. The presiding officer will then have to ask the voter if they wish to have scrutineers present to oversee the marking of the ballot paper. If the voter indicates that they would, then the presiding officer will invite scrutineers to witness that vote. There would be at least three people in the booth but, as we have heard, there could quite possibly be many, many more.
If the voter does not have a friend with them, then the presiding officer will then 
 request another polling official to witness the vote for his or her protection. Under this proposal, Australian voters will have to vote in the presence of people whom they may not want to see their vote. We will not have to do this, but plenty of other voters in Australia will, and they will be people who are visually impaired or people who are not literate in English—typically migrants and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Just consider the sheer ludicrousness of it. In many circumstances, the voter's friend is there because the voter communicates better in a language other than English. The instructions from the voter to their friend will be conducted in a language that potentially the presiding officer will not understand—whether it be Greek, Vietnamese or Wik—at the conclusion of which the friend will tell the presiding officer what square to mark.
What has been achieved? If the government is arguing that you cannot trust a voter's friend to accurately carry out the wishes of the voter who needs assistance, how on earth will the presiding officer actually know that? What is even more absurd in this whole debate is the fact that, currently, as the act stands right now, if an assisted voter prefers it, he or she can seek help from the presiding officer on a polling day and ask the presiding officer to vote for them—that is, as the act currently stands, the voter has a right to take the government's preferred method of assisted voting. If the government's plan for assisted voting is so sensible and non-controversial, then why make the changes at all? Surely voters would vote with their feet and simply take advantage of the existing provision.
The fact is that people who want assistance to vote choose to use a friend to cast their vote in private, out of sight of the polling officials and presiding officers and certainly out of the sight of party scrutineers. Like you and me, they hold the principle of the secret ballot dear. They often live in a small community where the presiding officer and the polling officials are known to them. Officials who conduct the poll are invariably the local teacher, the school principal, the nurse or the council clerk. People do not necessarily want those people knowing how they vote, and 
 neither do those people want to know how the voter is voting. It can put them in an awkward situation and leave them open to suspicion and resentment.
In fact, a letter to me from the President of the Queensland Teachers Union, Mr Ian Mackie, says as much. He says:
Implicit in the proposed changes is an assertion that, in the past, our members have acted irresponsibly or illegally. I find no evidence of this and hence reject totally the implication.
To suggest that supporting voters is a role for the Presiding Officer clearly breaches the confidentiality of their vote. The voter seeks a friend to maintain their confidentiality. If the Presiding Officer has a role in this voting, large numbers of voters will decide not to vote as their right to seek confidential assistance is denied.
To suggest that the voter cannot exercise discretion over their choice of electoral `friend' is extremely patronising.
In the face of these concerns, concerns which the government is very well aware of, why then is the government so intent on pursuing these amendments? Is it that the Association for the Blind is requesting that there be changes, or the disability advocacy groups, the migrant community, Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders? In my research into submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I have not found a single submission from any of these groups complaining about the current provisions. But I have found transcripts of coalition members who have raised the matter, and I think their motivation is not to improve access to the electoral process but to limit access by the most disadvantaged group of Australians there is.
This sort of contribution fits with my experience in Far North Queensland. In the area where I live, Liberal and National Party candidates have complained about assistance given to Aboriginal voters in every election that I am aware of since 1992. After every election, Liberal and National Party candidates cast a slur on the conduct of polling officials and AEC officers, Labor Party scrutineers and, most importantly, indigenous people, alleging inappropriate activity. But where do they raise these matters? Not through a complaint to the AEC, not through 
 a submission to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Matters; they raise these matters in the media, and only after the Labor Party requests that the matters go through the appropriate methods of investigation, do the complainants sometimes refer these matters.
Not once, not ever have these complaints been upheld. They have been investigated by the AEC or the QEC on three occasions and the result is always the same. There is no basis for the allegations and the AEC staff and the people of Cape York Peninsula are cleared. But the purpose of the Liberal and National parties has been served; they have had the headlines of `rorting', `dirty election tricks' and `misconduct', for example, on page 1 of the newspaper. They have raised the issue in the community's mind. As you would expect, the article which eventually reports that these allegations have been found to be baseless appears on page 7 or somewhere later in the paper, as it is not that interesting to report that there has been no basis for the claim.
I would like to provide the Senate with the facts surrounding the most recent example of the Liberal Party's orchestrated campaign to devalue the voting rights of Aboriginal people on Cape York Peninsula. Predictably, the day following the last election, the member for Leichhardt, Mr Warren Entsch, contacted the Cairns media—not the AEC—alleging misconduct in the conduct of the poll at a number of Aboriginal communities, including the community of Napranum, an Aboriginal community near Weipa. He advised that he had serious concerns about the conduct of the poll which were communicated to him by the Liberals' scrutineer at Napranum. These allegations were denied by the individuals named by Mr Entsch in statutory declarations.
The investigation by the AEC was finally requested by Mr Entsch, after my urging, some weeks later and, finally, on 9 December 1998 there was a small item on page 7 of the Cairns Post which reported that the Australian Electoral Commission inquiry found that the workers had not breached the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. In that same article Mr Entsch is quoted as saying that he did not accept the findings of the inquiry—although 
 I do not know how he was going to accept it—and reiterated his spurious claims. It is also interesting that senators note that the Liberal Party scrutineer in this case, the woman who made the allegation, was a Sandy Mulley, who is the partner of Robin Buchan, the then part owner of Cape York Concrete, known to this chamber on another matter.
We need to see the behaviour of Mr Entsch and others before him for what it is; it is an orchestrated campaign to intimidate the indigenous people of Cape York Peninsula and question their intent. It is also intended to denigrate those who assist voters who do not have English as their first language. I raise these issues because this legislation has exactly the same intent: to intimidate the indigenous people of Australia and to denigrate those who assist voters who do not have English as their first language.
This legislation is pandering to the unfounded suspicions of conservative candidates who just cannot quite believe that Aboriginal people vote exactly like everyone else, on the basis of what is in it for them, their families and their communities. They do not accept that Aboriginal voters reject candidates and parties on the basis of their policies and presentation at a local level. We are in danger of creating policy, of setting the guidelines for voting, to quell the unfounded paranoia of parties and candidates, not on what surely must be the most fundamental rationale of the Electoral Act—the rights of voters, irrespective of where they live, their culture or their literacy in English, to a free, fair and, most importantly, secret ballot.
As I have suggested, this matter has not been brought to public attention by those who are affected, the people who are blind, migrants or indigenous people. In fact, in a letter from Wayne Connolly, the Chair of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council, he says:
For many Aboriginal people who speak a traditional language as their first language and/or are elderly, it is important to have a trusted family member or friend assist them to vote. The provision of a Presiding Officer to assist elderly Aboriginal people is inappropriate for a number of reasons. Firstly, the Presiding Officer may be new to the community and unfamiliar with the traditional language spoken or cultural expressions used. 

Secondly, if the presiding officer is familiar with the community, the Aboriginal person voting may want their political choice to remain confidential. Overall, the removal of the `voter's friend' provision in the legislation will make the whole voting process more difficult. Therefore, this proposed amendment is in principle undermining democracy.
That letter is from the Chair of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council in Queensland, which represents every Aboriginal community in our state. Can I suggest to you that he is correct? In principle this legislation fundamentally is undermining democracy.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-27,"—I rise to outline, firstly, what has taken place in relation to this legislation. Perhaps I can deal with the more technical aspects first. In relation to the previous bill, a number of amendments were passed by the Senate. When the bill was returned to the other place, the government did not accept them and proposed amendments in their place.
The government moved that the House not agree to an amendment which dealt with financial matters as it was felt that it had unintended application to certain loans and to loans from certain entities. In particular, there was uncertainty over the treatment of credit card debt and concern that credit providers, such as American Express and Aussie Home Loans, were not included in the definition of financial institutions. To correct these deficiencies, government amendment No. 2, which we have here today, provides—
—Minister, I do not think you are quite on the amendments before the Senate.
—No. This is background and introduction as to how we come to be at this point.
—The question has been divided into two parts: amendments (21) and (26).
—In that case, I will still provide this by way of introduction.
Senator Forshaw interjecting—
—For the benefit of the chamber and those listening, I am outlining 
 the difference we have with the issue at hand and the other issues which are not in contention. I was shortly to conclude on the aspects which were not in contention. There is a difference here. We have assisted voting, some financial matters and some other technical matters. We have treated them in a discrete fashion by putting some to one side and dealing with the other in this particular debate, and that is assisted voting, which I will now deal with if I am allowed to.
There is no hidden agenda on the part of the government in this situation. The government is proposing something which is fair. When this matter was last before the Senate, there was an anomaly, in that there is a difference between the provisions for a referendum and an election insofar as assisted voting is concerned. The government is proposing that there be a system which pervades both a referendum and an election and that the assisted voting provisions be the same. When one looks at the proposals put forward by the government as opposed to what the opposition is saying, there is not much difference. I reject totally the allegations by the opposition that we are attempting to disenfranchise voters who are incapacitated or indigenous voters or to make life more difficult for them in relation to how to vote. When you analyse the step by step process, you can see that there is a great deal of similarity between what we are proposing and what is in existence at the moment.
Firstly, the voter must satisfy the presiding officer that he or she needs assistance. That remains unchanged. The question then is how that person is to be assisted. We are proposing that the person then has a choice as to how the procedure will be conducted. That is identical to the current situation. A friend can accompany that voter when they vote. That situation is the same; there is no difference. The only difference is who fills out the ballot paper. At the moment, a voter can attend with a friend and say, `I want my friend to fill in the ballot paper for me.' The government are proposing that that person could still attend with the friend; the difference is that, while the friend could be present, the presiding officer would fill out the ballot paper.
The opposition obviously does not trust the role of the presiding officer. The opposition is saying that this opens up a Pandora's box of all sorts of abuse, but it does not. The assistance can still be provided to the voter by the friend, but an impartial assistance is provided by the presiding officer, whom we trust to run the polling booth and to conduct things squarely and properly. The voter is under no sanction or force to have scrutineers present. If scrutineers are present, they can attend but only if the voter agrees. Where is the coercion? Where is the problem with that? If the voter wants those scrutineers to be present, why can't they have them present?
Let us now look at the flip side. The matter has been raised that, by having the presiding officer present—who is most probably a local person—it is no longer a secret ballot. But the current system is not a secret ballot, because it is up to the friend to fill in the ballot paper, and that friend would know how the voter voted. One could say that a friend is in a different position because the voter would not mind a friend being there. But you have to look at the situation in view of peer group pressure and the possibility of external pressure whereby someone might say to a voter, `You're going to take this friend in with you.' That is always a possibility, and the government believe that possibility should be absolutely excluded. It can be excluded by having the presiding officer fill in the ballot paper.
We trust the presiding officer to run affairs at the booth. That presiding officer is in charge. Why can't they fill in the ballot paper in the presence of a friend? A friend can still give assistance, in the presence of the presiding officer, to the voter. That makes it abundantly fair. It does not detract in any way from the assistance that is being given to the voter. People who question this process must be questioning the integrity of the presiding officer. I wonder why people who question this process are so intent on only the friend being present, because there is no diminution in the secrecy or the integrity of the ballot by having the presiding officer there. Those who question this process leave the way open for external forces to dictate to a voter who the friend is who may accompany them.
Remember, you are dealing with a voter who is at a disadvantage. The wording of the bill is that `the voter is so physically incapacitated or illiterate'—or the voter's sight is so impaired—`that the voter is unable to vote without assistance'. Quite reasonably, a number of voters who are disadvantaged would fall into these categories. Why not have the presiding officer fill in the ballot paper for them in the presence of their friend if they so wish and in the presence of scrutineers if they so wish? It is all a question of choice but, at the end of the day, at least we have an umpire in the polling booth who knows that no undue influence is being exercised upon that disadvantaged voter.
So I reject entirely the suggestion that there is any attempt by the government here to thwart the process—in fact, it is quite the contrary. These amendments came about as a result of the debate in this chamber when this matter was last before the Senate. It was as a result of that debate that the other place took on these amendments and modified them. I note that, when assisted voting was first proposed by the government, the opposition's position was that they were going to agree to it, and then there was a change in their position. We have come back with a modified position which the opposition still do not agree to. One can only wonder how far the opposition want the government to go in this respect. I might also point to the fact that the submission by the Electoral Commission—which was put before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on 12 March this year—pointed to the experience at Tangentyere polling booth in the Northern Territory during the 1998 federal election. That submission stated:
The Northern Territory legislation provides that, if a person needs an assisted vote, then the presiding officer or another official directed by the presiding officer may assist the voter in full view of political party and candidate scrutineers.
What the AEC was doing, I would suggest, was pointing to that as a desirable practice, and what we are doing here is similar to that. We are providing that a presiding officer be present to make sure that everything is done properly and there is no undue influence exercised on the voter.
I commend this provision to the chamber. It is desirable that both the electoral legislation and the referendum legislation have the same provisions for assisted voting so that, at the end of the day, we do not have a discrepancy. I would inquire of the opposition whether they are satisfied that their proposal does result in this.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-27,"—I am also interested in the answer to the question that the minister just proposed because, as I said previously, it is an important issue.
I would like to again briefly respond on this matter on behalf of the Democrats. I do think it is worth acknowledging that the proposal that the government has put forward here has taken on board and sought, I believe, genuinely to address some of the concerns that were raised when the matter was first debated earlier this year. I acknowledge and recognise that and, to that extent, I think it has been a genuine attempt to try to find some middle ground. I think the point still needs to be made, from the point of view of the Democrats, that to make a change, particularly in an area like this which obviously is sensitive, you need to demonstrate that it is not working adequately now. I think that is a fundamental point. I have not seen—despite having attended, as I said before, a couple of electoral matters committee hearings where there was some quite forceful evidence put forward from various sides of the issue—any concrete evidence of manipulation occurring. I suppose that the advocates of this change would say that that is why you need scrutineers: so that you can get concrete evidence. But I think, to make a change in an area as significant as this, you need to have more specific evidence.
There are a few other points that I would emphasise. Clearly, the proposed change, even in its modified form, does not have the support of indigenous groups. While, in practice, assisted voting applies to people much more broadly than just those in indigenous groups, the political momentum behind this change is clearly related to perceptions about the voting of indigenous people and the involvement of people of non-English speaking backgrounds—and, particularly, indigen 
 ous people—in the electoral process. I believe all parties and Australian society should recognise it as important that we maximise the involvement of indigenous people in our electoral process as much as possible. Changes may be made that indigenous organisations do not support, and the example read out by Senator McLucas before highlighted that it clearly does not have the support of the Aboriginal Coordinating Council in Queensland. From representations made to me in evidence to the committee, it appears that it does not have the support of indigenous groups in the Territory either.
The coalition may say, `Well, all those indigenous groups are just Labor Party fronts'—and they would say that, wouldn't they?—but, speaking from the Democrats' point of view, I put a lot more store in the integrity and independence of all community organisations, including the vast majority of indigenous organisations, to be quite able to separate issues like that. I believe it is insulting to indigenous organisations—I am not saying that the government have given that insult—but any comments like that, I think, would be an insult to the integrity of indigenous organisations. The minister, in his contribution, suggested that opponents to this were actually making some negative reflection on the integrity of polling officials—that they could not be trusted to fill in the ballot paper properly, or something like that. I think that is a complete misrepresentation of what motivates the concerns of those who are opposed to this change. It is not so much a matter of the integrity of the polling officer that is of concern; it is a matter of the voter being able to know who fills out that ballot paper.
That is one of the two fundamental changes that are being proposed—that is, who will fill out the voters' ballot paper. Previously, the voter could choose who would fill it out; now, they cannot. That is a big difference, and it should not be underestimated, particularly when you are dealing with people who are not comfortable with the voting process. It also opens up the prospect for other people to scrutinise their vote as well. While the strong implication in the changes that are 
 being put forward here is that the scrutineers will be able to watch only on invitation—an invitation only arrangement; one pictures that and it sounds nice and genteel: the scrutineers will sit in their chair in the corner, a polling official will put the question somewhere else and then they will go and tap the scrutineers on the shoulder and they will come across the room—I think how that would work in practice would be very different.
From the evidence provided to the committee, the one polling booth in the Territory was a very small room, a very small space—too small, and I hope that will be addressed next time—into which four or five scrutineers from the CLP, plus scrutineers from the ALP, plus two issuing officers had been squeezed. Clearly, the voters felt that the presence of some of those CLP people was intimidating. Clearly, that atmosphere was massively intimidating. In the reality of circumstances such as these, where scrutineers are trying to get in and scrutinise every single assisted vote, the operation of this provision would mean polling officials being forced to beat scrutineers off with a stick all day long. Clearly, on the evidence from booth officials about how that booth operated last time, that would be the reality of such circumstances.
The degree of assisted voting in some booths is enormous with more than 50 per cent of voters being assisted to vote. Therefore, it is also worth emphasising that this provision would add significantly to the load of presiding officers or polling officials. Again, the government may say that is an indication of abuse of the system; I do not think it is at all. But in the case where the assisted vote comes to more than 50 per cent, half the votes or more on that day would have to be filled in by the polling officer or officers. They would be up and down all day. They would spend their whole day in the polling booth, and half of their time would be spent in beating off with a stick the scrutineers who, because they would be convinced of some great rort going on, would be wanting to witness it all. That is the reality of how it would work.
For all those factors, I believe it really must be demonstrated that there is a problem with 
 the current system—that it is not working, that there is manipulation happening—and there is no concrete evidence of that. Certainly I believe that the minister, in quoting from the Electoral Commission's submission, drew an incorrect inference. He quoted from a submission that spoke of the current situation as it is under Northern Territory law. From my reading of the submission, that was simply a piece of information where the Electoral Commission was saying, `Well, this is how things operate at the Territory level.' I certainly did not read that as an endorsement of how things operate at the Territory level. Indeed, the original Electoral Commission's submission specifically says that it believes the current system works well and does not need changing.
For all of those reasons, I believe that it is not appropriate to support this change. The Democrats will be voting that the chamber does insist on these amendments. However, again, I would say that I do recognise that the government has moved a long way from its initial amendments which basically were to change things to reflect the Territory approach—and I think that clearly was unsatisfactory. But they still present problems. They still will add to the number of indigenous people in the Territory—but not just in the Territory—who will feel less comfortable about voting. That is not a desirable outcome, even if the majority of them do vote for the ALP and not for the Democrats—although I wish they all did vote for the Democrats, but they do not. But I am not about trying to change the electoral laws so that only people who have the wisdom and insight to vote for the Democrats have the incentive to vote.
This is probably worth also pointing out as a bit of an aside. It concerns the particular booth that was the source of such antagonism from the CLP with the number of scrutineers that were provided. I am sure that the last thing the CLP is interested in is gratuitous advice from me, but I believe that booth was one of the very few booths in the country where the CLP or Liberal vote was actually lower than the Democrat vote. On that day the CLP put huge resources into that booth, including—as I understand it, for most of the 
 day—senior members of the Northern Territory parliament. But the CLP could have had those people stationed at larger booths with much stronger CLP support bases, and I think it needs to reassess its strategy at polling places in the Territory. But I know that is not an issue of interest to the minister, and I make those comments more as an aside.
I appreciate the efforts to which the government has gone to find common ground on this particular issue. But the Democrats still believe that the change is not necessary and that it still presents problems. So we believe that the chamber should insist on its amendments—although, again, I would be keen to get clarification from Senate Faulkner that the opposition's foreshadowed amendments will lead us to a situation where we do have consistency between the Electoral Act and the referendum act.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I am very happy to give that assurance to the committee. My understanding is that the consequential amendments that have been foreshadowed in my name ensure that there will be identical provisions now with the Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act. If the minister has had any other advice, he should present it to the committee, but that is certainly my clear understanding.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-09-27,"—There are a number of things that I very briefly want to point out before we perhaps come to a conclusion on this. This is not about questioning the integrity of the presiding officer; this is about making sure that the voter feels comfortable about the way in which they cast their vote.
Minister, you talked about a local person usually being the presiding officer. In fact, they are not. In the Northern Territory—and this is where it is disappointing that senior bureaucrats who provide you with advice, I would say, have never been in the Northern Territory either on polling day or the week preceding polling day—presiding officers fly in and out from Darwin. They are usually people who put their hand up for an extra day's work during that week. They are not 
 local people, and that contributes an enormous amount of difficulty to this situation. You think that such a small change to the act has limited consequences, but it does not. It has enormous consequences. By and large, as I have said in a previous speech, they are white males. By and large, they are not people that Aboriginal people feel comfortable with. They are not within their skin group; they do not understand their language. Most of them do not have any kind of cross-cultural training. They do the best job that they possibly can, but they are not local people.
 The other difficulty—and Senator Bartlett alluded to this—is if the presiding officer is the person who must fill in the ballot paper. I have given you examples before of how we go to two or three communities in any one day. I have been at places where 500 people have only two hours to vote. As a citizen of Australia you do not incur that. You clearly know that election day is going to be all day on a particular Saturday. A lot of Aboriginal people in the Territory are given this timetable: `Your community is Monday afternoon from 1 to 3 o'clock' or `Your community will be Tuesday morning from 8 to 10 o'clock.' They have a limited time. It is not on the same national day as everybody else enjoys. And now you are telling us that a presiding officer will have to fill in their ballot paper.
The result will be that the Electoral Commission will need to spend longer periods of time in those communities. More than 50 per cent of those people usually need an assisted vote. If the presiding officer is going to be the one and only person who can fill in that vote, the commission will need to spend longer time in those communities. It will need to reschedule the whole way in which the federal ballot process is conducted in places like the Northern Territory. It will not be able to fit in the number of communities that it does at the moment. The presiding officer will be extremely busy in filling out ballot papers as well as presiding over the conduct of the booth.
I put it to you, Minister, that there is a severe lack of understanding about what that will mean in terms of resourcing communities to enable these people to have the same 
 amount of time that they have now to vote. I can see what is going to happen: the Electoral Commission will be forced to schedule fewer communities that it will visit or to schedule a significant decrease in the amount of time it spends in the communities. Not only will people not feel encouraged to vote but they will probably have less opportunity to do so, because either the Electoral Commission will not be able to stay in the communities as long as it does now or it will not go to the same number of communities that it does now.
While it may seem like a very simple change in your eyes, we are trying to ensure that people in vastly different remote parts of this country and in the isolated communities that the Electoral Commission now gets to will continue to be able to vote this way in the future. But that will not be possible unless you can convince me that the Electoral Commission will start pre-polling two weeks before the election and unless you can guarantee that it will spend the same amount of time in the same number of communities. Under the government's proposal, with the presiding officer filling in more than 50 per cent of the votes in each of those communities, that will simply not be possible.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-27,"—There are some matters which I cannot let pass without comment. There has been a statement that, in some mobile polling booths, two hours has been allotted for some 500 people to vote. If there is any misunderstanding that the AEC has a principle of having two hours there and if those 500 people who are queuing up cannot get through in two hours then the rest miss out, then I want to correct that misunderstanding. My advice from the AEC is that if 500 people have arrived to vote, then vote they will; if they have to be assisted, they will; and any two-hour proposed timing will not have any effect.
My own experience working on a booth in the desert east of Kalgoorlie at Cundelee Mission was that we dealt with the people there until everyone had been processed. I want to make absolutely sure there is no misunderstanding that the AEC would say, `We have 500 people and two hours, and bad 
 luck if we don't get through them all in two hours.'
—That has happened.
—I hear Senator Crossin commenting and my advice is that that is not the case. Can I further say in relation to assistance that the AEC would do whatever it needed to do in assisting voters. The provisions that the government is putting forward would not in any way hinder or impede the process of carrying out voting in mainstream Australia or remote Australia for that matter.
If I can touch on another aspect: Senator Crossin rejected my comments on the presiding officer being a local person. I was only responding to Senator McLucas's comment that one of the problems about having a presiding officer fill in the vote was that the presiding officer would be from the local community and thereby would know how the person voted. My reply in rebuttal of that was that the friend would be in exactly the same situation. The presiding officer is a professional, a person who faces a heavy sanction if they divulge the knowledge of how a person voted or if they interfere in any way with the process. I am saying that you cannot get any better person than the presiding officer to assist in these cases, because the presiding officer has charge of the polling booth.
If you attack the proposal that we are making in relation to assistance being rendered by the presiding officer, then one must question whether you have faith in the presiding officer. That is why I raised that very point about the question of integrity in this process. We are saying that you do not give the marking of the ballot paper to anybody else; you give it to the presiding officer. And, of course, that is only in the situation where the voter is so incapacitated that assistance is required. Those two aspects have to be clarified.
There was also some comment earlier about scrutineers being present. I remind the committee of the three combinations under our proposal: you can have the presiding officer, the voter and a friend; or you can have the presiding officer, the voter and a scrutineer; or you can have the presiding officer, the 
 voter and another polling official where there is no scrutineer or friend available. Those are the combinations. I would ask the Democrats to bear in mind that there is no question of allowing a situation where scrutineers have to be beaten off with a stick, so to speak.
I can understand Senator Bartlett's concerns and I know that he has seriously considered this issue. But I think it is very important that, for the record, these situations are made very clear. The government is not trying to thwart any process at all. It has taken on board constructive comments made in the debate when this matter was last before the committee and has come back in a genuine attempt to resolve the situation. The government would say that these proposals go further in relation to helping those voters who are incapacitated and in need of assistance or in remote areas.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill), to questions without notice asked by Senators Faulkner and Cooney today, relating to Australia's role in East Timor.
Last week, readers of the Bulletin  magazine were treated to the bizarre spectacle of the newly formed Howard doctrine of Australia's relations with our Asian neighbours being outlined. Australians were informed that the Prime Minister had decided that henceforth Australia will be acting in a sort of deputy peacekeeping capacity in our region to the global policeman role of the US. I gather the Prime Minister is already backsliding away from the so-called Howard doctrine. He started that process in question time in the House of Representatives today.
This must be the quickest ever repudiation of an Australian foreign policy doctrine in history. What is clear is that the new doctrine was the product of John Howard himself. It was utterly insular. It was demonstrating a craving to wear the deputy's badge to the international John Wayne figure, the United States. But the Prime Minister fails to realise that we are not dealing with a 1950s Saturday afternoon matinee with the good guys in the white hats. Australia's relations with its neighbours are infinitely more complex, difficult and important than that.
The Prime Minister would understand that if only he had consulted with his professional advisers before announcing his Deputy Dawg doctrine, things would be very different today. But he did not consult, did he? Admiral Barrie made it absolutely clear yesterday that he had not been consulted on the doctrine. He is only Chief of the Australian Defence Force—surely you would have thought that was the sharp end of the deputy sheriff role. A former senior diplomat, Mr Tony Kevin, indicated this morning on ABC Radio that it was clear to him that the Howard government does not see long-term policy development as a valid role for the foreign affairs professionals in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Mr Kevin went on to say:
To me, that is an enormously dangerous doctrine. What the government does not seem to understand 
 is that foreign policy is not a hobby you do in your spare time. It is actually part of your national security policy.
Over the past few days, the Howard doctrine has been panned and parodied by many experts and commentators. Dr Harold Crouch from the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies warns  that we need to keep our aspirations in perspective. We are not and never will be the leader of South-East Asia. Greg Sheridan noted in the Australian  that casting us as the US deputy in the region is also about the most demeaning characterisation of ourselves that you could conjure up.
How did Owen Harries, one of the leading foreign affairs commentators in Washington and a former adviser to Malcolm Fraser when Prime Minister, describe the Howard doctrine? He said, `He's a fool.' Doesn't this very accurate description of Prime Minister Howard's approach to foreign relations hold water no matter where you look? The Howard doctrine ignored intelligence warnings about East Timor, held out on involving the United States economic lever until it was too late and even raised the prospect of national service last night. That is the Howard doctrine, and it is no wonder the Prime Minister has just started to backslide in question time in the House of Representatives today. It is the shortest lived foreign policy doctrine in world history, and so it should be.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>East Timor: Foreign Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-09-27,"—Australian foreign policy is best demonstrated by action rather than words. If we look at the role Australia is playing now within our region in very difficult circumstances, we will find—as I suggested in question time—a contribution towards peace and security which makes most Australians proud. Most Australians—but not this opposition, who are still living in the illusions of past government—believe that we have taken up our responsibility in a way that was needed and which they recognise and appreciate. It has not been an easy situation. It could never be an easy situation for an Australian government to put forces into a situation of danger. But, in all the circumstances in this instance, we believe such action was demanded. 
What has been picked up was an expression used by a journalist in an article which sought to characterise our role in these circumstances as in some way acting as a deputy for the United States. While one can understand how a journalist might come to describe it in such a way, it is invalid. The reason that a journalist might come to describe it in that way is obviously that, in this post-Cold War environment, the United States—as the one remaining global superpower—really has taken on a great deal of responsibility in seeking to maintain global stability across a whole range of regional and localised conflicts. It is obvious that the United States simply cannot do the whole job itself and that other states have to be prepared to pick up areas of responsibility. It was clear that Australia should take on a particular responsibility and, in this instance, a leadership responsibility.
These circumstances obviously arose from our geography—our place in the region so geographically close to East Timor—our historical links with East Timor, our capacity to be able to provide the manpower and technology to be effective in these circumstances, our very good defence and political relations with other countries—with all countries, really, within our region—and also the longstanding and strong military ties that we have had with the traditional Western superpowers. All these attributes, in this instance, jointly presented a situation where Australia had to stand up and take extra responsibility. We, as a country, have not had to face a situation quite like this before. But it did not mean, simply because we have not experienced it in the past, that it was not ever going to occur, and in this instance it did. When Australians were faced with the evidence of the horrors as they were occurring in East Timor post the vote—the wanton violence and destruction—clearly the vast majority of Australians expected us to stand up and play our part, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Howard we were prepared to do so.
I think it should be emphasised that we are doing this under a United Nations mandate. It is not as if we have gone in on our own initiative. We are in there at the request of the 
 United Nations and we are leading the force at the request of the United Nations. It is a force strongly supported by other nation states—in this instance, most importantly, by nation states within ASEAN and other nation states both in South-East Asia and East Asia. They all recognise that the international community in today's age cannot stand by and witness the sort of violence and horrors that were occurring without taking some action.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-27,"—There is no doubt that the circumstances that have arisen in East Timor since the ballot on 30 August are tragic. There is no doubt also that our troops, engaged as part of and, indeed, leading the UNAMET force up there, are facing a very dangerous situation. The opposition have been fully supportive of the position that Australian troops should be part of that peacekeeping force and that Australia should be taking a lead in that regard. We have maintained that position—indeed, we have argued that position—for many months. That position was being argued by the shadow minister for foreign affairs well prior to the holding of the independence ballot. So the government cannot just stand up here and say that the Australian people can take pride in the effort that Australia is now making, and leave it at that.
We have to critically examine the circumstances that have led to this tragic situation and we have to go on critically examining the position as it unfolds. We now have the situation where the government's foreign policy and defence policy are effectively frozen. They are in a mess. The government have walked away from the doctrines that they enunciated in their white paper in April 1997. We have policy being made in an ad hoc fashion, on the run, and then being recanted within a matter of almost a few hours or a few days. We have seen this, for instance, in the enunciation of the Howard doctrine that was reported in the Bulletin of 28 September. It was reported in an article in the Bulletin that the Prime Minister himself has embraced this term, the `Howard doctrine', and given support to the concept 
 that we would become the US's deputy in Asia. We now understand that, as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has pointed out, the Prime Minister has had to walk away from that because it has been roundly condemned by the experts and by a range of former diplomats with vast experience in this area. It has also been attacked by some of our Asian neighbours who are standing beside us as part of the UN force. Thailand and Malaysia are now both on the record as expressing serious concerns about the long-term future of Australia's relations with the entire Asian region. Former ambassador Richard Woolcott, for instance, has written on this matter, and he has stated:
Our relationship with Indonesia, which the Howard government noted in its first ever white paper of foreign trade policy in 1997 would always be fundamentally important and one of our three or four most important relationships, has been set back perhaps a generation. The Australian community is now alienated towards Indonesia and the Indonesian community now alienated towards Australia.
Despite warnings from a number of quarters, the government has allowed its policy towards Indonesia and the region to become a hostage to its policy towards East Timor. Our wider engagement with East Asia has also been damaged. Countries have been surprised by the rush to press for early independence for East Timor, a rush which Australia led largely as a combination of domestic pressures and a naive assumption that we could secure a great diplomatic success.
Equally, there have been comments from others expressing their concern, including—as referred to by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—Tony Kevin, the former Ambassador to Cambodia.
The problem we have here is that the government continues to focus only upon the fact that we are now in there with peacekeeping troops, endeavouring to stabilise the situation—a noble objective that we totally support. But the government also has to get straight and get very clear the long-term policy implications for defence and for foreign policy in this area. It is no good the Prime Minister just running around and enunciating these `Howard doctrines', as he calls them, without having regard to the ultimate consequences of setting up a con 
 frontationist approach with the rest of the Asian region, as he is doing. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>East Timor: Foreign Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-09-27,"—Today's taking note of answers to questions without notice exercise is another example of how the Labor opposition is devoid of any policy of its own in relation to the important issues facing this nation. Indeed, the one spokesman who has been trying to make some noise, the shadow spokesman on foreign affairs, Laurie Brereton, has been roundly condemned by former Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and the former foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans. So, before making any assertions that policy on our side of politics is in disarray, I would invite Senator Forshaw and his Labor Party colleagues to try to sort out those differences within the Labor Party and determine where the Labor Party stands on some of these fundamental issues. Is it the Brereton line or the Whitlam-Evans line that is going to be pursued?
The sad thing in relation to this issue is that we, as a nation, are involved in East Timor not only of our own volition—and that is something that the Labor Party needs to understand—but also as a result of the United Nations requesting us to be involved, with Indonesia's support. Whilst the Labor Party runs around saying that things should have been different and things should have been put in place prior to the referendum, the reality is that the people of East Timor do want independence, as witnessed by the poll, and they want it sooner rather than later. Now, with hindsight, people are saying that conditions should have been imposed prior to that ballot being conducted. But if such conditions had been imposed, the ballot would not have gone ahead in the first place. So it is that sort of policy making on the run which is a bit too smart by half.
—That is what Gusmao, Belo and others asked for. Tell the full story.
—Order! Senator Forshaw, you have had your five minutes.
—Indeed, Madam Deputy President, Senator Forshaw had some time 
 during question time as well when he was interjecting and then trying to deny that he was, in fact, interjecting when Minister Ellison pointed that out.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. That is an absolute lie by Senator Abetz, and I will not stand for it. That is an untruth, as the Hansard  will prove.
—Senator Forshaw, there is no point of order.
—And I am sure that Senator Forshaw will deny that he used the word `riveting' when Senator Ellison was—
—I will deny it, you sleaze-bag.
—Order! Senator Forshaw, you will withdraw that comment, thank you.
—Madam Deputy President, I was not aware that that was unparliamentary, but I will withdraw it.
—Senator Forshaw, it is unparliamentary to reflect upon another member in this place, and you know that. Senator Abetz, would you address the chair, please—
—I was, Madam Deputy President.
—and ignore interjections.
—We have just witnessed—and it is a pity that we are not being broadcast at the moment because the people of Australia would have seen it—a display by a Labor senator dealing in the cheapest way possible with an issue of great moment to the Australian people. The Australian people are concerned about the young men and women in East Timor, the very real dangers that they face and the very real possibility that casualties may indeed flow from their involvement there. That is the gravity of the matter that we are dealing with. To try to cheapen this debate in some sort of political way, as has been attempted by Labor Party senators during question time and now with the taking note of answers, I think demeans them.
There have been a few furphies thrown around in this debate. The first is in relation to whether or not the Prime Minister believes that conscription ought to take place. On 25 September an article in the Australian stated quite clearly that the issue of national service `will be considered in its coming defence white paper', but the Prime Minister said he saw `no need for change at present'. That is exactly what Admiral Barrie said in relation to our presence in East Timor. There is no conflict between Admiral Barrie and the Prime Minister on this matter. The Prime Minister is simply saying that further down the track he will not rule out a possible option. But he did go on to say, `I don't believe at the present time there is a defence need for it.' He was talking about conscription there. So they were completely together on this point. For Senator Faulkner, the would-be Leader of the Government in the Senate, to try to make cheap political capital out of issues like this demeans the Labor Party.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-09-27,"—Senator Faulkner is a former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and has a proud record on issues to do with the defence forces. I take up the issue of conscription and national service. It is not simply a matter of saying, `We need more forces therefore we will conscript them.' The issue is more how can we get people with the high level of skills needed to operate modern weapons and to carry out the sorts of tasks that the military now must expect to be called upon to perform.
I refer to an interesting article in the Sydney Morning Herald today in which Professor Hugh Smith of the Australian Defence Force Academy talked about the strain that was placed on people who are in peacekeeping forces. He also talked about the need for the personnel to be highly trained and for the equipment to be at its utmost readiness. He said that the reserves that Australia now has are not up to speed in terms of their knowledge of the equipment and their readiness to face the issues that might arise in the future.
It is in that context that the Labor Party says, `If you are going to look at national 
 service, it is not simply a matter of people going in for six months, as happened in the 1950s; it is a matter of looking not at numbers but at the quality of service that is provided.' The Labor Party has a grand tradition of being against conscription. That tradition is bolstered by the need to have very professional forces these days. The army in Indonesia is set up largely to control the population of Indonesia. The army in Australia is set up to defend these shores against any possible attack and to do the sort of duty that it is now doing so magnificently in East Timor.
The Labor Party on this side of the chamber is right behind the troops in East Timor, as indeed are everyone in this chamber and most people throughout Australia, but that does not excuse us as a parliament from looking at issues that arise in this context. As I understand it, an issue that is now running throughout the Asian region is that we, through our Prime Minister, seem now to be taking an aggressive and arrogant approach to people in Asia.
The secret to all this is to ask: what is our approach to people throughout Asia and, indeed, throughout the world? Our approach should be that we attribute to them the humanity that we would like to have attributed to ourselves. If we take that approach, we understand that we are right in defending the people of East Timor, but we also owe to the rest of Asia and to the rest of the world the respect that we would expect from them. That respect is not given when we create—either intentionally or unintentionally—the idea that we somehow think ourselves superior and that we are the policemen on the block, superior in quality and superior in arms to others. That is something that must be avoided. It must be made clear as soon as possible that that is not our approach.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>East Timor: Foreign Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-09-27,"—I rise with some sadness to speak on this motion to take note because what we have heard here today, starting with Senator Faulkner, is an attempt to beat up a situation. We then heard Senator Forshaw try to play it down a bit and make it look as though the situation was not quite as bad as the Leader 
 of the Opposition in the Senate said it was. Then we moved to Senator Cooney who said some rather surprising things. One comment of his that I want to address in particular was the suggestion that we were being aggressive towards Asia.
When we look at some of the countries that supported the resolution under chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter which allowed us to go into East Timor with these other nations as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force, we see names such as Japan, Russia, China, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. Those countries agreed with the proposition that was put at that time when Australia—quite rightly in my view—played a leadership role under the circumstances which arose. If any of these countries I have referred to and others believed that we were being aggressive or unreasonable, I suggest that they would never have agreed so conclusively with the positions that were put.
What we have heard in this parliament, particularly from the other side of this chamber, is not helping our men and women abroad now in the role that they have to play. In fact, it is undermining them. It is creating a situation where you would think there was a great dispute going on in Australia, but the only place where the issue gets any mention of note or gets raised is in this chamber. If you try walking down the street, as I did over the weekend when I was back in Perth, you will find that person after person is congratulating the Australian government, congratulating the Prime Minister and congratulating Alexander Downer for the leadership that they have shown in dealing with what is a very difficult situation. People are praising the way our men and women are going about handling the situation in a country that is absolutely in ruin, almost burnt to the ground, and where they are discovering some of the worst atrocities that have been found in the world in modern history.
I say to you people on the other side of the chamber: it is about time you let up a little bit and gave our people up there a chance so that there is a united force behind our troops. I believe they will come back with a lot of glory and a lot of greatness not only for what 
 they are doing on behalf of Australia but also for what they are doing on behalf of world peace. I find it absolutely amazing that this type of attitude is coming through on a whole range of things. It is worth commenting on some of these things, particularly being ready and the different international troops and arrangements. Australia has for a long time covered itself in pride because of the success it has had in the various places it has gone to assist elsewhere in the world. Now there is something very serious much closer to our shores where we need to play a much stronger and more significant role. I read three or four days ago that the President of the United States said that he recognised the role Australia is playing and that it is now their turn to assist in what is going on in this part of the world.
I must make the comment that the Howard government had increased the readiness of our armed forces in case peacekeeping was required. Australia was willing and able to cooperate with our regional colleagues in restoring order in East Timor and allowing United Nations processes within Indonesia and Timor. The Howard government have made clear throughout that we would not send forces to East Timor except at the request of the United Nations and with Indonesian agreement. These things were achieved in terms of Australian men and women going up there to assist. To listen to you people on the other side of the chamber you would think that we unilaterally walked in there, took over and were doing our own thing with no coordination with the United Nations and with other countries in the region. I think I have demonstrated, given the countries that I have named here, that what you have heard from me, from our leader Senator Hill and from Senator Abetz proves you are absolutely wrong.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-27,"—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the development of Hinchinbrook Channel, together with submissions, the Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I wish to begin by thanking the committee secretariat for what is a very thorough report and for their careful work in collecting evidence in a sometimes difficult and heated political context. I would also like to thank those who made submissions to the inquiry for their input and for their patience in waiting a further 12 months from when the report was initially due to be tabled.
Hinchinbrook Island and the Hinchinbrook Channel in North Queensland are renowned for their natural beauty. The channel is in the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area and abuts the wet tropics world heritage area. The outstanding natural values of the area demand the most careful and cautious environmental management of development in the region. This is a place where, if anything, environmental management should truly be best practice. 
This inquiry was prompted by concern that environmental management of the region has in fact been very far from best practice, particularly in relation to the controversial Port Hinchinbrook marina and resort development near Cardwell at the north end of the channel. In my view, the environmental management of Port Hinchinbrook has been a tragedy of errors, the results of which have been unsatisfactory for all concerned. 
For more than a decade, the proposal to develop a resort at Oyster Point on the Hinchinbrook Channel has been characterised by controversy, intergovernmental disputes and bungling at all levels. The issue has grown from one about shortcuts in permit approvals to one about protection of an outstanding natural area, the right of local communities to decent prosperity and a full-blown national debate that arouses the strongest of emotions.
The Port Hinchinbrook development promised regional jobs in an area that sorely needed them. The committee notes that, despite the many public claims of the developer as to the economic value of the development, there has never been any economic assessment of the impact the development is likely to have on the region.
The committee received 166 submissions, the clear majority being from people who did not want the resort to proceed because of its dangers to the surrounding world heritage area. A number of independent submissions came in from scientists expressing grave concerns about the impacts of the resort and about the way governments have managed this matter. The committee notes that a number of scientists reported being threatened or intimidated for putting their views forward about this development. The committee finds this sort of behaviour to be regrettable. The committee gave those who had had adverse comments made about them in submissions the opportunity to respond in writing. This generated a large amount of correspondence that the committee took into account in its final deliberations regarding the evidence to this inquiry.
In retrospect, a tremendous amount of expense and aggravation would have been avoided if the resort and marina project first 
 proposed in 1987 had been subjected to a proper environmental assessment process. In response to the continuing controversy about the development, a deed of agreement between the local and state governments and the developer was made. The Commonwealth later entered the agreement under what is known as the deed of variation. This deed is only enforceable by the signatories and has never been legally enforced despite documented and acknowledged breaches. It is doubtful whether it will ever actually protect the area from the impacts of the development. Evidence to the committee demonstrated that there are serious environmental risks from this development which have been overlooked or downplayed by various governments. It also shows those risks are ongoing. The committee notes that concerns so far highlighted by the Queensland Acid Sulphate Soil Inspection Team and by Professor Ian White raise serious questions about the short- and long-term management of acid sulphate soil on site.
In the committee's view, the Port Hinchinbrook example is a clear case for government of how not to consider and deal with development applications in sensitive areas. The attempts, mainly by state and local authorities, to short-cut even minimal environmental assessment has had the perverse effect of substantially increasing the costs in time, money and degradation to all parties—including developers, regulatory agencies and the community. It is also clear to the committee that the whole system of environmental impact assessment needs substantial overhaul. A system where parties interested in development both commission and pay for environmental impact assessments tends to produce reports with a bias towards development. Reports commissioned independently or by the scientific community do not demonstrate anything like this unanimity and might advocate greater caution.
Many witnesses to the inquiry stressed the need for better regional planning policies. No-one would want to see the Port Hinchinbrook controversy repeated up and down the coast. We need regional plans to give clear ground rules to developers about what sorts of devel 
 opments will or will not be acceptable. The committee is recommending that planning authorities must commit to thorough, independent, up-front environmental impact assessment of significant development proposals. This is particularly the case in management of world heritage, where the highest standards and the most cautious application of the precautionary principle should apply.
Some key recommendations of the report are the following. The Commonwealth, as a party to the Port Hinchinbrook deed of agreement, should engage an independent assessor to report on whether the developer has been complying with the deed and, if there have been any breaches, the Commonwealth should act to ensure they are remedied. That is recommendation 1. There should be a full assessment of acid sulphate soils at the Port Hinchinbrook site, and the Commonwealth should act to ensure that any breaches of the acid sulphate management plan are remedied. The Commonwealth should fund CSIRO to expedite research on acid sulphate soils and acid sulphate mapping around Australia. The Commonwealth and the Queensland governments should expedite research into the environmental effects of aquaculture on the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area. The Commonwealth should fund a program of regional planning in local government areas where planning decisions may affect the world heritage values of world heritage areas. Funding should be conditional on using best practice planning processes. The Commonwealth should also fund a program of information and education about world heritage conservation in those local government areas. The Commonwealth, in cooperation with the states, should expedite research into risks to the world heritage values of Australia's world heritage properties.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",Committees,14,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I also rise to speak on the Hinchinbrook Channel inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. It is a great pity that Senator Allison is leaving the chamber at the moment, because I would like her to hear this. This has been yet another superfluous inquiry set up by 
 Senator Allison into environmental matters. We have had the Jabiluka inquiry, and now we have the Port Hinchinbrook inquiry. We are about to have the Spencer Gulf inquiry. We seem to be travelling around Australia on a series of inquiries trying to examine things that are pretty much already determined and listening constantly to arguments that proper processes have not been followed when indeed, as we found with Jabiluka and as we have found now with Hinchinbrook, this sort of evidence has been constantly ignored.
One would wonder why Senator Allison is wasting so much of the Senate's time on these matters and why she is this afternoon having a private press conference on this. When I tried to check with the committee where the press conference was on this particular issue, I was amazed to learn that it is a private one. Members of the government and other senators are not invited to express a view. Perhaps this is because we would reveal the shonky nature of what has been set up here by Senator Allison inquiring into this resort.
If I could set the record straight—and it certainly has been set straight—in the government members' response to this report we emphatically reject that the government has been negligent in its duty to protect the environment at Port Hinchinbrook. The government has taken a very proactive approach to protecting world heritage values in the area. This was vindicated by His Honour Justice Sackville in the Federal Court of Australia. The Commonwealth government has entered a comprehensive deed of agreement with Cardwell Properties Ltd for the construction and operation of this complex at Oyster Point on Port Hinchinbrook. The deed expressly notes the grant of consents. The minister would specifically require the company to enter into certain enforceable arrangements to ensure the protection, presentation and conservation of world heritage values in the area. This includes stabilisation of the foreshore, monitoring of continued erosion and best practice dredging as well as control of acid sulphate soil run-off.
This has been not only a Commonwealth government matter but also a joint matter with the Queensland government. A memorandum 
 of understanding has been signed between the two governments and a regional management plan has been developed and put in place. Senator Hill also requested that the six independent scientists have a look at and do the environmental risk assessments, and we have had advice from the Australian Heritage Commission and the Queensland environment minister. So these management plans have been put in place and executed properly. It was only after all the various steps that I just mentioned that the Commonwealth entered into the deed and the memorandum of understanding and Senator Hill finally gave his formal consent for this resort to proceed.
The strange thing about the whole process of this inquiry, given that so many procedures have been put in place to protect the environment, is why this particular matter has been pursued for so long in the Senate and why we have received such—let me put it politely—strange advice from so-called scientists, who have put forward evidence that reflects not any particular science but their own political bias. We came across this again and again in the evidence that was presented. You have only to look at some of the rebuttal evidence by scientists who were put up as independent advisers and also the response of the developer, Keith Williams, to see that we have had presented to this committee pieces of evidence that have no validity in science at all.
In my own training I was trained to measure scientifically things that change. Admittedly, it was not related to the environment, but I do understand the principles of measuring change. One of the things that you must do is start from baseline data, but we found again and again that, when we challenged people about where this baseline data was, we found it wanting. We also found that certain types of evidence that should have been obvious to any scientist were withheld. I could give one example of that, and it relates to what happens when acid sulphate reaches the ocean. It was claimed that this acid sulphate was very damaging—it turns into a very dilute form of sulphuric acid—and that, when it got to the sea, it would be damaging to the seagrasses which the dugongs feed on. An elementary knowledge of science would 
 tell anyone—and this was also revealed by one of the top scientists in the evidence—that, if you add a weak acid to a weak alkali, which the ocean happens to be, as it is salt water, it is neutralised. I asked one scientist, `How far does this acid effect reach out into the ocean?' He said, `Oh, about two or three feet.' In other words, as it proceeds into the ocean, it is neutralised. Therefore, it does not affect the seagrasses and the dugongs.
The dugongs were another point of contention. We were told that damage to dugongs occurred in the channel because of the activities of boats. Increased tourist activity would be damaging to the dugongs. We were actually shown photographs of this damage—dugongs with marks along their sides—and this was claimed to be caused by propellers. What we actually found, from other photographs in evidence that we received from other scientists, was that these marks on the side were from the amorous activities of male dugongs. This is something that occurs quite naturally—it had absolutely nothing to do with environmental effects. It was sad to see that so much of the evidence presented to us by people who were masquerading as scientists—just putting their own particular political spin on something that they believed in—was done so dishonestly.
For this reason, the government members of the committee have dissented from all the recommendations in this report. This is a blatant political exercise. Senator Allison kept referring to `we, the committee'. What she really meant was the majority of the committee, because there were also government members on that committee. We put in a minority report and dissented from something that was a blatant political exercise. I call on Senator Allison and the Democrats to stop wasting the Senate's time by holding inquiries like those on Jabiluka and Port Hinchinbrook. I am not too sure what we are going to find when we get to Spencer Gulf—maybe that will be a valid one. I look forward to it in that case, Senator Bolkus. I hope so, because the inquiries that we have had so far have been into things that have virtually been decided and into processes which you claim have not been implemented properly but, 
 when the evidence sees the light of day, it is clear they have followed proper processes.
This government has brought in a new environment, conservation and biodiversity bill which puts into the forefront the Commonwealth role in the environment and the protection of world heritage values. We have done this; we have followed proper procedure and, in the case of Hinchinbrook, we have certainly followed proper procedure. The minister, the Hon. Robert Hill, did not sign off until all those procedures were followed. What has happened with this report is a disgrace. It is a totally dishonest, biased and completely political report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",Committees,14,1,speech
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I also rise to speak in this debate and assure the Senate that I will not be breaking my record—I will not be agreeing with Senator Tierney for the first time this afternoon. I would like to start off by thanking the staff of the committee, and all those who were involved in making submissions, for the amount of work, effort and thought applied in helping the committee in its deliberations. I would also like to thank Senator Reynolds, in particular, and Senator Hogg for the work that they put into this inquiry. This is an important inquiry—important not as recognised by Senator Tierney but important as recognised by those interested in the Great Barrier Reef and the Port Hinchinbrook proposal, as well as those interested in future good environmental management.
It has to be said that Senator Tierney was totally unfair in the way he described Senator Allison's history of raising proposals for inquiry by Senate committees. Jabiluka was, and continues to be, an important national issue. It will not go away because of anything that Senator Tierney says here this afternoon. It is an inquiry which highlighted enormous gaps in the government's environmental assessment and approval processes, and those gaps are still there. The lack of adequate environmental support for the government's approval of mining there not only is of national concern but also continues to be of international concern.
Gulf St Vincent is an area which is under enormous environmental stress. Senator 
 Tierney may be sceptical about the importance of a Senate inquiry into that particular part of Australia, but we are talking of an area on which there are enormous environmental pressures and the future management of which the Senate, by analysing the state of the gulf, can play an important role in. In this particular case, the opposition agree with the recommendations of this report. But we do not agree with the report and we do not agree with many of the conclusions arrived at by Senator Allison.
In some respects, we find the actual body of the report a self-congratulatory document for the Democrats, one which in many respects is not justified by the facts. But we do not let that detract from the important recommendations made by the report—recommendations with which we agree. Senator Allison may be having a private press conference at the moment but, in terms of environmental politics, it must be acknowledged in this place that the Democrats at the moment have a fair way to go to catch up. Having dumped the major environmental movement over the last few months on environmental legislation, I do understand that Senator Allison would be going out and having private briefings at the moment. But let us not allow that level of politicking to detract from the recommendations before us.
This inquiry has highlighted shortcomings in terms of the environmental impact assessment and approval processes and also the relationship between Commonwealth, state and local governments and developers. It is these shortcomings that should give us guidance as to how we should approach these matters into the future. The proposal before us not only has media specific implications but also has wider implications. This is a highly sensitive, large development. It abuts the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area, it is about six kilometres from the wet tropics world heritage area and there are a number of endangered species involved.
The marina and resort development was started in 1988 but has been halted a number of times due to the failure of a development company and due to government intervention to protect the environment. The inquiry into 
 the Port Hinchinbrook development has highlighted a number of problems, including a lack of up-front environmental impact assessments dating back to the 1980s. This has fuelled claims that the authorities are too biased in favour of development. The deed of agreement, which did exist, was not complied with. Also, despite evidence of frequent breaches, the matter has never been tested in court.
There are lessons here for a Commonwealth with a commitment to environmental protection—lessons in terms of adequacy of processes and the need for enforcement capacities. The approval process has been attacked as not providing a transparent public consultation process. In such a polarised issue, it is important that there be confidence in the public process. The lack of a comprehensive EIS allowed for a situation where the developer was able to present the development as a fait accompli. For example, the previous developers carried out earthworks for the marina for which they had some state and local approval but before securing other necessary Commonwealth and state approvals. There are lessons there in terms of timeliness of approvals and coordination between Commonwealth and state and also taking into consideration environmental concerns in an adequate and meaningful way.
Concerns have been expressed also by scientists that there was not adequate baseline data in the EIS process. We must recognise that the deed of agreement between the state government, the shire council and the developer was inadequate in terms of transparency and accountability. These are others measures that should be of concern to a national government. The committee was also able to make an assessment of the recent approval—that is, in 1996—by the Commonwealth minister for works to recommence. We are of the view that such an approval raises questions of whether the interpretation of `environmental assessment' was too narrow. It appears that the wider impacts have been ignored, including the effects of boat traffic on dugongs and the potential for increased tourism on the nearby island national parks.
So there is a raft of recommendations that comes up through the report—recommendations which not only deal with specific issues but also, as I said earlier, have wider implications. Specifically, the recommendations in relation to Port Hinchinbrook include: (1) that the Commonwealth should ensure independent assessment of the development and ensure that the developer remedies any breaches of the existing agreement; and (2) that full assessment of acid sulphate soils at the Port Hinchinbrook development should be undertaken and steps be taken to ensure that the developer does not breach existing agreements.
Senator Tierney might think those sorts of recommendations frivolous and irrelevant, but they are important in terms of the ongoing Commonwealth responsibility in an area such as this—as I said earlier, so close to the wilderness area and also to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Recommendations that deal with broader environmental planning issues include the need for: (1) improved procedures for early open independent EISs; (2) general research into acid sulphate soils and their effects on aquaculture; (3) regional land use planning, including support for local governments; (4) better Commonwealth and state cooperation in the protection of world heritage values; and (5) control of threats to dugongs in the southern Great Barrier Reef.
We feel that these issues need to be taken into account and there needs to be continuing federal interest in this matter. In that respect, were a Commonwealth government not to take issues such as this seriously, its recent environment legislation allows it an escape clause. Even though the Australian Democrats claim great success in achieving better environmental protection as a consequence of that legislation, the fact of the matter is that, through a number of mechanisms, that legislation will allow for a Commonwealth government to wash its hands of policy interests and concerns in an area such as this where so much of the decision making can be done by state and local governments. It is important for us that a more definite role be detailed in terms of Commonwealth responsibility in areas such as this. We should recognise that 
 areas such as this have led to the major environmental battles of the sixties and seventies—battles which have laid the legislative foundation for Commonwealth involvement and also laid in many ways the policy foundation for such involvement.
We feel that the recommendations accurately reflect the findings of the inquiry. As I said earlier, we agree with the recommendations, but we do not agree with many of the comments made by the Australian Democrats in the body of the report. Unfortunately, agreement was not reached as to working through the body of the report and coming up with agreed words and conclusions. But, as I said earlier, this should not detract from the fact that there has been agreement between the Australian Labor Party and Senator Allison with respect to the recommendations here—agreement which should provide some foundation for further government policy initiatives when there is a change of government.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee</title>",Committees,14,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-27,"—I would also like to speak to this report on the development of Hinchinbrook Channel. As Senator Tierney felt it appropriate to mention that Senator Allison left the chamber when he was speaking, it is probably worth mentioning his immediate absence from the chamber as soon as he concluded his remarks, which is a pity because it is appropriate that I respond to some of his comments. As a senator for Queensland, I have a great interest in this report and in the Port Hinchinbrook development which has been, as all senators would know, an ongoing issue for many years not only for this parliament but also for the Queensland state government and the Queensland community in general.
The reason why the development has continued to be an issue for many years is that many of the concerns that have been raised, many of the flaws in the process and many of the ongoing threats to the environment surrounding the Hinchinbrook Channel and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park have not been acknowledged and have not been adequately addressed. It is important to emphasise that this report is not simply a matter of beating up on the Port Hinchinbrook development. The aim of this inquiry was to 
 assess the process that occurred and the flaws in the process that enabled things to get where they are today not only to see what can be done to prevent any further damage but also to see what changes need to be made—what things need to be done differently—so that we do not have a repeat elsewhere in Australia and, of particular relevance from my point of view, elsewhere along the Queensland coast.
Evidence presented before this inquiry demonstrated that that is a real threat. One reason, amongst many, why this development got as far as it did was that various approval permits were given in inappropriate or inadequate circumstances many years ago. That was then on-sold, and the development was seen as already having approval and was already a certain way down the track. As everyone would acknowledge, once something has approval and is further down the track, it is a lot harder to stop it. There are many other proposed developments along the Queensland coast that are potential repeats of this situation—that is, where initial development approval has been given and there is inadequate protection if any developer chooses to go ahead.
I counter some of the suggestions of Senator Bolkus that, somehow or other, the Democrats amendments to the recent Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act exacerbate this problem. On the contrary, if that new act had been in place when the Port Hinchinbrook permits were first put forward, then there would have been a much stronger likelihood of a proper environmental assessment being done from the outset. That is one of the major improvements that the Democrats have managed to achieve with that new environmental legislation.
Senator Bolkus said that the new law would allow the Commonwealth to wash its hands of the issue. But the fact is that, under the law as it stood at the time of this development, the Commonwealth did wash its hands despite there being clear evidence of a potential impact on world heritage areas. Under the new act we have a role for the parliament in being able to prevent the Commonwealth from offloading its responsibilities by enab 
 ling the parliament and the Senate to disallow any attempt made by the Commonwealth to offload its responsibilities. Clearly, there is increased power for the Commonwealth but the Democrats have managed to achieve increased protection as well.
I commend to the Senate many of the recommendations of this report. I hope that coalition senators, particularly those from Queensland, will examine those recommendations because there is an ongoing threat to the Great Barrier Reef, which is an indescribably huge asset to Queensland in terms of employment and the environment. Many of these recommendations address that ongoing risk. They are forward looking recommendations that not only try to prevent the travesty of the Port Hinchinbrook development recurring in the future but also provide ongoing, broader assessment and work to ensure that those ongoing threats to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area are addressed and managed properly. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-27,"—I present the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the development of Hinchinbrook Channel, together with submissions, the Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I wish to begin by thanking the committee secretariat for what is a very thorough report and for their careful work in collecting evidence in a sometimes difficult and heated political context. I would also like to thank those who made submissions to the inquiry for their input and for their patience in waiting a further 12 months from when the report was initially due to be tabled.
Hinchinbrook Island and the Hinchinbrook Channel in North Queensland are renowned for their natural beauty. The channel is in the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area and abuts the wet tropics world heritage area. The outstanding natural values of the area demand the most careful and cautious environmental management of development in the region. This is a place where, if anything, environmental management should truly be best practice. 
This inquiry was prompted by concern that environmental management of the region has in fact been very far from best practice, particularly in relation to the controversial Port Hinchinbrook marina and resort development near Cardwell at the north end of the channel. In my view, the environmental management of Port Hinchinbrook has been a tragedy of errors, the results of which have been unsatisfactory for all concerned. 
For more than a decade, the proposal to develop a resort at Oyster Point on the Hinchinbrook Channel has been characterised by controversy, intergovernmental disputes and bungling at all levels. The issue has grown from one about shortcuts in permit approvals to one about protection of an outstanding natural area, the right of local communities to decent prosperity and a full-blown national debate that arouses the strongest of emotions.
The Port Hinchinbrook development promised regional jobs in an area that sorely needed them. The committee notes that, despite the many public claims of the developer as to the economic value of the development, there has never been any economic assessment of the impact the development is likely to have on the region.
The committee received 166 submissions, the clear majority being from people who did not want the resort to proceed because of its dangers to the surrounding world heritage area. A number of independent submissions came in from scientists expressing grave concerns about the impacts of the resort and about the way governments have managed this matter. The committee notes that a number of scientists reported being threatened or intimidated for putting their views forward about this development. The committee finds this sort of behaviour to be regrettable. The committee gave those who had had adverse comments made about them in submissions the opportunity to respond in writing. This generated a large amount of correspondence that the committee took into account in its final deliberations regarding the evidence to this inquiry.
In retrospect, a tremendous amount of expense and aggravation would have been avoided if the resort and marina project first 
 proposed in 1987 had been subjected to a proper environmental assessment process. In response to the continuing controversy about the development, a deed of agreement between the local and state governments and the developer was made. The Commonwealth later entered the agreement under what is known as the deed of variation. This deed is only enforceable by the signatories and has never been legally enforced despite documented and acknowledged breaches. It is doubtful whether it will ever actually protect the area from the impacts of the development. Evidence to the committee demonstrated that there are serious environmental risks from this development which have been overlooked or downplayed by various governments. It also shows those risks are ongoing. The committee notes that concerns so far highlighted by the Queensland Acid Sulphate Soil Inspection Team and by Professor Ian White raise serious questions about the short- and long-term management of acid sulphate soil on site.
In the committee's view, the Port Hinchinbrook example is a clear case for government of how not to consider and deal with development applications in sensitive areas. The attempts, mainly by state and local authorities, to short-cut even minimal environmental assessment has had the perverse effect of substantially increasing the costs in time, money and degradation to all parties—including developers, regulatory agencies and the community. It is also clear to the committee that the whole system of environmental impact assessment needs substantial overhaul. A system where parties interested in development both commission and pay for environmental impact assessments tends to produce reports with a bias towards development. Reports commissioned independently or by the scientific community do not demonstrate anything like this unanimity and might advocate greater caution.
Many witnesses to the inquiry stressed the need for better regional planning policies. No-one would want to see the Port Hinchinbrook controversy repeated up and down the coast. We need regional plans to give clear ground rules to developers about what sorts of devel 
 opments will or will not be acceptable. The committee is recommending that planning authorities must commit to thorough, independent, up-front environmental impact assessment of significant development proposals. This is particularly the case in management of world heritage, where the highest standards and the most cautious application of the precautionary principle should apply.
Some key recommendations of the report are the following. The Commonwealth, as a party to the Port Hinchinbrook deed of agreement, should engage an independent assessor to report on whether the developer has been complying with the deed and, if there have been any breaches, the Commonwealth should act to ensure they are remedied. That is recommendation 1. There should be a full assessment of acid sulphate soils at the Port Hinchinbrook site, and the Commonwealth should act to ensure that any breaches of the acid sulphate management plan are remedied. The Commonwealth should fund CSIRO to expedite research on acid sulphate soils and acid sulphate mapping around Australia. The Commonwealth and the Queensland governments should expedite research into the environmental effects of aquaculture on the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area. The Commonwealth should fund a program of regional planning in local government areas where planning decisions may affect the world heritage values of world heritage areas. Funding should be conditional on using best practice planning processes. The Commonwealth should also fund a program of information and education about world heritage conservation in those local government areas. The Commonwealth, in cooperation with the states, should expedite research into risks to the world heritage values of Australia's world heritage properties.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I also rise to speak on the Hinchinbrook Channel inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee. It is a great pity that Senator Allison is leaving the chamber at the moment, because I would like her to hear this. This has been yet another superfluous inquiry set up by 
 Senator Allison into environmental matters. We have had the Jabiluka inquiry, and now we have the Port Hinchinbrook inquiry. We are about to have the Spencer Gulf inquiry. We seem to be travelling around Australia on a series of inquiries trying to examine things that are pretty much already determined and listening constantly to arguments that proper processes have not been followed when indeed, as we found with Jabiluka and as we have found now with Hinchinbrook, this sort of evidence has been constantly ignored.
One would wonder why Senator Allison is wasting so much of the Senate's time on these matters and why she is this afternoon having a private press conference on this. When I tried to check with the committee where the press conference was on this particular issue, I was amazed to learn that it is a private one. Members of the government and other senators are not invited to express a view. Perhaps this is because we would reveal the shonky nature of what has been set up here by Senator Allison inquiring into this resort.
If I could set the record straight—and it certainly has been set straight—in the government members' response to this report we emphatically reject that the government has been negligent in its duty to protect the environment at Port Hinchinbrook. The government has taken a very proactive approach to protecting world heritage values in the area. This was vindicated by His Honour Justice Sackville in the Federal Court of Australia. The Commonwealth government has entered a comprehensive deed of agreement with Cardwell Properties Ltd for the construction and operation of this complex at Oyster Point on Port Hinchinbrook. The deed expressly notes the grant of consents. The minister would specifically require the company to enter into certain enforceable arrangements to ensure the protection, presentation and conservation of world heritage values in the area. This includes stabilisation of the foreshore, monitoring of continued erosion and best practice dredging as well as control of acid sulphate soil run-off.
This has been not only a Commonwealth government matter but also a joint matter with the Queensland government. A memorandum 
 of understanding has been signed between the two governments and a regional management plan has been developed and put in place. Senator Hill also requested that the six independent scientists have a look at and do the environmental risk assessments, and we have had advice from the Australian Heritage Commission and the Queensland environment minister. So these management plans have been put in place and executed properly. It was only after all the various steps that I just mentioned that the Commonwealth entered into the deed and the memorandum of understanding and Senator Hill finally gave his formal consent for this resort to proceed.
The strange thing about the whole process of this inquiry, given that so many procedures have been put in place to protect the environment, is why this particular matter has been pursued for so long in the Senate and why we have received such—let me put it politely—strange advice from so-called scientists, who have put forward evidence that reflects not any particular science but their own political bias. We came across this again and again in the evidence that was presented. You have only to look at some of the rebuttal evidence by scientists who were put up as independent advisers and also the response of the developer, Keith Williams, to see that we have had presented to this committee pieces of evidence that have no validity in science at all.
In my own training I was trained to measure scientifically things that change. Admittedly, it was not related to the environment, but I do understand the principles of measuring change.

I hope so, because the inquiries that we have had so far have been into things that have virtually been decided and into processes which you claim have not been implemented properly but, 
 when the evidence sees the light of day, it is clear they have followed proper processes.

It is important for us that a more definite role be detailed in terms of Commonwealth responsibility in areas such as this. We should recognise that 
 areas such as this have led to the major environmental battles of the sixties and seventies—battles which have laid the legislative foundation for Commonwealth involvement and also laid in many ways the policy foundation for such involvement.
We feel that the recommendations accurately reflect the findings of the inquiry. As I said earlier, we agree with the recommendations, but we do not agree with many of the comments made by the Australian Democrats in the body of the report. Unfortunately, agreement was not reached as to working through the body of the report and coming up with agreed words and conclusions. But, as I said earlier, this should not detract from the fact that there has been agreement between the Australian Labor Party and Senator Allison with respect to the recommendations here—agreement which should provide some foundation for further government policy initiatives when there is a change of government.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-27,"—I would also like to speak to this report on the development of Hinchinbrook Channel. As Senator Tierney felt it appropriate to mention that Senator Allison left the chamber when he was speaking, it is probably worth mentioning his immediate absence from the chamber as soon as he concluded his remarks, which is a pity because it is appropriate that I respond to some of his comments. As a senator for Queensland, I have a great interest in this report and in the Port Hinchinbrook development which has been, as all senators would know, an ongoing issue for many years not only for this parliament but also for the Queensland state government and the Queensland community in general.
The reason why the development has continued to be an issue for many years is that many of the concerns that have been raised, many of the flaws in the process and many of the ongoing threats to the environment surrounding the Hinchinbrook Channel and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park have not been acknowledged and have not been adequately addressed. It is important to emphasise that this report is not simply a matter of beating up on the Port Hinchinbrook development. The aim of this inquiry was to 
 assess the process that occurred and the flaws in the process that enabled things to get where they are today not only to see what can be done to prevent any further damage but also to see what changes need to be made—what things need to be done differently—so that we do not have a repeat elsewhere in Australia and, of particular relevance from my point of view, elsewhere along the Queensland coast.
Evidence presented before this inquiry demonstrated that that is a real threat. One reason, amongst many, why this development got as far as it did was that various approval permits were given in inappropriate or inadequate circumstances many years ago. That was then on-sold, and the development was seen as already having approval and was already a certain way down the track. As everyone would acknowledge, once something has approval and is further down the track, it is a lot harder to stop it. There are many other proposed developments along the Queensland coast that are potential repeats of this situation—that is, where initial development approval has been given and there is inadequate protection if any developer chooses to go ahead.
I counter some of the suggestions of Senator Bolkus that, somehow or other, the Democrats amendments to the recent Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act exacerbate this problem. On the contrary, if that new act had been in place when the Port Hinchinbrook permits were first put forward, then there would have been a much stronger likelihood of a proper environmental assessment being done from the outset. That is one of the major improvements that the Democrats have managed to achieve with that new environmental legislation.
Senator Bolkus said that the new law would allow the Commonwealth to wash its hands of the issue. But the fact is that, under the law as it stood at the time of this development, the Commonwealth did wash its hands despite there being clear evidence of a potential impact on world heritage areas. Under the new act we have a role for the parliament in being able to prevent the Commonwealth from offloading its responsibilities by enab 
 ling the parliament and the Senate to disallow any attempt made by the Commonwealth to offload its responsibilities. Clearly, there is increased power for the Commonwealth but the Democrats have managed to achieve increased protection as well.
I commend to the Senate many of the recommendations of this report. I hope that coalition senators, particularly those from Queensland, will examine those recommendations because there is an ongoing threat to the Great Barrier Reef, which is an indescribably huge asset to Queensland in terms of employment and the environment. Many of these recommendations address that ongoing risk. They are forward looking recommendations that not only try to prevent the travesty of the Port Hinchinbrook development recurring in the future but also provide ongoing, broader assessment and work to ensure that those ongoing threats to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area are addressed and managed properly. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Given that the House of Representatives' amendments have been negatived, the appropriate course of action is to have all three consequential amendments now dealt with by the committee.

We have not been convinced of the need for change at this time in this area of assisted voting.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-27,"—For the record, the government, whilst disappointed that it was not successful in having its proposals in relation to assisted voting passed, recognises that there should be consistency between the electoral provisions and the referendum provisions. It recognises that these consequential amendments would achieve that, and therefore does not oppose them on that basis.
—The question is that items 55 to 58 and 60 to 65 stand as printed.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-27,"—Let me speak briefly to what is the second element of this message that is before us, which is, as you have properly indicated, Madam Temporary Chairman, Senate amendment No. 26. In one sense, this second element about the provisions relating to vehicles such as the Greenfields Foundation was perhaps the most controversial of the amendments that were adopted by the Senate in 
 February. I am pleased that the House of Representatives has passed those amendments with what I would describe as some minor refinements, and I am happy to agree to those refinements that have been proposed by the government. The disclosure of loans was the critical part of those amendments. Our amendments will prevent loans from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information such as terms and conditions of the loan are disclosed. We also inserted a definition of `loan' consistent with the Income Tax Assessment Act.
Our amendments would prohibit a loan from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution—guaranteeing its commercial nature—unless certain information was disclosed: basic information such as the terms and conditions of the loan and details about the individual or organisation from whom the loan was received. I believe that this information would greatly assist the AEC in their investigation and pursuit of possible or suspected associated entities such as the notorious Greenfields Foundation. The amendments do not, of course, prohibit loans being received. They just say that if you get a loan from an organisation, other than from a registered financial institution, then you have to disclose enough about that loan to inform the AEC as to whether it is on a commercial basis or not—or, indeed, would actually constitute a gift.
Hopefully, this definition, as set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act, will help Mr Lynton Crosby and Mr Ron Walker, along with the Special Minister of State and the Prime Minister, understand exactly what constitutes a loan. I think, to give him credit, Senator Ellison has probably finally worked out that there is not much support for the government's position, untenable though it might have been, on the Greenfields Foundation issue. I suppose in politics you eventually get to a point where you decide it is no longer tenable to defend the indefensible. I am pleased that the government has swallowed some humble pie on this and seen the good sense in the opposition's amendments.
The government has, to be fair, proposed some technical amendments here that have 
 been raised in relation to our Greenfields amendments, and I am happy to accept those technical amendments. Finally, the government has proposed a couple of technical amendments also in relation to omissions in the Electoral and Referendum Bill 1997, and we support those non-controversial amendments also. In relation to Senate amendment No. 26, to which the House has disagreed, House of Representatives amendment No. 2, which it has made in place thereof, and the additional amendment which has been made by the House, the opposition will support the question that has been moved by Senator Ellison on behalf of the government.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-27,"—For the record, as I indicated previously when we were debating the message earlier on today, the Democrats will support the minister's motion that we not insist on the original Senate amendment in this area. We do acknowledge the government's taking on board of the intent and aim of the Senate's amendment from earlier in the year. As far as we can ascertain, the extra amendments that the House of Representatives has made to that Senate amendment are a refinement or an improvement on the initial proposal.
It is worth mentioning the Democrats' longstanding commitment in the area of electoral legislation for greater disclosure of donations and assistance to political parties, and it is pleasing to see the ongoing commitment of all political parties. The proposals for declaration of donations and issues such as that were first floated by the Democrats probably 15 or more years ago—from memory, by my Queensland predecessor Senator Macklin. I think it is fair to say that there was far from universal support from political parties for those proposals. I think it is a credit to all political parties, an indication of the improvement in the political process and also a recognition in the parliament—taking on board community beliefs and community perceptions about what is necessary in terms of transparency in the political process—that it has now become a close to universally accepted principle that we should have openness in relation to disclosure of political donations and related matters such as loans.
All that remains to be debated is the issue of how best to ensure balance in relation to issues of openness. I think that is an issue on which there have been a lot of advances in recent years in the political arena across all political parties. It is an issue that the Democrats will continue to promote and to monitor to examine potential loopholes, such as those which have been addressed by the amendments that will be contained in the new act. It is an ongoing issue; it is not something that is now resolved and we can all forget about and move on to other things. But it is pleasing to see. It is worth noting the more widespread general political consensus for openness and disclosure of political donations. There is always room for improvement, and we will certainly continue to put forward suggestions for further improvement. But we are pleased that the government has accepted the overall thrust of the amendment that the Senate has put forward, and we will be supporting the minister's amendments on this occasion.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I rise tonight to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999  because I did not get an opportunity last week because of particular circumstances. I do not wish to take up too much time, but I do want to place on record some concerns I have about the way this government is handling the issue of aged care. This bill does introduce one or two issues that I think are very important—and the bill should have been introduced some considerable time ago because they are issues that the opposition has highlighted and that Senator Evans has been working on very hard and assiduously to get the government to change. But there are still a number of areas that this government has not looked at and is not taking proper cognisance of.
The issue of accreditation has many of the institutions very concerned, not because they disagree with accreditation—that is not true; they want accreditation—but because of the uncertainty as to what it means, the uncertainty of the cost factors and the uncertainty of how it is going to be implemented. In particular, there is concern in those very small, usually rural, aged care institutions as to how the cost factor is going to impact upon them and their viability. That is certainly of grave concern.
Other issues aged care institutions have concerns about relate to the general running of the department—how things are being run and conducted. I am aware of one hostel, for instance, that was not back paid $18,000 for eight months. This might not seem a great deal of money, but taking eight months to be back paid certainly raises concerns about the administration of the government and it certainly raises concerns about what impact this potentially has on institutions. This particular institution was a not-for-profit organisation. So it was not out there trying to make a lot of money; it was trying to break even so it could offer a reasonable service to its clients and the community. But it took the 
 organisation eight months to get the back pay that it was entitled to.
The other problem aged care institutions have relates to residents on British pensions, which involves a fluctuating exchange rate. It may not involve great fluctuations but they can be enough to warrant the residents receiving letters almost daily from the department altering the additional amounts that they will be paid. Something has to be done about that because this is not leading to good administration; it is leading to confusion. On occasions letters will come to the residents telling them the additional amount to be paid and that there is no money owing. Then a few weeks down the track the department will change its mind and say that there is money owing.
This sort of confusion is not particularly good for administration. But another group for whom that is frightful is those people who are concerned that they might be getting dementia or confused and forgetful. How are people in this vulnerable group able to have some comprehension and understanding of the requirements for them to meet to pay the institution in order to stay in the institution? How are they able to cope with this when they can be receiving letters almost on a weekly basis altering the amount that they are supposed to be paying?
In relation to reclassification, I know of a number of institutions that have taken to sending the department registered mail so the department actually receives it and cannot say to them, `Oh, it must have got lost in the post.' I am not talking about institutions that are sending their mail considerable distances from Perth or Geraldton or the back of beyond in Western Australia to Canberra. I am talking about people in New South Wales. Institutions are being recommended by their peak bodies to send their correspondence to the department, particularly their classification forms, by registered mail so if the department says, `Oh, well, we haven't got it,' or, `It's lost,' or, `No, it mustn't have come in the mail,' they can say, `Yes, we know it has come in the mail because Australia Post can tell us what day we delivered it to you.' This government have not set the example as to 
 how this should be run, and they should be condemned for this situation.
The accreditation process again keeps being an issue. A number of institutions have double and treble checked their administrative procedures and insist that the responsibility for this ongoing confusion lies with the department, not with them. Once they have started to send their information to the department by registered mail, they are finding that things are less confusing and the department cannot say that Australia Post have lost it, or they have to admit that they have lost it and that it is not Australia Post's problem. But lodging several amendments a month at $3 a pop becomes a bit of an expensive exercise as well. There are also concerns from some of the institutions that the department has delayed back payments of fees owing on reclassified patients for up to three months. This keeps coming up as a common thread when I talk to aged care institutions. I talk to a lot of them and I visit a lot of them. I have an interest in this particular area.
There is another issue which will be addressed by one of the opposition's amendments—that is, the eligibility to receive pension supplements of home owners whose combined assets, including the house, is less than $23,000. Before anybody tells me that they are going to do something about this, I want it placed very clearly on the record now that this is an issue that I raised in this place some considerable time ago, and I was assured that it was going to be fixed. We are still waiting in Broken Hill for that problem to be fixed. Unless it has been fixed in the last fortnight, it is still an issue out there. If that has not been fixed, it is slack and sloppy.
The other thing that is happening in aged care is that the department is now sending their monitors around to review classifications every couple of months. What one monitor might have passed three months ago is being changed by the reviewing monitor three or four months later. They are also reducing the classification level. It has been put to me by some institutions that this is another way for the government to save money. That has ramifications for the standard and the level of care that is given to elderly people in these 
 institutions. Of course, they are not necessarily all elderly people in these institutions. They are people in need of nursing home type accommodation.
This government really has to improve its administration of this portfolio and get some of these issues sorted out once and for all. Stop worrying about sending out pieces of paper to members of parliament saying that there is going to be an announcement made about a senior citizen of the year which only gives us three or four days to put nominations in and then having to extend the application period. That is an indication of just how slack the administration of this department is at the most senior level—at the ministerial level. That is being reflected in a number of the problems and issues that are coming to all of us from institutions and organisations associated with the care of the elderly and the care of the frail.
The delays in payment of fees and the processing of reclassifications is causing a lot of institutions a lot of problems. The department keeps changing the reclassification form. I have had a number of complaints due to the fact that there are critical dates. It changed last year on 1 November. It had changed the year before about that time too. An institution has about four weeks within which to do a classification. A person was admitted to an institution at the end of October last year and the institution was not in a position to be able to do the classification until November. The form had changed on 1 November. Therefore, the institution thought that they would fill out the new form, as was appropriate. They thought that that was the form they were supposed to be filling out. But, because the resident had been admitted prior to 1 November, albeit less than a month prior—they were still within the time frame of a month in which they had to do the classification—they wondered why they were not receiving any money. They were then told by the department that because the resident had entered the institution in October they had to use the old form.
I would urge any institution and any aged care facility reading or listening to this debate to be very careful about this trap, because it 
 has happened to other institutions as well. It has happened to different institutions in the north of the state and in the south of the state. When these critical dates happen to occur, the department does not have the wit or the ability to comprehend that an institution sends in whatever classification form is appropriate when it does the classification. The department judges that it has to be the form when the person was admitted, but there is nothing clearly stated about that in the advice to the institutions.
I am dealing here with managers and directors of nursing who have been in this industry for some considerable time, who have a lot of experience and who run very good institutions. I am not talking about fly-by-nighters who are out to fleece the department, the government and everybody else and who do not care for their aged residents; I am talking about competent and good managers and administrators.
These sorts of things are causing a great deal of confusion, upset, concern, annoyance and frustration. When people send in incorrect forms, the department does not get back to them and say, `Hey, you've done the wrong thing.' The people have to wait. When nothing happens and no money comes through, they think `Oops, better ring the department.' So they ring the department and get told, `Yes, you should have done A, B, C, D and E, not B, C, D, E and F.'
This lack of communication and, when there is communication, the complicated and technical manner of the communication are of major concern to the industry. This is a department which the minister does not seem to think should be speaking in plain English to the institutions and organisations. It is really a problem for people in the industry. Those are a few of the issues I wanted to raise last week, and I welcome the opportunity to do so today in the committee stage of this bill. There are a couple of other amendments I will certainly want to address when Senator Evans moves them.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—Senator West had a general spray against the government, the 
 department, the minister and, I think, some nursing home owners; I do not know whom she left out. But she did raise one legitimate issue, in relation to a resident with a low value house whose total assets are less than $23,500. A resident with a low value house whose total assets are less than $23,500 cannot be asked to pay an accommodation charge but does not qualify for the concessional resident supplement to be paid. The issue of low value homes is of great concern in rural areas, and the minister has consulted with stakeholders and held meetings with Ms Sue Irvine and Mr John Ireland on this issue. The minister today amended the definition of `home owner' to ensure that residents with homes and assets valued at less than $23,500 can qualify as concessional residents.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—We have an amendment that goes to this issue which was ridiculed, as I understand it, in the parliamentary secretary's response at the end of the second reading debate only the other day. I am not quite sure I understood what Senator Herron was saying had been done today. Perhaps he could clarify it for me: are you saying that there is some measure contained in the bill or that you have gazetted a regulation today?
Obviously, in a short time, I will be moving an amendment which seeks to deal with this problem that we have been seeking to get addressed for some time. If the minister has addressed it, I will be only too pleased—especially given that the parliamentary secretary, in his response in closing the second reading debate the other day, wanted to ridicule the suggestion that we ought to be addressing this problem.
Senator Herron, I am just not sure what it is you said and what that means in practice. We will obviously come to that in a minute but, if you can clarify that, that will give me a few minutes to think about it and whether or not we intend to proceed with our amendment when we get to that stage.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I thank Senator Evans. I am advised that the minister clarified it by 
 regulation today. If you wish me to repeat what I just said, I am happy to do so.
—It might be helpful.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I will give a more definitive position when we get to that amendment. On behalf of the Labor opposition, that is clearly the policy intent we were seeking, so we would be pleased if that has been done. Senator West has been campaigning on the issue for some time and has raised it in the parliament, and that was the reason we took it up in the form of an amendment.
In making some opening remarks, could I address some issues raised by Senator Allison, because I think it is important that I respond to her contribution in the second reading debate and get that out of the way. I thought Senator Allison's contribution was fairly defensive. She started by saying, `I'm going to abuse the Labor Party before they attack me, because I know they're going to attack me.' All I can say, Senator Allison, is that I gave a 20-minute speech in the second reading debate and I did not mention you. I am sorry about that, but I actually tried to deal with the public policy issues contained in the bill and Labor's critique of what was in the bill and what needed to be in the bill.
Those are criticisms that I have gained from moving around the industry in the last year and the concerns that have been raised with me by providers and consumers. I am sorry we did not fulfil your prophecies and seek to attack you. What was disappointing, I think, was that you did not provide proper attention to the public policy issues that we are trying to raise in our amendments and that are contained in the bill.
You seem to be concerned about re-arguing the debate that you said we were going to re-argue, when in fact we want to get on with debating the issues at stake. We are disappointed that you seem to have found yourself 
 in the position of wanting to defend the government policy because you have some joint ownership of that because of the position adopted during the first round of the debate on the aged care reforms.
I have no difficulty with the Democrats having some ownership of that policy; they did play a role with the government in getting that legislation passed. But I put to you that most of the critiques that we raised went to issues that you, the Democrats, said you were concerned about at that time, that Senator Woodley expressed some concern about at that time and that, with the passage of the last two years, have proven to be real problems and real issues. We would very much appreciate the Democrats seriously considering those issues and responding to them appropriately.
I know there is a tendency in the Democrats to discuss matters with the government and for that to be sufficient. I know you said, for instance, that you did not have time to consider our amendments. Like all parties, I have to go to my party room and get approval for amendments. Having done so, they were distributed to you as soon as possible. You have now had a week to consider those, so I think that criticism falls by the wayside. I think it is a criticism the Democrats would have trouble sustaining, given that on occasions they have been known to put in amendments fairly late in a debate.
I want to urge you to consider something other than the government's point of view and to engage positively with us. It is quite frustrating from the opposition's point of view if the Democrat response on serious public policy issues is to just talk behind closed doors with the government and not to engage in the public policy debate in this chamber. It is a critique I made of Senator Lees's and the Democrats' performance in the debate on the previous bill. It is a concern I raise again in relation to this bill. I do not mind the Democrats talking to the government. I do not mind them being convinced of the government's arguments if that is the case, but I do expect—and I think we have a right to expect—you to participate in the parliamentary process in a way that allows a proper debate of the issues in the parliament. Your second reading 
 contribution, where you said that you are going to vote against all Labor amendments because we are going to be mean to you and where there was certain paranoia about the previous debate, was a fairly immature response.
You have a legitimate point to make, which is that a number of providers in the industry are nervous about some of the propositions we are putting up. That is true. They were nervous about and reluctant to accept them last time; they are nervous about and reluctant to accept them this time. But I do not think it is my role to be the voice of providers in this parliament. I do not think the Democrats see it as their role either. Consumers also have a role. Aged pensioners, the people who live in these facilities, have a view. I urge the Democrats to seriously consider the views of the organisations that represent those people. I also want to make the point that we are debating this bill because the government withdrew the previous bill. It is our first opportunity in two years to debate aged care reforms. It is the first opportunity for us to make positive amendments to government legislation and regulation for the better of aged care. If we do not take this opportunity, who knows when we will get the next opportunity?
You may well have meetings with the minister. You may well have assurances that I do not know about, but this is the proper place for the scrutiny of government legislation. This is the proper place for the debate on aged care reform agendas and some of the holes and problems that are emerging with those. The Labor Party have applied themselves seriously to those. We have amendments which we are committed to, which seek to raise serious public policy issues and which we would appreciate you addressing. I make that plea because we got off on the wrong foot at the start of the second reading debate. That is unfortunate, but I want to make this bill better. There are ways it can be improved. I am encouraged by the fact that the minister seems to have suddenly discovered that one of the criticisms we have made is true.
I had a great deal of concern about our without prejudice piece of correspondence to 
 the Democrats being read out by the minister at the end of the second reading debate. I have spoken to the Democrats about that. I accept the assurance that that was an error. We expect to be able to deal on a positive level with the Democrats and to have discussions on a confidential basis. We are keen to get the Democrats to move some way towards recognising the real problems that are occurring with the aged care reforms and towards fixing those up, particularly in relation to accountability for funds paid by pensioners in fees for services provided by nursing homes. We urge the Democrats to seriously consider those. We make our suggestions seriously. We are prepared to consider alternative propositions, but we do want to make this bill better.
We do not want to indulge in wasteful rhetoric and abuse, which is what you accused us of. We have a series of amendments which we would like to have passed because we think they are important for aged care in this country. We do not think meetings with the minister and assurances from the minister that the government will look at them some time down the track will resolve those issues. These are real public policy issues about accountability for government and about residents' funds that need to be addressed. I put those comments on the record because I am keen to engage the Democrats in improving the bill. The political reality is that, if I cannot engage the Democrats in improving the bill, the government will have the numbers and it will roll on through. That is unfortunate. We would appreciate some support for our amendments. We will be moving them as we come to them, and we hope to get some support for them.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-27,"—I would like to respond to the comments of Senator Evans. The Democrats are very keen to engage in discussion and policy debate. I do not think we have ever said that we would not do that. In fact, that is the key problem that we have with the amendments that the ALP has put up: not so much that we have not had a chance to see them but that consultation has not taken place with the industry. If one thing is very clear, it is that you cannot introduce change in this whole sector without 
 having roundtable discussions that work through these issues and provisions in a very thorough manner with the consumers, the nursing home providers and others with an interest in this area. It is not the intention of the Democrats to step aside from any sort of discussion or consultation with anybody, including the ALP.
Senator Evans may have caught me at a bad time on Thursday. I remind him that it was a very long day on which there were a number of attacks on me and the Democrats by the ALP. Perhaps he caught the rough end of the pineapple, as my mother would say. I hope we are not on the wrong foot. I am new to aged care, as Senator Evans would be aware. My colleague Senator John Woodley previously had this portfolio. He was the one with the carriage of the legislation the last time around. We are not into wasteful rhetoric and abuse either, so I look forward to this debate and to reason and argument being the order of the day rather than any sort of ill feeling amongst us. I can assure Senator Evans that we have a great deal of sympathy for the sentiment behind the amendments that have been put forward. We are happy to take those discussions further with the sector and to argue them through.
 We have not stepped aside from recognising the real problems, to use your words, Senator Evans. If you have another look at my second reading speech, you will notice that we criticised the government for their lack of response to the Productivity Commission report, and we will keep doing that. We are not here to simply say, `We came on board with the first round of legislation, so we now own it, and we mustn't criticise anybody for it.' We will, as we always do, make judgments about legislation and about amendments based on argument. I hope we can continue in that fashion.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,—We are happy for these amendments and requests to be taken together. Senator West and I have a few general queries and comments that might best be dealt with before we deal with the amendments. I think Senator West wants to raise a couple of issues and I wanted to raise a couple of issues.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I wanted to go back to the announcement that the minister just made in relation to definition of `home'—that is, where the assets plus the home are less than $23,500. I am 
 fascinated that this announcement occurred tonight, when Sue Irvine and the others that you mentioned have been asking the department and the minister about this for more than 12 months. It was an issue prior to the last federal election, when I was up there campaigning—and that is just on 12 months ago now—and I am wondering why it has taken the government so long. I understood you to say that the definition of the `home' would be altered. I would like to know what the definition is going to be, and `can' is the word that was used. What weight does that have? Does that still allow people some discretion?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am advised that the definition has been changed to exclude anybody who has a home valued at less than $23,500. I think it would probably help Senator West if I gave her a copy of the principles under section 96(1) of the Aged Care Act, dated today.
—Perhaps you might table that.
—Yes, I will table it.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I wanted to ask a series of questions regarding the pre-October 1997 residents. The opposition is not seeking to move amendments to this. I just want to be clear about what the government is doing here. There is no provision, as I understand it, for payment to those residents who are owed refunds. The payments will be made to the providers. I was most concerned to understand what mechanisms were in place to ensure that all residents, and former residents now deceased, had access to these payments. As I understand it, from reading the explanatory memorandum, the government is not paying any moneys to those residents or to the estates of those residents. I want to know what accountability mechanisms are in place to ensure that those residents receive the funds that they are entitled to.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am advised that the act is being amended to give providers the 
 duty to repay the amounts and to do other things to facilitate the repayment. I would draw Senator Evans's attention to page 8 of the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 . At the bottom of that page, after paragraph 56/1K, section 25 refers to that.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I thank the minister. I understand that, but I suppose I am referring to your passing on the responsibility for paying back these funds to the aged care provider by that measure. What accountability measures are in place to ensure that people who are entitled to these refunds get them? I know that you are passing the responsibility on and you say to the providers, `Take reasonable steps to find any care recipients.' But what does that mean? Who is accountable when people or their estates are not paid; and what measures are in place to make sure that people are paid?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,—I am advised that the department will be notified when somebody has left a facility or died. The providers then will be required to repay either the estate or the person involved. The department will be aware of that because it will have to be notified of it. The department then will check back to ensure that that is done.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I thank the minister for his answer. Minister, doesn't that then beg the question: why aren't you directly paying them? It seems to me that this is a promise the Prime Minister made to those residents. Why aren't you, as a government, taking responsibility for paying back those residents?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I will seek advice on that. But my understanding would be that it is occurring and it is done administratively. It can only be done once notification occurs. But I will seek advice on that to see whether there is anything further to add.
What I said previously was correct: the providers in the first instance notify, and then the department takes over after that. So we are fulfilling the statement that was made.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I am sorry, Minister, I do not mean to be difficult, but it is not clear to me how that works. In the paragraph to which you referred me, as I understand it, you ask that the providers take reasonable steps to locate and pay them. In essence, I want to know whether you can give a guarantee that all residents and all estates of deceased residents will be refunded the money in a prompt and efficient manner. Is the government giving that guarantee? It seems to me that, under your regime, there is no guarantee that that money will find its way into the hands of residents or former residents.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I think there are certain circumstances—for example, where there is a nil amount of charge—which will exempt the resident's supplement from being payable to the provider. For example, this could include where the provider cannot locate the resident, or where there is no estate or legal representative or other specified person to whom the repayment can be made. You cannot say that it will always occur.
In these cases, the secretary must use her or his best endeavours to find the resident or legal representative to whom the payment should be made. If the secretary's best endeavours are unsuccessful in finding the care resident, legal representative or other person as specified, no refund will occur and the Commonwealth's liability for repayment will cease at that point. You cannot guarantee that in every instance this will occur, as has been requested by Senator Evans. But certainly the best endeavours will be made to ensure that the estate or the person is identified. Inevitably the provider, in the first instance, will be the one to notify the department. So, in summary, I can give the assurance that repayments will be made in all practical legal circumstances.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I am just not clear how the minister can give that assurance given that you are paying the provider; you are not actually taking responsibility, as I understand it, for paying the residents. What I want to 
 know is the accountability mechanism that ensures, one, that all the residents and their estates are funded and, two, that all providers forward on to those residents the moneys you provide to them? What accountability measures are in place to make sure that occurs?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—Just to clarify it, I hope: for the residents still in care the providers pay the refund and report to the department. So there is accountability in that regard from the department. For those who have left care or have died, so that their estates are required to get a refund, the department takes over the payment. There is a team of staff in the department to track them down. I hope that clarifies the situation for Senator Evans. If I can repeat that: for those residents still in care, the providers pay that back and report to the department so there is accountability there; and for those who have left care or who have passed away and their estates are responsible, the department takes over the payment. They have the staff to do that.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,—I thank the minister for his answer. Could the minister point me to the section in the bill which requires that reporting process to the department for those currently in care?,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—Section 88-2 of the act on page 326 under the title `Approved providers to keep records classified in Records Principles'. So it will be under those principles. Subsection (1) states:
An approved provider must keep records of the kind specified in the Records Principle.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I do not think that answered the question. You said they are required to provide the reporting mechanism to account for their payment of the refund. I want to know where that is required of them by this bill? You read me a general principle from the act about keeping records. You are paying an amount of money to the provider to cover the refund. What I want to know is where it says they are required to pay that to the 
 resident and report to the department that they have paid that money, where they are to account for that money and where they are to pay back to the department moneys that they have not properly refunded or been able to refund.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—That is conferred by the principles of the act as I have just stated. It is up to the department to ensure that that occurs. I do not see any difficulty with that. But I will check to see if the officers have anything further to add to it.
I can see the point that Senator Evans is referring to. We will have to check further as there seems to be some difficulty in finding where it is precisely in the act. As it is covered under the principles, I would like to ask whether Senator Evans wishes to pursue that further.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I do because I am not convinced that there are proper accountability mechanisms for these refunds to be paid. While I am happy to accept that that is the intention, I just want to make sure that the scheme does provide what you claim for it. I could not find where you ensured that the refunds were made. You sort of chose to give the money to the providers in the first instance and said, `Let them sort it out.' I want to be assured, one, that they are only paid for what they refund; two, that they account to the department for that; and, three, that all people are refunded their money. I am not convinced at this stage that that is necessarily the case. If I have missed that section about the accountability of the department, I am happy to have it pointed out to me.
My final question on this area is: what is happening in terms of the assisted residents? As I understand it, residents that have assets between $23,000 and $45,000 are only paid a partial payment of $2 or $4 a day. Are the providers being refunded for the full $12 for those residents? If so, are they to provide the full $12 to the resident or are they to provide reimbursement for what the resident paid? If so, who keeps the difference or are you 
 working out exactly what was paid and having that remitted?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—To answer Senator Evans's first question, on page 251 of the Aged Care Act, under part 4.3—Accountability, section 63-1 entitled `Responsibilities of approved providers', subsection (m), the accountability provisions are:
such other responsibilities as are specified in the Accountability Principles.
In other words, it is a sort of catchphrase for any other item that arises where an attempt might be made, inadvertently or by intent, to avoid that responsibility. It is covered in the act itself under section 63-1, subsection (m). In relation to the second question, I am advised that the provider gets the full $12. The refunds are what the residents paid.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—That begs the obvious question: does the provider keep the difference or does the provider remit the difference to the department? If you are only reimbursing the resident the lesser of the amount they paid and you have paid the provider the greater amount, the full rate, what happens to the difference?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am advised that most of the residents will have paid the full $12. If they have paid less than that the provider will keep that.
—Before I put the question, I respectfully remind the chamber that the question is that requests (1) to (6) and amendments (1) to (2) be put cognately. I therefore put the question: that the requests and the amendments be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—Before we move on I want to raise a second question, the question of revocation. I wonder if the minister could explain to the chamber what is behind the problem with revocation? How many providers have had their approved provider status 
 revoked under the Aged Care Act? The explanatory memorandum indicates that the department is unable to move currently because of difficulties with the current legislation. I wondered how many providers the department had identified as being targets for revocation but where it has been unable to act because of the problems in the current legislation—really, the justification for the revocation provision.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—The government is committed to ensuring quality care and services for older Australians and, as part of that commitment, where there is evidence that a provider is no longer suitable to provide aged care services their approved provider status should be revoked. This will affect only a very small minority of providers, but action such as abuse of residents or defrauding the Commonwealth demands serious action.
It has become evident that, under the current provisions of the Aged Care Act, the current time frame for notice of revocation limits the ability of the department to take this necessary action while at the same time providing for continuity of care in an orderly way. These amendments will ensure that strong action can be taken against providers who are not suitable persons to provide care. They will also ensure that alternative and appropriate care arrangements for existing residents have been made when this action is taken. These amendments will allow revocation to be undertaken in stages as alternative care arrangements are made for existing residents. As an example, the first stage is likely to stop a provider from taking any new residents. Then, as alternative arrangements are made, each facility could be closed one by one.
These amendments also allow for revocation to take effect without a gradual limitation on approvals—for example, where all care recipients in a residential aged care service can be found alternative accommodation at the same time. The proposals will add flexibility which will enable the government to deal with the exceptional circumstances where there is a real need to stop particular provid 
 ers from providing services in order to protect frail, elderly Australians.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I appreciate the minister's answer, and no doubt we will come to the issue about whether those provisions are adequate later on in terms of the care provided to residents during that period of staged close-down of a facility. But I just want to be clear: is the minister saying that no providers have had their approved status revoked under the Aged Care Act?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am advised that there have been four revocations in the past 10 years, so the government's bill strengthens the approved provider mechanism. It better enables the government to take action where required while protecting the residents.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I appreciate that answer, Minister. I would actually prefer the answer to the question, which was: have any approved providers had their status revoked under the Aged Care Act 1997?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,—The answer is none.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—I would like to ask the minister a question regarding accreditation and the cost of the new provisions. I am doing this because I have a letter from providers in Tasmania which says that the final part of the reforms being put into place is the accreditation principles and the fees to be charged. The letter says:
Tasmanian providers would like to put forward their views in regard to those fees. Previously the cost of Monitoring in Nursing Homes was carried out by the Commonwealth, without any cost to the provider. The new scheme of Accreditation is of real benefit, and our members are happy to see such a system introduced.
However, we cannot afford any fees for Accreditation Why?, simply because of two factors:
-	 It did not cost anything in the past, and therefore, any cost will take money away from the direct care of elderly residents. On top of this, there is the money providers have already spent in preparing for Accreditation (none of it funded by 
 the government, and estimated to be between $20,000 to $40,000 per annum per provider), which has also taken money away from direct care.
-	 The introduction of a decrease in funding for Tasmanian providers to the tune of around $75,000 to $100,000 per annum, per provider, means that providers in Tasmania simply cannot afford to pay any Accreditation fees.
The letter goes on to point out that being forced to pay those fees will lead to a real diminution in care standards in Tasmania. Would the minister address this real problem? I know that he has been written to by concerned care providers in Tasmania about this matter, particularly about that cost of self-regulation of $20,000 to $40,000 per annum, which is, as the minister will know, a very real impact on the finances of homes, particularly homes which have, say, 45 beds.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—Senator Brown refers particularly to Tasmania. Senator Brown would also be aware that hospitals actually pay accreditation themselves, because it is in their best interests to go through the accreditation procedure. So we can draw that analogy of where there is no subsidy. In relation to aged care facilities, the fees of all providers will be subsidised by the government to some extent, in contradistinction to the other. All but small residential aged care facilities will be required to pay a fee to cover some of the cost of accreditation, but the cost of those fees to each service is consequently expected to be less than one per cent of average annual income.
In addition, the government is providing a full subsidy for small services. That means that services with fewer than 20 places will not be required to pay any fees at all for accreditation. I know that Senator Brown referred to 25 to 45 beds—and I will come to that in a moment—but services between 20 and 25 places will receive a tapered subsidy, which means on average a saving for them of more than $2,000 each. These fees are, by definition, affordable and reasonable.
Senator Brown referred to homes with 25 to 45 beds. There is a sliding scale, as I mentioned, which tapers out between 20 to 25 
 places. As for a fee of $40,000, I am assured that that does not occur at all. There is no place in the country where an accreditation fee of $40,000 would occur, so I am not sure what Senator Brown is referring to there. Overall, the structure is giving the industry the partnership with government that the aged care facilities wanted. The aged care facilities wanted a process of accreditation, just as the hospitals did.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—I thank the minister for that. I was quoting from a letter from Mr Mark Stemm, President of Aged Care Tasmania. In that letter, amongst other things, he said:
. . . there is the money providers have already spent in preparing for Accreditation (none of it funded by the government, and estimated to be between $20,000 to $40,000 per annum per provider) . . . 
I guess this is preparation money that has been spent in getting ready for accreditation. The letter goes on to say:
The introduction of a decrease in funding for Tasmanian providers—
and I think that is under coalescence—
to the tune of around $75,000 to $100,000 per annum, per provider, means that providers in Tasmania simply cannot afford to pay any Accreditation fees.
I would be pleased if the minister would provide me or the committee with that sliding scale of fees, so that I can give it to my correspondent, and also if he would say what measures have been put in place to help Tasmanian providers—which, unlike those in other states, are going to get less funding because of this business of coalescence which, as I understand it, is to bring all states into parity as far as the amount of funding that is available is concerned.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I have been advised that every provider has been sent that table, so I would be happy to provide that to Senator Brown. Providers in Tasmania this year will receive an additional $104.4 million, which is an increase of $6.6 million over and above what they received last year.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—I take it from that last reply that the minister is saying that Tasmanian homes are going to actually see an increase—and not a decrease, as my correspondent fears—in their funding this year and in subsequent years.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am advised that there will be, as I said previously, an increase of $6.6 million over and above what they received last year, which will mean that this year they will receive an estimated $104.4 million.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—Thank you. The second part of my last question was: is this increase in funding going to be maintained, and does it take into account indexation?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,—I am advised that Tasmania will continue to have funding increases from indexation and other factors.,SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—I am informed—and I would like the minister to comment on this specifically, if he would—that over the past three years the government has been reducing the level of care money by using a low indexation rate, and that the average nursing home received an increase of 1.04 per cent for the 1999-2000 financial year but has had to pay wage increases of around two per cent for the same year. The correspondent makes the point that this reduces care funding by around one per cent per annum or $15,000 per annum for an average nursing home and that that is money lost out of care. Under the proposed coalescence this indexation rate will do nothing for three of the next five years, putting nursing homes further behind. Are those figures wrong? If they are, can the minister provide the committee with the figures which show where they are wrong?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—The government's  aged care reforms have significantly increased funding for residential aged care in all states and territories, including Tasmania and Vic 
 toria. In 1995-96, for example, Labor provided $2.5 billion for residential aged care. This year, 1999-2000, the coalition will provide an estimated $3.5 billion. That is an increase of 42 per cent since the coalition came to government, so I would have to dispute the statement made in that letter.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—Yes, but we are talking about two different things there. The minister is using gross figures for a service that is costing more and more each year because of the increased use by Australians of those services and I am using percentages. However, the minister is saying that nursing homes have never had it so good and that they are receiving increased amounts, including those in Tasmania. My correspondent says that coalescence will cost a 45-bed nursing home an average of $82,125 per year. You would need to make up a fair deal to put that at a positive. Has the minister factored in the coalescence factor as far as Tasmanian nursing homes are concerned?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—I appreciate that Senator Brown is being an advocate for his correspondent but the reality is the minister has not made a decision about the coalescence. That was recommended, as I understand it, in the Productivity Commission's report but a decision has not been made. There has been a campaign on this issue for quite some time, which is obviously being continued tonight by courtesy of Senator Brown. But one cannot make an allegation about something that has not yet occurred, which is the intent of Senator Brown's correspondent.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—Fair enough. Yes, I am advocating this because this is a Tasmanian constituency that I am concerned about. When is the minister going to make that decision and what other information, other than the information already available to her, is being considered that has delayed the decision? Can the minister at least take the worry out of budgeting for nursing homes right across the country? Some states will be advantaged by coalescence and other states disadvantaged. Tasmania, particularly, will be disadvantaged. 
 I think it is fair for me to say tonight that any responsible budgeter for a nursing home will have to take into account the potential for this decision to be made somewhere during the coming financial year. Will the decision be made during the current financial year and, if not, when?",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—As all of us know in the Senate, Senator Rod Kemp frequently states that this is a consultative government. In relation to coalescence, the government is involved in considerable consultation. The minister is not going to be rushed into a decision that has taken some time—it is admitted—but will make the decision as a result of considerable consultation both with providers and recipients of care. At the appropriate time that decision will be made. As far as I understand it, a time line has not been set, but I can assure Senator Brown that it will be in the best interests of both the providers of residential aged care facilities and the people who are resident in them.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I have a couple of remarks to make because this issue of coalescence is important. I was glad to see Senator Allison raise it in her speech on the second reading, and Senator Brown is pursuing the interests of Tasmanian aged care interests tonight. That is welcome because this is an issue that we have been pressing the government on since January. The Treasurer received the report on coalescence from the Productivity Commission in January and did not release it until March, after a lot of pressure from industry, the opposition and others to have it publicly released.
We were promised there would be a consultation period in the May-June period, with a decision being announced shortly afterwards. We are now getting various stories about the next month or two. I hear that the last story the providers got was that it would be by the end of the calendar year but the story varies from day to day. The government admitted there was a problem with the policy and sent it off for independent review by the Productivity Commission, which is not usually a 
 friend of those concerned with a caring, sharing society. However, the commission produced a report which was highly critical of the government's coalescence policy and pointed out the inequities in the policy, particularly for states—as Senator Brown quite rightly says—like Tasmania and Victoria.
 The industry is extremely frustrated that the minister is unable to deal with the Productivity Commission report and give a proper government response to it. It is scandalous that there is no direction coming from the government. Senator Brown, like the industry, makes the point that people need to be able to plan on the basis of the conditions that will be applying in their industry. The industry is in a state of great uncertainty because of the failure to get clear direction of what the government intends to do.
The government said it would refer the issue to the Productivity Commission. It got an answer which said that the government's policy ought to be abandoned. For the last eight or nine months it sat on that report and failed to respond. It has consulted to the point where the industry does not want to be consulted anymore, because all they hear is talk. They want some direction. They want some positive policy response to the issues that have arisen. Providers and the community in Tasmania are rightly concerned to know what the answer is.
So I really do think the government owes the Senate, the aged care community and the aged care residents an answer on when it will know what the policy will be. Really, Minister, they ought to know what the policy will be. The minister has had long enough, and she cannot continue to ignore the need for some direction from the government. So I add my support to Senator Brown's and Senator Allison's comments that this is one of the key issues that are at stake in aged care at the moment.
I understand that the minister in the chamber may not be in a position to give those assurances tonight and that, in the end, the buck does not stop with him—he is the messenger on this occasion—but it is the most pressing issue and it is causing uncertainty. 
 The government must respond and must address the issues raised by the Productivity Commission in a proper way and quickly. It is not good enough to say, `Oh well, we are still looking at it, we are still consulting.' I have not met anyone in the industry who wants to be consulted anymore; they want the problem fixed and they want an answer as to when it is going to be fixed.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—I thank Senator Evans. I put a specific situation to the minister. This is the calculation that coalescence would cost a 45-bed nursing home in Tasmania $82,125 per year. The government will be aware what that means to an average nursing home's budget. I know that a lot of figures have been worked through here.

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—As I said before, the government has made no decision, so it is a hypothetical. I cannot respond to a hypothetical on behalf of the minister.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-09-27,"—But to arrive at a decision, surely the government has to do cost estimates of what that decision is going to mean. This is what the nursing homes have done in Tasmania. They are saying that their cost estimate is that, if coalescence proceeds, it is going to cost an average 45-bed nursing home $82,125 a year. What I want to know from the government is whether that is consistent with the government's thinking. If it is not, what figures can the government give the com 
 mittee about what coalescence would cost such a nursing home in Tasmania and indeed in other states that would be involved by that policy being invoked. I think what I am putting to the government is that there is a lot of fear in nursing homes in Tasmania about what coalescence will mean to their budgeting. They are looking ahead four or five years and they have some figures which are quite frightening. It would be good for the government through this committee to be able to reassure them that their figures are not right; that the impact of coalescence would be much less; and that, in this absence of a decision being made by the minister, they can at least work out how their forward planning may be affected if the minister, the government and the cabinet do come down in favour of this policy.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

—You're showing your age.
—I appreciate that I am showing my age. It was just that the phrase was used with me yesterday, Senator Evans, and I had forgotten it. It brought home to me the thought that that is what would you expect them to say—that it was going to cost an enormous sum. For Senator Evans's benefit, the phrase was used in the supplement to one of the weekend newspapers recently.
—You are not going to do a John Profumo on us, are you?
—That case was mentioned. To get back to the point, these hypotheticals cannot be responded to, because a decision has not been reached. I would expect people to talk about large sums of money—and it is a considerable sum, as Senator Brown has said—but it is a hypothetical.

Really, the point here is that if the government is going to make an important decision like this it must know what the impact of that decision is going to be. Or is the minister saying that the government does not know what the impact will be and it has to wait until after its decision is made? We cannot have this both ways. What I am putting to the good senator is a request for the committee to be given whatever work the government has done. You cannot make a decision like this without doing your homework.

Chair, you will agree that he cannot have it both ways. I believe that the government has done the figures on it. I do not think the government would be able to really say otherwise.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I hate to be presumptuous, but I want, first of all, to tell Senator Brown that I have got the figures on the effect of coalescence on Tasmania. It is not a happy story, but I am happy to provide them to him. I got them on notice from the government some weeks ago. I will formally move opposition amendment No. 2,  because opposition request No. 1 was the one that related to the $23,000—
—Let us be clear: you are moving request No. 1?
—My understanding was that that was the amendment that dealt with the question of homes valued at less than $23,000—
—This is opposition amendment No. 2?
—No. 1; and it was not my intention to proceed with that—on the basis that the government have said that they have today made a regulation addressing the problem. I was going to break 
 the habit of a lifetime and accept them at their word and not proceed with that amendment.
—So at this stage you are actually bypassing amendment No. 1 and request No. 1?
—Yes, that is right. The minister indicated to the committee earlier that the regulation had been gazetted today.
—I beg your pardon, Senator Evans. You are now moving opposition amendment No. 2?
—I am dropping opposition request No. 1 and moving opposition amendments Nos 1 and 7, and seek leave that they be taken together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 1, item 4, page 4 (after line 5), after subsection (7C), add:
(7D)	 Where an approved provider has been issued with a notice under paragraph (7)(a) or (b), the Secretary must appoint an *authorised officer to monitor the care of care recipients in all residential care services operated by that approved provider. The authorised officer may recommend to the Minister any action necessary to protect the interests of those care recipients.
(7)	 Schedule 1, page 21 (after line 19), after item 41, insert:
41A  Before paragraph 91-1(2)(a)
Insert:
	 (aa)	 monitoring the care of care recipients in residential care services operated by approved providers who have been issued with a notice under paragraph 10-3(7)(a) or (b);
These amendments deal with the appointment of an officer to monitor the care of residents. These Labor amendments seek to insert into the act a provision that will require the appointment of a departmental officer to monitor the care of residents where a provider is having their approval to operate a facility revoked. This amendment addresses the concerns expressed by a number of parties in the sector, including providers, about the effect of the bill.
The government's bill inserts provisions that will allow for the gradual wind-down of a facility where a provider has failed to provide appropriate care to residents and a decision has been made to revoke their approved provider status. The minister indicated earlier in the debate that the wind-down was because of difficulties in terms of placing a large number of residents into alternative care at the same time. I accept that that is a difficulty, because alternative nursing facilities are often oversubscribed.
We are trying to deal here with a very small number of providers who may be impacted by the decision to revoke. We think the government's bill raises significant concerns about ensuring that the rights of residents remaining in the facility are protected. It is all very well to say that we are going to have this wind-down, but we have to understand the psychology of the provider who will be operating in that circumstance. The wind-down could take a considerable period because of the government's difficulty in placing those residents in alternative accommodation. Some residents may have to wait months while beds are found in alternative facilities.
That has certainly been our experience when dealing with providers seeking to leave the industry in recent times. We are concerned that the provider that either has been forced out of the industry or is seeking to leave the industry loses interest in the provision of care and that the sanctions that are currently available to the government fail to provide sufficient protection, because you are dealing with a provider who does not necessarily have a long-term interest in the provision of care, someone who is exiting the industry.
Under our amendment the secretary would appoint an authorised officer who would have powers set out under division 90 of the act to monitor the care of residents in the facility. This officer would then be required to report directly to the minister on any action necessary to protect the interests of residents. What we are doing is signalling the need to care for residents in this unfortunate position and clearly identify who is accountable for ensuring that their interests are protected. We request that the minister make a number of 
 determinations under the sanction principles under the act to strengthen the sanctions against providers who refuse to cooperate with authorised officers in this situation. We believe the current sanctions under the act would be ineffective in dealing with providers who are having their approved provider status revoked.
We believe with our amendments the sanctions would be strengthened and the minister would be able to protect the interests of all residents. Residents and their relatives would be confident that a departmental officer would be appointed to monitor the care of residents and report any problems directly to the minister. If these amendments are not carried, then residents and their families will have to rely on the existing monitoring and sanction provisions of the act, which may be appropriate for the majority of providers who act responsibly but we believe will be ineffective and are proved to be ineffective for persistent poor providers. We think this is a very necessary adjunct to the protections available for residents.
We have a situation where a shake-up in the industry is occurring with regard to accreditation and certification. This is an issue that is more pressing now than in normal circumstances as a number of providers are faced with an inability to continue in the industry or a desire to get out of the industry because of the new standards.
We welcome the new standards and we welcome the accreditation principles. We support those measures to improve the standards of care. But a number of instances have been brought to our attention in recent times where people leaving the industry have no incentive to continue to provide care. In fact, instances have been brought to our attention where providers have been established as not providing appropriate care, where there are real health risks to residents and where the care is clearly less than satisfactory. Under the scheme instituted in this bill, that facility will be gradually wound down: the provider who is leaving the industry, who is in dispute with the department and who is not providing appropriate care will continue to have care of residents for up to a number of months on 
 some occasions. We think it is important that we have proper protection for those residents left in that nursing facility.
We think this is a very appropriate and necessary adjunct to the powers already under the act to make sure that those residents receive the protections they deserve during that period, a time when they will be most vulnerable. We think it is important that this provision be included since we have already decided to support the phase down, the revocation of the licence in stages, because that process allows for that provider to be in charge for a considerable period of time as they gradually run down the number of residents in their facility. We think this is important. We do not accept the argument that there are enough powers there currently. Our experiences and the experiences of residents and their families in recent months have confirmed our concern that there is not enough protection. We think this is the way to solve that problem.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-27,"—The Democrats will not be supporting these amendments. Again, as I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, we support the sentiment and think there is some merit in the amendments. But, again, we have to be guided by those we have had a chance to speak with in the industry about these amendments. There is concern within the industry that the amendments may bring with them unintended consequences because of inadequate consultation time and inadequate time to consider the implications of how they will fit with the existing provisions in the act. We do recognise that the Council on the Ageing have voiced their support for the amendments, and we believe it is also important to consult with the providers of aged care before supporting such amendments.
I think we have had a very positive relationship with the peak bodies representing aged care in the past and have always found them to be very reasonable and very open to discussion and cooperative in working to improve consumer protection. I think it is counter to the interests of the majority of aged care providers to allow the minority of providers who do not maintain high standards of 
 care in facilities to continue to operate, putting the interests of their residents at risk. However, it is important to avoid introducing amendments, even if they are well meaning, which might have unintended consequences and which may make them unworkable for the majority of decent aged care providers. While the Democrats do recognise that protecting the rights of aged care consumers must be a very high priority, we also recognise just how counterproductive it would be to thrust ill-considered and potentially unworkable changes on the industry; and that would benefit neither providers nor consumers.
I understand that the act already makes provision for the protection of residents in circumstances such as those raised by the opposition. I ask the minister to once again provide us with an outline of what these are. If consumer groups in the industry believe these existing protections are inadequate, then the Democrats are happy to take part in further discussions with all the relevant parties to come up with changes which will be workable for everyone.
I will go to a couple of the comments made by aged care providers in support of those arguments. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Ltd asked, `Who decides whether the provider has a demonstrated commitment? Who decides whether the provider has met his or her responsibilities?' and questions of that sort. Aged and Community Services Australia said:
In the short time available to us we have attempted to understand the implications of the proposed amendments. We can understand the sentiments which have prompted the opposition to move in this way, but we believe the action proposed and/or the actual wording of each amendment is unhelpful. We do, however, agree that the amendments highlight certain problems in the current system and we will want to put in place a considered process through which these issues can be addressed. We are particularly concerned to ensure the total protection of residents in situations where an approved provider is acting outside the requirements for both provision of quality care and/or the protection of residents' funds.
Uniting Community Services Australia said that these amendments amounted to sweeping changes to the current legislative framework. They were very concerned that there had been 
 little or no involvement of stakeholders in the development of those amendments and urged industry consultation before progressing further with decisions in relation to the intent and outcome of such amendments. Catholic Health Australia said that the proposals are complex and would impose administrative burdens on the industry which must go through a wide consultative process before being adopted.
That is just an example of some of the quotes from letters that have been sent to the Democrats on these issues. While we are not prepared to support these amendments, we are happy to talk about them. We think it is worth while talking about them to ensure that there are those consumer protection mechanisms in place, but it is too soon for us to support the amendments in their current form.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-09-27,"—The government respects the intent of the amendment, but the legal advice is that this amendment is inconsistent with part 6.4 of the act and is more narrow. It does not add anything to the mechanisms, powers and duties already in the act and so is redundant. Therefore, the government opposes this amendment as there are already mechanisms in place to protect care recipients where the approved provider status of the care provider is being revoked. Currently, the Aged Care Act 1997 allows approved provider status to be revoked as a sanction where providers have breached their responsibilities under the act or where they are no longer suitable to continue to provide care.
To facilitate this process in both cases, there are teams of departmental officers in each state and territory known as `closure working groups' that work with the industry to identify suitable alternative accommodation if required for care recipients. In addition, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency continues to monitor compliance with care standards during the process of closing residential aged care facilities. The agency has powers to make recommendations to the secretary about appropriate action to be taken where care standards are not being met. The agency is 
 closely involved in monitoring in these cases. These mechanisms have acted to protect the interests of care recipients since the implementation of the aged care structural reform package.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I want to address a few remarks to the Democrats first in order to try to sway them. First of all, we ought not dismiss so lightly the views of the consumer groups because this is the issue that they are most concerned about—that is, the protection of residents. On the one hand, Senator Allison reads letters from providers—the people who run the nursing homes—which say that there may be unintended consequences. The minister says that these measures are redundant and have no effect. So the providers are saying that the unintended consequences is their reason for not being prepared to consider supporting these changes and the minister is saying that they are redundant.
That begs the question: where is the truth in this? It is the case that COTA, the APSF and other advocacy groups are supporting this approach because they are concerned about what happens to the residents in those nursing homes. I accept that the vast majority of providers act with goodwill, but they are the providers of the service. They would be reluctant to accept provisions which impose further accountability measures, if you like, on them. With the best will in the world, that would be their starting point, and I accept that. But the people whose job it is to represent the interests of the consumers are most keen to encourage this amendment in particular because it goes to the protection of those residents.
Senator Allison made general comments about the groups' concerns about or qualifications with our amendments, but most of those go to the questions that will come later on in the debate. They do not go directly to that. What I ask the Democrats to do is to not tell me the position of the providers but to tell me their position in the protection of residents' rights, because it is you who get to vote and you who get to make a determination on the issue.  
I want to point out clearly to the Democrats that this amendment applies to people who are having their licences revoked. This does not apply to the majority of providers; it applies to people who the department and the minister have said ought to be out of the industry. So talking about unintended consequences and the majority of providers and those doing good work in the sector is not a relevant response. We are talking about the people who the department have finally got around to saying should not be in the industry and who are not competent to provide quality aged care. What we are saying is that a person who has got to the point where they are not acceptable ought to be monitored.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-09-27,"—This afternoon two media releases arrived on the fax machine in my office. The first was from Qantas and the second from Ansett. Both dealt with the same issue—the impact of the Howard government's GST on airfares. Both represent bad news for the all-important tourism industry in my state, the state of Tasmania. The Ansett release advised:
Effective from today—that is 27 September—all domestic airfares booked for travel after 1 July, 2000, will increase by 7.5 per cent.
It continued:
A further increase, yet to be determined, for domestic travel after 1 July 2000, is likely in advance of the 1 July 2000 introduction of the GST.
According to Ansett, cost reductions from the removal of indirect taxes will be minimal because they have little impact on airline costs. Ansett advises that, in contrast to the increase in domestic fares, international airfares will fall.
Qantas chief executive, James Strong, advises in his release that an increase, also by an average of 7.5 per cent, in the price of domestic tickets came into effect last Friday. 
 Mr Strong also warned that the cost of domestic airfares might vary again before the GST is introduced next July. He said that Qantas would continue to monitor closely the cost of implementing the GST, together with the savings from wholesale sales tax, other indirect taxes and cost savings passed on by suppliers. He said:
The net result is hard to assess accurately at this stage, and there may be a need for further adjustment after reviewing the actual impact at a later date.
I think that means there may be a further rise in Qantas domestic fares before 1 July next year in line with the further increase flagged by Ansett. Both the media releases refer to the fact that business travellers can claim the GST as a deduction. But this is of little comfort to the Tasmanian tourism industry and those people who wish to holiday in that state.
International travel is GST free. Families wanting a cheap holiday in Fiji or Hawaii will not have to pay Mr Howard's new tax but a family wanting to fly to Tasmania for a holiday will; and of course they will have to pay a GST on their car hire bill, their accommodation and all their meals. The government, therefore, has built into its new tax system a bias against domestic recreational travel and, in doing so, a bias against Tasmanian tourism.
The last time I spoke about tourism in Tasmania and the importance of the industry to the economic health of my state, I referred to a report prepared for Tourism Tasmania in 1997. That report showed, based on 1995 data, that visitors to the state spent $857 million on travel. According to that report, the industry was and still is a key employer, accounting for up to 18,700 jobs, and tourism contributed up to 8.3 per cent to Tasmania's gross state product.
The tourism industry in Tasmania is built around the small business sector. The jobs it supports are in the retail, restaurant, accommodation, entertainment and recreational sectors as well as travel, and they enjoy a statewide distribution. According to the report I mentioned earlier, 50 per cent of tourism related jobs are in the southern region, 30 per 
 cent are in the northern region and 19 per cent are in the north-west.
I received a letter from the chair of Inbound Tourism Organisation of Australia Ltd, Mr Peter Doggett. In his letter dated 11 February, Mr Doggett told me that the Australian tourism industry was not opposed to the GST. I must say I am sceptical about that claim. However, he did have a concern about the impact of the GST on his particular patch. He wanted the government to zero rate tourism services sold offshore, but he did say in his letter:
The GST will pose the greatest threat in the price sensitive leisure market where Australia faces huge competition from cheaper countries.
Not only will it increase the cost of an Australian holiday, it will result in Australian product receiving less coverage in brochures overseas and less marketing exposure.
There will be a severe detrimental impact on tourism operators, particularly in regional Australia and states like Tasmania and South Australia.
In recent times, the headlines in the media have been dominated by human catastrophes, as they should have been. The world has seen a massive loss of human life through natural disaster and mass slaughter and, in this context, the GST is very much a second-order issue. But it is still there. We will have to deal with what is a regressive and all-embracing new tax from 1 July next year. For regional Australia generally and Tasmania in particular, this burden in the form of job losses, lost income and falling living standards will be very heavy indeed.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Airfares</title>,Adjournment,18,1,speech
