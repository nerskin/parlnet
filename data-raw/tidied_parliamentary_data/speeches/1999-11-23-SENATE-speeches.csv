"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to a question without notice asked by Senator Mackay today, relating to the goods and services tax.
Senator Mackay raised an important issue in a question to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, relating to the charging of a GST on fire levies and the application of stamp duties—in other words, a tax on a tax on a tax. This is a further major example of the problems with the application of a GST—the important principle of a tax on a tax. This was an issue which the Liberal-National coalition assured the Australian people would not occur in respect of a GST. They assured the Australian people there would not be a tax on a tax.
It is a grossly unfair situation where, for example, a GST is added to the cost of the purchase of small businesses, residential homes, insurance policies, property leases and those sorts of financial transactions and then, on top of that, there are various state charges, taxes, levies or whatever they may be called. This in effect is a tax on a tax. To magnify the difficulty that this causes, it is a percentage tax on top of a percentage tax. And what was Senator Kemp's response to this further example of a major problem that has emerged with the GST? Senator Kemp's response was that they would be consulting with state governments to try and establish some guidelines for the application of the GST in these circumstances.
This is not good enough. This problem has arisen in other countries. The government was forewarned of the difficulties that this would present. Indeed, I can recall the Liberal Party assuring the people of Australia in the lead-up to the last election that these sorts of state taxes and charges would be abolished and would be replaced by the GST. Not only have 
 they not been abolished, their impact has been added to with a double whammy—and, in some cases, the triple whammy of a tax on a tax on a tax. Senator Kemp referred to the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Richard Court. The Premier of Western Australia said that stamp duty had always been applied after Commonwealth taxes had been levied. I quote the Financial Review:
`The principle is uniform,' he said. `In some cases [particularly on car purchases] stamp duty will decrease, in other cases it will increase.'
The point at issue here is that we have never had a GST in this country before. We have not had a federal tax apply to a whole range of transactions, such as residential home purchase, insurance policies, purchase of a small business, a mortgage and property leases. We have never had a federal tax apply in this area before. The wholesale sales tax, which the Liberal Party is so fond of criticising, did not apply in those areas. So we have a new tax, and then state taxes applying on top of the GST. This is grossly unfair. It is ludicrous for the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, to say that this has always happened. It has not always happened, because we have not had a GST.
The Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court, would have known this well. He has been a strong advocate of a GST. It is no wonder, when his government is intending to apply the unfortunate principle of a tax on a tax on a tax. This is not the only recent example we have had. We have also had the latest saga, reported in the Financial Review, of renovated houses, which could attract a GST, depending on the extent of renovations. A draft business activity statement to be filled out by more than the one million new tax collectors—small businesses in this country—is two pages long, but the instructions are 130 pages long.
—What is your policy?
—Our policy is not a GST—a massive new tax, a massive new set of problems and headaches for small business in this country. Labor's policy is not a tax on a tax on a tax—a percentage tax on a percentage tax. The Liberal Party promised a simplified tax system and what have we got? We 
 have a more complex tax system. It is going to cost small business more to administer and what do they get in return? They get a paltry $200 to assist in this—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: State Imposts </title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-11-23,"—It is quite clear that there is very real embarrassment, especially among Labor senators from Tasmania, given that the regional forest agreement legislation will be before the Senate today and during the course of this week. What this, of course, has to do with the debate before us is that Senator Sherry, in desperation, will look at any issue other than to explain to the Tasmanian people why he and the Tasmanian Labor senators are not supporting the regional forest agreement legislation.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order on relevance. Senator Abetz is starting to talk about the Regional Forest Agreement and it is really drawing a long bow to go from the GST to regional forest agreements.
—This is usually a wide-ranging debate. However, I would ask Senator Abetz to endeavour—and I am sure that he is going to—to bring his response in line with Senator Mackay's question and Senator Kemp's reply.
—Madam Deputy President, as I was pointing out, Senator Sherry—and this is borne out by his point of order—has highlighted the fact that he and his Labor colleagues in Tasmania are highly embarrassed that they have been rolled on this legislation by the federal parliamentary Labor Party in contradistinction to the view of the trade union movement and state Labor in Tasmania. Senator Sherry therefore had to cast around for another issue to try to divert attention from his gross embarrassment.
His gross embarrassment was further highlighted by Senator Kay Patterson's very articulate interjection. She said, `Senator Sherry, what is your policy?' We then heard a diatribe that lasted for ages, with a raised voice, telling us everything that the Labor Party policy was not. He could not quite get around to the point of explaining what is Labor's tax policy—and, of course, there is 
 none. The people of Australia are entitled to know what the Labor Party's policy on taxation is. If what we are putting forward is so bad, then fine—but then tell us what your alternatives are.
—The Toorak tractors.
—Yes, the Toorak tractor policy at the last election was jettisoned and a capital gains tax policy was jettisoned, only to be followed by the jettisoning of the shadow Treasurer at the time, Gareth Evans, who is now right out of the parliament. This is their policy making at its best. Senator Sherry is following in that great tradition of Labor Party tax policy formulation in just trying to take cheap shots at the government but without presenting any alternative to the Australian people.
If he is so concerned about state taxes, why doesn't he pick up the blower to Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon and say, `Remove the stamp duties'? But, of course, he knows what would happen if he picked up the phone to Premier Jim Bacon. The Premier would be saying to Senator Sherry and his Labor colleagues, `Why are you going to vote down the regional forest agreement legislation today, which will cost Tasmanian workers?' Fifteen per cent of Tasmanians are employed in the forest industry and Senator Sherry and his Tasmanian colleagues have sold them out and put the axe right through the possibility of investment.
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—Senator Calvert quite correctly reminds me that people such as Michelle O'Byrne, the temporary member for Bass, and Sid Sidebottom and Dick Adams are highly embarrassed about Labor's lack of policy in a whole host of areas. But the one time that they do get into a policy situation, like on forestry, they get it absolutely wrong and sell out regional and rural Australia, particularly Tasmania. They just happen to think they can take Tasmania for granted because they did relatively well at the last election, but I would remind them that the people of Tasmania will be very mindful of the betrayal of the Labor Party on this issue.
Any Labor member or senator who gets up in this debate should tell the Australian people what their policy is. It is not good enough to tell us what their policy is not; we want to know what their actual policy is and we want a guarantee that they will not reject it—like they rejected their Toorak tractor tax, the capital gains tax and, above all, their former shadow Treasurer, Gareth Evans. The Australian people deserve better in debates on taxation, and it is up to the Australian Labor Party to tell the people of Australia what their policy is. If they do not have anything affirmative to say, they should not be involved in this debate.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: State Imposts </title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-11-23,"—What an embarrassing and pathetic attempt, Senator Abetz, to try to cobble your government's response together—
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Besides being painfully hurtful, Senator Crossin should in fact be directing her comments through the chair. That way, she would not be quite as personal and offensive.
—Please address the chair, Senator Crossin.
—Madam Deputy President, through you, what an embarrassing and painful attempt by Senator Abetz to try to cobble together a response in relation to what Senator Sherry had said. We raised an issue today, and I stand to take note of the Assistant Treasurer's response in relation to a question from Sue Mackay. It is a typical response from the government. All you get is a sidestepping attempt to avoid the real issue, and that is that the GST has fallen flat on its face. It is about as flat as a blancmange that has not worked. Eric Abetz can go on and on about—
—Order! Please refer to members by their correct title.
—Senator Abetz can go on and on about the last federal election campaign. We on this side wish he would, because as the federal campaign director in Tasmania he scored zero out of five, if my memory serves me right, in terms of returning Liberal Party members back to the House of 
 Representatives. So he has a fabulous track record of being able to deliver for us.
But let us just have a look at the Assistant Treasurer's response today. We now know that there are seven rates under the GST. I just remind people who are listening that the Assistant Treasurer sat down after less than two minutes today in responding to this question from Senator Mackay. He couldn't take his full time, probably didn't want to take his full time, because this government does not want to know and does not want to accept what is happening with the GST.
Despite their election promise to simplify the tax system, the government has revealed in certain cases that the GST is in fact a tax on a tax. Where a state or local government applies a levy, a fee or a charge for a service provided, the GST will apply on top of that levy, fee or charge. My colleagues are right, in that we heard the government say that it would seek to get the states and territories to abolish those stamp duties, and we can see that that is not happening.
An example of those levies, fees and charges that are expected to have GST added on them are fire levies contained in insurance policies, environmental levies, bushland acquisition levies, camping fees, national park entry fees, swimming pool entry fees—even sporting fields that are hired from local councils you will pay a GST on—community hire halls from local councils and library fees. In these cases the GST will be a tax on a tax.
In some states—such as Victoria—the fire service levy will be hit by the GST and both of these will be hit by stamp duty. So in these states consumers will be hit by a triple tax—a tax on a tax on a tax. We know the property and insurance industries recently have reacted very angrily to the revelation that states propose to charge stamp duty on and after a GST basis—effectively a tax on a tax. I have with me an article from the Financial Review of 26 October, which talks about the complexities for higher insurance premiums being paid by people. It says:
The complexities of the proposed GST legislation, rather than malpractice on the part of insurance companies, have caused the cost of general insurance to skyrocket, according to a GST expert. 

That expert, Mr Rod Hill, said:
""The insurance industry is daily sending out notices incorporating—
in his words—
a tax, on a tax, on a tax . . . 
He said:
. . . insurers have been forced to charge GST on stamp duty and fire levies due to the vagaries—
his words—
of the draft GST laws.
""The insurance industry is daily sending out notices incorporating a tax on a tax on a tax, thus forcing the affordability of insurance off the agenda for many Australians.""
Many Australians know that. If you have a 12-month renewal notice coming through your post office box at this point, from November to November, then the GST kicks in. It kicks in twice if you live in those states or territories that do have such things as fire service levies. The article continues:
The impact of the cascading tax varies from State-to-State but is most marked in rural Victoria—
Senator McGauran—
where a $49 fire service levy is charged on every $100 . . .

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-11-23,"—I am not going to attack Senator Crossin. She is a soft target, metaphorically and physically, but I am not going to attack her, as she attacked Senator Abetz.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. You might like to remind Senator Lightfoot that he might like to withdraw some of those remarks and direct his comments through the chair.
—I think that you had better address your remarks through the chair, Senator Lightfoot. I would urge caution in your language and how you describe other members in this place, please.
—I always take very seriously your cautions, Madam Deputy President, and when I do I have found that I am often a far better person because I did.
The GST is a tax that is going to work. These attacks on the tax really are to cover 
 and to try to bring down what is going to be an evolutionary tax for Australia. Those on the opposite side know that this is going to work. This is a new tax system that is going to work, just like the motor vehicle industry is going to boom as a result of this tax—not retrogress, as it did under the Labor Party, but boom. We are going to have a boom situation with the motor industry, and we are going to have a boom situation with other areas of the Australian economy. There is no GST on exports. We did not tax exports. We are removing the tax on exports.
We are worried about jobs. I have said before that this party is the champion of the working class. This party represents the working class. We represent the blue-collar vote now. You have lost it. Just as you have lost over 50 per cent of your union membership in the last few decades, so you are losing the working class vote too. The government, of course, is keeping a close eye on the motor vehicle industry and adjusting it where it sees that that transitional effect is necessary.
But you cannot say that the Premier of New South Wales is not on your side; you cannot say the Premier of Queensland is not on your side; you cannot say the Premier of Victoria is not also on your side; you cannot say the Premier of Tasmania, where Senator Sherry comes from, is not also philosophically agreeing with you. Why do you not ask those premiers if they are going to remove their stamp duty and so on? What is it that you expect from the other premiers that you do not expect from your own premiers?
Opposition senators interjecting—
—You are talking about sledging the Australian premiers with `a tax on a tax', as you so repetitively and boringly call it, but you are not prepared to say that the new tax system itself is a tax that benefits the states. You may not be aware that I represent Western Australia here. Over 10 years Western Australia is expected to get $2 billion extra as a result of the GST. We expect exports from the premier exporting state in the nation to increase to the betterment of places like Tasmania, which Senator Sherry represents.
There is a proposition that accommodation taxes be abolished by 1 July 2000—no bed tax. We are going to take the bed tax away. There is an agreement with Mr Carr in New South Wales. Financial institutions duty and stamp duty on quoted marketable securities are to be abolished by 1 July. This is all part of the transitional period. Even you, Senator Crossin, should be intelligent enough to know that you cannot on the stroke of midnight change completely—
—Order! Senator Lightfoot, please address the chair.
—As part of the transition, financial institutions duty and stamp duty on quoted marketable securities will be abolished by 1 July 2000. Debits tax is to be abolished by 1 July 2005. That is subject to a review by a ministerial council which comprises all the state premiers, including Labor premiers. States will receive all of the revenue from the GST.
Why is it that you are opposed to the GST? You are opposed to it not because it will not work but because you know it is going to work; you know it is going to be a boon to the states; you know it is going to be a boon to the economy and a boon to employment. That is why you are knocking it. You want to bring Australia down while the coalition government is here in Canberra in order for us to be seen not to be competent, when we are probably the best government this nation has seen in the postwar years.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-11-23,"—I think the people on the opposite side have completely missed the point of the debate this afternoon. It is about three things. Firstly, it is about a tax on a tax that is applying now. If you had listened to the question that came from my colleague Senator Mackay, you would have realised that she asked about a tax on a tax that is applying now, and she quoted Mr Rod Hill who said that the insurance industry is issuing notices daily and that people are paying those notices—
—Right now.
—Right now. So we are talking about a tax on a tax that is applying now, particularly to insurance, and that in the near future will apply to property, even prior to 1 July next year. Secondly, there is no compensation for this tax whatsoever. And, thirdly, it was avoidable had this government foreseen the effect of the GST on state taxes. Those are the three points: it is a tax on a tax that is operating now; there is no compensation; and it was avoidable.
My colleagues who spoke before me, Senator Sherry and Senator Crossin, have clearly pointed out that this tax on a tax is applying throughout a number of states of Australia. It has a significant effect when it comes to notices that are being issued for taxation in the area of stamp duty. I will point out how that applies in a moment. It will apply to property progressively as time goes on. As contracts are entered into in the period prior to 1 July, the operators will be obliged to include in those contracts an element of GST which will attract stamp duty in those property dealings. Clearly the government has failed to deliver on its promise that there would be no tax on a tax. It has nothing to do with Labor Party policy; it is to do with the government's promise that there would be no tax on a tax.
There is no compensation either now or in the future for the tax on the tax—the tax on the tax that is happening this very day. There is no compensation whatsoever, neither now nor in the future. Any compensation packages were worked out prior to this becoming a problem for the government. So those people renewing their insurance policies now and paying the stamp duty on the GST will not be compensated for that in any way. Those people who enter into property deals prior to 1 July or post 1 July which attract stamp duty on their transactions will not have any compensation whatsoever. So we have a dilemma for people—from battlers to business people—that has not been addressed and was not even foreseen by this government.
A couple of examples bring clearly to mind what this is about. If you look at a home in Western Australia costing $141,000, the stamp duty on that will increase by $233 as 
 a result of the tax on the tax. If you look at an apartment in Sydney costing $350,000, that cost will increase by $787.50 as a result of the tax on the tax. Those amounts will not be compensated for by this government. Then if you look at the business end, the cost of an investment in a plant or factory worth $1.5 million in Newcastle will increase by $8,250. That is certainly not insignificant.
But it was avoidable, because the government had the opportunity to not have this mess occur in the first place. If there had not been the grubby deal between the Democrats and the government in the first instance, we would not have seen this happen. We would have seen a proper scrutiny of the legislation before this chamber, and issues such as this would have been picked up.
But the federal government will not accept responsibility. They want to put the blame now on the state governments. Of course, if there were no GST, this problem would not be in existence in the first place. It is because of the legislation of this government that the problem exists, and so they have got to face up to it and do something about it. They can take actions with the state government which can overcome the problem. But the problem exists today; and how to redress the problem is something that faces this government. There is a tax on a tax, and there is no compensation. The fact that it was avoidable and that the government failed to address it is totally their fault, and the blame lies with the government on this issue.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-11-23,"—Senator Hogg finished by saying that this government should face up to its tax policies. Well, for four years now, Senator Hogg, the opposition has come into this chamber and not once has it  come in with an alternative policy. You have been negative for those four years. From this side of the chamber we have called for your alternative policies. But I am happy to say that you do have an alternative policy with regard to tax: it is the wholesale sales tax. So, for the first time in four years, we can say that you actually do have an alternative policy and that, if you are re-elected to government, you will return wholesale sales tax—that iniquitous tax, that 
 inconsistent tax, that complex tax, that debilitating tax on exporters and on our manufacturing and production sector.
Yesterday you came in here with feigned concern for the car industry. Well, talk about a tax on a tax on a tax! Your wholesale sales tax is just that, Senator Hogg and Senator Sherry. When you buy an imported car, wholesale sales tax goes on top of the stamp duty too. That is a tax on a tax. Throw in the tariff, and you have got a triple tax.
—I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy President, and it goes to relevance. The issue is the tax on a tax: the GST, not the wholesale sales tax. The GST is going on everything and double taxation is applying. That is the issue, and he should be brought back to the question.
—On that point of order, quite obviously Senator Sherry is wrong. Senator McGauran must be allowed to develop his argument. If it is a tax on a tax, it is quite relevant; and I would suggest that Senator Sherry does not have a point of order at all.
—Order! This is a wide ranging debate and I would ask Senator McGauran to relate it to the answer given by Senator Kemp.
—I was very much developing my argument in regard to a tax on a tax on a tax. In fact, under your tax system we would have a triple tax on cars. You came in here yesterday feigning concern for the industry but, under your tax system, you would have a triple tax: a tariff and a wholesale sales tax on the stamp duty. So your system is a triple tax.
You raised the question of what we are doing about the stamp duties by the states. With regard to state stamp duties, what did you do in your 13 years? We have a policy to abolish the stamp duties in the states. What better can you do than that? That is not a tax on a tax; that is an abolition of a tax. That is a whole abolition of a tax. That is our policy, and by 2001 that will be introduced. Why don't you get up and say that you would follow suit on that?
—Senator McGauran, you might like to address the Chair, thank you very much.
—Madam Deputy President, you would be happy to know that this government's policy is to abolish the array of state taxes so that there will not be a tax on a tax at all. We will be abolishing bed taxes by 1 July next year. We will be abolishing the financial institutions tax by July of the following year.
—What about payroll tax?
—I would hope, Senator Sherry, that in the future payroll tax—which is a state tax, let us note—will also be tackled down the track. It is a debilitating tax also. We are abolishing the bed tax, the financial institutions tax and, by July 2000, we will be abolishing stamp duty on shares. We will be abolishing the bank accounts debit tax—another debilitating tax on business—by 1 July 2001. What better policy can you have than to abolish the states' stamp duties and the array of taxes you are talking about that have a tax on a tax, when the alternative policy is to maintain them in place and have a tax on a tax on a tax? You are triple taxers; we abolish the taxes.
It is pretty clear that there may well be a transitional phase with the massive package that we are introducing, but we have in place the education system to make that transition as smooth as possible. Without doubt, we say to look at the whole package and to look at the advantages for business with regard to the whole package. We are introducing a 30 per cent tax for business. We are introducing large personal income tax cuts—
—What has this got to do with woodchipping?
—Because you will not look at the whole picture. The whole picture benefits business. The abolition of those stamp duties will benefit business. The reduction of company tax will benefit business. The introduction of large personal income tax cuts will filter its way through the system and benefit business. These are not taxes on taxes; these are reductions in, and abolitions of, taxes. So what is your alterna 
 tive on the other side but to come in here and carp and be negative—(Time expired)
—Order! The time for the debate has expired.

The correspondence read as follows—
Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999
Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations 1999, Statutory Rules 1999 No.159
26 August 1999
The Hon Jackie Kelly MP
Minister for Sport and Tourism
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations 1999, Statutory Rules 1999 No.159 and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999, which create a single drug testing scheme and the administrative framework for the collection and sampling of drug tests performed on competitors in sport. The Committee has a number of concerns with these Regulations and Orders which it outlines below.
Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations
Drug control officials and chaperones
Regulations 8 and 9 allow for the appointment of, respectively, `drug control officials' and `chaperones'. Since, by virtue of subregulation 9(2), a drug control official is also a chaperone, and since neither need have any special qualifications or attributes, as they need only be a `person', it is 
 difficult to see the reason for the two types of officials.
Personal interest
Subregulations 12(1) and 13(2) seek to ensure that a person taking a sample from a competitor will report to the Australian Sports Drug Agency any personal interest in the collection of the sample. Subregulations 12(2) and 13(3) nevertheless permit the Agency to allow the person taking the sample to continue with that task.
Conditions of service—persons appointed by a sporting administrative body
Subregulation 13(2) requires the Agency to make sure that the conditions of service of persons appointed by a sporting administrative body contain particular terms. However, it is suggested that this provision may not fulfil its apparent purpose. There is no requirement, for instance, that the conditions of service must be immutable, and it is difficult to see how the Agency could monitor the conditions of service, at any particular time, of those appointed by other, outside, bodies.
Discretion to use an interpreter
Subregulations 18(2) and (3) give the Agency a discretion as to whether to communicate with a competitor through an interpreter. It might be thought that if a competitor is `unable to receive or understand [a] request' (see subregulation 18(2)), or is `unable to understand English' (see subregulation 18(3)), the Agency should be required  to make all reasonable efforts to ensure, by whatever means, that its request is understood.
Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee
By virtue of paragraph 65(2)(b) read with subregulation 65(3), the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee must convene a meeting of the Committee if he or she receives, among other things, an oral request therefor from the Agency. The Committee suggests that it would conduce to better administration if such requests were required to be in writing.
Delegation of powers
Regulation 80 permits the Agency to delegate `all or any of its powers  except [this] power to delegate' to, among others, a drug control official or a chaperone, and regulation 82 gives a drug control official a similar power to delegate to a chaperone. However, it is apparent that, by virtue of the definitions of drug control official and chaperone in regulation 3, there is no limit by reason of office or attribute on the persons who may be appointed to the position of drug control official or chaperone. The Committee suggests that these powers of delegation are too wide, and that delegations should, for instance, be limited to employees of the Agency. 

Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing Orders
Compliance 
Section 8 of the Orders provides that substantial, rather than strict, compliance with the provisions of these Orders will generally be sufficient. However, the Orders do not indicate who is to decide what constitutes substantial compliance.
Collection of Samples
Subsection 10(2) of the Orders obliges a competitor to comply with `any instructions given by a chaperone during the sample collection process'. However, the subsection does not limit those instructions to such as may be reasonably required in the circumstances.
Section 11 of the Orders gives to the drug control officer in charge of the collection of a urine sample a discretion as to the information which he or she may record on the drug testing form. It is difficult to see why this discretion should be available, and why the officer is not required to record certain information, and no other.
Subsection 28(2) to (6) of the Orders list a number of matters which a competitor and a drug control officer must carry out, but then, in subsection 28(7), the drug control officer is given the discretion as to the instructions which may be given to the competitor. It is difficult to see why this subsection does not lay down a further mandatory requirement.
Both subsections 29(4) and 43(4) of the Orders appear anomolous. Subsections 29(3) and 43(3) provide that the respective subsections (4) apply if, for example, the pH of a sample is lower than 5 or higher than 7. But the relevant subsections (4) then require the drug control officer to deny the evidence that he or she has received, and treat the sample as if the pH were not  lower than 5 or higher than 7.
Subsection 49(2) of the Orders deems `a courier in the normal course of business' to be a secure means of transporting a sample to an accredited laboratory. However, neither the Act, the Regulations, nor the Orders provide a definition of such a courier. Also, if a drug control officer decides not to use such a courier, he or she is required to see to the transport of samples `by means which will ensure [their] safe arrival'. The section, however, does not provide for the means by which the officer is to fulfil this requirement.
Subsection 51(2) of the Orders obliges a drug control officer to store samples overnight in `a secure place', but neither the Act, the Regulations nor the Orders apparently defines such a place.
Testing of Samples
Section 57 of the Orders deals with the testing of part B of a sample, if the result of testing part A of 
 the sample is positive. The section does not, however, indicate what an accredited laboratory is to do with part B of a sample if, either the test of part A is negative, or the Agency does not instruct the laboratory to test part B.
Scheme A Register
Subsection 60(2) of the Orders requires the Agency to remove details of a person's name, etc from the Scheme A register if it turns out that the person was not a competitor. It might be thought that the Agency should satisfy itself before  carrying out the testing program on a person whether they were a competitor or not.
The Committee is concerned that the discretions about what is being recorded in the Register may infringe on the privacy of the athletes. The Committee would welcome advice on any comments the Privacy Commissioner may have made on this aspect of the Orders.

Subsection 61(1) of the Orders appears to incorporate into the Orders various lists of prohibited drugs and doping methods kept by sporting administration bodies `as in force from time to time'. So far as the Committee can ascertain, this provision is contrary to subsection 49A(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , and is to that extent void.
Consultation with Privacy Commissioner
The Explanatory Statement to the Regulations stated that the `Privacy Commissioner has been consulted [about the Regulations] but notes that compliance with the Privacy Act 1988  will depend upon the way Drug Testing Scheme A is implemented'. The Orders appear to implement Scheme A, but the Explanatory Statement to these Orders states that the `Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the [Orders] but notes that compliance with the Privacy Act 1988  will depend upon the way the Orders are implemented'. The Committee would appreciate your clarification on the response from the Privacy Commissioner as it is concerned that the Commissioner will not be able to make an adequate assessment of the scheme until the Agency implements the Orders.
Explanatory Statements
The Committee is concerned that the Explanatory Statements for both the Regulations and the Orders give a broad picture only. These statements are deficient, in that there is no detailed explanation of each individual regulation. There is also no indication whether these Regulations and Orders are consistent with standard testing orders used throughout the international community and whether international and domestic sporting bodies were consulted about the testing scheme. 

The Committee would appreciate your advice on the matters raised on the Regulations and the Orders.
Yours sincerely

CANBERRA  ACT  2600
Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 26 August 1999 commenting on the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations 1999 No. 159 (the Regulations) and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999 (the Orders).
I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the Committee's concerns. For ease of reference, in the following paragraphs the Committee's questions are presented in bold type, with detailed answers appearing immediately below.
THE AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY REGULATIONS 1999 (THE REGULATIONS)
Drug Control Officials and Chaperones
Regulations 8 and 9 allow for the appointment of, respectively, `drug control officials' and `chaperones'. Since, by virtue of subregulation 9(2), a drug control official is also a chaperone, and since neither need have any special qualifications or attributes, as they need only be a `person', it is difficult to see the reason for the two types of officials.
The reason for two roles is separation of functions. A chaperone will accompany an athlete from the time of notification of a request to provide a sample to the point of provision of the sample, and will accompany the athlete throughout the collection process. This is to ensure security of the sample.
The drug control official (DCO) manages the overall sample collection process. The DCO is not in the company of the athlete at all times. It is, however, appropriate for the DCO to be able to perform the functions of the subordinate chaperone if called upon to do so.
This might occur if the chaperone is not the same sex as the athlete requested to provide the sample.
Personal interest
Subregulations 12(1) and 13(2) seek to ensure that a person taking a sample from a competitor will report to the Australian Sports Drug Agency any personal interest in the collection of the 
 sample. Subregulations 12(2) and 13(3) nevertheless permit the Agency to allow the person taking the sample to continue with that task.
A personal interest must be declared, but does not necessarily disqualify the person from being an Agency representative or an appointee of a sporting administration body. There is nothing unusual in this. The Agency or the body concerned must then decide whether the interest warrants withdrawing the person. Ultimately it is for the courts to decide if a wrong decision has been made (In this context and throughout this reply, `court' includes `tribunal'.)
Conditions of service—persons appointed by a sporting administrative body
Subregulation 13(2) requires the Agency to make sure that the conditions of service of persons appointed by a sporting administrative body contain particular terms. However, it is suggested that this provision may not fulfil its apparent purpose. There is no requirement, for instance, that the conditions of service must be immutable, and it is difficult to see how the Agency could monitor the conditions of service, at any particular time, of those appointed by other, outside, bodies.
In this circumstance the Agency enters into a contract arrangement with the sporting administration body so the sporting administration body may collect samples from competitors on behalf of the Agency.
The contract will stipulate the obligations and responsibilities of the sporting administration body. This includes monitoring conflicts of interest relating to any person appointed by the sporting administration body to conduct and monitor the sample collection process.
If the Agency becomes aware that the sporting administration body is not fulfilling or has not fulfilled its obligations under the contract, the Agency will renegotiate or revoke the contract as may be appropriate in the circumstances. A clause of this type is included in contracts entered into by the Agency.
Discretion to use an interpreter
Subregulations 18(2) and (3) give the Agency a discretion as to whether to communicate with a competitor through an interpreter. It might be thought that if a competitor is `unable to receive or understand [a] request' (see subregulation 18(2)), or is `unable to understand English' (see subregulation 18(3)), the Agency should be  required  to make all reasonable efforts to ensure, by whatever means, that its request is understood.
This is an empowering provision, so that the request communicated by the interpreter is taken to be a request by the Agency. It is a matter of the 
 Agency's judgment whether the competitor understands the request. The review provisions apply if a competitor claims not to have understood, but the Agency thinks he or she did understand. However, the provision will be expanded to ensure that the Agency is required to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that its request is understood.
Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee
By virtue of paragraph 65(2)(b) read with subregulation 65(3), the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee must convene a meeting of the Committee if he or she receives, among other things, an oral request therefor from the Agency. The Committee suggests that it would be conducive to better administration if such requests were required to be in writing.
It is agreed that it is preferable for such requests to be in writing, but it is conceivable that circumstances may arise where time will not allow this. There is nothing in the legislation to prevent a written request being made.
A situation of urgency could arise, for example, where the determination of the validity of an analytical positive test result requires a scientific investigation protocol to be set by the ASDMAC. Such a circumstance is conceivable in an event testing context when positive test results need to be reported within 24-48 hours.
A written record of the request for the meeting from the Chief Executive Officer of ASDA would, of course, form part of the minutes of the meeting of ASDMAC.
Delegation of powers
Regulation 80 permits the Agency to delegate `all or any of its powers' . . . except [this] power to delegate to, among others, a drug control official or a chaperone, and regulation 82 gives a drug control official a similar power to delegate to a chaperone. However, it is apparent that by virtue of the definitions of a drug control official and chaperone in regulation 3, there is no limit by reason of office or attribute on the persons who may be appointed to the position of drug control official or chaperone. The Committee suggests that these powers of delegation are too wide, and that delegations should, for instance, be limited to employees of the Agency.
DCO's and chaperones are appointed by the Agency and are employees of the Agency. It is not possible to limit the class further because of the wide range of persons who may be employed to fill thee appointments.
A DCO needs to be able to delegate his or her powers to a chaperone if necessary for effective delivery of the Agency's services. For example, in some circumstances arising during the sample 
 collection process (say, if the DCO becomes unwell during the testing process) it may be necessary for the DCO to delegate some of his or her functions to a chaperone.
AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY DRUG TESTING ORDERS
Compliance
Section 8 of the Orders provides that substantial, rather than strict, compliance with the provisions of these Orders will generally be sufficient. However, the Orders do not indicate who is to decide what constitutes substantial compliance.
Subsection 17A(3) of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990  (the Act) sets down the circumstances under which the Agency must strictly comply with procedures.
Apart from the matters mentioned in that subsection, the Act permits the regulations to provide for substantial compliance with procedures set out in the Scheme (subsection 17H(2)). What constitutes substantial compliance is to be decided by the courts which generally permit inconsequential deviations from procedures where the deviations will not affect the end result. `Substantial compliance' provisions can not be used to change the structure or policy of the law.
Collection of samples
Subsection 10(2) of the Orders obliges a competitor to comply with `any instructions given by a chaperone during the sample collection process'. However, the subsection does not limit those instructions to such as may be reasonably required in the circumstances.
If a competitor believes an instruction is unreasonable, he or she can apply for a review of any action taken by the Agency as a result of either compliance or failure to comply with the instruction. If the requirement is only to comply with `reasonable instructions', the competitor could arbitrarily decide that an instruction is unreasonable, and the Agency would then have to establish that it was reasonable. In the time available between request and provision of a sample, arbitration of this point may be impractical or even impossible. However, the orders will be altered to provide that the instruction must be relevant to the process.
Section 11 of the Orders gives to the drug control officer in charge of the collection of a urine sample a discretion as to the information which he or she may record on the drug testing form. It is difficult to see why this discretion should be available, and why the officer is not required to record certain information, and no other.
This is an empowering provision. The requirement to complete the form is set out in section 30. While a drug control officer is empowered under section 
 11 to annotate the form relevantly, the competitor is given the opportunity to agree or disagree with the contents of the form under section 30.
The sort of annotation that is envisaged here includes descriptions of problems encountered during the sample collection process, annotations requested by a competitor concerned about, for example, medications he or she might have taken or the procedures adopted during the collection process.
Subsection 28(2) to (6) of the Orders list a number of matters which a competitor and a drug control officer must carry out, but then, in subsection 28(7), the drug control officer is given the discretion as to the instructions which may be given to the competitor. It is difficult to see why this subsection does not lay down a further mandatory requirement.
Subsections 28(2) to (6) set down the procedures which must be followed if a sample proves to be sufficient. The discretionary nature of subsection 28(7) is important to leave open to the competitor the option of requesting assistance to seal the bottle (see subsection 28(8)).
Subsections 28(7) and 28(8) provide options for both the competitor and the DCO in dealing with a situation where a bottle continues to leak despite efforts to seal it properly. Using the discretionary power contained in subsection 28(7), the DCO may instruct the competitor to give an additional sample, or select another test kit, or the competitor, under subsection 28(8), may ask the DCO, or another person, to help seal the sample bottle. The provision will be amended to make it clearer that the outcome must be a valid sample in a secure bottle.
Both subsection 29(4) and 43(4) of the Orders appear anomalous. Subsections 29(3) and 43(3) provide that the respective subsections (4) apply if, for example, the pH of a sample is lower than 5 or higher than 7. But the relevant subsections (4) then require the drug control officer to deny the evidence that he or she has received, and treat the sample as if the pH were not lower than 5 or higher than 7.
If the relative acidity (pH) of a sample is lower than 5 or higher than 7, or the sample's specific gravity is equal to or lower than 1.010, the sample is not necessarily unsuitable for analysis. A sample's pH and specific gravity are only preliminary indicators of its suitability for analysis.
A sample outside the prescribed limits of pH and specific gravity will still be sent to the laboratory for testing. The DCO, however, is given the discretion to instruct the competitor to give the Agency an additional sample. The additional sample is also tested for pH and specific gravity and is sent to the laboratory for analysis as well.
Subsection 49(2) of the orders deems `a courier in the normal course of business' to be a secure 
 means of transporting a sample to an accredited laboratory. However, neither the Act, the Regulations, nor the Orders provide a definition of such a courier. Also, if a drug control officer decides not to use such a courier, he or she is required to see to the transport of samples `by means which will ensure [their] safe arrival'. The section, however, does not provide for the means by which the officer is to fulfil this requirement.
This is meant to link up with the prescribed courier services referred to in regulation 86. Section 49 of the orders should clearly state this. I undertake to amend the provision accordingly.
`Safe arrival' is a question of fact. The official could use a prescribed courier service, or other means that will achieve the required result. It would be otiose to spell out all the steps that would ensure safe arrival and it would not be possible to provide a conclusive list of appropriate circumstances in any event. A court could determine if the provisions of the Orders had not been followed in the particular circumstances of each case.
Subsection 51(2) of the Orders obliges a drug control officer to store samples overnight in `a secure place', but neither the Act, the Regulations nor the Orders apparently defines such a place.
Whether a place is secure is a question of fact that will be determined by the courts if necessary.
If a competitor is concerned that a sample may have been tampered with, this may be raised in a review and the security of the place where the sample is kept ultimately becomes an issue for the court. (It should be noted that the containers in which samples are kept are required to be tamper-evident.)
Testing of samples
Section 57 of the Orders deals with the testing of part B of a sample, if the result of testing part A of the sample is positive. The section does not, however, indicate what an accredited laboratory is to do with part B of a sample if, either the test of part A is negative, or the Agency does not instruct the laboratory to test part B.
If part A of a sample is negative or if the Agency does not give instruction to the laboratory to test part B, the testing process stops.
The accredited laboratory procedures state that if a test is completed on Part A of a sample and the result is negative, the laboratory is required to hold on to Part B of the sample for 30 days. In the case where a Part A of a sample tests positive, irrespective of whether the Agency instructs the laboratory to test Part B, the laboratory is required to hold Part B of the sample for 12 months. Appropriate provision can be made in the Regulations to outline 
 these practices. I will ensure that this is done as soon as practicable.
Scheme A Register
Subsection 60(2) of the Orders requires the Agency to remove details of a person's name, etc from the Scheme A register if it turns out that the person was not a competitor. It might be thought that the Agency should satisfy itself  before  carrying out the testing program on a person whether they were a competitor or not.
The Committee is concerned that the discretions about what is being recorded in the Register may infringe on the privacy of the athletes. The Committee would welcome advice on any comments the Privacy Commissioner may have made on this aspect of the Orders.
A drug testing scheme can apply only to competitors. The Agency can only enter details about someone the Agency believes is a competitor. Subsection 60(2) provides the mechanism for removing details if the Agency later decides that the person was not a competitor.
The Agency is diligent in satisfying itself that persons subject to testing by the Agency are competitors. However there may be circumstances where a person ceases to be a competitor but the responsible sporting administration body does not notify ASDA.
The Privacy Commissioner has no objection to the provision at this stage. The Commissioner's comments are discussed below.
Prohibited drugs and doping methods
Subsection 61(1) of the Orders appears to incorporate into the Orders various lists of prohibited drugs and doping methods kept by sporting administration bodies `as in force from time to time'. So far as the Committee can ascertain, this provision is contrary to subsection 49A(1) of the  Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , and is to that extent void.
Subsection 11(5) of the Act deals with the schedule of drugs and doping methods for a drug testing scheme:
11(5)	 The schedule referred to in paragraph 2(b) may make provision for or in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in any other instrument or writing made by a sporting administration body:
			 (a)	 as in force or existing at a particular time; or
			 (b)	 as in force or existing from time to time.
The Act, therefore, specifically permits the provision in question and overrides the Acts Interpretation Act to that extent. 

Consultation with Privacy Commissioner
The Explanatory Statement to the Regulations stated that the `Privacy Commissioner has been consulted [about the Regulations] but notes that compliance with the  Privacy Act 1988  will depend upon the way Drug Testing Scheme A is implemented'. The Orders appear to implement Scheme A, but the Explanatory Statement to these Orders states that the `Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the [Orders] but notes that compliance with the Privacy Act 1988  will depend upon the way the Orders are implemented'. The Committee would appreciate your clarification on the response from the Privacy Commissioner as it is concerned that the Commissioner will not be able to make an adequate assessment of the scheme until the Agency implements the orders.
It is my understanding that the Orders are in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 . The Privacy Commissioner has advised that the Orders and the Regulations appear to be in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 . However, it is reasonable to say that further comment cannot be made until such time as the Orders are in operation and the Privacy Commissioner has an opportunity to determine whether the practical application of the Regulations and Orders is in compliance with the privacy legislation.
The Privacy Commissioner has also been given an opportunity to view The Athlete's Guide  provided under section 14 of the Orders. The Privacy Commissioner advised that The Athlete's Guide  also appeared to be in compliance with the Privacy Act 1988 . Further comment could not be provided until such time as the Regulations and Orders were in operation.
If in operation the Regulations or the Orders prove to cause any privacy concerns, action will be taken immediately to address them.
Explanatory Statements
The Committee is concerned that the Explanatory Statements for both the Regulations and the Orders give a broad picture only. These statements are deficient, in that there is no detailed explanation of each individual regulation. There is also no indication whether these Regulations and Orders are consistent with standard testing orders used throughout the international community and whether international and domestic sporting bodies were consulted about the testing scheme.
The paperwork accompanying the Regulations and Orders was prepared in good faith. I apologise for any misunderstanding which may have occurred in respect of what was required. However, if the committee would like to have a more detailed Statement, I would be happy to have it prepared. 

Consultation with domestic and international sporting bodies
The Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Sport Commission Medical Advisory Panel and many other sporting and government bodies were consulted in the development of the legislative package and agreed with its general thrust.
To my knowledge, Australia is the only country to have such Orders. However, legislative instruments for imposing doping controls for sport exist in South Africa and New Zealand: these nations have modelled their legislative instruments on the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act and Regulations.
The Orders set out procedures which are consistent with the International Olympic Committee's Medical Code. This code provides the procedural framework for doping control in all Olympic Sports.
The Drug Testing Orders are consistent with the International Standard for Doping Control which has been developed by parties to the International Anti-Doping Arrangement (IADA). The parties to the IADA are Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.
The intent of IADA is to seek international harmonisation of doping control procedures. IADA is currently mid way through the process of seeking International Standards Organisation (ISO) certification of a minimum standard to be upheld, to ensure delivery of drug testing services through high quality procedures.
ASDA procedures are well respected by the international sporting fraternity and are considered to be achieving best practice in doping control.
I trust that these explanations allay the Committee's concerns. I would be happy to provide further information should this be required. Should the Committee wish it, officials of my Department or the Agency could be made available to brief the Committee in person. The drafters of the Regulations and the Orders, the Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney-General's Department, have also indicated a willingness to discuss any aspect of the drafting with you if this should be required.
Yours sincerely

CANBERRA   ACT   2600 

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1999 in which you responded to the Committee's concerns on the Australian Sports Drugs Agency Regulations 1999 No.159 and the Australian Sports Drugs Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999.
The Committee welcomes your considered response, which has addressed most of our concerns. However, there are some continuing issues for which the Committee would appreciate your further advice.
Conditions of service
In relation to the conditions of service for persons appointed by a sporting administrative body, you advise that the Agency enters into a contract arrangement with such bodies to collect samples from competitors on its behalf. Although such contracts are said to stipulate the obligations and responsibilities of such bodies, it is not apparent how the Agency would become aware that they are not fulfilling such contracts. Has the Agency developed practical mechanisms to handle a breach of such contracts?  You also advise that a clause is included concerning the renegotiation or revocation of such contracts in such circumstances. It would assist our deliberations if, in addition to answering our questions, a copy of a draft contract could be made available.
Delegation
The Committee is still concerned with the delegation of the Agency's powers. We understand that there is some safeguards to this delegation because the drug control officials and chaperones are employees of the Agency. However, given the wide range of persons you say are employed to fill these appointments, the Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether there are any specific attributes or qualifications required for such officials.
Safe arrival
The Committee appreciates that `safe arrival' is a question of fact. However, if the Agency were to rely on that fact, then it would appear to be unnecessary to describe a prescribed courier service as one means of achieving that end. The Committee is concerned with the means of ensuring the safe arrival of samples and considers it should either be spelt out prescriptively or left for the officer to determine in the light of the relevant circumstances.
Secure place
The Committee also appreciates that a `secure place' is a question of fact. Even though the question of what is a secure place can be challenged in a court, such a determination would not be held until some considerable time after the event. The Committee considers it may be preferable to nominate places as safe and secure from the first available moment of the drug testing.
IADA and other drug testing organisations
The Committee notes that Australia is a party to the International Anti-Doping Arrangement (IADA). You advise that other countries are looking at the issue of drug testing in sport. What is not apparent from your response, however, is which organisations other than IADA are undertaking drug testing. The Committee would appreciate a list of such agencies.
The purpose of this letter is to outline the remaining concerns of the Committee. We are mindful that our notice of disallowance imposes a deadline on the resolution of these matters and appreciate the offer of a briefing to clarify matters. Might we suggest that you provide a written reply by Tuesday 19 October 1999 and that the Committee meet Agency officials on Thursday 21 October 1999 to deal with any residual issues that arise.
Yours sincerely
Helen Coonan

CANBERRA  ACT  2600
Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 14 October 1999 concerning our previous correspondence on the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations 1999 No. 159 and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999.
I note that the majority of the Committee's concerns were satisfactorily addressed by my letter of 30 September 1999 and am happy to provide further advice in relation to the outstanding issues.
Conditions of Service
On entering into a contract arrangement with a sporting administrative body in order to collect samples from competitors on its behalf, the Agency requires the body to be familiar with the requirements of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990  (the Act), Regulations and Drug Testing Orders.
The Sporting Administration Body, in signing the contractual agreement with the Agency, warrants and agrees that it is empowered to do all things that will be required by this agreement, in particular that it will comply with the conflict provisions under the Act.
During the term of the agreement, the Sporting Administration Body is required to promptly advise the Agency of changes to the procedures applied to the drug testing process. The contract used to engage a sporting administration body to test a 
 competitor enables the Agency to terminate the agreement where a breach has occurred.
As a practical measure, prior to negotiating a contract the Agency undertakes an assessment process that examines the procedures and policies of the sporting administration body. This assessment is used to determine the suitability of the sporting administration body to conduct drug testing on the Agency's behalf. Another practical mechanism to monitor compliance exists in the form of the doping control session report. The Doping Control Official (DCO) in charge of the sample collection session prepares reports that describe issues arising during the session. The competitor providing a sample can also record any issues of concern or note on the drug control form that is provided to the Agency on completion of the drug testing mission.
A copy of the contract pro-forma is at Attachment A.
Delegation
Specific qualifications in the form of accreditation are required before an individual can be employed as a DCO or chaperone. The employment of DCOs and chaperones occurs only after the individual concerned has been accredited as a drug control official or chaperone respectively. The accreditation process involves a program of theory (equivalent three day program) and practical field training for DCOs and theory training followed by an examination for chaperones.
The accreditation process applied by the Agency is equivalent to international best practice.
The competencies of a DCO and chaperone are set out in the Attachment B.
Safe Arrival
In light of the Committee's comments, I propose that section 49 of the Scheme will be revised to emphasise its facilitative nature, with a view to reducing the length and expense of court proceedings while allowing for the full range of circumstances that might occur. I propose that subsection 49(2) be replaced by a provision that provides for it to be taken that the transport bag has arrived safety at a laboratory if it is delivered to the laboratory by a prescribed courier and there is no evidence sufficient to raise a doubt that it did arrive safely. This will preserve flexibility in choice of means of delivery for the drug control officer, but will also assist in establishing the chain of control where standard delivery methods are used and the point is not contested.
Secure Place
The collection of samples occurs in a range of settings largely determined by the nature and duration of the sporting event. To be prescriptive about what the specific characteristics of a secure place for all possible doping control circumstances 
 would be virtually impossible. To ensure samples are kept in a secure place by the DCO, the Agency has issued guidelines regarding security of samples collected and the DCO is required to manage samples accordingly.
The use of tamper evidence sample containers and security transport bags ensures that evidence of interference would be apparent before the final confirmation of a drug testing result and validation of the result leading to entry of a competitor's or person's name on the register of notifiable events.
IADA and the other drug testing organisations
The members of the International Anti-Doping Arrangement undertake year-round drug testing at events or during out-of-competition periods following protocols that are similar to those employed by the Agency. Other agencies that undertake drug testing include, but are not limited to:
The International Olympic Committee during Olympic Games only (using the infrastructure and staff provided by the relevant organising committee);
International Federations (mostly during internationally sanctioned events);
National Olympic Committees (e.g. the United States Olympic Committee, the Chinese Olympic Committee);
International Drug Testing Management (DTM) which provides drug testing services out-of-competition for a range of international federations including the International Athletics Federation and the International Swimming Federation;
A number of Governments that are signatories to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention (e.g. France and Ireland) conduct drug testing through their respective anti-doping agencies (a list of signatories to the Convention is at Attachment C).
I understand arrangements have now been made for the Committee to be briefed by officials of the Agency on Thursday, 21 October 1999. Officers of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and the Office of Legislative Drafting will also attend to assist as appropriate.
I appreciate the Committee's efforts to finalise this matter quickly, and trust that the proposed approaches will lead to resolution of the outstanding issues.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for making available officers from the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) to brief the Committee on the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations and Orders. The briefing proved to be informative and useful.
The information provided by ASDA answered members specific concerns on:
.	 the delegation of powers and functions to drug control officials and chaperones;
.	 the safe arrival of samples; and
.	 the standards and procedures adopted by other countries and organisations.
The Committee discussed its remaining concerns with the officers and you should note the following:
.	Conditions of Service 
The Committee discussed the possibility of amending the contract document to include a definition of gross negligence in clause 16.3 and a clause concerning indemnity protection under Warranties. ASDA agreed that such amendments would be considered.
.	Secure Place
The Committee suggested that the wording of subsection 51(2) of the Orders could be amended to `held securely' instead of a `secure place'. ADS and a representative from the Office of Legislative Drafting considered that this would not alter the meaning of the subsection and agreed that an amendment would be considered.
The Committee appreciates your assistance in obtaining a satisfactory conclusion to this matter and will withdraw the notice of disallowance at the first opportunity.
Yours sincerely

Exemption No. CASA 25/1999 made under regulation 308 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988
26 August 1999
The Hon John Anderson MP
Minister for Transport and Regional Services
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to Exemption No. CASA 25/1999 and Instrument No. CASA 884/99 made under the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988.
CASA 25/1999 exempts Brumby pilotless aircraft from compliance with most of those regulations while a member of the aeronautical engineering 
 department of the University of Sydney flies them for developmental testing purposes. Clause 5 of the Conditions, subject to which this Exemption has been granted, requires a flight tester who is flying a Brumby pilotless aircraft to `ensure that persons operating ultralight aircraft at Medway are notified not less than 24 hours before flights begin under this exemption'. Read literally, this clause would apparently require a flight tester to have the foresight to know who was going to fly an ultralight aircraft on the following day. It would appear that the condition is intended to relate to all those who normally operate ultralight aircraft out of Medway. The Committee would appreciate your confirmation that this is the intention of the Exemption.
CASA 884/99 allows for aircraft taking part in the RAAF Museum Interactive Flying Program to fly over a public gathering at less than the normally required heights. While the Explanatory Statement provides a considerable amount of information on the legislative authority for this instrument, and its effect, it provides no information on the nature of the RAAF Program. The Committee would be grateful for your advice on the nature and frequency of the air displays carried out by this Program.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
I refer to the Deputy Prime Minister's letter of 1 November 1999 in reply to your letter dated 26 August 1999 regarding Exemption No. CASA 25/1999 and Instrument No. CASA 884/99 made under the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 . I am writing to you in the Deputy Prime Minister's absence.
The Deputy Prime Minister informed you that CASA had sought legal advice about Exemption No. CASA 25/1999, which exempts Brumby pilotless aircraft from compliance with most of these regulations under certain conditions.
As a result of your Committee's concerns, CASA has revoked this exemption, and remade it without the condition requiring that persons operating ultralight aircraft at Medway aerodrome are given at least 24 hours notice of flight tests of the Brumby aircraft. 

I trust this addresses the concerns of your Committee. I have attached a copy of the reissued exemption for your information.
Yours sincerely
Bill McKinley

—I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the Australian Sports Drug Agency instruments.
Leave granted.
—As honourable senators will know, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee works assiduously and without fanfare to ensure that over 2,000 legislative instruments tabled in the Senate each year accord with fundamental principles as set out in the standing orders. The approach of the committee is non-partisan and its objective is quality control.
The committee raised several concerns about the Australian Sports Drugs Agency Regulations 1999 and the Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999 with Minister Jackie Kelly and corresponded with her on a number of occasions seeking explanations on specific provisions in the regulations and orders relating to drug control officials and chaperones, collection and testing of samples, prohibited drugs and doping methods and privacy considerations.
The responses to these inquiries were helpful but did not fully address all of the committee's concerns. Through the minister the committee arranged a briefing with officers of the department, the Australian Sports Drug Agency and the Office of Legislative Drafting in order to discuss and resolve the outstanding matters. The successful results of this meeting are noted in the correspondence incorporated in Hansard.
I would indicate to the Senate that this is another good example of the work undertaken by the committee to ensure that regulations are of the highest quality and are consistent with fundamental legal principles. I commend the minister and the departmental officers for the cooperative, helpful and instructive approach they adopted during this process and 
 thank my colleagues on the committee for the work they did on this important matter.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Withdrawal</title>,Notices,5,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-11-23,"—I seek leave to table a statement on East Timor made in the other place by the Prime Minister and to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Today I inform the House that the government has decided on the formation of two additional infantry battalions for the Australian Army as well as other force additions. These decisions flow directly from Australia's involvement in East Timor. I also report to the House on the impressive progress made to date by the INTERFET multinational force in East Timor, so ably and effectively led by Australia. Furthermore, I will explain the details of a temporary revenue measure, for the next financial year only, to cover the unexpected costs of the military deployment by our nation in East Timor.
On 21 September, I advised parliament of the deployment of Australian troops as part of INTERFET, the multinational force mandated by the United Nations, to restore order in East Timor. I am pleased to report that, in the intervening two months, INTERFET has largely achieved the tasks the United Nations set it: to restore peace and security to East Timor, to protect the United Nations mission in East Timor and to facilitate humanitarian relief.
In this period also, East Timor's political status was settled. On 19 October, the People's Consultative Assembly in Indonesia agreed to the separation of East Timor from the republic of Indonesia, thus respecting the vote East Timor's people freely exercised in the United Nations ballot on 30 August. East Timor is now under the transitional authority of the United Nations until its full independence is achieved in two or three years time. The day after its decision on East Timor, the assembly elected Abdurrahman Wahid as President and Megawati Sukarnoputri as Vice-President. These steps underline the enormous distance Indonesia has travelled towards democracy over the past 12 months.
INTERFET's achievement of its mandate has been an outstanding success. It reflects very well indeed 
 on Australia's leadership, the international support the force has received, the good cooperation among contributing countries and, above all, the professionalism of the service men and women in the force. Soldiers, sailors and aircrew from 17 nations are working together effectively. The force now numbers over 9,900, including 4,400 from Australia's coalition partners.
Countries in Australia's region have made a strong contribution to INTERFET. The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea are participating. Thailand has provided the deputy commander, Major General Songkitti, and the second largest contingent of forces. The government is particularly grateful to the Prime Minister and the people of Thailand for their support. We thank Japan, which, unable to commit troops for constitutional reasons, is providing $US100 million to pay the cost of developing country contributors to INTERFET. China has been supportive throughout the UN process. New Zealand's contribution represents its largest deployment of forces abroad since World War II, and I would like to express my particular thanks to Mrs Shipley for the leadership she displayed.
Countries beyond the immediate region have also made a substantial contribution to INTERFET. The United States has provided capabilities which are essential to the mission's operations and would otherwise have been difficult to secure. Its ready support for Australia's leadership of INTERFET has underlined the effectiveness of the ANZUS alliance. We were grateful for the United Kingdom's prompt response in sending a company of combat troops and naval assets at the very beginning of the operation. Canada, Brazil, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway and Portugal have all made valuable contributions. Denmark, Egypt, Fiji, Jordan and Kenya have committed to send forces.
To date, INTERFET forces have sustained only two casualties. We were pleased and relieved that both these Australians are making a full recovery. There have also been six militia deaths and a number of militia casualties. This loss of life is regretted, but in each case the incidents did result from attacks on INTERFET. Since these events the security environment in East Timor has greatly improved. INTERFET has consolidated its control throughout the mandated area, including the Oecussi enclave. Dili is returning to normal life. More than half its displaced residents have returned, and work on rebuilding the city's shattered infrastructure has begun. The last Indonesian troops and officials left East Timor on 31 October.
INTERFET's success in providing security has provided the basis for achieving its second and third goals: protecting the UN mission and facilitating the provision of humanitarian assistance. 
 Humanitarian assistance is reaching all corners of East Timor, with greatly improved access for international relief agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Red Cross, World Vision, CARE, Catholic Relief, UNICEF, UNHCR and others now have operations on the ground. This financial year, the government has provided an initial $14 million in humanitarian assistance to East and West Timor. And yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced a further $23 million in humanitarian assistance. INTERFET has created the conditions for hundreds of thousands of East Timorese to return home and to start to rebuild their lives. The United Nations estimates that more than 88,000 displaced East Timorese have now returned.
The government is still very concerned, however, about the plight of over 150,000 displaced East Timorese who remain in West Timor and are subject to intimidation by militia. The onset of the wet season makes their return home urgent. The government welcomes statements from the Indonesian government that militia groups are to be disarmed and removed from border areas, and that displaced East Timorese who wish to return are to be allowed to do so. Unfortunately, as yet this has only happened in some areas. The government will pursue this issue vigorously with the Indonesian government, the UN Secretary-General, other governments and the appropriate relief agencies.
With security largely restored, the immediate priorities remain humanitarian: the return of internally displaced people and the rebuilding of their lives in East Timor. East Timor and the United Nations must also now begin work on reconstruction, reconciliation and nation building. On 25 October, the UN Security Council passed resolution 1272, which establishes a United Nations Transitional Authority, UNTAET, to prepare East Timor for independence and provides for a UN peacekeeping operation to take over from INTERFET as soon as possible. It is essential that UNTAET moves quickly to set up effective political, economic and social structures and that UNTAET involves East Timorese as much as it can in its work. The government warmly welcomes the appointment of Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello as head of UNTAET and looks forward to working closely with him. We are now discussing with the United Nations an early transfer from INTERFET to the new UN peacekeeping force, to be managed in a way that fully maintains East Timor's security. We expect this will occur early next year. INTERFET's role will end once it hands over responsibility for security in East Timor to the United Nations.
I am sure both sides of the House, and indeed all Australians, will join me in warmly commending the force commander, Major General Cosgrove, and the Australian men and women serving with him in East Timor for the outstanding job they have 
 done on our behalf and on behalf of the United Nations.
All Australians were deeply distressed by the scenes of violence, death and destruction in East Timor that they witnessed daily after the results of the ballot were announced in early September. As I said in my address to the nation at the time, we sensed that a small, vulnerable community was about to be denied the freedom it had sought so long and that it had voted so overwhelmingly to achieve. Despite the pleas of the international community, the Indonesian government was unable to restore order and the United Nations authorised a multinational force to do so with the agreement of Indonesia.
Australia acted because it was the right thing that we help protect East Timorese from appalling violence and destruction and also because it was in Australia's national interest to restore stability in East Timor. The mission was dangerous and the risks to our men and women were high, but the Australian people gave it their strong support. It represents our largest military involvement for more than 30 years. The Australian troops in East Timor are doing a splendid job and all of us are rightly proud of every one of them. Australia's military involvement in East Timor will not end with INTERFET. We will make a substantial contribution to the follow-on UN peacekeeping operation—in the order of 1,500 troops.
Inevitably, such a commitment to East Timor has put added pressures on our Defence Force and the budget. In order to be sure that we can sustain our commitment to East Timor, the government has accepted a recommendation from the Minister for Defence, based on advice from the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence, to increase the number of fully operational infantry battalions in the Army from four to six for a period of two years. The Army's size will grow from 23,000 to 26,000. This increase is required to sustain Australia's involvement in the peacekeeping operation and to maintain acceptable levels of overall defence readiness.
Although the extra battalions have been raised to meet the immediate East Timor requirement, they could be needed on an ongoing basis. A decision will be taken on this in the context of the government's defence white paper next year. Air Force numbers will also be increased by about 500, to just over 13,500, to allow for additional combat support personnel and the raising of an extra airfield defence squadron.
The government estimates that the extra defence costs from the deployment of forces to East Timor, the raising of two new battalions and additional Air Force numbers will amount to $907 million in 1999-2000, the current financial year; $1.089 billion in the year 2000-01; and $901 million in 
 2001-02. After the transition from INTERFET to the UN peacekeeping operation, the United Nations will make some reimbursements. But these reimbursements will cover only a small portion of the costs of the deployment of Australian forces in East Timor and not the wider defence costs associated with that deployment.
Australia's support for East Timor goes wider than our involvement in peacekeeping and peace enforcement. The government will make available $60 million during the current financial year to cover additional aid needs for East Timor. Australia's aid commitment for 2000-01 will be considered in the coming year's budget process. Other additional costs in 1999-2000, the current financial year, relating to East Timor include assistance to evacuees from East Timor to Australia, $35 million, and deployment of Australian Federal Police and police from other jurisdictions as part of the United Nations civilian presence, $26 million. Attached to this statement is a table setting out these additional costs.
The government will present to parliament before the end of the year a special appropriation bill to cover the extra defence and aid expenses for the current financial year. The government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook  has now been compiled and will be released in full by the Treasurer shortly. We know, however, from the details to hand what the impact of the additional cost of the East Timor operation will be on the budget balance both for this and subsequent years.
The House will recall that I undertook some weeks ago to outline funding arrangements for the Timor operation when details of the mid-year economic outlook were available. This I am now doing. It is clear from these details that the cost of the East Timor deployment presents a particular difficulty in the next financial year commencing on 1 July 2000. At the time of the May budget the underlying cash budget surplus for 2000-01 was projected to be $3.1 billion. That figure has been significantly reduced by a number of developments.
The major additional item was the further costs to the budget of $1.8 billion in the coming financial year—that is, 2000-01—for revisions to the tax package that were negotiated with the Australian Democrats to secure its passage through the parliament. Other necessary policy decisions and adverse variations to estimates have imposed further costs to the budget. These additional costs, combined with the delay in receipts from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra, have also led to slower debt retirement and higher interest repayments on outstanding debt, costing about $500 million in 2000-01. In the absence of East Timor, all of these extra costs could properly have been absorbed within the projected budget surplus for 2000-01.  

The defence expenditure relating to East Timor of about $1.1 billion in 2000-01, however, falls into a different category altogether. Such an extraordinary item of additional expenditure could not reasonably have been expected at budget time. Therefore a special provision must be made for its impact in the year 2000-01. The additional expenditure on the East Timor defence effort has a particularly severe impact in the next financial year. By contrast, in the current year and the year subsequent to 2000-01, even after East Timor costs have been allowed for, the budget is expected to remain in healthy surplus.
As a result of the extra costs since last May, and in particular the unexpected defence costs relating to East Timor of around $1.1 billion in the 2000-01 financial year, it is calculated that, without additional measures, the budget in that year—that is, the year commencing 1 July 2000—will record an underlying cash deficit of approximately $500 million. The government is not willing for this to occur. The days of budget deficits should remain firmly behind us. The economic consequences of high deficits, particularly the pressure they place on interest rates, should be unacceptable to all honourable members.
The government has decided therefore to introduce a temporary Defence-East Timor levy for 2000-01 only. This levy will be applied as an addition to the Medicare levy on the income of taxpayers earning above $50,000 a year.
The levy will be set at 0.5 per cent for taxpayers with an income of between $50,000 and $100,000, and at one per cent for taxpayers with incomes above $100,000 a year. There will be appropriate shade-ins to smooth the impact on taxpayers earning just above $50,000 and $100,000. The levy will apply only for a 12-month period from 1 July 2000, ending on 30 June 2001.
Applying the levy on incomes above $50,000 will protect low- and many middle-income earners. The levy will begin on the same date that tax cuts begin under the government's tax reform. It will reduce only slightly—and for only one year—the tax cuts that those taxpayers will receive. For example, a single taxpayer with an income of $60,000 a year will receive a tax cut of nearly $62 a week and the levy will reduce that for one year only by about $6 a week. With this approach, 80 per cent of all Australian taxpayers will receive their tax cuts in full from 1 July next year.
The levy will collect approximately $900 million in 2000-01. That sum will substantially cover the East Timor defence costs arising in that year. After 2000-01, the East Timor defence costs can be absorbed by the budget whilst maintaining strong surpluses. The community, I hope, will support this measure as a fair and reasonable one to help fund the bulk of our defence costs relating to East Timor 
 in 2000-01. The only alternative to this special and temporary levy would be further cuts in government spending.
Given the expenditure savings of earlier years, the necessary funds of approximately $1 billion could not have been obtained without paring back in essential areas of social expenditure, such as health, education and welfare for the needy. The government does not believe it would be fair to do this. The levy I have announced is the fair and decent way to deal with this unexpected budget difficulty in the next financial year. There will of course be other requirements for Defence that do not relate to our involvement in East Timor, such as completing the submarines and other procurement decisions. These will be considered in the normal budget process and in the context of next year's defence white paper.
Australians from all walks of life have responded sympathetically to the suffering of the East Timorese people, and I want to acknowledge the great willingness of so many individuals and organisations to help in different ways. In particular, Australian non-government organisations, including the churches, have played an important role. Australian business can also play a significant part. The government convened a meeting with business groups and aid agencies in response to the strong interest from the business community in helping with reconstruction. I warmly welcome the contributions already made or foreshadowed by the timber, construction, power and pharmaceutical industries. The Northern Territory government has also provided valuable help. Darwin will continue to serve as the principal logistics base for UNTAET in the period ahead.
East Timor's resources are limited. Now that it is entering the phase of reconstruction and nation building, it will need a great deal of international support. Australia will act generously, but we cannot carry the full burden alone. The government is encouraging others to make substantial
commitments. Even with international help, however, East Timor's future prosperity can ultimately be assured only by the East Timorese themselves. Only they can put in place the democratic, transparent and accountable political and economic institutions on which a viable state can be created.
I was therefore pleased with the approaches Mr Xanana Gusmao laid out in my meeting with him in October. He is realistic about the challenges that face East Timor. His commitment to pursuing reconciliation is encouraging, and we hope he will work closely with UNTAET. He understands the importance for East Timor's future of a good relationship with Indonesia. President Wahid's readiness to meet Mr Gusmao in order to lay sound foundations for the future is also to be particularly welcomed. Australia's own relationship with 
 Indonesia has been under some strain because of East Timor. Now that East Timor's status has been resolved, both sides can move on. Australia and Indonesia are neighbours, and it makes sense for us to cooperate closely. Australia has long been a good friend to Indonesia, and we gave it strong support during its recent economic crisis.
Indonesia has a new democratic government and an elected president who has a record of commitment to human rights and tolerance and to economic and political reform. Both countries have important interests in common. I am confident that on the basis of mutual respect both of us can build a mutually advantageous and pragmatic relationship.

Mr Speaker, let me conclude by again expressing on behalf of all Australians the immense pride we feel in the contribution of the serving men and women of our nation now in East Timor. The success of the operation thus far is a tribute to their skills and their professionalism. They are well trained, they are superbly led, and each day they bring great credit to this country and to those values in which we all believe.
Although casualties to date have been thankfully limited, we continue to share the anxiety of family and other loved ones here in Australia for the safety of those serving in East Timor. We wish them all a safe return home.

(a)	 All figures are on an accrual basis.
(b)	 Defence costs over the four year period are based on a planning scenario which assumes an ongoing deployment as part of the UN peace keeping operation. Actual spending will depend on the length of the UN peacekeeping operation while the ongoing need for the additional battalions will be examined in the Government's White Paper on Defence.
(c)	 Extra Operational costs for the ADF.
(d)	 Costs associated with upgrading and replacing major capital equipment for the deployment in East Timor and the expanded force.
(e)	 Cost associated with raising 2 additional battalion groups and an extra air field defence squadron (around 3.500 personnel). This will ensure the deployment in East Timor can be sustained without impairing the overall readiness of the ADF.
(f)	 The deployment involves a cost to the budget through the income tax exemption for pay and allowances of ADF personnel on eligible duty outside Australia. 
",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Australian Defence Force Deployment</title>,Ministerial Statements,6,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-11-23,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
At the beginning of the debate on this important issue I would like to convey to the chamber the opposition's support, subject to our own internal caucus processes which have not been able to be used in this case because of the short notice of this statement. The caucus process has not been possible in this circumstance. But subject to that caveat, I would like to convey the opposition's support for the proposals in the statement.
We believe that the Prime Minister's statement is consistent with Labor's strong support for INTERFET, for the ADF and for the people of East Timor. The aspect of this particular statement which will attract the most attention is the Defence-East Timor levy. So I would like to deal with that matter 
 first. Again, subject to the processes of the caucus, I would like to indicate our in principle support for the levy. This is consistent with out view that our troops must have everything they need in this deployment and that there are real questions for our defence structure down the track. I might add that we could not have a better reminder of the need to ensure revenue neutrality in the business tax reforms and for ongoing attention to the offsetting arrangements for the GST package.
We think it appropriate that those most likely to benefit from this government's past and proposed tax reforms are those who it is intended will pay this levy. I note in passing that this levy would not be necessary had the government not spent $17 billion on its GST package—$6 billion of that in the year this levy will be introduced alone. But those are matters for just passing mention. The fact is that the opposition supports the levy in principle and we do so because we support our troops absolutely.
As we have made clear on very many occasions, we thoroughly support the INTERFET deployment in East Timor. We believe that the professionalism of the ADF has been amply demonstrated throughout this deployment. Some have questioned the capabilities of the ADF, but the truth is we are without question among the most professional and effective fighting forces in the world. We have always been at this level and we have proved it again in East Timor, and our forces deserve all the support that we can give them.
On reserves, we understand there is more detail to be provided, and we look forward to looking closely at it when it is forthcoming, but we would add a couple of points. Firstly, whatever is done on reserves, we would have been far better placed had this government not abolished the Ready Reserve upon coming to power. Secondly, whatever is done must take account of the issues we in the opposition have raised on numerous occasions, including two private members' bills that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, has been associated with—that is, the protection of leave entitlements for reservists to undertake their reserve duties as an allowable matter in awards and the protection of civil 
 employment for those reservists who are called up for service.
We are pleased to see the government commit $60 million for aid to East Timor. We note that the $60 million might be a good start, but it cannot be the end of the story. There is no money committed above the existing very small aid program beyond 1999-2000, yet an enormous amount of work needs to be done in rebuilding infrastructure, in replacing the infrastructure funding previously provided to East Timor as a province and, of course, in humanitarian work for the people of East Timor.
Part of Australia's support should also be in the area of lending our expertise to the establishment of political and administrative institutions in East Timor—for example, legal experts, public service experts, economists, finance experts and the like. East Timor needs that sort of expertise. Australia has it, and we should stand ready to provide it wherever possible. There are always many people of decency and of goodwill who emerge in difficult times like these, but there are often some unscrupulous operators ready to take advantage. To the extent that we can help them avoid the latter, we should be there to do so as well.
There are, of course, diplomatic issues which extend beyond the scope of the Prime Minister's statement but which are no less important both to our deployment and to the future of East Timor, and I would just like to touch on those for a short time. The first point is that Australia should be very grateful for the support of the United States. We welcome the strong support of the United States in securing the diplomatic conditions for INTERFET's deployment in the first place and then in backing up that support with visits by the Secretary of Defence and, most recently, by Ambassador Holbrook. We could not want for a better contribution from our greatest ally since this deployment. The United States's strong diplomatic presence has been indispensable in securing a dangerous environment, and of course that goes for the people of East Timor and also for our own troops on the ground in East Timor.
But the further crucial question is the role of Indonesia in East Timor's future. We would echo the words of Richard Holbrook in saying that Indonesia's reputation in the international community will depend to a significant extent on its role in East Timor's security. The new Wahid government has, in our view, a magnificent opportunity to establish its international credentials. The immediate task is the disarming of the militias, currently in West Timor, to remove the external threat to the new state of East Timor. There must also be a role for Indonesia in the rebuilding of East Timor through material and political support.
There are many issues raised in this statement, and these are obviously going to be the subject of debate in days to come. Let me say clearly that we support, in principle, the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister as a useful contribution to our current troop deployment, to our future defence posture and, of course, to the future of East Timor.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Australian Defence Force Deployment</title>,Ministerial Statements,6,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-11-23,"—I rise to speak briefly on the Prime Minister's statement relating to East Timor. I would like to say at the outset that we are very pleased to note that there will be no cuts to services in order to fund our commitments in East Timor. We note that an additional two battalions will be raised for our Army and also other Defence personnel will be recruited, and these costs will be met through revenue raising.
I wish to put on the record the support of the Australian Democrats for those fundraising proposals and for both parts of this initiative—the government in their actions and the comments made by the Prime Minister. I would just like to look at some other parts of the statement. In particular, I note how pleased we are to see that we are part of a 17-nation force that is working in East Timor to secure peace in that country and to start assisting the citizens of East Timor get their lives back together again.
On behalf of the Democrats, I want to say how pleased we are with all that our force in INTERFET has achieved. We congratulate the men and women who are over there working so hard in the interests of the people of East 
 Timor. We note with pleasure that life in Dili is slowly returning to normal and that the markets are resuming. In some of the outlying villages, things are still a little slow to get back to anything like a normal way of life, but more and more of the displaced residents are returning and starting to get their shattered lives back together.
The biggest problem is that so many East Timorese still find themselves in West Timor. Despite the assurances of the Indonesian government and the variety of different promises, very little seems to be happening on a large scale. People on a regular basis are finding their way back into East Timor, and that is an issue we encourage the government to pursue vigorously to ensure that all those people who wish to return to East Timor can do so as a matter of urgency before the worst of the wet season is upon them. These people should be given the opportunity to get back to their homes and be in some reasonable level of restoration before the full wet season is on them.
There are a number of comments in the Prime Minister's statement relating to the substantial and tremendous effort of our troops, but he also said that this is a long-term commitment. Once the peace has been restored, we will be part of the long-term peacekeeping operation. It may be that that is required year after year after year in order to ensure that the people of East Timor can get their country back together again and resume their lives.
I note on page 8 of the Prime Minister's statement a reference to the arrangements that we made on the ANTS tax package and the cost to the budget of that. I point out that at that time we said to the government that the tax cuts for those on high incomes should be pared back even more. Effectively, we are now seeing that happen—not back to where we had recommended they go, but we are taxing those earning over $50,000 and taxing those earning over $100,000 at double that rate in order to fund these immediate commitments to East Timor. We wish to support the government in that and to say that this is certainly the fairest way we could have secured this amount of money.
However, I do wish to point out that the table at the back which looks at expenditure through 1999-2000 out to 2002-03 does not include an amount for aid beyond this year. That hole is going to have to be filled. In an earlier part of the statement, the Prime Minister noted that and said that we will be told what that amount is, but we can only wonder where that amount of money is going to be found. Nowhere is there any mention of our direct support for the rebuilding and for the actual infrastructure that needs to be put back in place in East Timor.
Also, there is no ongoing funding for the civilian police force, for the role of the United Nations and for our support of the administrative part of the UN's role in East Timor. I do point out that, while we have raised this amount of money through the Medicare levy being increased for only 12 months, there may be a need to look in the future at an ongoing stream of finance for our long-term commitment to East Timor.
We have been arguing throughout the debate on business tax that there would be pressures on the budget bottom line as a result of our commitment to East Timor and that we have to be doubly certain we are not going to leave the budget under further stress because of the decisions we make on business tax. There has been a specific amount identified in the small section on the personal aspect of capital gains tax within the business package, and that in itself is at least another $400 million a year.
So while we have welcomed this statement and it has taken some pressure off the debate of where business tax is going, it certainly has not reduced our commitment to making sure that the business tax package is revenue neutral. There simply is no fat left to trim off any of our social programs—not off our schools, our hospitals, our universities or any of our environment programs. There is nothing spare left. After the first two Costello budgets, we have argued all along that there was far too much cut from government expenditure.
We will be continuing to push for substantial aid for East Timor so as to fill those gaps in the chart that has been provided to us 
 today. If we look at the fact that the government is using an unusual device of asking the Reserve Bank to defer some $600 million of its dividends payments until next year, we believe the budget is still under incredible pressure and could still be heading for a deficit.
I will close there and simply state again that the Democrats fully support the government's decision not to touch services but to raise the money through an additional Medicare levy. I congratulate all of those who are working so well in East Timor to give that country a future.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>East Timor: Australian Defence Force Deployment</title>,Ministerial Statements,6,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—I also support the Australian contingent and all the people involved in establishing the East Timorese nation to our immediate north. I am happy to pay the Timor tax. As a parliamentarian I am receiving an income of more than $80,000 a year. I am very supportive of the fact that this is aimed at high income earners, who can afford to be contributing towards the Australian presence in East Timor as it moves towards being our newest fully independent national neighbour.
That said, I am also very aware that the $900 million that is involved here is the same figure that the Treasurer said before the 1996 elections would be coming from high wealth individuals who do not pay their tax, who avoid tax one way or another. The government has not been able to recoup that $900 million. Were it able to, we would be able to support this East Timorese presence through people defaulting on taxes in this country—people who still need to be pursued and who ought to be paying their taxes. I am also very aware that half the multinational corporations in this country pay no tax at all. That is a matter that needs rectification. 
However, the thrust of the Prime Minister's statement is towards the East Timorese, to give them assurance that Australia is with them. I note that it is also towards mending relationships with Indonesia. This is going to be a difficult matter. It is going to require maturity in Jakarta as well as in Canberra. It is not, in my books, a case for turning our back on the people seeking self-determination in Aceh and in West Papua in particular. 
 These issues will not be resolved and the aspirations of those people will not be resolved by us saying that East Timor is the end of it. Putting to right, after such a horrible history over the last 25 years, the East Timorese situation does not enable us to turn our back on the rest.
I hope that the government will be learning from Australia's sorry history in regard to East Timor when it comes to the other inherent nations such as Aceh and West Papua and their right to have their day in the sun. That said, I again give my support to this way of raising the necessary money to ensure Australia's commitment to East Timor stays strong, firm and friendly to all concerned.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—In view of that objection from this side of the House, pursuant to contingent notice of motion standing in my name, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion No. 362.
My motion to the Senate reads:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes that:
	 (i)	 19 November 1999 was the 30th anniversary of the United Nations (UN) Resolution to remove West Papua from its list of non-self-governing territories of the UN Decolonisation Commission,
	 (ii)	 documents released in 1999 show that Australian and United States intelligence surmised that 95 per cent of West Papuans wanted independence in 1969, and
	 (iii)	 the recent protests against Indonesian rule, involving 1,500 youths and other civilians in Jayapura—
which is the capital of West Papua—
		 condemned the government's move to split the province; and
(b)	 resolves that the 1969 `vote' in West Papua was neither free nor democratic and the UN should now act to provide West Papuans with a genuine act of self-determination. 

This is an extremely important matter. If there is one part of the Indonesian empire that is closer to Australia than East Timor it is West Papua. In West Papua there are nearly two million people who aspire to their freedom. The latest news reports point to 1 December, which is, in effect, independence day for West Papuans, being marked by the raising of the Morning Star flag of the West Papuans.
The chamber might remember me asking for assurances from the Australian government last year as we approached that anniversary that this nation would be doing everything it could to help protect West Papuans against Indonesian military brutality following the Biak massacre last year where anything between 20 and 120 people were machine-gunned effectively after they had raised the Morning Star flag in Biak. That monumental day for the West Papuans is coming again. Let me read from an AAP overseas news report of Monday. It says:
The Morning Star flag was raised last week in the grounds of the Three Kings Catholic Church in Timika, on the central south coast of Indonesia's easternmost province—
that is West Papua—
It was still flying after several days, a situation unheard of in the past, even under the more liberal tenure of the third Indonesian president BJ Habibie.
When the Morning Star was hoisted in Biak, in 1998, less than two months after Habibie took over from long-serving president Suharto, troops opened fired in an incident that has been reported as a massacre by church investigators.
Among other new independence groups is the National Council of West Papua . . . , set up by traditional leaders whose head, Theys Eluai, is called the Father of West Papua.
The group's primary aim is getting the independence message out to Europe, the Pacific and Asia.
This council acted as a sort of alternative parliament to prepare for independence, Theys said.
But he admitted that the OPM—
the Free West Papua movement—
was not involved.
""Our struggle is a diplomatic one, not a military one,"" Theys told AAP.
""We haven't talked with the OPM, but we have similar objectives for independence."" 

Theys said some students also supported the council.
I also want to refer to the article by Anthony Balmain in the Sydney Morning Herald  and the Age  on 26 August this year which pointed out:
As East Timor prepares to vote in a United Nations ballot on its future, previously secret documents show Australia played a leading behind-the-scenes role to ensure Irian Jaya—
that is, West Papua—
became a part of Indonesia in another UN-supervised vote—the so-called Act of Free Choice in 1969.
The article goes on to show what a sham that act was, with only 1,025 people voting out of 800,000. No women were involved in that vote. Those who did vote were very clearly under coercion. Yet the rest of the world turned its back on West Papua, and Australia did so knowingly. One US document given to Australia before the process of self-determination in 1969 said:
Personal political views of the United Nations team are that 95 per cent of Irianese—
that is, West Papuans—
support the independence movement and that the Act of Free Choice is a mockery.
Yet here we are, in 1999, 30 years down the line, not allowing this matter to come to a vote. That will effectively be the outcome, as I see it, of my raising this issue today. Let me give a commitment that I will continue to raise the issue, because the West Papuans deserve nothing less.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-11-23,"—I advised Senator Brown prior to reaching this item of business that the opposition would not grant formality on this matter, as it was a matter which involved a foreign affairs matter and on which there was not a consensus. That position is entirely consistent with the position that Senator Brown knows is a position adopted by the opposition on matters which fulfil those criteria. I simply put on record again that that is the opposition's position and the position we will take on matters which fill those criteria.
As to the suggestion that this matter is so urgent that standing orders be suspended, the opposition will not support a move to suspend 
 at this stage. We cannot see that the  motion gives rise to matters which need to be considered urgently and Senator Brown has other forms of this place by which to have the matter considered.
—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Brown be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye, against say no.
—Aye.
—I think the noes have it.
—Divide.
—Senator Brown, we cannot divide on one voice.
—Would you have my lone voice noted in dissent from that vote?
—Certainly.

In the interests of good will the government adjourned the debate last night to ensure that the Western Australian Democrat Senator Brian Greig

Indeed, we ensured that the debate was adjourned to suit him—which we do from time to time, as honourable senators opposite know. We try to facilitate full and considered debate of the government's legislative agenda. We look forward to Senator Greig's imminent arrival in the chamber. I am really only speaking to avoid senators opposite calling a quorum. I welcome the new Democrat senator for Western Australia and, since I will be leaving the chamber, look forward to reading his remarks in the Hansard .",SENATE,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-23,"—I thank the Senate for its indulgence. Wearing my hat as the Democrats' spokesperson on Attorney-General's matters, I am pleased to present on behalf of the Australian Democrats a speech on the second reading of the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999.
This parliament has created comparatively fewer courts than those created by the states. One reason for this is that, even today, the largest amount of legal work for Australian citizens is presided over by state and territory courts exercising their own jurisdiction and not that of the Commonwealth. For the Australian Democrats, the establishment of a new court must be seen in the context of why we even have courts in the first place. On this point, some of the learned scholars of the past are instructive for how the Australian Democrats see this latest initiative by the government.
As far back as 1748, well before the arrival of white people's law in this country, Montisesquieu had the following to say on the separation of powers:
There is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and the executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. There would be an end to everything were the same man or the same body, whether of the nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of 
 enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.
More recently, in 1981, former High Court Justice and former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, said the following:
But within its own modest limits judicial independence conduces to the free society and it is within those limits that I confine myself tonight. If judicial independence is in itself far from a complete protection against absolutism in government it is nevertheless a sure touchstone of freedom under the law; where it exists absolutism  has not yet established itself, and where it is absent absolutism is likely to have free reign.
It is therefore with some concern that the Democrats have viewed the agenda of the minister for immigration in curtailing judicial review within his portfolio. One wonders if even the jurisdiction of the High Court would be safe from the minister for immigration should he deem it necessary to curtail the civil liberties of people within our shorelines.
However, to the extent that this bill furthers access to justice, it is a welcome development. Unfortunately, with the present cuts to legal aid, access to justice has become a term of endearment rather than a benchmark of Australian democracy. All the courts in the world cannot create justice if those people who need it the most cannot cross the threshold because of the costs associated with access to that justice.
In analysing the debates and issues related to this to date, the Australian Democrats will be supporting this bill but, additionally, will be supporting the bulk of the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party, in particular those relating to industrial relations. We Democrats have no particular concern with the creation of a new Federal Court structure and are perfectly accommodating of the notion and happy to facilitate support for greater access and equity within such a structure, particularly to the extent to which it might facilitate or take some of the stress off our existing Family Court. That concludes my remarks on this point. Thank you.
(Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-11-23,"—in reply—I would like to thank all honourable senators for contributing to the 
 debate on this important legislation. There are just a few points that need to be made. One relates to how the Federal Magistrates Service will help ease delays in the family law system. It will do that by easing the workload of the court, since it will be able to deal with many matters which judges currently deal with as well as those matters which can currently be dealt with by registrars. Because the federal magistrates will be able to make final orders and hear matters more quickly, there should be less need for interim applications and hence less need for parties to appear so frequently before the court.
The service is an efficient use of Commonwealth funds. It will have very close links with the existing federal courts and will share many of those courts' facilities. In that way, duplication can be avoided and the best use will be made of all available resources. That strategy will minimise both the set-up and ongoing costs of the service. Both courts have been cooperating with the Attorney-General's Department in planning how that will actually work in practice.
The question has been raised: why not appoint magistrates to the existing Federal and Family Courts? In respect of that matter, the government is of the view that it is essential that federal magistrates be appointed to a separate court. The service will develop a new culture with an emphasis on user-friendly streamlined procedures. They will facilitate access by unrepresented litigants and minimise technicalities and delays. The new culture cannot be achieved by appointing magistrates to the existing federal courts and incorporating them in their cultures. That view is supported by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, who considers that the establishment of a new and separate court is essential to enable a different culture and new practices to be developed which are appropriate for dealing with smaller and less complex matters.
Senator McKiernan raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to have part-time federal magistrates, querying whether part-time appointments would be unconstitutional or cause problems with conflicts of interest. The provision has been drafted to minimise 
 any risk of appointments being held to be unconstitutional and has been the subject of careful consideration and advice. I note the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee obtained the opinion of Professor George Williams on the issue. He advised the committee in September that it seems unlikely that chapter III of the Constitution would prevent those appointments. Individual federal magistrates would not be appointed where conflicts of interest were likely to arise. The magistrates will not be permitted to practise as lawyers, which will assist in minimising any conflict of interest they may have.
The bill also makes it clear that the doctrine of constitutional incompatibility developed by the High Court will still apply to such activities, as it currently does to High Court, Federal Court and Family Court judges. The Law Council of Australia initially had reservations about part-time magistrates. However, I note that the Law Council now supports the provisions of the bill which deal with those matters and considers that the issue of potential conflicts of interest is adequately addressed in the bill.
As to workplace relations and the jurisdiction, Senators Bolkus, Ludwig, Cooney, Collins and McKiernan made comments about the court's jurisdiction under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. There will be more to say about that when we reach the opposition's proposed amendments, but at this point I should say that this jurisdiction will be concurrent with that of the Federal Court so that more complex matters will continue to be dealt with in a superior court.
Finally, the establishment of the new Federal Magistrates Service is an important step towards ensuring suitable access to the justice system for all Australians. I thank honourable senators who have contributed to the debate on these matters.",SENATE,<title>FEDERAL MAGISTRATES BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1

This particular amendment has been before us before, and it seeks to amend the government's amendment to the bill which was made in the House of Representatives. The government's amendment sought to establish a Forest Products Advisory Council. Instead, our amendment seeks to establish a fully functional Wood and Paper Industry Council and defines its objectives, functions, powers, composition, meeting procedures, remuneration and allowances, financial procedures and reporting requirements. It also empowers the council to employ staff and engage consultants.
Essentially, the genesis for this can be traced back to the 1992 National Forest Policy Statement, a statement which encompassed more than just regional security and conservation matters. Industry development was an aspect of that, and we think it is important for the Senate to proceed on the basis of a council which is much broader and much more fully composed than the government's proposal. That is embodied in this amendment.
—I might just seek your guidance for a moment, Chair, this being my first involvement in a message from the House of Representatives. As circulated on sheet 1630, we Democrats propose to reintroduce our original amendments to Labor's original proposal for a Wood and Paper Industry Council. Am I able to do that now? Is this the point at which I can do that?
—Yes. But, before you go on, we do have an Australian Green amendment on sheet 1629, and it was my intention to go to that first. It is an amendment to the opposition amendment on sheet 1617.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—If it will help the committee, I will move that amendment:
After paragraph 15(1)(d), insert:
		 (da)	 a person nominated by the Australian Conservation Foundation; 

This amendment places a member of the Australian Conservation Foundation on the council that is being established. I think this is acceptable to the Labor Party. It follows part (c) in the `Constitution of Council', which would have `two persons nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions', and it is more specific than the standing part (d), which says:
. . . a person representing persons having an interest in the protection of forest environments and ecosystems—
I am sure Senator Bolkus would agree with me that that would leave the way open for the government to appoint anybody at all under the elastic definition of the environment and ecosystems which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, has and which includes anything and everything.
It is important that we be specific and that we not have somebody from the woodchip corporations—who I think will dominate this council anyway—representing forest environments and ecosystems. As I have said so many times before in this debate, the woodchip corporations which run the forest industry in Australia—and there are only a handful of them—are in the business of wreaking havoc in Australia's unprotected, grand wild forests. They are in the process of logging those forests. In Tasmania and also on parts of the mainland where those forests are logged, 90 per cent of them do not go to sawmills, do not go to downstream processing and do not go to creating more jobs in Australia; they go to the woodchip mills to line the pockets of companies like Bunnings, North and the other corporations involved in woodchipping.
It is very important, if this council is going to have any validity at all and not simply be a taxpayer funded cipher to the logging industry, that it at least have a voice for the environment that is recognised as such. That is why I have put forward this amendment in specific terms.
The Australian conservation movement represents 80 per cent of public feeling in this matter. I am being conservative when it comes to Western Australia, but that is what the opinion polls show as the proportion of 
 Australians who do not want the continued destruction of our grand wild forests and their wildlife by the woodchip industry. So if they are going to be represented adequately, they need to have faith in that representation, even though it will be but a voice on this council. It will not be able to affect outcomes. My amendment, which says that `a person nominated by the Australian Conservation Foundation' be on the council, would fulfil that democratic role.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-23,"—The opposition does support Senator Brown's amendment, which would in essence put on the council a person nominated by the Australian Conservation Foundation. Senator Brown has disappeared for the moment, but I indicate that at this part of the debate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-23,"—This amendment by Senator Brown is in accord with what we Democrats had been advocating previously. It is a sensible and appropriate amendment, and it brings home the point that there is such inherent distrust with the Australian people towards the process that we know as the RFA.
Senators may be interested to note that, within the last two or three days, some 114 environmental experts and/or scientists have outed themselves, as it were, in a list through the Western Australian media to the effect that, although they were a part of the RFA process in Western Australia, they are not by any means happy with the outcome and, by inference, resent the implication that they had somehow endorsed the process—a curious contradiction, I think, to what the state minister, Mrs Edwardes, had been saying.
In that sense, the inclusion of somebody from the ACF to such a council is an appropriate step. It will hopefully reinstate, to the extent that it can, some sense of faith and trust in what is an inherently flawed process but which must at all times have a voice from all stakeholders.
—The question is that the Australian Green amendment on sheet 1629 to the opposition amendment on sheet 1617 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—We now proceed to Democrat amendment No. 13. Senator Greig, are you proceeding with this amendment? I understand it overlaps the previous amendment and has been dealt with by that amendment.
—You are quite right and, on that basis, I withdraw amendment No. 13.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—I move Green amendments on sheet 1621:
(1)	 After paragraph 15(1)(j), insert:
	 (ja)	 a person representing the interests of the forest-related tourism sector;
	 (jb)	 a person representing the interests of the forest-related water sector;
(2)	 Subsection 15(5), omit ""or (j)"", substitute ""(j), (ja) or (jb)"".
These amendments would put on the Wood and Paper Industry Council, firstly, a person representing the interests of the forest related tourism sector and, secondly, a person representing the interests of the forest related water sector. Let me speak briefly to both of those appointments.
Firstly, in Tasmania, from where two-thirds of the woodchips exported out of this country emanate, the cry has always been that the forests are there for jobs. We have seen that as the rate of woodchipping increases the number of jobs has fallen—in fact it has fallen by more than 5,000 since the woodchip industry began in Tasmania. This has been matched by an increase in jobs in the tourism and service industries by people wanting to come and see the forests. This is a very real use of the forest resource. It is particularly vital in Tasmania where, as senators will know, the unemployment problem is worse than in other parts of Australia.
The tourism industry in Tasmania supports more than 18,000 jobs; the logging industry in native forests supports 2,000 jobs. When you look at that component of the tourism industry that depends on wild forests, you find that it is 3,000 jobs. So already in Tasmania there are more jobs in the tourist and service industries dependent on natural forest being protected than there are dependent on the woodchip and associated industries which are involved in destroying that same resource.
You cannot have it both ways. You cannot log a resource and expect tourists to go there. Other people who live in Tasmania will corroborate my experience that, while visitors proclaim the beauty of Tasmania, they are universal in their condemnation of the ugliness of the woodchip industry and the destruction which it occasions all over the state, not just in state forests, publicly owned forests, but increasingly in private forests where the destruction of the rural landscape and even the urban visual amenity has become unprecedented in Australian history since Prime Minister Howard and then Liberal Premier Mr Rundle signed the Regional Forest Agreement.
Far from the forest agreement leading to the security of jobs that the industry and the Labor and Liberal parties in Tasmania always said would follow, 500 jobs have been shed from the industry since the Regional Forest Agreement was signed. That agreement opened the way to the greatest onslaught on Tasmania's forests in history. That surely is saying something. Nevertheless, the tourism and service industries in Tasmania continue to bolster the employment figures.
It is very important that senators, including Senator Troeth, understand this: you cannot have it both ways. You cannot destroy the resource upon which the tourism and service industries depend for thousands of jobs and say that you are creating jobs. It would be totally remiss for a council which is looking at the health of the wood and wood products industries in Tasmania to not include looking at the biggest employer of the lot—that is, the tourist related industry—which depends on wild forests and wild landscapes. It would be absurd to do so. It would reflect thinking of a couple of decades ago.
The forest industry these days has changed. Industrial forestry has no place destroying the job creating service industries in Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. This is a very important matter. I was very disappointed that the emergent new tourism industry based on Tasmania's wild and scenic attributes and its wilderness did not take a much more aggressive role in the regional forest agreement 
 business. But the power base in Tasmania which has been established by the logging industry over these last few decades is awesome indeed. There is a small business community which is very much interconnected, and the people who are involved know when to keep their heads down. It is truly a great pity that the tourism industry did not bore in there in defence of business, jobs and, I might add, the service industries which, very much distinct from the big woodchip industries based outside Tasmania, put their money back into the Tasmanian economy. You will note that this is a Green not talking about the environmental amenity per se but talking about jobs and the economy. I would be very happy for the government or anybody else to provide a different set of figures to that which I have put before the Senate just now.
Once again, placing a person representing the interests of the forest related tourism sector on this council is not going to enable them to have sway. They ought to, but they are not going to have it; the woodchippers will get that. Nevertheless, it is excruciatingly important that their voice be there and that it be heard and that it be a genuine person representing the forest related tourism sector.
Further, this amendment would ensure that a person representing the interests of the forest related water sector be there, and that also is hugely important. Forests and water go together. What is left of our forests is very often high in the catchments of rivers and streams flowing to the sea via townships and through agricultural areas which are very dependent on the water. Members will know that, these days, high-tech forestry also involves such things as pesticides and herbicides on a large scale and that there is great alarm about water pollution from the mud which gets into these stream systems and is currently threatening marvellous species like the world's largest crayfish, Astracopsis gouldii, in Tasmania's north-west streams and also the wellbeing of the human population further down. It threatens that much-touted clean green image. It threatens organic farming. It threatens other economic and job important components of the future. Again, we cannot have it both ways. It is extraordi 
 narily important that somebody who is involved in that forest related water sector be on this council.
I might add here, Chair, because you might not be aware of this, that studies in Victoria have shown that the value of forests in Melbourne's water catchment to supplying a clean and natural water system to the metropolis of Melbourne is far greater than the value of cutting those trees down and transporting them off to the woodchip mill and the rubbish dumps of Japan—far greater. That is an economic fact. This is not me coming up with an assumption. This is a result of independent studies and is there for all to see, and everybody of course knows about it.
It is putting our heads in the sand if, when it comes to the future of forests, we do not have somebody involved in the water related industries, which are themselves dependent on what happens in forests, not only in headwaters but throughout catchments in this wonderful country of ours on a wood and wood products council. Again, they are going to be underrepresented. But it would be very remiss were their voice to be shut out altogether. We are still at a very primitive stage in the way in which governments deal with the forest resource in this country, but it is time that we started to catch up. It is essential that the voice of the tourism sector and the water sector be heard on this council and that it have a say in formulating an informed policy and putting that to the body politic as well as to the public in the most rounded out way possible.
—Before I call Senator Bolkus, I clarify that the matter before the chair is Senator Brown's amendments Nos 1 and 2 on sheet 1621, which is an amendment to opposition sheet 1617, as amended.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-23,"—I wish to briefly come into the debate at this stage. This is an issue that has been discussed both in this place and also privately with Senator Brown in terms of trying to get the opposition to support his proposal on sheet 1621. Discussions we have had indicated at an earlier stage that we were prepared to support one part of the proposal, the part 
 that goes to the forest related tourism sector. The opposition, as expressed to Senator Brown previously, had difficulties in accommodating both aspects of it.
I suggest to Senator Brown that he may be able to move his amendment in an amended form at a later stage. He may want to test the numbers with respect to the whole amendment. If he were to move an amendment which basically encompassed (ja) and had a consequential amendment to the second part of his amendment on sheet 1621, we would be able to support the insertion of `a person representing the interests of the forest-related tourism sector'.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—I have yet to hear the force of Senator Bolkus's argument on this, but I can count. Therefore, I would take that suggestion and will test it separately if the committee will permit me to do so; that is, to separate (ja) and (jb) as in the amendment that the Greens are putting forward. Therefore, we would first deal with a person going on to the council who would come from the tourism sector, then separately deal with the representation by somebody from the water sector.
—Senator Brown, we can divide the question, and we will do so. The question is that amendment (1) to insert a new paragraph (ja) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-23,"—The Democrats will be supporting this amendment in relation to the forest related tourism sector and a person from such a scenario being involved in the proposed council. It never ceases to amaze me the extent to which those who advocate a thriving forest industry in terms of employment and jobs ignore or overlook or are wilfully blind to the immense and greater potential of tourism; that is, enjoying the forests as they are rather than chopping them down.
I have been struck by some interesting images over the last few months. On Sunday nights, I—and I am sure many of us—have been watching on television the spectacular BBC program on dinosaurs. It intrigued me that the background footage—the landscape—used in that program was chosen from very 
 specific places on the globe, one of which was the Tasmanian highlands. It was chosen for its ancient and existing beauty. It stuck me that, at the very time such immense beauty is shown around the world—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I accept that it is protected. But the point I am making is that it is constantly advocated and demonstrated as being something which we should all support and enjoy and be lured to. When I last spoke on this in the Senate I explained that I had recently spent some time in and around the region of Deloraine and Meander—this was my first time in Tasmania—and I had spent some time in the logged and being-logged region of Mother Cummings Peak and its surrounds. I hesitate to refer to it as logging; it is more like mining. The utter devastation has to be seen to be believed. Yet as you stand on that peak in the midst of this utter devastation, you cannot but be struck by the immense beauty of the place and wonder why the tourism industry, most particularly in Tasmania but also in my home state of Western Australia, is continuing to be denied the greater patronage that it is crying out for. I understand there is a tourism exhibition about to take place in Tasmania as I speak.
I was also struck by the fact that, in my home state of Western Australia in the Karri forests around Pemberton, there is a magnificent tree of some—unless I am mistaken—70 metres in height known as the Gloucester Tree. It is very famous in Western Australia. It is a tree which almost every Western Australian, who is able to, is keen to climb and enjoy. It is marketed very much as one of the highlights of that region. People can no longer climb that tree. The reason offered is that it is now dangerous. I am led to believe that that is nonsense and that the real reason the Gloucester Tree was closed is that, when people climb to the top of it, they can see the logging that is going on in nearby districts and are horrified by it.
In my home state, I was struck recently by some imagery of the state Minister for the Environment, Mrs Edwardes, handing out awards to members of the tourism industry within Western Australia and basking in the 
 glow of how wonderful our south-west forests were and that we should be doing more to promote tourism within them. This was occurring at the very time when in excess of 80 per cent of people in my home state were screaming out in outrage over the continued logging of native forests in that very region. For that reason it comes as no difficulty for us whatsoever to support the notion that should any such council exist, as is being advocated by the Labor Party, then it is imperative that it involve at least one person from the forest related tourism sector.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown to insert paragraph (ja) be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The question now is that Senator Brown's amendment to insert paragraph (jb) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—I draw the committee's attention again to the amendment which proposes that a person representing the interests of the forest-related water sector should be on this council. I will not go over the argument again, but I want to repeat that we are not talking here about some minor or side issue to the proper management of forests. We are talking about a multimillion dollar component, if not multibillion dollar component, annually of the forest industry impact on Australia's wellbeing. I reiterate that studies in Victoria for one have shown that the value of forests in important catchments being unlogged—that is, staying as they are—is greater than the value of cutting them down and carting them off to the woodchip mill.
It needs to be said that the value accrues differently, though. When you are talking about the value of keeping catchments pristine, and being able to slowly release the water into the river systems and then into the water systems of cities like Melbourne, you are talking about the interests of millions. But when you are talking about the woodchip industry, which would cut down those catchments and cart them off to a woodchip mill, you are talking about very few indeed who want to exploit—for the short term and for a 
 premium on their woodchip shares—the forests against the interests of the majority.
There are much wider ramifications in this amendment than I will go into here. But water, as everybody knows, is a prime commodity in these days when six billion people are on the planet. The majority of people in this largely dry continent of ours live in areas which hug our coastline. Our forests and the water that we all depend on are also along our coastline. Increasingly, it is an economic premium that that water be unsullied, and increasingly one of the biggest factors degrading the water catchments near the populated areas of the eastern and far south-west seaboard of Australia is the logging industry.
Where logging occurs, you get a disturbance to the flow of water. When you do not have a forest there is a more rapid run-off and a loss of water. Of course, this means that there is less insurance against drought. You also get pollution through the direct erosion of the soils—and it is massive in places. Consequent upon that is the pollution from industrial forestry where so much depends on chemicals these days. These are all injurious to the wider economy of the populace as a whole.
I can gather the way this vote might go. I would expect the support of the Democrats, and Senator Greig has assented that that is the way they will be going. But I cannot understand the older parties not wanting to support something which is economically sound as well as environmentally sound and in the interests of the wider populace. Having somebody representing the forest related water sector on this council is not going to change the vote of the council, but it is going to make sure that those who persist in what is going to be the most rapid onslaught on the unprotected forests of Australia in history under the Howard government's regional forest agreements do so with their eyes wide open, knowing what damage they are causing economically as well as environmentally to the interests of the Australian populace as a whole. There should be somebody from the forest related water sector on this council.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-23,"—As Senator Brown stated, the Demo 
 crats support this. It is a sensible imperative. One of the many things which struck me on a recent tour of forests in Tasmania was the extent to which there was water related damage on the hillsides around what would be the southern edge of Mother Cummings Peak. I think the water body in question was Dunnings Rivulet. Perhaps Senator Brown can correct me.
—Yes, it was.
—I walked deeply into the forest and was shown the extraordinary damage to the landscape that had been done there, clearly as a direct result of the logging within that region. It was not simply the destruction of that immediate area but the immense amount of sand and dirt which, as a consequence, has been washing down that hillside through the Meander Valley and then dumping itself as silt in the Tamar River and regions. Of course, Tasmania is no different from other states in terms of environmental damage and water related issues as a result of logging, but if for no other reason I think it is imperative that a person with these particular credentials be represented on such a body.
—The question is that amendment (1) moved by Senator Brown, inserting after paragraph 15(1)(j) a new paragraph (jb) be agreed to.

These amendments ought to be supported for the key reasons I argued the first time around in what has become somewhat Groundhog Day legislation. The Democrats' argument in relation to this proposed council has always been that it must not be so heavily focused— 
as it is—towards logging interests and the logging industry. The amendments that I propose again today, including amendments Nos 1 to 11, aim to make what we see as a bad council better—that is, to improve Labor's proposal for its Wood and Paper Industry Council.
The key amendment of the section I am now moving is amendment No. 2, relating to the objectives of the council, which we believe ought to be far more ecologically and environmentally supportive of the notion of forest industry. In part, amendment No. 2, within this section of amendments, proposes and advocates ecologically sustainable forest management within all RFA regions—increasing the areas available for conservation purposes and protecting threatened species, wetland areas and areas of important ecological diversity, and so on—in addition to adhering to the principles of ecologically sustainable development for forest industries.
The other amendments within this particular block are largely administrative, but the intent of them is clear. We Democrats continue to argue that, should any council of this nature exist, it must have a much stronger focus on those aspects of forests and forest industry which are so absent within this particular proposal.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-11-23,"—I could facilitate the debate here at the moment. Basically, we have two different models: the one that the opposition has put up and the one that the Democrats are now pursuing. As Senator Greig said, we have had this debate before. We have put up our Wood and Paper Industry Council and the Democrats are pursuing an alternative proposal, even though they have, to date, supported some amendments to the composition of the proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council. So we have two different models and, in proposing our own model, we do not see it open to us to support the Democrat proposal.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—I take a totally opposite point of view. I think the amendments that Senator Greig has brought forward on behalf of the Australian Democrats are eminently sensible and very appropriate to the aspirations of Australians 
 at the end of this century. But, again, we are going to see the Democrats and the Greens outvoted by Labor and the government on this matter. Senator Greig has proposed that there be a council looking after the management of the regional forest agreements—which we are dealing with here—and, in particular, that it have an eye to ensuring ecologically sustainable forest management. That should be a major aim sought by any council—whatever its set-up—but we are not going to get that. We are going to see a council which is there primarily to promote the interests of the logging industry.
I know that some of the Tasmanian Labor senators, including Senator Murphy, have been very concerned that this council be established. I am not going to speak for Senator Murphy, but one of the things that I have gleaned from him over the years is that he is concerned that the industry is top heavy and dominated by the woodchip industry and the out-of-state corporations and that it is time the smaller players had a real say. A council like this is going to enable the smaller players and the interests of workers to be represented. In those circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that the council be looking at the way forward. If you leave out ecological sustainability, you are not looking at the way forward; you are looking at a way to an end—you are looking at the way to the ultimate end of the native forests that are unprotected. They are being cut down rapidly and the forest product is being shot out of this country. This is of course increasing, by huge amounts, other problems like greenhouse gas release, which is quite unnecessary because the standing forests are the best carbon banks this nation has.
All sorts of things need to be looked at here. I see the pivotal words in Senator Greig's amendments as being `ecologically sustainable forest management'. Surely that should be central to the whole matter. That is what the national forest policy of Labor and the government is aimed at: ecologically sustainable forest management. But, although Senator Greig and the Democrats have brought forward a proposal for the council to have that as its first aim, we can see that we 
 are going to get voted down. There is a disjunction here between the rhetoric and the reality. The reality is that the big logging corporations are calling the shots. They essentially wrote the legislation and they have essentially written the regional forest agreements, against the wishes of the vast majority of the Australian public, who own those forests. They also—and I am going to keep saying this because it is so important to understanding the process we are dealing with here—put hundreds of thousands of dollars into the coffers of the big political parties, and they do not do that without expecting a dividend.
I find it quite remarkable that, just last week in the House of Assembly in the Tasmanian parliament, a move by both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party was successful in calling on all members of this parliament, particularly the Tasmanian members, to support this legislation without any of these amendments—that is, with no amendments at all. The Tasmanian Labor Party, which is in office at the moment, is the most gung-ho destroyer of forests of any of the governments in Australia—and that is saying something. They even wanted to log the very small area of national park which the Liberals, who are dependent on the Greens in the state parliament, set aside last year for the nation's future—for future generations. You can only ask when Tasmania is going to follow the example of the Hawke government in the eighties and bring in legislation or allow legislation to be brought in which brings transparency at least to the donations being handed across by the woodchip corporations and other logging entities to the Labor Party and the Liberal Party in Tasmania.
I know from my own times in the Tasmanian state parliament that such proposals got hammered down by the big parties. There is a very unhealthy relationship there that is against the public interest and certainly against the job-rich industries that I talked about earlier today—not least, the service and tourism industries. This is highlighted by what we are seeing here right now—that is, this Senate, this parliament, reflecting that atavistic sentiment in the Tasmanian parliament by 
 not wanting to support an amendment which says that this council should be looking at implementing ecologically sustainable forest management in all the regional forest agreement areas. It is time—is it not?—that the big parties who talk about user pays applied that to the big industries, and that includes the big industries `picking up the tab', in the rawest terms, for the environmental damage which they have put on the shoulders of industry as a whole.
At the moment in Tasmania we have the extraordinary example of a new concert hall being built next to the Grand Chancellor Hotel across from Constitution Dock in downtown Hobart; it is a mixture of private enterprise and public support. Recently, there was great speculation that the whole thing would fall through. Why? Because costs had soared by $5 million. Why? Because the log trucks roaring through Hobart, down Davey Street, laden with the grand forests of the southern regions of Tasmania on their way to the woodchip mills to be exported to Japan, created such difficulties that the sum of $5 million was needed to protect the concert hall from these thundering beasts of destruction that were roaring past outside.
It is not as though I am talking about one or two trucks. Under this legislation, under the regional forest agreements a la Labor and Liberal in Tasmania, 150,000 log trucks a year are taking the most magnificent forests in this country to the woodchip mills. It is very difficult not to be angry about that. It is very difficult not to feel outraged—by not just the environmental but also the economic and employment madness of this situation.
It is shown up for what it is when there is an amendment here which says that this council should have ecologically sustainable forest management as its purview and the big parties are about to vote it down. That is not just bad management; it is culpability in my books. Remember, the taxpayers will be funding this council. The Greens and the Democrats will be left to try to improve the membership so at least there will be a flow of information, which will be in the wider public interest, to and from the council.
We cannot do anything but mark the argument and the dereliction of duty of the government in particular in the direction in which this vote will go. I congratulate the Democrats for their proposal; it is the right one. But, as we know, in this place right is never necessarily going to lead to the right outcome. I support wholeheartedly the Democrat amendments, and I recommend that the big parties again have a look at their opposition to them.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-23,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 12:
(12)	 After paragraph 15(1)(b), insert:
		 (ba)	 a person nominated by the conservation council of each of those States which have entered into RFAs;
This amendment allows for a person nominated by the conservation council of each of those states which have entered into RFAs to be a part of the council. Again I think that it pretty much speaks for itself. I find it hard to see how or why you would argue against that. It is interesting that—and I speak largely on the basis of events in my home state of Western Australia—most often it has been members of the conservation council who have produced the more accurate and more reliable information and evidence as to what is really happening within our forests and our timber industries. All too often it has been the conservation councils that have led the charge against the wanton and unwanted destruction of our native forests when it can be and has been shown to be so demonstrably unacceptable. All too often it has been the conservation councils that have been able to dig out and produce those experts and academics who might otherwise, without their encouragement, not have come forward to speak openly to the press, given the curious intimidatory environment some feel that they are under in relation to this issue.
Quite simply, the amendment seeks to allow for, as I have said, a nominated person from each conservation council within those states which have thus far entered into RFAs to be a part of that council. I commend that amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—I support this amendment also. It is plain commonsense and, for the reasons I gave in my last contribution, it should be supported. I might add that again we go back to: what does the public think about this?
Western Australia is an aberration because in that state an opinion poll in recent times showed that 89 per cent of people wanted an end to the destruction of that state's grand wild forests. I will be conservative and say that 70 to 80 per cent of people right around this country have shown in opinion polls consistently for the last decade that they agree with that sentiment. But money speaks louder than democracy. That is why we are not succeeding with the amendments that Senator Greig is putting forward. However, it is sensible that conservation councils, which represent that majority viewpoint of the Australian people, be on this council. The council will also have a member from the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is seen by many as the umbrella organisation for conservation groups in Australia—and that is a move in the right direction.
But where we have, for example, the Tasmanian forests feeding two-thirds of the inexhaustible appetite for woodchips of the overseas pulp and paper industry, there is no Australian Conservation Foundation field officer in Tasmania. It is appropriate that there be a conservationist from Tasmania, a person representing that state's conservation interests, on this council—a person with on the ground knowledge and with an ability to work through and follow the arguments as they relate to the island state.
This is not a small matter. It has huge economic, employment and environmental ramifications. If this council is going to work successfully, it needs to be based on good, sound knowledge. You do not get that result by cutting out a pivotal part of the knowledge base because you do not like its point of view. That is what Labor and Liberal in Tasmania stand for: they are anti-conservationist; they are anti-green; they are anti protecting forests. They are exploitative parties in the business of permitting, at the bidding of the big woodchip corporations, the 
 record destruction which this process allows of one of the most important economic and employment resources the state has. We need to have someone speak up for the alternative at a regional level, someone that can really argue on behalf of the industries which provide more jobs from keeping forests intact than the industries that want to destroy the forests, such as woodchipping, and that continue to shed jobs.
I am afraid we are going to see the committee vote this amendment down, but I am glad it is on the record. I again say that Senator Greig's amendment is the right one and that the committee should think about it again.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-11-23,"—On a point of clarification, I understand that what was Democrat amendment No. 15 is now redundant. Is that the case?
—That was your request, yes.
—Thank you. I understand that amendment No. 15 on subsection (ja) is not necessarily precluded by what has gone before. I wonder if I might now move that.
—It is an overlap. You can do it.
—I move:
(15)	 After paragraph 15(1)(j), insert:
		 (ja)	 a person representing the interests of threatened species;
This amendment is such that a person representing the interests of threatened species would also constitute part of what would be the board for such a council. Threatened species are, regrettably, an integral part of our forests. I say `regrettably' because of the extent to which they are threatened and not because they exist. I am very conscious, for example—and I spoke of this previously—of the chuditch, one threatened species amongst others in the south-west of Western Australia, which has so endeared itself to the populace of Western Australia that it has been adopted as the icon and emblem of the Small Business Association of Western Australia—an association which is, incidentally, strongly opposed to the logging of native forests. Again, I think 
 this is a sensible amendment, and I seek Senate support for it.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-11-23,"—Senator Greig has my support for it. Around the world, the greatest cause of the loss of species is destruction of forests. We have the cute argument by the industry in Australia that nobody can specifically identify a tree that has fallen that has led to the extinction of a species; but this process of gradualism is extraordinarily important. In Australia 50 per cent of the species are in our forests.
Under this legislation, millions of hectares of forests are going to be destroyed. We do not have the minister for the environment in here. He has avoided this whole debate because he is not up to protecting the environment of this country. He repeatedly sells out on it. We cannot allow this to go by with a shrug of the shoulders, because inherent in this legislation is the deliberate destruction of habitat and the deliberate movement towards extinction of a whole range of species in our forests.
There is a glib look of satisfaction on the face of the greenwash experts who assure us that the regional forest agreement legislation is going to actually enhance species in our forests. But you could not get away with that in a kindergarten. You cannot go ahead and destroy half of what is left of the forests of Australia and cogently argue that the species base—the thousands of species of plants, animals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects—in those forests is going to be, at the end of that process, as well off as it is now with the wild forests intact. This is a process of extinction.
So we have a council set up to look at the way this industry is going, and we have a Democrat amendment here which says, `Let's put somebody on that council representing the interests of threatened species.' Is the Liberal Party, with its absent minister for the environment, going to say yes to that? No. Will the Labor Party say yes to that? I doubt it. And the reason for that is the woodchip industries and their financial clout, which not only goes against current Australians and future generations of Australians having all that is left in this much depleted country of theirs as part of 
 their variety of life, interest and natural realm; it sells out our fellow species themselves.
It is noteworthy that the particular amendment that Senator Greig is putting forward says `a person representing the interests of threatened species'. That would run a shudder down the spine of most of the woodchip industry, certainly economic commentators and I think the majority of people in this parliament, when they think about it, because other species have no rights in our society. We have enough arguing of the anthropocentric point of view, which is that we gain through having other species as part of our realm of existence. But when it comes to moving for leaving living room and the right to survival of other species, you would not get a debate on it except a jocular put-down from those opposed to it. It is part of this materialist, marauding world which needs rectifying.
That is why I am here as a Green—because not only future generations but other species do need a voice. Whereas many members of this place might think that this is almost an irrelevant amendment brought forward by the Democrats, I think it is a pivotal amendment. I think it is crucial. I think it is as important as the debate on taxes, which I recognise as being important. We are dealing here with the planet that we hand across to future generations. We are dealing here with the right to survive, with what is left of their natural habitat, of the panoply of species in this country and on this Earth.
I have no doubt that there are many members in the big parties who could get up here and give at least a little talk on why the Amazon forest should not be knocked down and why they are concerned about that. Senator McGauran, National Party Senator for Victoria, for one, agrees. But would you hear senators from the big parties getting up here to say that we should not knock our own forests down for exactly the same reasons, that is, because they are species rich, they are full of life, they are ancient, intact ecosystems, and we have lost too many of them already? And we do not need to because this  country has a plantation base which is totally 
 adequate to provide all our wood needs, including woodchipping for export.
It is profit that cuts across the field of vision of people who think it should stop in the Amazon and in Siberia, in West Papua and in Cameroon. But, oh no, not here in Australia. I remember trying to argue this with the former minister for the environment, Ros Kelly, who went to the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro representing Australia. The argument made to Minister Kelly was: `If you are cutting down the tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere and the tallest hardwood forests on the face of the planet in Tasmania because the woodchippers want to turn them into profits, you are not going to be  able to argue for saving the rainforests or the temperate forests in the rest of the world.' And that is exactly what happened.
At Rio, where an agreement was expected to come out of that conference trying to protect the forests and the majority of the world's living species which live within them, Australia was silent. It could not raise a voice to Vietnam, Brazil, the Congo or a great range of other countries. Why? Because those countries would immediately say, `Minister Kelly, look what you are doing in your own backyard. Look what is happening in Tasmania, in south-western Australia, in Victoria, in New South Wales and in Queensland. Of course, included in this is the current outrageous destruction of woodlands, rating at half a million hectares per annum in Queensland. This has Amazonian proportions of its own.
So here we have a council which is being set up in the wake of the regional forest agreements to ensure good management of this resource. Here we have the opportunity for those persons who say, `Don't cut down the Amazon' and `Stop the destruction in Thailand and Vietnam' and `Protect the forests of Tibet' to be honest and say, `Let's be consistent about this; let's protect the forests of this great nation of ours and, if we cannot do that, let's ensure that we have the maturity to have somebody on this council who speaks and can inform the council about threatened species.'
Do you know what the results will be? The big parties will outvote us on this matter. That is what is going to happen. It is an extraordinary bind that this nation is in on the environment, which has been put on the backburner, where former Prime Minister Keating said it should be. He was wrong, and the Howard government now is wrong. If there is any commitment I make in my time in this place, it is to keep resolute about giving a voice to the environment in the Parliament of Australia because that is what I believe the people of Australia want to have heard, along with the other arguments.
We are going to have representatives galore of the industry on this council. Surely there is room for somebody to represent, if not the threatened species themselves, then the public interest in the threatened species. You know what it is like. If you go to a kindergarten these days and ask the children what worries them, they will talk about the environment.
The pictures on the wall are of trees, animals and birds. If you ask the children, `If you're going to have a council that looks at the future management of Australia's forests, do you think anybody should be there to speak up for the birds and animals?' they will all say yes. So what is it in a mature group of adults elected into this place that squashes that wisdom of the infants in this country? What is it? It is ultimately greed and profit that, like a magnet across a computer, somehow erases long-term sensitivity and concern for this beautiful little planet of ours from the dinkum consideration of members here.
Once again, we cannot do anything but appeal to the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and even One Nation, which is not supporting these amendments, to think again. These are critical matters. They are every bit as critical as the other matters we will be dealing with between now and Christmas. They deserve to be supported.
I go back again to that vote in the Tasmanian parliament last week where every member of the government, with one exception, called on this parliament to have no amendments at all—a lay down misere for the woodchip industry. The one exception, of course, was the Green MHA for Denison, Peg Putt—one 
 voice of sanity in a sea of insensitivity. Fortunately there are a few more of us in this place, but the majority here are not reflecting the public interest in this matter. There is a serious flaw in the democratic system that allows that to happen, and that serious flaw is called money—money being power. Again, I ask the big parties to think once more about whether it is too much to ask that, in a wood industry council, there ought not be somebody there representing the interests of the threatened species of this nation. Of course there should be.
Amendment not agreed to.
